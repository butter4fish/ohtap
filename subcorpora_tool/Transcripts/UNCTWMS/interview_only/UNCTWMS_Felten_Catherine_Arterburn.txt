Evan Faulkenbury: Alright, today is March 31, 2015. My name is Evan Faulkenbury with the Southern Oral History Program. I'm interviewing Catherine Felten, who I believe goes by Kitty, is that correct?        Catherine Felten: That's correct.         EF: Okay. With Mrs. Kitty Felten. Well, the first thing I want to ask is for you to talk a little bit about your childhood.        CF: Alright. I was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1943. My mother was Bernice and my father was Alfred. I was born and my father went off to war about when I was two or three months old, I believe. I did not see him for, probably, until I was three years old. I have a very faint recollection of my mother screaming when he first came to the door. I didn't know who he was. My father--well just a little background on them--my mother grew up in Evans Landing, Indiana. She was the daughter of a country doctor in Harrison County. She said they got paid mostly in potatoes and chickens. They really weren't very wealthy as we think of doctors today. The family made all of their own--whatever they needed. She loved white bread of the [19]50s. She thought it was the best thing ever. My grandfather had a disease of which he eventually died, and the family moved to Louisville to make it easier for him, which is right across the Ohio River. I remember her saying when they got to Louisville and moved there, she thought sliced white bread was the best thing she ever tasted because her mother would bake the bread--once a week or possibly every other week, they would grind the grain and bake the bread, but to do that, she would put some flour with water out and set it on her windowsill and wait for it to catch a yeast or two. Sometimes the yeast was good and sometimes it was not. It was a little variable. So she talked about that and other memories of her childhood, which she told us a lot about. But that was interesting. My father--.        EF: Well, before you talk about your father could you tell me some more about those interesting memories that your mother passed down?        CF: Sure. Let's see. I remember they had a dog named Bingo. She and her three sisters--she had three sisters--they went to essentially, I guess, a one room schoolhouse around New Middletown or Buena Vista, Indiana--all these are little, tiny bergs in Harrison County. They went on a horse. All four of them would fit on this old horse called Pinto and my grandfather would give it a slap on the rear and Pinto would march off to school and come back when it was time to pick them up. Their house actually looked down banks of the Ohio River. She remembered one time that the river was rising and they ran, the family ran to the barn and slapped the horse and the horse showed up much earlier than anticipated, the teacher knew to send them home and got them home. So Pinto was the family school bus.         EF: Wow.         CF: They made all of their own clothes. They raised chickens. The family was devout Catholics. They went to church on Sunday morning, which took most of the day, I suppose. By the time you hitched up the horse and wagon and rode in an hour or two and went to mass and all that. At the time she had two grandfathers who lived with them a good deal of the time, and one was French from France, from Alsace-Lorraine, and the other was from Germany. She was, I guess, second generation American. But anyway, it was up to the grandfathers to prepare the Sunday repast which, every Sunday, they butchered a chicken. She said the grandfathers would always have a terrible fight about how to cook it, whether the French way or the German way. And they would always be mad at each other when they got home, but it was always good.        EF: Wow.         CF: She had a lot of memories like that. My grandmother did not approve of--. I think one of the other reasons they moved to Louisville, she wanted the daughters--my grandmother wanted the daughters to have a better education, and she felt that too many of the girls that went to the local high school "came in the family way," as it was expressed, before they should have. She did not want her daughters going there, so they moved to Louisville. And that's where she went to high school and graduated at the age of sixteen and went to Miss Spencer's secretarial school. My father had a totally different upbringing. He was from an old Louisville family. His father lost his whole fortune in the crash of [19]29. He and his father and grandfather worked together in a business and they sadly had leveraged the business, so he grew up in wealth and privilege. Although, his childhood really was rather sad. He lost his mother when he was four. His father did remarry. But his father also died before he was twenty of a cerebral hemorrhage very suddenly. I think he had almost rebuilt the fortune, but it all crumbled to dust. And about that time the war broke out. I think had my father's parents not died, probably my parents never would have married because he was from a strictly Protestant family. And Protestants and Catholics did not marry. It would have been frowned upon. But they did marry. They did.         EF: How did they meet?        CF: My mother was working as a secretary and had tripped and fallen, and my father happened to be walking in the opposite direction. My mother was a stunning looking redhead, so I guess that was that. Anyway, they did marry, and about that time the war was breaking out and my father was drafted.         EF: So tell me a little bit more about the circumstances of your birth and where you were and what was going on then.        CF: Well, I don't know that much about it. My parents rented a few rooms in a private home off of Bardstown Road in Louisville. My mother had this old ironing board, and she remembered that the landlord had collapsed, and they used the ironing board to carry him out and get him to the hospital on her ironing board. I think after my father was called to war, she moved back in with my mother so that there would be someone to look after me and she went to work. So she worked all during the war.        EF: Sure. Sure. So you were born in 1943 and then your father was off fighting in the war and then returned when you were about the age of three.        CF: Yes. Yes.         EF: Okay.        CF: He had a very difficult assignment in the war. We never knew much about it because he wouldn't talk about it when we were growing up. I think he would have been classified as suffering from PTSD today. I remember him dive-bombing under tables when cars backfired.        EF: Wow.         CF: He drank too much, which I don't know if that was a problem before or not, but he was essentially an alcoholic. We did some research into his--. He fought in the Pacific Theatre--the Asia-Pacific Theatre. He was in Burma and China and India. We were trying to do some research on that. Actually, I think, fewer than a quarter of a million soldiers were assigned to that, but apparently his job was to construct airstrips. There was this company called Merrill's Marauders, which captured some place in Burma. Then these guys were flown in on gliders and he claimed that there was a huge casualty rate. People coming in on gliders and landed in the jungle and were fighting the Japanese as they got to this place to build an airstrip. So a lot of his memories tumbled out, more or less, in the last year of his life. They sounded terrible. You know, we don't know whether than what we have researched on.         EF: Right. So tell me about your relationship with your mother and father growing up.        CF: Well, my childhood was--. My father really was unable to support the family, so mother worked most of the time. But that being said, my father had a wonderful family. I remember a lot of happy family reunions. We would have reunions at my aunt and uncle's just about every Christmas, Fourth of July, and Derby Day, always. And usually, there would be a couple more thrown in on Easter, Labor Day, or whatever occasion. We had a lot of happy get-togethers. I knew all my cousins on both sides. On my mother&#8217;s side there were four daughters and a total of seventeen children. The aunts had all--her sisters, with one exception, had moved away&#8212;probably due to the war. Their husbands ended up in places. One in the state of Washington, another in Florida, and occasionally we'd all get together. Actually, we're having another cousin reunion next year. So it's fun to know your cousins.        EF: Yeah, absolutely.        CF: And we know our cousins on our father's side. We were always getting together there. We still have get-togethers on that side too. So I had a lot of family interaction. My father and mother--my father's drinking was an impediment, but they stayed together. We went to the Catholic schools. I remember all the hallmarks of the [19]50s. The saddle oxfords, the kremlin skirts, Elvis. My parents moved across the river after the war and I think with the GI Bill were able to purchase a very tiny house. It would certainly be tiny by today's standards. There were five children by that time and a very small house, but I would have to say that we weren't that unhappy. I had playmates. I liked school. It was a typical [19]50s upbringing. Jeffersonville, Indiana is a river town. Its big industry was making the river boats, those paddle boats that went down the Ohio and the Mississippi. The boat works is still in existence today, but I think it makes yachts today.        EF: Okay.         CF: But everyone was pretty much in the same boat. Everybody lived in a small house with a yard and we thought it was really exotic that there was one set of apartment houses and there was somebody that would actually live in an apartment house. We all thought, &#8220;Oh wow, that's really weird.&#8221; It was a very homogenous population.         EF: So growing up there, could you tell me a little more about--describe more about your neighborhood and the town and the people that were there?        CF: Well, I would say the people that were there were salt of the earth. Most of the people we knew went to our parish church. Originally, we lived in the small house, which only had two bedrooms. About five or six years after that they were able to move to a real modern [19]50s ranch with three bedrooms and a big basement. It was a working class, blue collar neighborhood with kids in every house. I had a lot of babysitting jobs by that time. I had friends that I had from first grade that I still keep in touch with. A lot of them never moved away. I did, obviously. I had a lot of freedom in that town that people can't even imagine these days. I never would have let my kids have the same freedom. I started out at the parish school, which was closer to the old downtown because that was the only one. They later built another one closer to our house, but from the old parish school, I used to walk home and it was probably three or four miles. I didn't walk home every time, but I liked it. I would walk along the floodwall. They had a floodwall there that was essentially a big hill, it wasn't a concrete wall.        EF: Right.        CF: That was fun. My parents weren't worried. When I grew older and had a bicycle, I rode my bicycle probably a range of five to ten miles. For a young girl to do that today would be unthinkable. But like I said, it was a very homogenous town. It was a small town. People knew each other and looking back on it, it seems rather idyllic compared to some of the situations we encounter today. Where our larger house was, the ranch house, there was a Utica pipe. We were on one side of the Utica pipe, the other side was two or three acres of woodland and again, it ran down to the Ohio River. So on Sunday afternoons in the summertime, you would hear the Delta Queen and the Belle of Louisville--these were paddleboats--go along the river taking people for a ride. You would hear the calliope playing. The calliope was the steam organ that was on the boat. They would be playing songs like "Cruising Down the River," "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," and you would hear that every Sunday. Of course, nobody had air-conditioning then so the windows were all open.        EF: Wow. Well thanks for sharing. Those are all vivid details. I'd like to know--. The place was called Jeffersonville?        CF: Mhmm.        EF: Okay. Could you tell me about growing up Catholic?        CF: Well, going back in the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan was very prevalent in Indiana. They were more anti-Catholic than anti-black. My mother has memories of that. It was sort of like, in those days, when you were born, you were essentially born Catholic and Democrat. Simply because, I guess, Republicans were perceived as being members of the Klan. Or perhaps it had to do with unions or the hiring policies, I'm not sure. But I do know that my mother was from a staunchly Catholic and staunchly Democratic family. We went to the Catholic schools. I remember a couple of encounters with public school kids throwing rocks at us and screaming, &#8220;Catholics, get out!&#8221; or something. But that was minimal and we could dish it out too. There was not a whole lot of love lost, which is sad. But a part of that stemmed from earlier history. In the Catholic schools, we had the nuns. The classes were large, quite large, and if you couldn't stand the discipline, you didn't need to be there and that was made quite clear. I know my mother's attitude was, &#8220;If there's a problem and you were punished by a sister, then it was your fault and you were going to be punished.&#8221; And that is sad, it is sad today to see parents--that sense of discipline or that sense of learning has been lost today because it did help in keeping your priorities set on learning and not on getting into mischief. But I can remember classes of, well forty and above, and the disciplinary issues were minimal. Sometimes we had mixed grades. You always had something to do. There was a sense of learning for the sake of pursuit of education and truth. I don't feel that is the case today having seen education first hand. I can remember we had to do a lot rote memorization. I can remember having to do the Gettysburg--well, I don't think everyone had to do it. You got extra credit if you memorized the Gettysburg Address. Everyone had to memorize the preamble to the Constitution. There were other poems we had to do and a lot of that. I think that's good for the memory. I think it's considered a waste of time today. I don't know whether it was or not. I remember memorizing things. I can still tell you all of the intransitive verbs I had to memorize in the sixth grade. "Be, am, is, are, was, were, been," so on down the line.         EF: Right.        CF: So, some things stick with you. I went to the Catholic high school, Providence High School--high school as well. Loved it. Part of it was--well, I loved my studies. I enjoyed learning. I was a joiner and I still join clubs to this day, I guess. But I joined every club that I could. I was always staying after school for something. I liked it. We wore uniforms. Uniforms were okay. I didn't have a problem. It was pretty good. Then I won a scholarship to a small Catholic college in Indiana. I had a full scholarship. And since mother didn't have a whole lot of money at that time, they thought that it was probably a good idea I accept this and go. And I did. I went to a small Catholic college and I felt I had a very good liberal arts education there. I think that it was probably a lot more rigorous. You can go through and get an education today with the minimum credentials, and it's barely an education. I don't even want to talk about the basketball or sports scandal here. But I felt that I had someone give me a wonderful education, so I am grateful for that.         EF: What was the name of the college?        CF: Saint Mary of the Woods in Terre Haute, Indiana. It is still operating today, but I think that it is barely hanging on.         EF: I'll come back and ask you about your college years.        CF: Okay.        EF: Before we get there, I'd like to go back a little bit.        CF: Alright.        EF: I'd like, if you would, talk about your own religious beliefs growing up in your Catholic family and going to a Catholic school. What were your own personal religious beliefs at that time?        CF: Well, basically the Catholic beliefs, I didn't question them and I accepted them. It didn't seem a burden. I have four siblings and of the five of us, I'm the only one still a practicing Catholic today, so I more or less accepted it. I married a Catholic spouse, which probably helped. But so did they, actually. Or most of them did. It's sort of the times and you have to sit back. I've been through periods when I've been deeply questioning--kind of minimally practiced--but I never fully left. At this point in my life today, I'm glad I haven't. I appreciate the values that were imparted. There are things that I don't like, but overall the basics are good.         EF: Along that same line, can you tell me how the Catholic teachings, the church teachings, shaped you as you grew up from childhood through high school and on to college?         CF: Well, I say a sense of right and wrong. Good and bad. A sense of responsibility. It was your choice. You had choices to make and there were consequences. Or things that resulted from those choices. Looking at it today, the whole Judeo-Christian ethic when you stop and think where it stems from, looking at it historically, you have--thousands of years ago you have--most human beings believed in gods who were angry and demanded sacrifice, even to the point of human sacrifice. With the rise of Abraham and--the story of Abraham and Isaac, I've often wondered if that wasn't symbolically calling an end to human sacrifice. You have Abraham and his son Isaac and on down to Christ as the son of God being the sacrificial victim for us rather than us being sacrificial victims to a more demanding God. So the whole concept, and the sense of natural law from the Greeks, with what is moral and what is not moral, and that which is moral is that which enables one to survive, and that which does not help human survivability is what is considered evil, makes a lot of sense to me. I'm thinking, &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; I see the church as somewhat preserving this whole concept or these concepts of western civilization. So yes, I appreciate my faith and my religion.         EF: Well, thanks for going into detail. And you mentioned that there were also times where you have wandered from your faith or--.        CF: Questioned a lot of things. Oh sure.        EF: Questioned things. Can you talk about some of those times a little bit more?        CF: I think, obviously the sex scandal of the last several years. It was something that I wondered about and I'm not surprised. The [19]60s brought on a lot of questioning and a lot of changes that were needed, but they, in a lot of ways, threw the baby out with the bath water. Through the [19]60s and [19]70s I probably did a lot of questioning like everybody else did and came to the conclusion that more of the "sixty-ers" who were crying rebellion were more mistaken than--. I mean, these are all human institutions. Nobody is perfect. So I suppose that was a part of my [19]60s and [19]70s questioning.         EF: Okay. Well I'll get to your college in a second. We've talked about your family's religion growing up, I wonder if you could also talk about, what were your family's politics, or political beliefs, growing up and how active was your family in local politics or national politics.         CF: Alright, my father's family was Republican. I don't know how far back that would go, but they were Republicans. My mother's family were ardent Democrats to the point where my mother spoke of the precinct being located in their living room at one time.        EF: Wow.        CF: That was the voting place at least once or twice. I don't know if more. But they were active. I know that my grandmother was very happy when women had received the right to vote. She talked about that. Even though my father was Republican, he was extremely grateful that Harry Truman had dropped the bomb. He said if Harry had not dropped the bomb, that they were marching through China, that he probably would have never have made it back. Anything Harry Truman did was fine with him. After that, he became rather apolitical because mother was so ardently Democrat, he would usually put his hat on on voting days and go out to vote and say, &#8220;Well, it's time for me to go cancel out your mother's vote.&#8221; So that was about what we would hear.          EF: Wow.         CF: And then of course Jack Kennedy was almost canonized in our household because he was a Catholic. Looking back on it now, it was to vote for someone just because he was Catholic was probably not the wisest thing, but that's the way it was in those days. Of course, we've had the same thing with Barack Obama, voting for him simply because he's black and I don't think that was equally--I thought that was equally unwise. But anyway, that's the way things happen.         EF: And for yourself, when you were a child, and maybe into high school, did you feel yourself also have political affiliations or beliefs?        CF: Not in high school. Well, I presumed I'd be a Democrat and I never thought much about it. In college, some of the people, some people were getting very active. I was not as active as a lot of my classmates. I didn't have the fire in my belly for a lot of what they were doing. I thought, "Well, I'm hard to make a fulltime commitment." It's hard for me to really get committed to something without believing in it. Now, I guess during--probably in the mid to late [19]60s, which would be my college years, I started having--. Things about Jack Kennedy were coming out and I was expressing some of my doubts about that to the family. Well my gosh! They just about ringed me out for even saying something like that. I was probably starting to have some doubts in the [19]60s. I mean I was still a registered Democrat. I was taught to vote. This is your citizenship. It's a privilege and a right and you better exercise it, which I agree with today. But, I was having some nagging doubts.        EF: Well, you mentioned college again. Could you tell me about going to college and your experience at Saint Mary in the Woods?        CF: Oh, well, my college experience was probably like few others. The campus there, I've gone back to visit a few times and each time I go back I forget how absolutely beautiful that campus is. I mean it was idyllic. It was all girls. It was very small. They had an enrollment then of around 600 students. Every class had its class songs and you were more or less housed together, so you knew everyone in the class. In West Terre Haute there was nothing around the campus that you could do, so everyone was expected to be checked in and on campus by six pm at night. I can't imagine that. But there was really nothing to do there and it was a matter of safety. It was isolated. Some girls couldn't take it. I know we got a few from New England and the east coast who really couldn't take it so they didn't last too long. Unless you were from a protective Italian family, then you did. The classes were small. The one thing about the order of nuns who taught there, most of them had their PhDs and were very qualified and competent in their subjects. I took a lot of extra courses. I took way over the minimum required hours for graduation. I took a lot of extra philosophy classes. I was a French major. I enjoyed learning, I have to say.         EF: Why were you a French major?        CF: I would have been a Latin major. I loved Latin. Catholic schools, Latin class. I was one of the few who really enjoyed Latin. I took four years of Latin and seriously thought about becoming a Latin teacher, but by that time demand for Latin was going downhill and I was thinking, "Well, maybe I better do a modern language." So I did French and Spanish, but then I took extra Latin courses too. I wish I had been able to squeeze in German, but I couldn't. So I enjoyed it. Also, come to think of it, my mother's family was French.         EF: From Alsace-Lorraine, right?        CF: One of those grandfathers was from Alsace-Lorraine and his name was actually Pierre. Mother thought it was great. Maybe that's why. But I just enjoyed language.        EF: Right. Right. So while you're also at Saint Mary in the Woods, you said that's where your friends were getting a bit more politically active--socially active. But you didn't quite have that fire in your belly, as you described it.        CF: No.        EF: I was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit more. Even if you're not getting personally involved in more politics you're seeing it more first hand and how that's shaping you, perhaps.        CF: Someone wrote a book called Black Like Me and he had colored his skin black and gone through the South as a black man, or something. He came to speak and there were--everybody was making a big deal over it and I thought, "Well, yeah, I guess that's sad. That's not good." I'm glad he brought this to our attention, but some of my classmates were actually at some of these demonstrations. I opted not to go. Some of my reasons might have been financial. I didn't have any extra money to put into things like that, and I guess any extra money I did have, I probably had other priorities. So that might have been part of it. I don't fully remember, but I don't remember feeling committed enough to go down to march or show up. I probably thought it was a little silly.        EF: So, this might be too far ahead, but if so we can come back and see what happens next, but how did you become more politically active and aware and become more conservative?        CF: I didn't really become really politically active until the last fifteen or twenty years because I felt that I didn't have time. I was putting full time on raising four kids and helping working part time and trying to get the kids through college. I probably started turning conservative much earlier. There are some hallmarks. One of the hallmarks has to do with education. In 1969, the year my first son was born--I think it was [19]69 or [19]70, maybe--the head of the New York teacher's union, Arnold Shankler made some snarky remark to the effect of, "Mother's, you stay out of our classrooms and we'll stay out of your kitchens." I was thinking at the time, "Like hell I will!" That's totally wrong! Parents are the educators of their children. The public education provides the means, but the parents guide it, and I still firmly believe that. I have never forgotten that. It really, totally irritated me. That was one thing. After I graduated from college, I ended up in graduate school in the late [19]60s at Indiana University.        EF: In Bloomington?        CF: Uh huh. And I was in linguistics. I went for the study of linguistics. I ended up meeting my husband there and getting married. I left taking a master&#8217;s degree simply because I really didn't have time. We were moving to an area where linguistics wasn't really that big of a thing in most colleges, so there really wasn't an opportunity. But that was also a wildly radical group, the people in the linguistics department. I can remember going out and seeing all my professors out there demonstrating against the Vietnam War and thinking, "Wow, this is weird." I mean, I was pretty green and naive when it came to being socially in the know or culturally in the know, I suppose, coming from a small Catholic girl's college. My interest in linguistics was probably more in the historical, and Noam Chomsky was the big guy that you followed in those days and his deep structure and his, what is it, syntactic structure or something. I really never got into Chomsky that much. I had a lot of respect, but I didn't care about his war activities. At the time, I didn't really know what to think. I wouldn't say that I was pro-Vietnam, but I thought it was terrible the way people were behaving towards soldiers, young men who came back from the war. I probably hung out on the fringes. I didn't speak out either way. Anyway, it was an exciting ride at Indiana University, but I happened to meet my husband at the same time and we made our departure. I do remember the [19]70s, being at Indiana University really didn't turn me into a radical. I remember the SDS there and we went to go see a poetry reading by--who was that wild poet?--I don't know. But he did most of his poetry on LSD, I think. But I went to a bunch of those things and I was thinking, "I don't know if this culture or not, but it's weird." Like I said, it was probably my conservative upbringing kicking in back there. On the other hand, my brothers and sisters were all children of the [19]60s more or less. When my brother was a Vietnam protestor and tore up his draft card. They were all more [19]60s than I, I suppose.         EF: How did it make you feel as older looking on your siblings and seeing them being much more demonstrative in their politics?        CF: I suppose I thought, "Well, okay. It's their thing." It never was mine quite to that extent. What really I suppose pushed me over--. Richard Nixon came along. I did not like LBJ, I'll have to say that. I thought that man was abominable. So I had very little respect for LBJ. I was glad he didn't run. I didn't know what to think of George McGovern and Richard Nixon. And to this day, I can't tell you who I voted for because I remember going in the voting booth and thinking, "I don't like either one of these guys." I don't know if I just put my finger down, but obviously Richard Nixon won. I thought the Watergate scandal was terrible, but looking back on it, I think what is going on--what has happened today by the perpetrators--by the same people who were so critical of Nixon then is far worse. I'm thinking of Hilary Clinton specifically. She was all for this open thing and he can't erase those tapes. Those tapes belong to the government because he's a public official, but yeah, she's a public official and guess what she can do. I was scandalized by what Nixon did. In the end I think he got a raw deal. I'm sorry that he had to resign. Part of the fault was his as well. I remember Richard Nixon. And then Jimmy Carter was in. At that time, I was still a Democrat. At that time we bought a house. We got transferred with my husband's job. Interest rates for a mortgage were twenty-one and twenty-two percent. My husband said, he told the realtor, he said, "Look, we will look at any house that has a takeover mortgage or owner financing. Don't show us anything else." We actually lucked into a very nice house that way, but you talk about creative financing. We had the owner financing that was one-third. We had a take-over mortgage that was one-third and we financed maybe less than twenty percent at the twenty-two percent [interest rate], which was horrendous. So you get to 1980 and I'm still a Democrat and I'm thinking, "Oh, movie star. How can a movie star prepare you for the presidency?" I voted for Jimmy Carter, I can tell you that. Boy, that is the vote I most regret in my life. I felt in love with Reagan. That's when I became a Republican.         Actually at that time there was another defining--. There were two things that pushed me over the edge to Republican. One was Ronald Reagan and the other was school busing. We had lived in a state, moved away from it--I don't want to name the state--we moved away and when we lived in that state I was teaching there and was so impressed by the education system. It was fantastic. Shortly before we left we were transferred to another state for a while and they were talking about a lawsuit to redistrict the schools and make sure every school was integrated. Well, I frankly in theory had no problem with that. I thought that was fair. We left for a few years, we came back and--. Let me back up. We had not put our children in the Catholic schools where we had lived in this state because I was aware of the different orders of nuns. Some of them educated their sisters before they put them out teaching and others did not. In this school, the school we would have sent our children to had a very poor reputation as far as math. All of the kids who came from the Catholic school and went to the public school had to be put in remedial math. So we sent our kids to the public school there. But then we got transferred back to the other state and we were going to put our kids in the Catholic schools there, but that was the first&#8212;no, it was probably the second or third year of integration--and the bishop had said, "If you come into this state with your kids in a public school, you can't put them in a Catholic school because you must be doing it because you're prejudice." We thought, "Well, okay. We'll deal with the public schools." Oh my goodness! I spoke with a couple of parents.         Well, my first experience was with my son who was in middle school. He came home after the first day of school that he was in and did his homework that he had been taught to and was told it was expected of him. He went in the next day, comes home the next day and he's angry and he's throwing his books. You have a kid going through puberty who doesn't want to have anything to do with parents. So it took a while to get the truth out. It turns out he had been threatened that he would be beaten up if he did his homework again. So I did a little more questioning. It turns out he was the only white kid in the class. I said, "Well, what kind of class is this?" It turns out it was remedial math. I'm thinking, &#8220;I don't want him in remedial math.&#8221; It turns out the next day, this math class happened to be at the last period of the day and he had a dentist appointment. So I pick him up before the class, got him in the car, went back in, and said "What is this class my son is in?" I had actually called around and had done a little more inquiring and found out it was a remedial math class. I said, &#8220;I don't want my son in this class.&#8221; "Well, he's transferred from another district. He might not be able to keep up." I said, "Let him try." Bottom line is, they needed a white face in this class and they thought they could pull the wool over my head because I was a parent transferring in. This was the dream team with self-esteem I encountered. The principal and the assistant principal, one was black and one was white, and they were trying to--"Well, think of how this will make him feel for it to be so easy for him." I said, "I don't want easy. I want him to learn math." Finally, I said, "He will not be reporting for that math class again. I will be by here every day at this time to take him out, and I want a copy of the math book from the top level of math, not this crappy math that you're trying to snooker over me." At that point, they said, "Mrs. Felten. Don't you think you're being a difficult parent?" I said, "You think you know difficult? Let me bring in Mr. Felten. We are not backing down and my son will not go back to that class." I mean it was a knockdown, drag out fight. But they relented and he was put in the regular math classes and was fine. Although, at this point I wish I had pulled him out of the school entirely, I don't think it was that good. Anyway, the whole emphasis was, forget about learning. The kid was a number and we have to balance our colors in class and that's all we're concerned about. I was frosted. So that turned me off.         The next thing is the grade school. I guess this must have happened a year or two later. By that time I had learned--talked to one of the other mothers in saying what do you do--what can you do if you want to make sure your kid gets a good teacher? I found out there were teachers to request and all parents who wanted their kids to have a good education requested had a list of teachers they requested. I did that for a year or two. Now I'm still an idealist at this point and I thought, "Maybe this isn&#8217;t fair. Let me try it once and see what happens." My youngest son, I did not request a teacher for him. He ends up in a class with a black lady, but the thing of it--. Which was fine because I actually requested black teachers in the past who were great, fantastic teachers, so that didn't bother me. But what did bother me was that she was bringing in her thirty-year-old son every day to help her teach. This was not a vetted employee of the school system and I was a little uneasy with that. I was a regular volunteer at this school. I thought, "Well, I'll make it my business to volunteer in this classroom." One of the things that I learned in this classroom, we actually picked this up from home was that, again it's the math. I have to tell you my husband is a scientist and we are really big into pushing math with the kids, and we told every--he made every one of them go through engineering calculus in college. I mean, that's the extreme we cruel parents forced upon our kids this math. So I'm concerned about the math and I find out when I went there in late September, they were on page twenty. By mid-November, they were still on page twenty. Another thing that I learned was that this dear lady could not spell. She was the laughing stock of the teacher's lounge. They were saying, "Did you see how she spelled?" I mean, these were three letter words. She was misspelling them. She seemed to spend all of her time. She liked to do spelling and she liked to do reading and she wasn't doing anything else. I approached her about the math and I was at an advantage because I had had two children in the past two years who had been through second grade and I knew where they should be. I'm thinking, "By the time he gets to third grade, they're going to put him in a lower math thing." I knew this as a teacher. So I got a little concerned. I said something. I said, "You know, they seem to be going a little slower than I recall my other children doing." She said, "Oh, well, little Charles,"--I think that was his name, it may have been some other name--"seems to have trouble learning math and I'm not pushing anybody until Charles gets it." I said, "I'm happy to spend a little time with Charles." Well Charles was a black child from one of the ghetto areas of the city and I sat down with him and I said, "Now you know, math is a lot of fun. We can try doing it this way." And he looked at me and put his hands over his ears and said, "My momma said I don't have to listen to anything any white lady tells me and I'm not going to listen to you." So I said, "Okay." I took him back and I didn't say anything. I said, "I think you really should talk to Charles yourself about his wanting to learn math." I didn't say anything further, but I went down to the principal's office and I said, "I want my child out of this class because I have my concerns about the learning experience in there." I said nothing personal against the teacher and she was a lovely person and I mean that sincerely, but she was not a teacher. I think she had been a teacher's assistant who had been given all these dummy credentials so she would qualify as a teacher. She was in over her head and she needed her son to help her. Anyway, I said, "I want my son transferred out of there." Well the principal was black and he looked at me and he said, "You know Mrs. Felten"--now I've had three black teachers in the past and he was there the whole time--he looked at me and said "if you ask to be transferred out of this black teacher's class, I'm going to think you're a racist." I looked at him. I couldn't believe what I had heard. I thought, "Well now, on the one hand we have Mr. So-and-So thinks I'm a racist if I do this. On the other hand I've got my kid's future. No problem here. I know what I'm going to do." So I looked at him and I said, "You know, you can Mr. So-and-So, you can take this phrase, 'Mrs. Felten is a racist' and fly it from a plane over the school over the whole damn state, I don't care." I said, "You can get the local newspapers to print it in headlines a mile high if you like, that's fine. I'm a racist, but you get my kid out of that classroom. I'm going to make your life miserable." I could because after I got out of there, I thought, "Oh my gosh, I have all kinds of dirt I could dig up." I won't go into the dirt, but I had plenty. I told him, I said, "I will be calling the school board, I will call every member on the school board, the superintendent, I am calling the state board of education, I am writing letters to the editor, I am doing everything under the sun. You get my kid out of that class and out of that class tomorrow." And he did. On the way out, this is an ironic story, I run into this mother and I said--who I knew had a child in this very same class--and I said, "I got my son transferred out of that class." She looked at me and she said, "Oh I couldn't do that. They might think I'm a racist!" So I said, "I guess, that's another viewpoint." So anyway, I ran into her at the end of that year. She was in tears. Her son's grades had fallen fifty points on the end of grade test, they had fallen over fifty points. She was crying, "Oh my god, I don't know what went wrong." Well I bit my tongue and I didn't say, "Well, at least Mr. So-and-So thinks you're not a racist"--although that's what I was thinking. But I said, "Why don't you get some of the textbooks and work with him over the summer.&#8221; But that's the kind of stuff that was going on. The day he said that to me, that's the day I became a Republican. I think that made me change my registration.        EF: This was--was Ronald Reagan president?        CF: Ronald Reagan was president. The other thing about the integration issue was that there were six people who had pressed that suit in this city. Those six people and the judge, the minute that was enforced all pulled their kids out of the public schools and put them in the private schools, which I thought was the biggest act of hypocrisy I had ever seen. And schools to this day are a disaster.         EF: Well thanks for--.        CF: And I'm just going to say that's--. Some people would call that racist, I call it common sense.         EF: Well thanks for going into such detail about your political evolution.        CF: I didn't mean to get into it that much. But it makes me furious to this day that someone tried that.         EF: To get some of the details right from what you mentioned, could you tell me a little bit more about the period in your life when you went to graduate school in linguistics at Indiana University and met your husband, and then on from there?        CF: Oh I loved it! I have to say, I enjoyed that time at graduate school. I really thought it was living history and indeed it was. They had some of the main historical figures at that time. I wish I could remember the name of that poet. We did go to a lot of those things. I enjoyed my studies, my classes in linguistics, but like I say, my heart was more in--historical linguistics was my favorite and after that I loved the phonetics. I ended up teaching English as a second language in my last years of teaching, I switched from French and Spanish and did ESL. But that's where I got the first grounding and foundation for it. Did some little research. Worked with African speakers of some of the African nations. Transcribing their languages. Africa is a fascinating continent linguistically speaking. Let's see, well we would look at a lot, we would watch a lot of the demonstrations. My husband, I guess, had the experience--I don't know if I can tell this right or not--he was a chemistry major, chemistry student, and they got locked out of their building once by a bunch of demonstrators. He was a TA, he noticed one of his students blocking the doorway and he said, "You let me in or you got an F." So he got in the building to do what he needed to do. He wasn't into the politics that much either. Neither one of us. Neither one of us politics our main interest. But it was interesting, let's put it that way. We followed it.         EF: Right.         CF: We had a lot of the national figures from the SDS at one time or the other. Basketball was great and at that time Indiana University even had a great football team, so I did a lot of sports things. I got to do a lot of things that I had never did in undergraduate school, being at an all-girls school, so I thoroughly enjoyed it. I supported myself as a dorm, what do they call them, residence assistant. At that time, believe it or not, even Indiana University had a rule of three feet on the floor in the common areas at night. You had to walk through every so often. But that was interesting and fun. You could tell that there was change in the air. There were a lot of sit-ins and we did not participate in. Like I say, we were both so busy, I guess we didn't have time to. Probably we didn't have the money to either.         EF: Then going back to where you started talking more of your political beliefs taking shape in light of Ronald Reagan's election and then your kids schooling and the difficulties you had with teachers in school.        CF: I wouldn't say I had difficulties with teachers as long as they were teaching.         EF: Right.        CF: I, in fact, tried to be supportive of teachers having have been one. But that was more than I could stomach because I knew the consequences of it.         EF: Right. You mentioned you had been more politically active in the last few decades and I'm guessing that originates in the 1980s. So if you would go forward from there and talk about how you continued to be politically active. What clubs were you in? How did you get involved, I guess?        CF: Well, even in the 1980s, we had changed our registration to Republican and we might have put up a few signs. We had a neighbor down the street running for office. Had nothing to do with--it was a minor office. We were helping him out. So we did that. That was about the extent of the political activity until we came to North Carolina. We moved to Chapel Hill thinking, "Well, you we've got--." By that time our oldest son was about finished with college, we had three more coming on, we thought, "Well, North Carolina would be a nice place so maybe we'll settle near Chapel Hill," which we did. But we were not prepared for the radical politics in the schools, as far as I'd call them, far left politics. Now we're traditional, we were a traditional 1950s family. In other words, the kids had a home cooked meal every day and we sat around the table and discussed, not politics, just the day's activities. Well, one of the first things we discovered was that several kids had made the comment--. The kids were in high school by this time. &#8220;Oh my god! All four kids had the same biological parents. Weird man." We were thinking, "What kind of place have we moved into?" Because we were in a rather family oriented neighborhood before. So we thought that was somewhat odd. Then I guess a few months after they came home and they were complaining because they had been forced to go to this assembly celebrating homosexuality. I said, "What?" I said, "Homosexuality certainly exists but it's not something one celebrates." I called the principal actually and I said, "I feel that having a school assembly on homosexuality is outside the realm of what I consider what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing, and I have given my children notes that they are to carry with them excusing them from any similar assembly where they might feel uncomfortable." I said, "They were very uncomfortable yesterday. This is not something that we teach as being natural and celebratory, and if you persist in forcing them to do something, I'll sue the heck out of you." So I guess I'm not shy about expressing myself, really, when it comes to my kids. But that's the only time I really am. We had a lot of discussion about that. I tried to educate myself on it because really it was a peripheral issue for us and never really bothered us one way or another. Anyway, about that time. Chapel Hill, the high school, there was a lot of politics going on behind the scenes apparently.        EF: And was this the 1990s?        CF: Mhmm.        EF: Okay. Sorry to interrupt.        CF: Yeah, we moved here in the early 1990s. Well, I guess I went into register and the guy said, "Well, what do you want to register? Democrat?" I said, "No, I'm a Republican." He said, "What? You won't have much chance to vote here." I said, "I want to register Republican. I'll deal with it." So I did. I understand what he was trying to say was that the primaries are mostly Democrat v. Democrat. I'm registered Republican and found the telephone booth where all of the other republicans were, eventually. Anyway, the whole sexuality thing, a few months after that, it was the same year, the school board was trying to pass this resolution where by the school had the right to give children condoms behind their parent's backs. I said, "Wait a minute, that's infringing upon a parent&#8217;s right. We went to the school board meeting and actually ran into a lot of other concerned parents who felt the same way. Regardless of where you stand on this, it is a question of who has the right. I want my child to know the consequences. What I have thought [about] my children is that action have consequences, and using a condom and going around to have sex discriminately, be it with the same or the opposite sex, does not prepare one for responsible life and adult hood. It's not healthy, I mean high school kids don't know how to use condoms. You have the issues of disease, unwanted pregnancy, to say nothing of emotional and psychological, bad psychological, and emotional experiences coming from that. So we fought it tooth and nail. We found a lot of other parents were.         But what we discovered was that the people that were pushing this were the homosexual lobby. They were coming up, "Well, we have to find children in high school because all these homosexual children are committing suicide." They were giving ridiculous numbers, because remember I told you my husband was Mr. Math, and they gave these numbers, my husband is sitting there and he they were saying, "one child for however so many thousands commits suicide." He was saying, "Wait a minute, North Carolina has this many people, Orange County has this many, and they're saying with these numbers we should have had fifty teenage suicides in the last year,&#8221; and we didn't. We didn't even have one. He's saying, &#8220;There's something screwy here.&#8221; At the same time you had all this politically--there was a whole politically correct agenda going on. You had this one teacher who was openly gay, which, okay, as long as he's not preaching it. On the one hand they're saying it's natural but on the other hand it seems like they're trying to proselytize. A lot of this did not make sense. But this one teacher, I'm digressing here, was an English teacher and he was changing his curriculum around and he wanted the students to read only gay authors and black authors and women authors. I said, "What about good literature?" You judge literature that it should stand on its own merits, not the skin color or sexual orientation of who wrote it. But that was not the outlook. Actually, as it turns out, some of the gay literature that he was insisting requiring the students to read were only available at gay bookstores. We got ahold of some of it and read it out to the school board, which was not appreciated. Anyway, they dropped the issue of that. It turns out someone there, they were planning a clinic where girls could get abortions without parental permission and a lot of other. A lot of that was dropped, so I guess you could say it was a victory of sorts, but I would call it a pyrrhic victory because I'm sure that those condoms are there to be handed out whenever needed on the QT, as long as you don't hand them to the kid who's parent is going to raise a fuss. So we were not prepared for that, and that's what really made us more active here. We made some very enduring friendships at that time with other parents that continue today. When I retired, I did join Republican Women's Club, mainly to self-educate because they have a lot of speakers in. So it's not like I've been a gung ho activist. I've been busy with family and children and I've been forced into this.         EF: It's certainly kept you active.         CF: Yes.        EF: And that was my next question was to ask you about how you came to join the Republican Women in Chapel Hill, and what that relationship has been like?        CF: I've enjoyed it. I'm not the most active person. Like I say, I'm a joiner and I have a lot of irons in the fire, but I do try and we try and support candidates that we believe in than supporting the party, per say. We prefer to support specific candidates. We certainly follow the news. We become political junkies following the news. I suppose we really didn't realize how biased the mainstream media was. We didn't realize it at the time and I think just in the last twenty years or so it has become so blatantly obvious. So we follow all the goings on, the back and forth there, and you wonder where is this all going to end. It's not that I'm trying to return back to the 1950s. The 1950s certainly had lots of problems, but we need, I guess, some common sense--that's an old fashioned term itself--as far as why we're doing things. I'm appalled by some of what goes on.         EF: Have you maintained your Catholic identity?        CF: I have. I'm very active in the--. Well I'm active in the parish. I belong to two or three things there. We attend mass weekly.         EF: At Saint Thomas More?        CF: Yes. I'm glad I have kept my faith. Although there is certainly a very politically correct faction in the Catholic church too. I suppose that actually has been the turnoffs, and one of the things that has bothered me from time to time within the church is there is a very politically correct attitude that I don't care for. But like I say, I like the basics. I like the historical, philosophical--. To me it has kept the treasury of western culture and civilization and brought it down this far, and I hope that it can continue to carry that down. I have my issues there. It's not like I'm a non-thinking robot about that either.         EF: Well that really brings me to the end of my questions. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about or anything else that I should have asked that you would like to talk about?        CF: Not that I can think of. You've brought back a lot of things.        EF: Good.        CF: I came into this thinking I don't know what I'm supposed to say or what's going to happen here. Anyway.        EF: I certainly enjoyed listening to it. Thank you for sharing so much.         CF: Okay. I hope I didn't sound too over the top there or whatever.         EF: It was great to have your memories and everything else laid out. So I really appreciate your frankness and everything else. I'll go ahead and turn it off.         CF: Alright.
