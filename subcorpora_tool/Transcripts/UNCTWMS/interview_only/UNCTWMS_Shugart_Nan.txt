JF: This is Joey Fink with the Southern Oral History Program. It&#8217;s May sixteenth, 2011, and I&#8217;m interviewing Nan Shugart at her home in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Alright, Nan, so can you start by telling me when you were born and where you grew up?
NS: Yes, I&#8217;ll be happy to. I was born in Maryville, Tennessee, in 1958. So I&#8217;m fifty-two years old. And after living in Maryville for a few years, my family moved to Oak Ridge and that&#8217;s where I grew up and went to high school and before I left home. So I spent all my years mainly in Oak Ridge. And I&#8217;m the youngest of two girls, kind of stair-stepped. I have one sister who&#8217;s about eighteen months older than me and then another one who&#8217;s four years older than me.   I grew up in a very, I would think very, feminist household because we were three girls and then my mom and my dad, and they were just very liberal parents. I kind of feel like I got the feeling growing up of just because you&#8217;re a girl, you can do anything you want to do. Because in that time period in the 60s, there was a lot of sexism everywhere, everywhere you looked. You could go down the road and there&#8217;d be a sign and unfortunately, I think this is still true today, where it says &#8220;Men working.&#8221; But there was a lot of division, I think, of what girls could do and what girls could not do. When I compare it, though, to my mom&#8217;s growing up, she grew up in the Depression and probably her choices of career were secretary or teacher, nurse maybe. Maybe those were the few things that-or getting married. That was the probably number one. That&#8217;s the number one job, right? (laughs)  JF: Almost didn&#8217;t even need to be spoken.  NS: Right. But it was just a total generation for us and the doors were starting to open. I say &#8220;starting to open.&#8221; I wish they had been open all the way and I say that because growing up, I was very involved in sports. My dad was my basketball coach and my softball coach, just church sports, and just I loved sports. It was a lot of fun. Just even that, there were doors that were closed. For instance, in basketball, girls played what we called &#8220;split court&#8221; and a lot of girls of this age and time, they don&#8217;t even know what that means and basically that means if you were playing defense, you played half of the court and once you got to the middle line, you would pass the ball off to the next, to your teammate on the other side, who would then go and shoot. So if you were playing defense, you never got to shoot and if you were playing offense, back and forth. Anyway, that was just so bizarre and sexist and basically was due because they thought girls didn&#8217;t have the strength to run up and down a full court. (laughs)   But getting back to just growing up, again just, I don&#8217;t know, I had a wonderful, wonderful childhood, like I said, very liberal. Our parents encouraged us to do whatever we enjoyed doing and again, just whatever we wanted to do. It didn&#8217;t matter if that was a chosen women&#8217;s role, I guess. We were encouraged to just find our talents and do our best. But the sports thing is where I think I got more involved with the feminist, more issues of kind of right and wrong, like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not right. We should be able to run up and down the court.&#8221; And my dad was very involved in that struggle of trying to change that. He became, I think, an official, a church league official and then doing other basketball games, and so he did a lot in trying to get that changed. I was a child during that time, probably middle school, so I don&#8217;t really know the details of everything he did, but I know that he and my mom worked hard to try to get that changed and did and got that changed in our church league organization.  JF: What church were you?  NS: First United Presbyterian. That was the church. I remember in terms of church, that was my big involvement was the sports. Again, I think just that liberal upbringing of whatever. I can remember going to church on Sundays, but no more involvement in terms of like some other denominations, that kind of rules their life or that is their whole thing. But I can remember I was finished with church league. I guess I was going on to high school or maybe I was out of high school. I can&#8217;t remember when it finally got changed. So I never got that opportunity to ever play full court, but hopefully had some part of being a voice to get that changed for other girls.   I think it was more for me, high school years were where I really got involved in being able to have more of a voice, I think, for women and girls&#8217; sports. In high school, I was running track and what I vividly remember is being on the track practicing. The girls were practicing their stuff and the boys were practicing and I remember the boys&#8217; coach coming over to me and saying, &#8220;I need to take these hurdles from you because the boys are going to practice.&#8221; And I was practicing. I think some guys just came and got them and they said, &#8220;Coach said we could do this.&#8221; So that was real upsetting because that was my event and that&#8217;s what I was practicing. It was just that acknowledgement of, you don&#8217;t really matter. The boys are much more important.  And different things I would see going on in high school, like when we would go to away track meets, the girls would pay for their lunches at the cafeteria at the place, the high school we were competing against, but I would notice that the boys&#8217; coach would give the boys money to have their lunch. You just start seeing these little things. I shared a uniform with another girl who that was her basketball uniform and it was my track uniform and, of course, the boys had uniforms for all of their sports. So you just started seeing all these inequalities that made no sense. And so I would I come home and tell my parents, &#8220;This is what I&#8217;m seeing. This is what I&#8217;m hearing. This is what is happening.&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;This is crazy.&#8221;   They went the normal route to the school, then to the school board, and then when they saw that this is a real problem, we&#8217;re going to get legal help, and that&#8217;s when they asked our family friend and lawyer, Dorothy Stulberg, to be a part of that. They had to, &#8220;they&#8221; meaning my parents, we had to file a complaint with HEW, Health, Education and Welfare under Title IX, which says you can&#8217;t discriminate between the sexes in athletics. It took three years, I think, for that suit to run its course and get fixed, so to speak. The school was Oak Ridge High School and Oak Ridge High School is a very, very well-known top school in the country. My parents had, when they would go to the school or school board and talk about &#8220;this is wrong, we need to fix this,&#8221; blah blah blah, they were mainly dealing with male figures who many, I think, didn&#8217;t care. And they even felt like, &#8220;Oh we have time to be in compliance with Title IX.&#8221; And that&#8217;s not how the law is read. You don&#8217;t have time to wait. You start getting your ducks in a row and fixing things.   So I graduated from high school by the time that the suit was finally, by the time the Oak Ridge High School had fixed what they needed to fix. I was already in college at that point, which is so interesting when you think it takes so long to get things done, but at least things were changed and I feel like for girls now because of that, it&#8217;s always because somebody stands up and says, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t right.&#8221; I think probably the biggest thing I&#8217;ve learned from my mom is you&#8217;ve got to stand up because some people can&#8217;t stand up for themselves and some people can&#8217;t be heard. So it was kind of an honor, actually, to be in that position and to be able to do some good.  JS: I&#8217;m going to back you up a little bit now.  NS: Okay.  JS: And ask a couple of questions.  NS: Yeah, sure.  JS: It&#8217;s just great.   NS: Oh okay, good.  JS: You&#8217;re a very good storyteller. You&#8217;re making my job so easy.  NS: Thank you.  JS: So first I just wanted, like, where do you think your mom&#8217;s sense of justice, that sort of feminism and liberalism, where do you think that came from for her?  NS: Yeah. That&#8217;s such a great question. We adored her mother, my grandmother, and her father, my grandfather, just wonderful, little, sweet grandfather, grandmother. Gosh, they were such sweet people and they always seemed fair. So I guess my mom would probably say she got her sense of justice from her parents. She was an only child and probably very loved. I just feel like I really somehow got that quality from my mom, and my mom is very precious and very honored in our family. She&#8217;s the strong matriarch. She really is. I just feel like all the, she&#8217;s just so strong and so much of my strength comes from her, I guess. But my dad is wonderful. Both of them were so together in terms of &#8220;we&#8217;re going to help you fix what&#8217;s wrong.&#8221; So it was great.  JS: And your dad was the one that got you involved with sports?  NS: Yes.  JS: What&#8217;s like your earliest memory of playing sports or learning?  NS: Yeah, wow, probably throwing the softball with him outside in the yard. Like I said, he was my softball coach and I just had such a great childhood, just so much happiness with playing sports, riding to-he had this little van at some point where almost the whole softball team could get in this van back when you didn&#8217;t really have to wear seatbelts and worry about things. And we&#8217;d drive to different tournaments and stuff. It was just we had a great time. It was just so much fun and I&#8217;d love him being my coach. It was wonderful having him as my coach, although he did yell at me sometimes a lot more than other girls, but that was okay.  JK: Did you have a sense that your parents were unusual among your classmates and your friends?
NS: That is a great question. In some ways, yes. I sensed that they more liberal than my other friends&#8217; parents. When I say &#8220;liberal,&#8221; I&#8217;m not even quite sure how to put that into words, but I really did have a sense that they, I don&#8217;t know, just maybe because they were very involved in our lives. My dad would be the one who would go and pick up other kids who couldn&#8217;t get a ride to softball practice or basketball. We&#8217;d go and pick people up. They were just very supportive of whatever we chose to do.  JS: Do you remember any reactions from the community or from the school negative or skeptical when Title IX started to gain steam?  NS: Yeah, yeah. I can remember friends of mine in high school not relating to what I was sharing with them about feeling discriminated against, some friends, not all friends, but some. I remember just thinking, &#8220;What world do they live in?&#8221; Almost weekly, I felt like there was something in my worldview that I felt like either myself or other girls were being discriminated against. But it was such, you know for society, it was so habit and for so long, women have been looked upon as second-class citizens and unfortunately, to this day, I think that continues around the world. It&#8217;s disheartening, but yet I see the gains that women have made. So that makes you feel better about it.   I have a daughter now who&#8217;s thirteen, who&#8217;s never had to really struggle the way I struggled growing up with her expectations as a girl, what she could or couldn&#8217;t do. When I [her] remind about, &#8220;This is what I went through. I know that&#8217;s hard for you to understand that I had to struggle for this right that you and your friends just take for granted.&#8221; It&#8217;s hard for girls today to relate because it&#8217;s just there. These opportunities or whatever are there and always have been for them. My mom&#8217;s generation, my generation, we worked hard to get things to change for the better for girls, females, for women.  JS: You did. Thank you.  NS: Yeah. You&#8217;re welcome. (laughs)  JS: I think you&#8217;re in such a great position to talk to me about this because you&#8217;re really that first generation where there&#8217;s some new opportunities being made available, but there&#8217;s still resistance and push-back.   NS: Yeah.  JS: So if you could tell me a little bit about when you were in high school, what was the sense of what was possible? What were your expectations for what you were going to do after high school? What did you and your girlfriends talk about?  NS: Yeah. Let&#8217;s see. I guess when I was in high school, I did excel at sports. I loved sports, being athletic I remember my mom kind of suggesting that I be a physical education teacher. And I thought that was a good idea and wasn&#8217;t quite sure what else. At the time, I&#8217;m sure exercise physiology or something like never occurred to me. That probably wasn&#8217;t something really out there. I think if something like that had been more prominent, that might have been a direction I would have taken. But more, I guess, the teacher route, PE, and did for two years focus on being a physical education teacher, but when I had to do the student teaching, I thought, &#8220;Ew, I don&#8217;t want to do that.&#8221; (laughs) &#8220;That sounds scary. I don&#8217;t want to teach that. I&#8217;m not going to do that.&#8221; So I shifted gears and went into more of a social work field.   But I&#8217;m trying to think of, like when I think about my friends now that were in high school, that are grown and doing their careers, so many of them went into the medical field if I think back, like nurses, counselors, phlebotomists, lab technicians. I&#8217;m trying to think of some of the other girls. I&#8217;m trying to think. We talked about college. I always knew that I wanted to go to college and I think most of my friends, we were in the middle class society. Most of us talked about college and what we&#8217;d want to do afterwards.   Times were so different then, though, than now in that there certainly wasn&#8217;t near as much pressure on us as boys or girls in terms of just the pressure that kids have these days in school to make good grades and to go on to maybe top colleges and things. I wanted to do well, always did well, but there just wasn&#8217;t the homework load and the pressure, just all that, that are all on kids today starting in elementary school really. So I think I&#8217;m happy that I grew in a time that was a little bit freer, more relaxed in terms of academics and pressure.   I&#8217;m trying to think in terms of the discussions that my girlfriends and I had in terms of growing up, leaving home. I guess I basically just remember that all of us were kind of looking at a career path beyond high school, definitely making that next educational step. Education was big for my dad in particular and I think it was because it was big for his mother. His mother, one of my grandmothers, knew that that was, it&#8217;s kind of true, your ticket out, your way to get ahead in life, education. I think that&#8217;s actually true today. You&#8217;ve got to had some good education in order to do something in life, in order to have some skills to offer. But he was really big on that and just wanting us to do well, but wanting us to go on to college, that sort of thing.   JS: Then your mom and Dorothy Stulberg started talking about filing a lawsuit. Did it start with a lawsuit against a state?  NS: Against the school.  JS: Against the school.  NS: Against Oak Ridge High School, yes.   JS: What do you remember of that? Did you have to testify in court or--?  NS: No, I didn&#8217;t have to testify in court and sometimes I wonder if they shielded me a little bit when I think about it because I remember my parents and Dorothy having lots of meetings either at our house or Dorothy&#8217;s house. I can remember HEW, the two, three people came from the government to our home and I don&#8217;t remember, my memory may be bad on this, but I don&#8217;t remember being a part of it. Maybe I was. I remember them coming and they were going to meet with my parents, even though it was essentially from me that the lawsuit was filed. That&#8217;s terrible. My mom would have a better memory about this than I would. But a lot of meetings, a lot of conversations on the phone, what to do now, lots of my parents going to school board meetings, individual meetings with the school, and just my parents coming home and my mom saying things like, &#8220;We can&#8217;t get through to them. They don&#8217;t seem to get it. They don&#8217;t understand. They don&#8217;t see the need to make things equal.&#8221; I can remember her saying something about one gentleman at the school, some administrator or someone who had like three girls and my mom thought, &#8220;Surely, he&#8217;ll get it.&#8221; But he didn&#8217;t get it either. (laughs)   And I guess the fact that the suit was finally, even though I certainly kept abreast in high school of what was going on and what meetings were happening and there was a lot of articles in the newspaper because, again, Oak Ridge High School was a big, important school and so there was a lot of publicity about what was Oak Ridge High School going to do. And I think that&#8217;s where Dorothy probably has most of those articles. So I remember it being, I was treated very importantly by my parents, which was great. They took what I said as something serious, important, and &#8220;we&#8217;ll help bring this to a right conclusion.&#8221; I think Oak Ridge High School went kicking and screaming, but they had to get on board or else be non-compliant. So it was quite a victory and good when things were resolved and they complied. They had to comply in a lot of areas.   JS: Yeah. Dorothy mentioned something about they had tried in the courts to change the split court and they lost, but then because of your lawsuit for track, she described sort of going in the back door with it, that they were able to force all athletics to comply.  NS: Interesting.  JS: So basketball ended up coming up into compliance as well.  NS: And I think our state in particular, Tennessee, was pretty backwards in terms of split court. I think other states were already full court, but not Tennessee, unfortunately. But I didn&#8217;t realize that. Like I said, I guess maybe having gone on to college, I just wasn&#8217;t as aware of what was exactly going on with that.  JS: Where did you go to college?  NS: Well, my mom didn&#8217;t really want me to go to the University of Tennessee, which would have been kind of the home-town college, because it is so big and so I went to Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky, partly because my dad knew somebody there. My dad&#8217;s a bio-chemist and somehow had a friend maybe working at the university and they just thought it would be a good place. I suppose I visited. My mom laughs about this because I remember thinking, &#8220;Oh they just drove me to Kentucky, dropped me off, and helped me set up my dorm room, dropped me off, and that was it.&#8221; I remember at some point saying, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t even visit the school.&#8221; And my mom was like, &#8220;Nan, you did visit the school.&#8221; So like I said, my memory&#8217;s a little shaky. But I really enjoyed Western Kentucky and I was there two years, didn&#8217;t finish there, came back home after two years. I kind of think I got a little homesick and came back, wasn&#8217;t really sure what I wanted to do, was disillusioned with continuing with the physical education and ending up going to the University of Tennessee and finishing out my undergraduate there in social work and human services.  But when I was at Western Kentucky, because I was in the physical education program, one of the teachers approached me and another girl to see if we&#8217;d like to be managers for the women&#8217;s basketball team. And we were like, &#8220;That sounds fun.&#8221;  JS: And this would have been around [19]76, [19]77?  NS: Yes, from probably more [19]77, yeah, because I graduated in [19]76. So exactly, yeah, somewhere in between [19]76 and [19]78 because I was a manager for two years. We thought, &#8220;Well, that sounds good.&#8221; We kind of felt like that was an honor to be asked and yeah, we&#8217;d go to the practices and do the usual manager stuff where you, I guess, take care of the balls, the equipment, and that sort of thing. And because, having left high school, seeing that discrimination, I guess I was just aware and in turn when I saw, oh my goodness, the same thing is happening here on this college level, I couldn&#8217;t believe it. And at that time, there were actually Title IX [of the Educational Amendments of 1972] coordinators in colleges, which was really cool, although it did no good for me.  JS: What should have they been doing there? I guess I should ask it that way.  NS: Yes, exactly. Why do they need to be there? I don&#8217;t know if it was for a time period trying to get Title IX all complied in educational institutions. It is interesting because why should you need that?  JS: Did they talk to female students or were they someone that you could report to?  NS: No, I don&#8217;t remember at all. The only time I met that women, the women who was, there were, I think, two Title IX coordinators at the college, but I remember going to one initially when I saw all these problems, these discrepancies between the men&#8217;s college basketball program and the women&#8217;s college basketball program. And I remember calling home, saying, &#8220;Oh gosh, I can&#8217;t believe this is happening here. I&#8217;m going through this again.&#8221; And I remember Dorothy [Stulberg], I don&#8217;t know if we talked on the phone or what, but I remember we must have or maybe on a break home, and I remember Dorothy saying, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to document everything that you&#8217;re seeing. You&#8217;ve got to know what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;   So I did and I took that documentation to the Title IX coordinator because that was the proper avenue to go through and I even took the other girl. Her name was Lucretia. I took her with me, the other basketball manager, to this meeting and she was a very wonderful, southern girl who, I&#8217;m sure, was horrified of the fact that I was leading her into this meeting. She would not make waves or anything, a wonderful girl. I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s doing now. But it fell on deaf ears, I guess: &#8220;Oh thanks for letting us know. We&#8217;re not going to do anything about it.&#8221;   So I remember calling home: &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ve done this part.&#8221; And so then my dad, and I have some documentation on this where my dad wrote some letters to the Title IX coordinator saying, &#8220;Our daughter is saying this.&#8221; Anyway, I was reading back through the letter and one of the letters back from the Title IX coordinator said, &#8220;Well, we have until&#8221; whatever the year was, &#8220;until this year to be in compliance.&#8221; And then my dad wrote back and I have a copy of that letter saying, &#8220;No, this is not a waiting period for you to be in compliance. This is when you start being in compliance. So because the college was not going to help in any way, we knew how to do it at that point, how to file a lawsuit with HEW; so we did.   The thing I remember, though, so clearly about this whole time was how emotionally difficult it was for me partly because my parents weren&#8217;t with me. So I was kind of on my own with this in a way in terms of on my own physically at the school. They were incredibly supportive and probably were doing all the paperwork and stuff. But people at the school, particularly the women on the basketball team, did not understand what I was doing and were not supportive really. Again, that mentality, I think, of people just not wanting to upset the apple cart. Even when I spoke with the women&#8217;s coach and then the athletic director, female, they were sympathetic, but they were scared of jeopardizing their jobs if they spoke up and I totally do understand that. But it was kind of lonely for me, particularly when the women I was fighting for didn&#8217;t get it, didn&#8217;t really understand. So there wasn&#8217;t a whole lot of support. I did have some friends who weren&#8217;t involved at all with basketball, just friends on campus, that were real supportive of me and that meant a lot.   That suit took two years to go through its process and by that point, I had left again. I&#8217;d left the college by the time it was resolved. And remember after I left there-and I didn&#8217;t leave there because of the suit. I left mainly because I was switching gears career-wise and really wasn&#8217;t quite sure what I wanted to do, just knew that that wasn&#8217;t the path for me, and so I came back home and eventually went to UT. But I remember getting a letter from HEW saying, &#8220;We need you to write us back and let us know if you want end the suit,&#8221; so to speak. It was like, &#8220;They&#8217;ve complied. They&#8217;ve gotten in compliance.&#8221; So I can remember just writing back saying, &#8220;Okay. I guess I&#8217;ll drop it if it&#8217;s all taken care of.&#8221;   Something I wrote I was reading the other night when I was getting back in touch with all this is, when I left there and I was so involved in sports, particularly basketball being the basketball manager, [but when I left college] I could not watch basketball anymore on TV, live games. It just brought up too much emotional feelings about it. It was years before I wanted to watch basketball games again, which was interesting because I love that; I do now. But it was just like it was kind of, I guess, a way to just kind of protect myself from all that went on because it&#8217;s just hard to be the whistleblower. It&#8217;s hard to be the one that&#8217;s saying, &#8220;You know, this isn&#8217;t right,&#8221; when you don&#8217;t get the support that you think you&#8217;ll get. I guess if I had everybody behind me and everything, it would have been much easier.  JS: Yeah. If you had everybody behind you, you wouldn&#8217;t have to be a whistleblower.  NS: Right, exactly. It would have already gotten fixed, yeah. And some of the things just briefly that I became aware of in terms of the inequalities were the boys&#8217; managers got paid books, they got their books free for being a manager for the men&#8217;s team, and some small, little stipend. It wasn&#8217;t much, but it was something and we didn&#8217;t get anything. The two of us, the females that were for the women&#8217;s college team, we didn&#8217;t get anything and I remember how I found out about this was one of the other men&#8217;s managers and I were talking and he said something about his books and stuff, indicating like, well, I guess I got my books free too. And I was like, &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; I was thinking, &#8220;What?&#8221;   It was never about me wanting any stipend or my books free. My parents could afford to pay for that. It wasn&#8217;t ever that. It was more I would see the women, we&#8217;d be getting into these school university vans to go to an away game to travel and the men&#8217;s team would be in a rented Trailways, big bus thing. Just visible inequalities. The locker rooms for the women versus the men were very different and I&#8217;m sure the pay, of course, for the coaches were quite different and shouldn&#8217;t have been. So just on the outside, you could see all these differences. Anyway, I&#8217;ll really glad that I could be a part of that really. I wish it didn&#8217;t have to be taken care of, but if it does, I didn&#8217;t mind being the one to try to get it fixed.  JS: I see you definitely had a sense of sort of being the pioneer, the trailblazer, if for no other reason than just for the loneliness.  NS: Yes, exactly. (laughs)   JS: And the difficulty.   NS: Yeah.  JS: Did you have a sense of being part of a broader women&#8217;s movement?   BS: Yes, oh yes. Growing up, yeah. During my growing up time period, which would have been mainly the 60s and 70s, a huge women&#8217;s movement and yeah, I did feel a part of a big movement, which was a great feeling. I can remember one Christmas, my grandmother gave me this book that I wanted. It was a women&#8217;s, not just a novel reading book, but more like a catalog kind of thing about the women&#8217;s movement and I was so thrilled to get that and that my grandmother gave it to me. So I was very much appreciative and loved that movement and being a part of it.   I had t-shirts back then. I remember one, I wish I still had it, but I don&#8217;t know where it is. It&#8217;s gone. It&#8217;s probably rotted. I had it made, I guess my parents helped me make it, that said &#8220;Title IX&#8221; on it. It was a maroon shirt with this white-when you used to get, if you wanted t-shirts made, you got the little stuff and they hot-ironed the thing on top. But it said &#8220;Title IX&#8221; and then something else. But if there was a shirt out there that was about women&#8217;s lib or whatever, I had it. I would get that t-shirt. I didn&#8217;t have any trouble just letting people know that&#8217;s how I felt.   I felt good describing myself as a feminist. I mean, I do to this day. I know there are times where people are real confused about that word or what that means for them or some people feel like it has a negative connotation, but for me, it never had a negative connotation. It was always something to be proud of.  [Recorder shut down due to equipment malfunction and interview was ended abruptly.]
