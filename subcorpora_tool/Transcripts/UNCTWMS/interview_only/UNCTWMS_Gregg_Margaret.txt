Joey Fink:
It&#8217;s August 10, 2010. I am in Abingdon, Virginia, with Margaret Gregg. Margaret, we could start by perhaps you telling me a little bit about where you&#8217;re from, where you grew up, how you ended up in Appalachia.  Margaret Gregg: I was born in Chicago on the South Side in 1940 and I grew up Catholic, going to Catholic grammar schools and high school. And then I went to Marquette University for a year and I wasn&#8217;t always sure what to do when I grew up. &#8220;What do you want to be when you grow up?&#8221; So I was--. My sister was also attracted to Catholic sisters. They were very significant role models for me so that was a big influence. So then my sister, who is four years older than I am, had joined the Glenmary Sisters and somehow I did that, too. And then that experience brought me to Cincinnati and then another small town in Ohio, and then I spent some time in Big Stone Gap, Virginia around 1964, and it was more in the heartland of it all. So part of it was not me having the vision, &#8220;Oh this is what I want to do with my life,&#8221; but one thing followed another and it was mixed things.  Different levels of motivation and different needs to get out of one thing and see what something else brings.    JF: And you were one of the sisters that left to start FOCIS [Federation of Communities in Service]?  MG:  Correct.    JF: About what year was that?    MG: August of 1967.    JF: What drew you to, well, what drew you out of the Glenmary sisterhood and into FOCIS?  MG: I was more involved with the people that created FOCIS than I was with the people that wanted to keep doing the Glenmary thing. So it was just the next thing. It wasn&#8217;t so, yeah, followed.   JF: What kind of things were you doing with FOCIS in the mid to late 60s?    MG: Right from the beginning I started to live in Knoxville. I was the first person to live there and some other people were living in mountain communities of Clearfield [Kentucky].  And I was running the communications center and then I went to some sort of ecumenical interfaith meeting at the National Council of Churches and met someone, Jim Carmichael. We got to talking about ideas, about arts and social change and just plain old arts stuff.  And then he got me interested in talking to someone with the Cummings Foundation and that started to evolve into a community arts program and it hit home real well because of everybody&#8217;s meeting the folks. [Because of] people&#8217;s involvement in mountain communities and urban centers and kind of all over.  And an interest in the arts, some of that really had been nurtured in Glenmary.  So in Knoxville there was an ecumenical community that was really exciting. It was great people like Bill Daniels and Renfro Sproul, and myself.  We got things moving and got some money and did things in the neighborhoods.  And then the whole regional thing--.  JF: What kind of projects were you working on?    MG: Well, I remember one--. A lot of people were up in Woodstock, and we were building jug sculptures in some of the neighborhoods in Knoxville. And actually part--. I never knew that much about civil rights movements as I did about things that were happening in Central Appalachia and that was usually from a perspective of being interested in creating alternatives rather than creating the system and challenging the status quo.  Creating alternatives was another way to challenge certain structures.  JF: What kind of challenges were you all up against? Were you working with communities against strip mining?  MG: Yeah, we just [pause]--. That was a part of things, and then there was just plain a lot of poverty and a lot of cultural alienation and, you know, just getting to be friends with people and get a little music going and doing some decorate a few things, build some environments. We got people together and it opened up a lot of areas to discuss about other things that could be related. I guess you might call it a strategy. The program we developed--which you can read more extensively about in the book Mountain Sisters [subtitled From Convent to Community in Appalachia, by Helen Lewis and Monica Appleby]--was called Discovery Communication and Arts Approach to Social Change.  It&#8217;s like, why not think of ways to help people have a success experience? And that builds up some confidence and you can keep moving on.   JF: And were you working with, what kind of people were you working with? I mean your fellow organizers and artists. Were they from the area? Were they local?  MG: Some were local and some were coming in because they wanted to organize. And then there were some church people from different denominations that had that same interest, but they were trying to find a base, a sort of connected base that could be a vehicle for networking. And at this point it is kind of--. I didn&#8217;t see myself as so much of an activist, I just kept doing stuff.  Even within the Glenmary FOCIS tradition, we never saw ourselves explicitly, or discussed ourselves, as feminists. Someone, she did a lot of work in the archives at (6:20), she called us &#8220;unintentional feminists. We weren&#8217;t out there being feminists, but we just had to be and didn&#8217;t realize that was a part of it.   JF: How would you characterize the people that you were helping to find moments of success and places of expression?  MG: Well, just delightful, friendly, supportive, engaging.  Yeah. I just think, hey, it&#8217;s fun to be with people and learn things and do things, and there are different ways of doing things together. You bring stuff in, mess around with it, make films, do wall hangings, do quilting. I was doing some projects that I wanted to make some money on, so I paid people to do some sewing projects and things.  It was fun to get together. I gave them some good laughs. I was so stupid about what it was to live in the mountains [laughter].  JF: [Laughter] Can you give me an example?  MG: Well, they teased me. They said, &#8220;If you go into the outhouse at night, you better watch out, there could be snakes and you can&#8217;t see them.&#8221;  JF: That seems reasonable to me.  MG: It sounds very reasonable but I never would have thought of something like that.  Good laughs [laughter]  JF: [Laughter] The community center was--. You said people were looking for a base, some were locals, some were outsiders.  Did that base form? Where did that base form?
MG: In different ways. Part of the intention of the FOCIS people was to provide experiences of initiation and be able to empower people enough so they could take it over, and that so-called FOCIS people or any community organizer type wouldn&#8217;t be there [later on] to sustain the thing. That had its unknown areas.  That is a good concept but to really pull it off is very, very challenging and uncertain.
JF: Did you have alliances from other organizations that you worked with?
MG: At the time, yeah we always worked in--. There were a whole bunch of connections going on.
JF: Like Highlander?
MG: Highlander, CORA, Appalshop, Epworth, different community groups. The Design Center. I was more into East Tennessee things and Southwest Virginia things and then there would be things going on and you could all call on each other to deal with it.
JF: Do any particular events or projects stand out in your mind as turning points or real moments where you nailed it, where you got it?
MG: Oh! [Pause]. Nothing ever nailed it or got it. It would be nice if it did. But I was involved more in the city thing in Knoxville, which was the hippies, some of the druggies and the political people, and the Nixon administration time. And then there was another culture happening of people working in mountain communities where the old coal camps with the poverty levels and the educational levels and the need for different things--. There were almost two different scenes. And so how to look at that together was a bit of a challenge.   It&#8217;s always amazing that some people can live so close but not know what the other is doing, and not know that deep down you are doing the same thing. Like at one point, the Vanderbilt Student Health Coalition was doing health fairs and at the same time we were doing the art fair thing, the arts stuff.  Not everybody could see the connection that we are all about the same thing. There were also some differences with people that were doing more church-oriented things in a new kind of way.  If they saw people that were more specifically political and aggressive politically they did not know how it might work out. But somehow it all did.   Oh, one of the exciting things was a festival we did at High Knob. I think this was in 1991 or 1992, Appalachian peoples&#8217; old-timey festival and tea party, whatever.  It may still be going on at the fairgrounds, but it opened up a way for some people&#8212;again, this is something you can get some good information about in the book&#8212;Jackie Wright, Frankie Taylor, Bertie All, Ground Perlage and the Bingmans and me.  I was doing a different thing that some of the other FOCIS people were doing. This was more rooted in a group different than a church-connected thing. But it all worked out. It was sort of arts-related and it brought in so many exciting people up on High Knob. And now High Knob is a situation where there are serious environmental issues about mountaintop removal and it is more complicated than I could ever have imagined way back in 1972 or 1973. Appalshop was there shooting their first 16 millimeter film stuff. They were just beginning because they just got funded.    JF: So you said FOCIS was doing something and you were doing something different? What was the difference?  MG: Well, I was with people, oh, this is awkward, let&#8217;s see, Art Sing, and then it was people who were used to organize other people that were used to organizing from a more political base than a community base.  They wanted to find the community thing and I was sort of helping that happen. I guess the main location of other FOCIS people was in Big Stone Gap and their work there was related to some community work with groups, sort of Catholic Church related but not totally, and then working with the diocese.  The festival was happening independent of all that. It was also a time when we got involved in Clinch College and Helen Lewis was there.  It opened up some new things, all these areas. So I think that was probably the most significant. And that is where Rich and Beth met each other.  JF: [Laughter] Oh, Rich Hannigan and--.  MG: Rich Kirby and Beth Baneman.   JF: Rich Kirby. What was going on with the Clinch College?  MG. Now it is called Virginia something-or-other. They changed the name. There were folks there who were Vietnam veterans going back to school and studying with Helen Lewis about social issues, Appalachian studies type of things. They were really gifted, brilliant people, finding a new way to come home and do things.   JF: So there was threads of the anti-war and--.  MG: Yeah. The craziness of being a colony in Appalachia, and the industry and the abuse that was happening in all the systems.  JF: What kind of roles were women playing&#8212;local women in the communities&#8212;in these efforts?  MG: I don&#8217;t--. They would be there. In relationship to this festival, it is hard to say. It was mostly male, mostly men doing stuff. In Big Stone, the women [pause] had to work with emergency relief.  How you keep your families going and how you get work and stuff like that.  I&#8217;m not a good feminist historian.   JF: That&#8217;s fine. We&#8217;re not asking for--. I just want to hear your perspective, not necessarily the history, but what did you see as the primary struggles these women were going through, or what resources did they have? How did the Gerard Center fit in with this?  MG: I would do art projects with women. We would either sell them or hang them up somewhere. It was fun to get together and do it and make a few bucks and think, &#8220;Oh I can do that, I never did that before.&#8221; That sort of thing. And then in some places different people might promote different activities that were performance-related or music or film.  At that point, storytelling was not specifically such a big deal as it is now, but there was always storytelling.   JF: Sort of informal groups of women?  MG: Yeah. I think me, as a person, I was so needy to be with people and just get whatever, that I wasn&#8217;t threatening to anyone.   JF: Can you tell me a little bit about the Upworth Jubilee Community Center?   MG: Oh! That was very [pause] experimental in terms of Knoxville.  JF: What do you mean by that?  MG: Well, an ecumenical project in Knoxville was very tradition-based. Experiences with the Episcopal Church and the Methodist Church. The Presbyterians and the Catholics were kind of on the sideline but they couldn&#8217;t not be there because you just can&#8217;t refuse something like that.  But it was very community- based because it was right by the campus. I was someone there who was a way to bring in a program about community arts, and we had buildings to work with. We could do festivals and have workshops and discussions, and somebody did a free school and it just kept going. There were some wonderful liturgies that would pull in stuff from different traditions that wouldn&#8217;t put off anybody, in terms of being too traditional or too much the organized church-heavy approach.  JF: So it sort of would appeal both to folks who were looking for a spiritual center and folks who were trying to avoid them?  MG: Yeah, something like that. And it was very much spirituality and community. It just opened up all sorts of awesome community energy. Some wonderful musicians were there, and opportunities for community dinners. It was a big old free-for-all in the best sense of the term. And we would do things in the community and bring people in and they loved it, and no one had done that before.  JF: Can you give me some examples?  MG:  Well, there would be big community suppers and the neighborhood, the students, the UTK [University of Tennessee at Knoxville] people, everybody would come and do it. And then we would find ways, especially for some students that wanted to do something different, to do things that would support the festival experience or something else.  So that was good.  JF: And Joan [Boyd Short] told me that you did a lot of the artwork?  MG: I did.  JF: What was your medium? What were you working with?  MG: Silk screen and textiles. But I also was a source for getting some money. Yeah, it was very significant. Through the expansion arts program, National Endowment for the Arts, they had just opened up and we went to visit them right away and they liked us.  JF: So you got some money from the NEA right from the opening of that? That must have been pretty exciting to get that kind of [laughter]--.  MG: Money makes a difference.  A lot of people just couldn&#8217;t be there unless they were getting church support or some organizing structure or whatever.  JF: So how long were you with the Jubilee Center?  MG: Well, since it began. And then I left Knoxville in 1975.  JF: So about 1969 to 1975?  MG: Well, the first couple of years it wasn&#8217;t so much the Jubilee Center as much as focused on being the, getting the arts program off the ground, and finding a base for one aspect of the project in Knoxville.    JF: Were there leaders in the Upworth ministry that stuck out to you as people that were particularly good at trying to reach, like you said, that point of empowering people to find their forms of expression, to find resources to better their lives?  MG: Most significantly, Bill Daniels and Renfro Sprout.  JF: Do you remember some of the campaign success they had or issues they--.  MG: Well, they could keep getting some support from their denominations, meaning Episcopal or Methodist, and then they could finesse a lot of situations. Bill was the person that could always deal with the arts endowment.  JF: So it sounds like you were sort of running the ground floor.  MG: Yeah, I put up a good front. I was drawn to the arts. It was just so interesting and safe.   JF: Was there anywhere else in town that was doing something like that?  MG: No.   JF: So this sort of became the center.  MG: Right. Now everybody&#8217;s doing it. One precedent for this type of work was a program in New York called Summer in the City. That was going on in the middle &#8216;60s.   JF: Did you have people coming down from New York to work with you all?  MG: No, but I met them and the first&#8212;. I forget the name of the person who was behind it all. I was in, the summer that Glenmary (22:13) happened, I was in New York for a liturgical arts conference, which was featuring a lot of very contemporary artists doing Happenings and things and somehow we ended up in an apartment in Harlem that was part of the Summer in the City things. I&#8217;d have to really dig in, do a little research, to see what that was all about.   JF: So you said that probably one of the bigger local concerns, one of the bigger concerns for local women, was around issues of poverty.  MG: Yeah, family. People take care of each other. I am not informed enough to know how people could use the system in terms welfare and all of that, but a lot of people just wanted to keep doing their thing. I can&#8217;t go into that in much depth, but people took care of each other [pause] and they loved where they were. And that is a whole other phenomenon about the outmigration and family patterns and changes, economics. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know how to discuss it with any clarity.   JF: Can you think of a story or two that sticks out to you, of someone you know or a story you heard of a family that sort of represents that, that problem of the area?  MG: Well one person, and her family, I dearly love. Her name was Nervie and she was the matriarch and she had I don&#8217;t know how many children. They lived up in Buffalo Holler. She would do quilting and things for me and I would be with them and I would sell stuff and bring something back, and other family members did things. You know, these are older women. Very caring, and they loved it. They got really excited just doing things. And they did beautiful work.    Once I had a little exhibit up and I showed the quilts that I had that I would design and do the piecing, and Esther, Nervie&#8217;s daughter, and Nervie, they would do all the quilting. Esther came to visit with--. I don&#8217;t know, she was a character, she never had children, she had a husband, and she would fool around and she was just wild and wonderful. But she saw this work up and she said, &#8220;Oh, something is going to live beyond me.&#8221; Her beautiful work in the quilts. I was able to give that presence to her, in terms of her legacy.   JF: That&#8217;s wonderful.  MG: Yeah, it was on a--. These were people, they lived on a, they grew up, because they did the deep mines and all that.  The men worked in the mines, the women took care of everything. So it was&#8212;. And the quilting traditions were very, very specific to women in the mountains. Esther took care of her mother until she died. Nervie was always in the bed in the front room until she died. It was gentle and caring and happy in its own way, and a great sense of humor.   JF: How would you characterize the relationships between men and women among the people who made Jubilee their center for whatever work or goals they were pushing towards?  MG: Well, I can think of Fran and Jim [Fran Ansley and Jim Sessions]. They came from the east coast, and were very sophisticated in terms of education and intellectually, and very focused on, &#8220;This is what I am going to do.&#8221; And so it became a base for them, and they could hang out there and find other people and bring people there if they felt like it. But they would not have to be there in such a way that it was their goal, but it was a supportive environment. That was, I think, true for a lot of people. It was sort of a, you know they use the term, &#8220;This is a safe place,&#8221; if you have stories to tell that you wouldn&#8217;t tell somewhere else you could tell them there. I think that was part of it, because the people that were keeping it going were that kind of people. Everybody was kind of dealing with personal issues and how to think about what was going on. This is the sixties, crazy, insane times. How to put that together, professionally, personally, and in a very specific community and in the region. There was not much regional consciousness of Knoxville as part of Central Appalachia. But that has increased.   JF: What were the main focuses on the city of Knoxville?  MG: Oh boy. Well TVA [Tennessee Valley Authority] was there, and the university. And it was called the &#8220;armpit of the universe.&#8221;  Let&#8217;s see. And again, I am not politically that astute or sophisticated or knowledgeable, but people at the university were trying to set up some new programs, and then I am not sure what the church groups were doing. Oh, Neyland Stadium somehow was the place that Billy Graham came to talk in the Nixon years and all that, [at the Billy Graham Crusade at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, May 22-31, 1970], and that sort of pulled things together in terms of being able to offer a sense of resistance.   JF: How so?  MG: To demonstrate.  And then people came to ETSU [East Tennessee State University] from outside the area because it was easier to get in. If you needed a school to go to, you could get in there if you could not get in other places. It&#8217;s right next to Oak Ridge, and I don&#8217;t know how to look at that in terms of significance.  JF: Were people talking a lot about Oak Ridge?  MG: Yeah, because of what Oak Ridge is all about, and if you are close by, there are people close by that have worked there, or who are critically thinking about it in critical terms, and that kind of stuff. Highlander was close by. Highlander was in Knoxville. And then they sort of had to, they moved out of town.   JF: What did you think of Highlander?  MG: Let&#8217;s see, I enjoyed the people I met there, quite often. I was impressed that they would try to include community people, but I never felt I was that able to be a heavy duty organizer or articulate things about different needs and different movements, but I could do little arty things and it did not hurt anyone. Highlander was being very aggressive, and they had ways to fund things and ways to initiate projects, and the folks I was with would sort of be into funding and projects from a different perspective, but they are not exclusive in any way. All these approaches need each other, and that is becoming more and more exciting. If we would bring some of the people into festivals that were also some of the people that were associated with Highlander, they liked it.  JF: Can you describe a little bit about some of the things that were going on with the festivals?  MG: Well the first ones were so much fun, with Hazel Dickens and Ralph Stanley and Anne Romaine, who has since died.  Let&#8217;s see, Cy Cahn, John McCutcheon, wow, Rich Kirby, Jackie Wright, Mike Klein, great people. Lots of dancing, drinking. So much fun.  JF: Did it have a sort of political undertone?  MG: Absolutely.   JF: Yes? What were some of the issues and thoughts that were occupying people&#8217;s minds the most?  MG: Well, how, just plain the divisions in economic structures, being colonized, more and more about that, and even neighborhood issues. Knoxville needed a lot of ways to develop more attractive housing for people of different economic levels, and the university needed to reach out and do more things in the community and we gave them a lot of ways to do that. The neighborhood was the perfect environment for the Community Design Center to get set up.   JF: What was the Community Design Center?  MG: Well, that is why you need to talk to Annette Anderson when you are in Knoxville, absolutely. It provided professional services to communities that needed to do some serious planning and some serious design. Low income housing that is attractive and community design that allows for renovations, upkeep, and parks and user-friendly pedestrian pathways and all sorts of issues. They have done it the biggest and best in the country.   JF: What would you say were some of the biggest oppositions to this kind of community development and community-centered arts and politics?  MG: People that would&#8212;. It&#8217;s like a marriage relationship. If two people are too stuck on each other, they cannot follow their own heartbeat. So sometimes people would be so stuck in church traditions or university department traditions, or even the way county systems are set up, they could not think of any leeway. In the 1970s, so many things were new. There were new options for community development funding and anything, and arts funding, and even church groups were ready to put some money into different ways to deal with their mission to serve the poor.   JF: Would you attribute that to making these issues, the way that the activists and the artists made these issues more visible?  MG: Right. Some of the new activists and artists, they would ask questions and they would not need the affirmation of the established status quo to do what needed to be done.  JF: So things sort of started to turn in the 70s, opening up?   MG: Yeah.  Well, I think some new relationships could start, too, with students and activists and university types.   JF: Was the student population growing more diverse because of the Civil Rights Act and Title IX in 1974?  MG: Yeah. What&#8217;s Title IX?  JF: Title IX basically placed gender along with race, that you can not discriminate against an applicant for college based on gender.  MG: Sure. See, that is where I am a nitwit. I have not thought about those things and the impact.  JF: Do you feel like the student population was changing?  MG: I think so, yeah. Right. Yes. But again, that is a whole superficial response, because I don&#8217;t know enough about it.  JF: Well, I am just asking for your perspective as you think back on the years between &#8217;69 and &#8217;75.  MG: Right [laughter]. Well the whole town changed, too, and then they got the World&#8217;s Fair there. That was great.   JF: Were you involved in anything going on with the World&#8217;s Fair?  MG: No, but Bill Daniels had a lot to do with it. He would get on all the right committees and push hard. He did great.   JF: Did they do any kind of Appalachian arts, or exhibits of local folk art?  MG: I think so, and I think the Community Design Center was involved in that, too. Again, I was not living there at the time, so it was&#8212;. I did not know that much in intimate detail, but there were developments in that part of Knoxville that were fascinating. Some really beautiful neighborhood architectural planning things that were very impressive.   JF: So can you tell me a little bit about what happened after you left Knoxville? Where did you go? What did you do?  MG: I moved up to Johnson City. Part of it was that I was involved with someone and he got a job at Broadside TV. I moved up there and did a little bit with Broadside and got a studio set up in Jonesboro. We weren&#8217;t together that much longer, and I just kept doing things in Jonesboro, and had different studios in the area up through 2006 or 2007. Then I left for eleven months. I was in Chicago, and then I came here. The interesting thing about being in Chicago after so many years&#8212;I had done some work in Uptown in the 60s with the Appalachian community that migrated there. We did arts things, it was wonderful. Now that whole part of town is a different population. It has upgraded and the Appalachian population is not the big focus. Ethnic groups, it all changes. So that was a bit of a revelation.   JF: Did I read that you were in Lithuania for a while?  MG: Yeah. My father was born there, and so I was curious. I thought, &#8220;Hey, somehow.&#8221; I thought, and I found a way to get there. I think it was 1975. Right before that I had met an artist, a sculptor, from Lithuania, and this was when they were still part of the Soviet Union. So then I found a way to go, and it was like right in my back yard in Chicago. This travel agency, they had opened up travel to the Soviet Union in the 50s, they were the first to do it, so I signed up for a trip. So I go and I met my friend the artist and his family and people that they know, and it was amazing. Then I went back again with a group, FOR, Fellowship of Reconciliation, out in Nyack, New York, and we went to visit my friend. I said, &#8220;Hey, maybe I should come here and study.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Oh no, you should teach.&#8221; So then I applied. I wrote something to the embassy, the Soviet embassy, and then something came through and I got to go. It was a resident artist, and I did a documentary about when they reclaimed independence from the Soviet Union in 1992. So I did a documentary. At this point I was getting an MFA and I related some things to it in my installation.  You have got to finish your dissertation! [Laughter] At this point, an MFA, it gave me a way to get out of other things and maybe get a little perspective.   JF: Did you enjoy teaching?  MG: Yes and no. I was sort of teaching there in Lithuania. Because they wanted to hear English in a new way. I brought slides and presentations about projects happening in Appalachia and what we call &#8220;rural.&#8221; This is an America they never knew about, and so that was interesting.  Then I would work with some students and I said, &#8220;Well, could we collaborate on something? Can you do something among yourselves?&#8221; One or two could speak sort of good English, and they would go off in a corner and talk to each other and they came back and they said, &#8220;We are so used to working alone, we think we should do something together. This would be good for us.&#8221; And so they did this powerful installation. It was something they built, and it had milk bottles in it. Part of the performance was to break the ties, and it crashed, and it was just great. I have a tapestry they gave me as a present.   And then I was in Lithuania again, just to visit a good friend&#8212;I was shooting more video&#8212;but I saw that these guys were doing incredibly impressive conceptual stuff and very effective. They were great folks. In the Soviet times, there was a lot of support for artists, but they had to do what was expected, but they could work on the side and do their own thing in different ways. There was brilliant theater in Lithuania. It was very visual, because if it was too verbal, it would be censored. So that was a real exciting thing to experience.   JF: So you were in Lithuania three times, total?  MG: Yes, and then again in1975, and then FOR, and then the residency, and then three other visits. Yeah!  JF: Are there connections between Lithuania and Appalachia?  MG: Well, the people I feel connected to in Lithuania are people that just sort of, they are very, they are not wealthier in any way, but they are just very friendly and very sensitive and philosophical and a great sense of humor, and very welcoming. Welcoming. Good to be with, and sharing things. As an American that visits, it is like, &#8220;Oh, here she is again.&#8221; But they took good care of me. I could stay with people. When I travel, I end up staying with people a lot. In some ways, but sometimes you cannot do that.  JF: So you have traveled a lot and you have worked with&#8212;.  MG: Interesting thing about my good friend--well, I am older, maybe thirteen years older than she is-- but she was never married, either. I was, as a single person who is never married--. But it is [pause] whatever, I found some interesting women who never married or anything but they were a very significant part of society, for what they do and who they are. I thought that was interesting.  JF: In Lithuania?  MG: Mm hm.  JF: What do they do?  MG: Well, Regina is an artist and not always full-time employed, it is real hard. Actually, most of the other women were artists because I kept meeting artists. I don&#8217;t know too much else.   JF: When you say they were a very important part of society, in contrast to, perhaps, what their lives would have been like if they were Americans?  MG: I don&#8217;t know. That is, our latest Supreme Court folks, women, are single women, aren&#8217;t they? Kagan, whatever, is she married?  JF: I think she is married.   MG: Oh really? OK. Well anyways. It is one of those things. That doesn&#8217;t say much.  JF: How was marriage--. What were some of the issues about marriage in the 70s and 80s that women were talking about, or that sort of occupied conversation when women would get together at these community centers or activist networks?  MG: That is hard to look at. I knew some women that were very aggressive about relationships and then I knew some that were not so obviously aggressive, and then some people that just would not, they were not interested, I don&#8217;t know. But that is hard stuff to look at unless you go into family things, each individual&#8217;s family history and their perception of themselves and I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know how to look at that too well.  JF: The poor women that you were working with, the local women that were, like you said, just sort of struggling to keep their head above water and keep their families together, did you find marriage to be much of an option for them? Or was it just something that was just sort of part of life?  MG: I think it was a part of life, yeah.   JF: Did they talk about it at all with you? Or did you&#8212;.  MG: Not with me, and I was not trying to get there. It was just sort of there, without asking a lot of questions.   JF: Did their art express their feelings about their family roles and relationships with men?  MG: Hm. It might have, but I never looked at it in those terms. I can think of people who are good art therapists that would be able to look at that in more detail, but I don&#8217;t know how to do it.   JF: What thoughts&#8212;. I am not sort of asking to analyze, but more just that it was not like an obvious part of&#8212;.  MG: No. That would be an interesting thing to play with. If you were with a group and you said, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s look at blah blah blah,&#8221; family stuff, whatever, that would open things up in some fun ways.   JF: How have your views on women&#8217;s rights and women&#8217;s roles in society changed over time?  MG: I think of it more and I also see aspects of things where the oppressed take on the patterns of the oppressor. I see a lot of women acting like the men that they complain about, in terms of being authoritative and controlling. And then I see women who have always been who they are and just do well and can be compassionate and inclusive and creative and inventive and not get sidetracked by issues that relate to who is male and who is female. [Pause] At one point I thought, &#8220;Oh, I will vote for so-and-so to be mayor just because she is a woman,&#8221; and I would not do that anymore. I spend more time looking at what are the issues and who is doing what. I think women can be as effective in terms of organizing things as men can. And then I have noticed things about women in different traditions, like some religious groups, they can give the party line on religion, and then they know how to manipulate all around it, and I find that somewhat&#8212;. And they can also&#8212;. Well, anyway, it gets very&#8212;. It is a lot of game-playing.   JF: Did you see a lot of that in the community and church groups that you worked with?  MG: I can see that. It is kind of fun, when you think of some church groups that what goes on in the kitchen, it is all women, and they run the show. There are things to consider because of who is available to be anywhere at certain times, given if you are still a young family and the husband, father, is working and the women are free to be more flexible about their time.   JF: Would you have been surprised if somebody would have called you a feminist in 1969?  MG: Would I have been surprised, yeah. I would think, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; No. [Laughter].  JF: What about now?  MG: Yeah, it is OK, sure.   JF: Your life pattern, your life, has sort of taken you here and there and you just sort of rolled with it and enjoyed it. Do you feel that you have had some opportunities as a woman that you might not have had if you had taken a more traditional&#8212;gotten married, started a family&#8212;kind of path?  MG: I guess, yeah. Hm. I don&#8217;t know where what I do, how it comes to me. But I did have my natal chart done, I think astrology is interesting, and it is important to see who you will get without it. But the way I am, in terms of how and where and all that I came from, and changes in the process, it explains a lot. Different patterns. So I guess I cannot see how I might have been any other way given all that.  JF: The education experiences you have had to get your MFA, would you credit that to your decision to become a Glenmary nun? Has that taken you&#8212;  MG: Oh, well when I was in Glenmary, they sent me to school. I majored in art and I got an undergraduate degree, and then I kept doing things as a visual artist. At one point I was just thinking, &#8220;Oh my god, what is going on,&#8221; so I did get into an MFA program. I was working at the same time. That was a way to sort of get out of a rut and look at different patterns, see what was going on. That was when I was in Lithuania, too, so--. I got mugged in Lithuania.  JF: What happened?  MG: Well, I was coming home from shooting video in a big coliseum where all the Jewish groups had come together. This was in times after they had claimed independence; they could not do this before. So I had my video, and I was going home to my friend&#8217;s apartment and just got mugged right there at the doorstep. I got mugged in Knoxville, too. [Laughter] I don&#8217;t recommend it.  But it opens up new experiences. I did an installation at an exhibit here called&#8212;. I used, it was all gloves, old worn-out garden gloves, which was a way to sort of honor a hands-on experience that most people can relate to, and it was a way to sort of allow something participatory to happen in the midst of the gallery situation. So I like that.   JF: What did it look like?  MG: Well it is like thirty-two feet long, with a quote under it that is twenty-two feet long. It is just all these worn-out garden gloves, hundreds of them, that people used and thought it was interesting to send them to me to include in the project. People liked it. And right now it is at Richland&#8217;s Southwest Virginia Community College.   JF: Has there been something that has kept you in the South, in this area of Southern Appalachia?  MG: Well, I like it here and I have good friends. I was sort of testing it out in Chicago, and I love Chicago, but it was a lot to keep up with, friendship networks, and I could not afford it financially.   JF: Do you think that there are particular challenges that women face in the South, especially if they are pushing against traditional gender roles?  MG: I think that is happening everywhere, and I don&#8217;t know how to compare the South with other places.   JF: What do you think are the biggest, in your experience and your perspective on things, what do you think are the biggest challenges that are facing women that do want to challenge traditional gender roles, but not, as you said, become the authoritative or oppressive&#8212;.  MG: I think it is important to be able to speak your own terms and try to honor that in other women and other men, and see where that can help create a better bonding, and how that can transfer to a larger community. I think women maybe have more of an experience of being able to talk out things than&#8212;again, I don&#8217;t know much about it&#8212;but sometimes the relationships between men are pretty restricted, like where can they go to discuss their feelings and work through things. Quite often it seems like women have a way to find those groups and that support and share those things. But to do that with integrity, without putting somebody else down so you can put yourself up, or reinforce control patterns that are oppressive. Women can do that and men can do it.   JF: How can art help people to do this?  MG: I think art is good therapy. Therapy is a good way to be who you are on your own terms. And art also requires discipline, and if you want to do your own art and not do a kit, you have to look into a tunnel that is very dark and think, &#8220;There is light at the end of the tunnel.&#8221; But it is also interesting to be in that sort of close, closeness, of the dark. You have to take a lot of risks. Leap and the net will come.  JF: John was telling me about going to meetings to sing and it was the line between when it was just everybody sitting around singing and talking or when it was people organizing, and doing political activity. That line got so blurry and that made it more powerful and more useful time.  MG: Oh!  JF: Did you find that to be the case, that there was often these sort of overlapping circles of when it was just art for art or when it was politics for politics, and then&#8212;.  MG: Sure, yeah, very overlapping. Yeah. Hm. Yeah. Oh, I wish I was there to listen to John&#8217;s conversation with you.   JF: Well, you will be able to hear it on the SOHP archives.  MG: Sure.  JF: Do you think that that still exists today, or have we lost some of that, the overlapping between art and politics and art and community goals and community development?  MG: That is hard, because so much happens on the Internet. Information technology is offering something and then films are offering something. There are different arenas for community theater and there are different arenas for festivals. Now compared to what it used to be, every weekend you could&#8212;. [Now it&#8217;s], &#8220;Which of the three or ten festivals do you want to go to?&#8221; And it used to be there was one. Then to access different forms of communication about issues you can go online and find a whole bunch of things. So it is very different. Now, things that used to be personal and in your face, they are tourist attractions. The Ralph Stanley Museum is like a tourist attraction.   JF: What is the Ralph Stanley Museum?  MG: Well, Ralph Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys? Big time music, the AP Carter store.  JF: I am sorry, you will have to explain some things to me, what you think I should know.  MG: These are nitty-gritty issues and now it is like something to come and see. It is sort of like eco-tourism, there are so many changes. They are doing tourism for people who can afford to go do something socially relevant in a Third World community or whatever. It is a lot of new venues that I don&#8217;t know if, I was not aware that people were thinking of them, if they were, back in the 60s and 70s.  But it is opening up new options for people that may not have thought of them in such a way and it is a global village now. Issues about Appalachia and coal mining and resources and clean air, hey, I don&#8217;t know how to look at it exactly because it is all overlapping with everything else that is going on. And I&#8212;. [Recorder is turned off, then turned back on].  JF: --generation is out front, or has it sort of faded away&#8212;  MG: So a lot, a little bit and a lot of both, because there is a whole quilting phenomenon that is going on among middle class people and the people that run the shops that sell the fabric for the quilting and all the workshops and the books and all the&#8212;. It is a big business. It did not used to be. There are some places preserving traditions and offering them. I am somewhat familiar with what they do in the Appalachian Studies and the archives at ETSU [East Tennessee University]. Great stuff! They have saved everything, from everything Broadside did, all this Appalshop stuff, the community video projects, early days of the AP Carter Store and everything. It is there and it is being looked at with respect. People have collections of artifacts and are saying more about it.   It is always curious to be with people from outside the region that have not been here, ever, and have not been down a country, twisty road, and they don&#8217;t, they are totally clueless. I took a few people that live here up to the Ralph Stanley Museum and we were going through old coal camps, and they said, &#8220;Oh, do people have second homes here?&#8221; Oh. Because they spent their life in New York and they worked in one office and never done anything else, or else lived somewhere in a very secure situation and did not get off the beaten paths.   JF: Quilting is such a woman-centered project, right?  MG: Yeah, but there are men in the mountains that do it, too.   JF: Yeah? That is interesting, I have never heard of that.   MG: A little remote, but it does happen.   JF: So you do see&#8212;. What kind of difference is there between the women that you were working with in the 70s, local women, you are quilting with them or helping them to sell the quilts they made or to show them, and then what you talk about now, where quilting is sort of a fad now?  MG: There are a lot of quilt shows. It is people who have been to, you know, they have got their MFA and they made a project of it and they go to the meetings every month. They are doing great, brilliant, intense, intricate stuff. It is very impressive. My respect and awareness increases about some women that grew up in mountain communities. They know how to survive, because their families are huge and they have had to struggle and sometimes, they know how to have a good time and they know how to get by and they are brilliant, and they don&#8217;t have MFAs or anything. Some of them do, because they left and then they come back and then they are looking at things with new eyes again. But what it takes to survive in a poor community is a whole lot of skill, a whole lot of smarts.   JF: Is there anything that you thought I would ask that I have not asked yet?  MG: Well not really, yeah. I don&#8217;t know. Yeah.   JF: Is there anything more you would like to add?  MG: Well I think it is, let&#8217;s see, community is an interesting thing. But there are so many different kinds of community. Yeah, I don&#8217;t know what else.   JF: The kind of community, you said there are so many different kinds of community, were there differences between ideas of community and say, the FOCIS women, and the movement people, and the local people?  MG: I think so. Sometimes there are funny little stereotypes or labels that go on people if you are connected with a church. Oh. To some people church is the worst thing in their whole life and they have made a big point of saying no. Once I had a friend who said, &#8220;Hey, church is all about a social thing. It is a social network.&#8221; And there is a lot to that. It is something that happens on a regular basis and it is a good group of people with everything that goes on and all sorts of--. Like any social network. Some groups like that can have a certain kind of value system or direction that relates to some more than others. Like Upworth, it was like church but totally out there on the cutting edges of reform and who cares, you know, somebody has got to deal with this issue. Let&#8217;s see, there are different--. Family structures create some sort of communities. Let&#8217;s see, I think I am getting lost. And at different times in your life you need different kinds of support structures. Some people do not, but a lot of people do.  JF: Where does individualism fit into community, if it does at all?  MG: Well it is really critical to community, to be true to your experience. If community becomes something that is a rigid structure, and you are pushing aside your own individualism in order to fit in, you may have compromised too much. That is a very serious personal responsibility, to be true to yourself and risk. If you have to risk something, hey, that is important.  JF: What kind of barriers were there between communities when you were in Knoxville?  MG: Oh, let&#8217;s see. Well I think the whole Upworth thing was such an alternative that so-called straight people thought, &#8220;Oh dear, look at them.&#8221; But then other people that wanted to experiment a little bit could say, &#8220;Aha, we like that, we will support it, we will go to the festivals, we will throw in a few bucks.&#8221; And then it was mixing different parts of the community that had never been together before, so that offered an opportunity that did not exist anywhere else in Knoxville. We offered quality entertainment that nobody else was doing in terms of Appalachian folk music, brilliant people doing music, and dance and the visual stuff. It set a precedent really. Which relates to a folklore type of value or level. That is always something that might get pushed aside when you think of the fine arts.   JF: Or when you think of politics.  MG: Politics, right.  JF: It sounds like there was this moment in Knoxville. It sounds really special.  MG: Oh yeah. Really. We ought to have a big reunion. Reunions are fun.  JF: Were you at all involved with Carpetbag Theater?  MG: Not really. I knew they were doing things. I don&#8217;t know. Sometimes they would perform at Upworth, but not really. They were pretty much, I don&#8217;t know, they did their thing. Maybe I was gone by the time they were really getting off the ground.   JF: Was there a strong racial barrier between communities in Knoxville?  MG: I am sure, but somehow I did not know how to--. I was not sure what I was doing in relationship to that.   JF: Were most of the folks who were hanging out at Upworth or getting involved in it, was that a broad spectrum of black, white, Hispanic?  MG: Yeah. Not so much--. It is more Hispanic now, I am sure, but not back then.   JF: But African Americans--.  MG: It was more like poor whites and middle class whites and not too many African Americans, just because of the nature of the neighborhood, so minimal--. And then the UT [University of Tennessee] population, I don&#8217;t know.   JF: So the city almost geographically kept barriers up?  MG: I think so, yes. That has probably changed. Someone like Annette Anderson could speak to that better because they were always aware of what neighborhoods could use what kind of help and be open to it.   JF: Would you like to maybe leave us with one last story or a thought on those years in Knoxville when Upworth was that center for so many people? Maybe you could say something on how you feel, what are contributes to that kind of community-building, where it is the right kind of community, it is not too rigid that people cannot be themselves but it is not too loose that people do not feel they are part of something?  MG: I think that sounds real good. You said it.  JF: Oh no! [Laughter].  MG: You said it. That is good. That is alright, you did well. Took the words right out of my mouth.   JF: Well, what role does art in your mind play in that that cannot be replaced by something else?  MG: Oh, well just the whole story. I don&#8217;t have any more to say.   JF: Well thank you very much for your time.  MG: OK. Great, this is interesting.  JF: I would love to talk with you again, too.  MG: Yeah, good luck.   JF: Thank you.  MG: Hey, wish I was going with you to Knoxville [laughter].
