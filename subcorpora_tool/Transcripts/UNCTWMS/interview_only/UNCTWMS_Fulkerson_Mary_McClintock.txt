SARAH PEDERSON: This is Sarah Pederson with the Southern Oral History Program interviewing Reverend Doctor Mary McClintock Fulkerson professor of theology at Duke Divinity School. It is Thursday June 26th around one p.m., and we are sitting in her office at the divinity school. We are going to be talking about Mary&#8217;s life experiences and work as they relate to her commitment to social justice and theology and practice. So Mary, first off thank you for sharing your story with us.   MARY FULKERSON:  Glad to.   SP:  Is it all right if I address you as Mary?  MF:  Sure.   SP:  Great. So to start can you tell us more about yourself, your family and where you&#8217;re from?  MF:  I was born in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1950, turbulent time back then in Arkansas. But as a child of an all white family, Presbyterian, very &#8220;religious&#8221;, I was part of a typical white middle-upper middle class culture in Arkansas. I grew up oblivious to issues, a lot of issues, particularly race, but also gender issues, but thought of myself as growing up in a happy family. I was the oldest of four kids. Both my parents had grown up in the little tiny town called    Marianna, Arkansas. So we would typically go there a lot to see grandparents and stuff. So what more in that trajectory?  SP:   Right, so maybe you could speak a little more what it was like growing up in Little Rock community during such turbulent times in history. Do you have any particular memories of the civil rights movement or school integration?  MF:  Well, I don&#8217;t, and we moved just a few years after I was born, and we moved to Texas. So later on I found out about all that had been happening in Little Rock and the protests and the horrible stories of protecting and fighting off integration. And I, this is sort of ironic, not really funny. But I was like, &#8220;Oh phew, we weren&#8217;t.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t literally there when those protests happened in Little Rock, Arkansas. But my awareness of those kind of issues was very late in coming. And I would simply say I grew up thinking--, I grew up happy, privileged, lots of close family ties with extended family. We lived in Dallas when Kennedy was shot there. Before that we lived in San Antonio. My father worked for JC Penney Company and he kept getting promotions, and every time he got a promotion we would move. So Mom was the wonderful stay at home, unpaid labor. I don&#8217;t like to call it stay at home mom. These were really unpaid laborers and raised the four of us. We had to change schools a lot because of all of our moving, and that was a little struggle. But I just don&#8217;t really have any other striking memories of my youth. We ended up moving to North Carolina when I was just entering high school, and that was a little bit difficult because of the anxieties that come with being a teenager. [Coughs]   And so there&#8217;s not a lot that I remember if anything about being aware of the public sphere. I mean I really have to say I pretty much was not aware of what was going on in the larger, explicitly political domains. We always went to a white Presbyterian church, and I suppose that suggests a kind of --and now as a theologian I can be very critical of this-- but that suggests a moderate piety. It wasn&#8217;t evangelical or fundamentalist or very conservative. But it was certainly not addressing, at least that I was aware, that Christianity or Christian faith has to do with social justice. Or if it was said from the pulpit, it just went over my head. And then when I decided to go to college, I ended up going to Salem College. Do you want me to continue on with that kind of thing?  SP:  Sure, actually I wanted to just stay briefly--  MF:  Oh with the family.  SP:  Kind of this--  MF:  Culture.  SP:  Yeah with the family understanding maybe the role of faith in your family. But going a little bit backwards to what you were saying before about not feeling very politicized in any sense when you were growing up, I was wondering when did you first understand racial identities and begin to think about your white racial identity? Did that come much later?  MF:  Um hmm. Yeah, I suppose. I would&#8217;ve been sort of typical of the white Protestant notion that yes, there are certain things that are wrong. And I would&#8217;ve, if you pressed me, probably said racism is a malicious individual act against persons of color. But that was not something that, as I said, got discussed in the circles that I was in. So my awareness was very gradual. I think probably only when intellectually I went into&#8212;I mean as a Christian and a person who then became ordained as a Presbyterian minister, I was certainly in the abstract against injustice, against racism and sexism and so forth. But in terms of the experiential, that really didn&#8217;t start, that didn&#8217;t become a part of my deeply existential awareness until I was a grownup and probably, I would have to admit, in a teaching job when I started coming up against some of these realities. I do remember stories about how my grandfather did some, what was it called? It would sound like just &#8220;helping the poor&#8221; kind of things. Teaching the little kids and including African Americans I think, but I only heard about that much later. I don&#8217;t seem to have been aware of it.   SP:  So issues of social justice were not really discussed in your family.  MF:  Well, in so far as they were, they didn&#8217;t stick in my brain. I mean I can&#8217;t help but think that the way I was shaped made me open to caring about those who are &#8220;oppressed.&#8221; But we didn&#8217;t have political discussions that I became aware of. I think it was just a kind of generosity associated with being Christian that would inevitably invite a more specific focus. So if you&#8217;re Christian, Jesus, God loves you. God loves everyone. You&#8217;re supposed to love your neighbor as yourself. That kind of ethos and shaping would have a part in shaping me to become interested in particular forms of injustice but it just wasn&#8217;t specified in the language and specifics of those injustices that I remember. So I mean I don&#8217;t want to act like my childhood was completely bad or selfish. It&#8217;s just that I think it shaped me to be Christian in a particular way that needed to be advanced later on. I mean when I was in college, I went through this experience which wasn&#8217;t great, but I became a part of this evangelical group. This was at UNC-Chapel Hill. I became part of the Campus Crusade for Christ which is really--, okay so you&#8217;re aware of that.   SP:  Oh yes.   MF:  But I never liked the little job of going around and sharing the four spiritual laws with people, just randomly. They would do that on campus. So I would go with someone and I can still remember knocking on somebody&#8217;s door when she was getting ready to go out on a date. This was on a Friday night. And the person I was following was going to share the four spiritual laws with her. And I was standing there thinking, &#8220;God, I'd much rather be going out on a date. Dammit.&#8221; So I ended up getting out of Campus Crusade for Christ and then later ended up becoming quite a critic of it. Anyway.  SP:  Interesting. I'd love to hear more about that when we move into the education section.  MF:  Oh okay.  SP:  So when you were growing up, going back to that, what did you imagine you&#8217;d be when you grew up? Were you encouraged to go into certain occupations over others?  MF:  Not really. My memory&#8217;s pretty bad, okay. But I grew up in a standard white, middle-upper-middle class, what I would now call patriarchal arrangement. And my mother, as I said, was an unpaid laborer. She stayed at home taking care of the kids, and she did all sorts of volunteer work. Oh that&#8217;s another thing I forgot. She did incredible amount of volunteer work through the church, and giving food out, the kind of things that a lot of churches do, and predominantly women in many of these kinds of congregations are doing that. They&#8217;ll have a soup kitchen or a food pantry every week or so and people from, the homeless people et cetera can come by and Mom did that a lot. So I was exposed to that, but I don&#8217;t remember, I certainly never saw a woman minister. And I didn&#8217;t have on my brain that women---, I certainly didn&#8217;t have a feminist lens at all. So I didn&#8217;t think that much about this other than, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll just get married and live happily ever after.&#8221;   So I was lucky when I was about to graduate from UNC Chapel Hill. I had been a music major, music performance major. So that&#8217;s another thing that took up a lot of my time. When I was, before I went to college, I was a pianist and spent hours every day practicing. So one of the positive things about our family too was you had to work hard. You had to study hard. Now they didn&#8217;t have this idea that I would then go on and be some professional anything, but it was embedded in me that I had to practice at least two hours a day on the piano. So I majored in piano performance, was about to graduate and was like, &#8220;Oh wait. I&#8217;m not going to be a concert pianist. And I certainly don&#8217;t want to go around and teach kids how to play the piano. Boring. What the hell am I going to do?&#8221; And the guy I was dating then, anyway long story, but he was afraid I was going to pressure him to marry or something like that and his mother told him that if he wasn&#8217;t going to marry me, it was important that I know that.   SP:  Oh.  MF:  So he broke up with me, and that&#8217;s when I had the wonderful opportunity to decide I needed to come up with something to do. And so I decided to go to seminary.   SP:  Awesome.  MF:  It was so--, we laugh about that now. We&#8217;ve been married for forty-one years.  MF:  Yes, we got back together.   SP:  The same guy.  MF:  We got back together after I came up with a vocation and a plan. See, he was a year behind me.  SP:  Oh wow. Wow, that&#8217;s a very interesting trajectory of how you got (         ). And I&#8217;m glad that you did eventually arrive there. So I wanted, I know I keep taking you back to your childhood, but I wanted to know a little bit more about the roles that were modeled for you in the church and how that--, what did the effect of seeing your mother volunteering all the time have on you? What did you see men doing in your church? People of different ages?  MF:  Well, pretty much what we think of now as stereotyped kinds of behaviors. I mean the men tended to be the elders in the Presbyterian Church. As I said I never saw a female minister. My mother was, as I said, she was part of this group called Presbyterian Women, and she was always involved with that. And it had, here&#8217;s one of the effects it had on me. When I finally got my Ph.D. and got a job teaching in a divinity school, one of my first books&#8212;I guess it would be my first book&#8212;was I wanted to look at, I wanted to write a feminist book, but I wanted to write it on women that typically get ignored by feminist theologians. And because what I wanted to push is the idea that there are all forms, there are all sorts of forms of agency. And we can&#8217;t be feminists and just have one model for what it means to be an agent and sort of pooh-pooh women who do what look like just traditional domestic kinds of things. So I wanted to look at women in different social locations and ask, not to simply bless the patriarchal structures in those locations, but to at least recognize and foreground the way women can creatively use the traditions in their context to enhance their agency. I said I&#8217;m not going to be arguing that they&#8217;re really feminist because they won&#8217;t, I will typically look at women who wouldn&#8217;t want to be called feminists.   So I wrote about three different groups of women. One was Presbyterian Women. That was because of my mother. I wanted to respect that kind of agency and give it a little more recognition. Well, I don&#8217;t remember seeing any recognition granted to that kind of group in feminist theology. I could be wrong now and out of date. But so I did a study of that entity. It&#8217;s a long standing Presbyterian group, and other denominations typically have women&#8217;s groups too. United Methodist Women is an analogous group that women, and this I think started in the late nineteenth century, minimally? But anyway, so I wrote, after doing some research on Presbyterian women as a national entity in the Presbyterian Church. I focused on the ways in which they were using images of the home and the domestic to enhance, as I said to enhance their agency and their impact. And it went from sort of explicit, caring for these kinds of things but more in terms of, in addition to ways in which they could push back against men&#8217;s groups in particular situations which when the men&#8217;s groups were trying to either incorporate them, or control them more. And I remember--, this has been a while since I've read that book. But they even used that kind of language. The domestic language to go global with their work. So the home is everywhere. It&#8217;s across the globe, the domestic. So I mean they literally were using those images but expanding them in much more radical ways than you would typically think of.   So then I did a study of Appalachian women, and I went looking for a group and consulting with some people and luckily stumbled on some literature that actually was a bunch of interviews with Pentecostal women, now, who were located in Appalachia. This was really lucky because I had a whole selection of interviews, but also these were women--and this was more true earlier in the twentieth century. Pentecostal women used their faith, which institutionally is a very patriarchal denomination, and used the appeal to the Holy Spirit, which is what is characteristic of Pentecostal. You know anything about Pentecostalism?  SP:  Vaguely.   MF:  Well, okay. I can&#8217;t get nuanced on this because I&#8217;m not a scholar of it, but and there are various versions of it but it has to do with&#8212;like one version of it is speaking in tongues, glossolalia. Okay. And I didn&#8217;t study that although I did go up into Appalachia and went to some services and witnessed some people falling out and speaking in tongues. It was really unusual for me. What an experience. But the appeal to the Holy Spirit gave the women a way to argue for their freedom. So these women were traveling all over the United States. Again this was more prevalent early in the twentieth century. It got more constrained later in the twentieth century. Men would say, &#8220;No, women can&#8217;t do this. And women can&#8217;t speak or teach men,&#8221; and these women would say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not me. It&#8217;s not I that am speaking or teaching or preaching. It is the Holy Spirit in me. I&#8217;m serious.   SP:  Wow.  MF:  Many of these women said just that. So my, I have a chapter in the book the same. Hell, this is&#8212;I didn&#8217;t say hell, but this is agency. This is using your tradition to enhance your agency.   And then my third context or group of women was feminist theology and how it was a critique of the patriarchal structures, behaviors, also the images, the God the Father image and all that stuff. A very different way to enhance women&#8217;s agency. But obviously important. That was a long answer to what question.  SP:  Yes, I think we were talking about models&#8212;  MF:  Oh models.  SP:  You saw in the church growing up.  MF:  Yeah, right, right.   SP:  But that was very interesting and I wondered I heard in there you said the agency was more constrained as we approached the twentieth century, twenty-first century. What did you mean by that?  MF:  No, no. Are you talking about for the Pentecostals?  SP:  Yes.  MF:  Oh, oh. I just read some of the literature that showed that this freedom to go across the country--see they would travel like in twos and preach on a street. They would do street preaching. And that got more constrained as it moved into the twentieth century or mid-twentieth century.  SP:  For women.  MF:  For women, yeah. Less&#8212;  SP:  What do you think was driving that?  MF:  I have no idea. I mean, it could&#8217;ve been as they became more middle class. I mean my vague memory is that it had to do with a rise in class. And so probably that would be &#8212;this was a guess. This was connected with proper behavior. A good middle class woman stays home and takes care of her kids. She doesn&#8217;t go out and preach in the street and travel across the country. That&#8217;s a guess.  SP:  Interesting. Well, relating back to your perspectives being shaped by the church. What messages did you get about, if any, race or sexual orientation or these very other identities growing up in the church? Did you get any messages?  MF:  I don&#8217;t remember getting any. If there ever were any, although sexuality gets talked about in churches very rarely. Okay. There have been studies showing that. It doesn&#8217;t get talked enough about. It doesn&#8217;t get talked about enough in divinity schools, in seminaries. If anything if I ever heard about so called gay--as they used to call it--ness is that it was a sin. But I may not have heard about it. That would&#8217;ve been the only thing I could&#8217;ve. But I don&#8217;t remember race&#8212;  SP:  No conversation.  MF:  I don&#8217;t remember it. I mean maybe later in my, I&#8217;m just trying to think. Yeah, I don&#8217;t remember any specifics.   SP:  What about messages about feminism when you were growing up?  MF:  Uh uh.  SP:  Nothing.  MF:  Not that stuck with me. [laughs]  SP:  So on that note, when do you think was your first participation in the women&#8217;s movement?  MF:  I went to Vanderbilt to get a Ph.D., and Vanderbilt&#8212;I went to divinity school here. I did not get involved in it. It was really just off my screen although about the time I was a student here is when the women&#8217;s center started. And it was just off my screen. I wasn&#8217;t involved. There was one woman faculty here then, one. And I don&#8217;t think I took a course with her.   SP:  Wow.  MF:  So I get to Vanderbilt. It&#8217;s more&#8212;oh Vanderbilt was a very different place than here, very liberation oriented, liberal liberationist. And I got exposed to a whole new way of thinking about theology and Christian faith. It was a mindblower. I still didn&#8217;t get really into the gender issues. But I was exposed to that literature more and more. So when I came, when I got offered my first job which was here, I think I had&#8212;it&#8217;s embarrassing to say your consciousness really doesn&#8217;t get raised for that long a time. But I admitted this before. While I'd been exposed to feminist, probably not queer theology at Vandy. I don&#8217;t remember that. But some, more expanded liberationist kind of thinking, it didn&#8217;t really get into my soul until I had actual experiences that made me feel stereotyped, diminished, whatever, more explicitly. So when I came here in 1983, I hadn&#8217;t written my dissertation. I mean, that was sort of crazy too because to get a job means you have to start creating classes and your going to write a dissertation on the sideline? Yeah, that was not easy. But, and I tell this just to laugh as a joke. But when I came here I knew there were no women on the faculty when I came here because that first woman had left. And I thought oh that will be fun.  SP:  Oh no.  MF:  I really like guys. Well, I was wrong. I was wrong. And I had some experiences here that really altered my feelings, imagination, intellectual interest et cetera, et cetera.  SP:  Tell me more about that. That sounds very interesting.   MF:  Well, one really good thing was that Jean O&#8217;Barr became head&#8212;I don&#8217;t remember the specific year&#8212;but she became head of women&#8217;s studies and connected up with women faculty and it was a life giver. It was so wonderful. Liz Clark was in the religion department. It was just wonderful to connect up and have that sort of resource for support where you could go tell your stories and share and complain. I had a very unusual experience here that&#8212;do you want me to tell you about?  SP:  Yeah. Yes. Yes, if you&#8217;re comfortable.  MF:  Well, it got a little publication. It was my five minutes of fame. It was written up in the News and Observer and another, I think another local newspaper wrote it up and a national academic journal, not a journal but some newsletter of some sort. Because when I came up for tenure which would&#8217;ve been in [19]94, and I was very nervous and scared and I had this one book, Changing the Subject, which is the book I was talking about. I found out from a student that a colleague had sent out, put together a manuscript to send out to try to get people to stop my tenure. And let&#8217;s see, I found this&#8212;  SP:  Oh my God.  MF:  I had it right here in my old stuff. But it was a professor I had actually taken Old Testament with when I was a divinity student here. And he sent out this pile of stuff supposedly showing that I was not doing a good job, and I was harming divinity students because--. And basically the complaints boiled down to I was teaching feminist theology, and I was pro-homosexuality. What would the third one have been? Maybe there wasn&#8217;t a third. But those two were the problems with my work and why they should not give me tenure. So that was somewhat of a surprise. And as I said it did get written up in the news because what he had done is shared some information. Well, some of it just wasn&#8217;t true. Like he supposedly said that I had had goddess worship around a tree outside. [laughing]  SP:  Well, that sounds fun.  MF:  If only. No, I had not done that. But anyway, he got given some sort of early retirement deal because he&#8217;d revealed confidential information. And I was never told what that was because, and they also couldn&#8217;t speak publicly about what was going on because they didn&#8217;t want it to affect my tenure. So I just huddled down.   SP:  Oh my God.   MF:  Fortunately I got tenure.  SP:  Wow.  MF:  But he&#8217;s gone. He&#8217;s been gone ever since 1994. So&#8212;  SP:  Did he retire?  MF:  Early retirement, he took so called early retirement. I have never known. I was never told what the actual deal was. But I haven&#8217;t clapped eyes on him ever since. And he got a couple of my colleagues to sign the document. But they&#8217;re retired too. So agreeing that&#8212;  SP:  And you&#8217;re still here.  MF:  And I&#8217;m still here. Who would&#8217;ve thought, still teaching feminist theology and being pro-gay.  SP:  Wow, well I was going to ask you a question about if you&#8217;d ever experienced any discrimination or obstacles at work? but I guess that--  MF:  Well, the Independent did an article, and that&#8217;s why I've got this framed picture up here because the cover was this is, you can see &#8220;A Cross to Bear: Mary McClintock Fulkerson and women at Duke Divinity School&#8221;, just talking about the incident and unhappy sort of ethos.  SP:  So is the media coverage of it in general reactions were they more on your side&#8212;  MF:  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh definitely.  SP:  So this was like one kind of&#8212;  MF:  Oh it was wonderful. There was even a protest out in front of the chapel.   SP:  Oh wonderful.  MF:  A bunch of students and people.  SP:  That&#8217;s comforting to hear there was support.  MF:  Oh absolutely. Absolutely.   SP:  Wow.  MF:  As I said, my five minutes of fame. So--  SP:  So would you say that the environment, your working environment was somewhat of a boys club, men&#8217;s club?  MF:  Yeah, it was inevitable because it was&#8212;well, by then we had another woman faculty who was awesome. Teresa Berger, she&#8217;s now at Yale Divinity School. She was wonderful and became a feminist, and she was tenured but&#8212;yeah, it was predominantly male. So that can be a boy&#8217;s club even if they&#8217;re well meaning because certainly most of them supported me.   SP:  Um hmm. And could you tell me a little bit more about your ordination in the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. When did that happen?  MF:  Oh boy. I can&#8217;t remember if it was, hmm, it was in the mid-seventies. I got ordained in an unusual way. They don&#8217;t really do this anymore. I got ordained &#8220;for further study&#8221;. And that&#8217;s when I was going on to get  Ph.D. So that&#8217;s not a typical Presbyterian. Typically you need a calling in a specific site be it obviously a congregation or some kind of a chaplaincy or and so forth. So I&#8217;m not even sure that happens anymore, but I got ordained for further study. And there were really no, there was really no struggle there. I remember when I transferred my membership. That was in North Carolina. And then when I transferred my membership to Vanderbilt because I was getting my Ph.D. at Vanderbilt. And I was already ordained, and I was just having it transferred. And there was actually a friend of mine who had been serving a church for a number of years who was also transferring her membership because she was going to be in the Ph.D. program at Vanderbilt too. So we were coming up before the Presbytery to be examined for transfer. And they split us apart. Then there was a real pushback against me, a little bit of a pushback against her. But originally it was over my beliefs and things like that. It was just a conservative church at that point, a group of churches who ended up&#8212;and I ended up getting accepted. But this group of churches ended up pulling out of the Presbyterian church later on. So and then I&#8217;m trying to remember where. I was at some Presbyterian meeting somewhere and a guy was outside&#8212;I don&#8217;t know whether it was when I, I don&#8217;t remember when it was. But there was a guy outside with a protest sign against women&#8217;s ordination. But I was laughing because it was too late. I&#8217;m already ordained. But no huge deals.   SP:  And what drew you to academia instead of working within a church environment?  MF:  I thought I would probably go into a church when I left divinity school. It was complicated, but my husband is a physician, and he, we were both here in Durham, and he had gone to UNC medical school. So he was, when you get an internship, you match and you don&#8217;t get a choice. So he matched at Vanderbilt. So we didn&#8217;t have a choice. The options in different places that I decided, it&#8217;s easier, this may sound odd now, but I thought it&#8217;s easier to just go to grad school because the process of getting a church position anyway--. And I thought I&#8217;ll go to grad school and then I&#8217;ll serve a church. But grad school didn&#8217;t really shape you toward ministry. It shapes you toward doing more so called academic kind of thinking. So that&#8217;s what happened.  SP:  Well, do you ever wish that you could go back and do it differently and go into--?  MF:  Nope, no. It&#8217;s really important to me to be connected with projects. I could not be happy if all I did was teach classes and try to write books. I really have to be connected with projects. So the Pauli Murray project [has] been a life giver.   SP:  So maybe you could speak a little bit more about how you met your partner, when you met your partner in at UNC I&#8217;m assuming, and how did you come to marry him and--?  MF:  How did I come to marry him? [laughs] I guess we thought we were in love. Yeah, I went to Union Seminary the year after I graduated. He had one more year, and then he was going to medical school. And then I dropped out and we got married and I thought, I would rather be with him, and there wasn&#8217;t a--. And then I got a job as a secretary, and that was boring. So I decided I&#8217;m going to go back and ended up coming to Duke because he was at UNC. So it&#8217;s worked fine. I mean we&#8217;re in really different worlds, and in many respects that&#8217;s a positive thing.   SP:  Did you feel that he really supported your independence and pursuing your career goals?  MF:  Oh sure. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.  SP:  And what was the decision to have children like?  MF:  I guess I was shaped as a traditional mom. [laughing]  SP:  Did you want to have kids?  MF:  Yeah. Yeah. Was it planned? Yeah.   SP:  And how did that affect your life? Did it affect&#8212;?  MF:  Well it happened when I had finished classes at Vandy, and I thought okay, I can have a kid once I&#8217;m out of class. Well, that was sort of dumb because taking your exams, passing your Ph.D. exams and then writing a dissertation, yeah, you could stay home to do that, but it&#8217;s not like your baby is going to sleep all the time. So I had wonderful friends who would come and keep Hopie, our first child and because she hardly slept at all. It just took a while and that&#8217;s why when I got the job at Duke, I hadn&#8217;t finished, I had just barely started my dissertation. It took quite a while. So but Bill&#8217;s mother was around, and she kept the kids while I was writing, trying to finish my dissertation and stuff. I mean it was just family support. I mean Bill being a physician and doing internship then and as I said residency and on and on, his schedule was really not conducive to dad being home to do dad care.   SP:  Do you think that your time at Vanderbilt when you were really immersed in feminist theology, do you think that had any affect on your parenting style?  MF:  No, probably not. I mean at the abstract level I could be very critical of our arrangement, but I've gone along with it. I mean our arrangement being that his work et cetera, et cetera has him gone so much, and he&#8217;ll confess now that he wasn&#8217;t at home with his kids enough and stuff like that. I don&#8217;t know what I would&#8217;ve done if I had taken a more&#8212;I just I didn&#8217;t.  SP:  I&#8217;m kind of switching back into thinking about your work more, do you feel that you infused feminist values into your work?  MF:  I hope I do. Yeah. One of the things that really had been off my screen, although it&#8217;s not that I wasn&#8217;t aware of it, it&#8217;s just that I hadn&#8217;t made it a real focus was enough was womanist thinking and mujerista and so forth. So the challenge of the unclaimed whiteness that&#8217;s now attributed to most feminist theology continues to complicate the way the topics are taught and understood and written about. So I didn&#8217;t address race in my first book. So it&#8217;s a shame. The intersections is what I&#8217;m talking about that become more important as time goes on. My next project probably did not do adequate justice to the intersection, but it did begin to look at race in ways that I had not before. So remind me of your question again?  SP:  It was how do you think you infused feminist values into your work?  MF:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, it also, one of the things feminist theology et cetera needs to generate more successfully is to recognize the marked and unmarked character of different versions of theology or different versions of history or different versions of any real topic. Why is there, and by unmarked I mean what gets called history or what gets called church history or theology with no descriptor, and then you add, you have to add something like &#8220;feminist&#8217; to theology or &#8220;black&#8221; to theology. Well, that implies that the people discussed in theology are normal and don&#8217;t need an adjective like &#8220;white&#8221; theology or &#8220;male&#8221; theology or &#8220;male&#8221; history. So that, in other words feminist thinking sort of expands issues that may not sound just feminist. So that&#8217;s still an ongoing challenge to try to get students to not think of this as simply a marked subject matter that&#8217;s perspectival, et cetera and it&#8217;s only about certain people. No, it&#8217;s about everybody. And just because it&#8217;s called black or feminist or womanist doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t about everybody because it matters to males how gender is defined just as it matters to females and race et cetera, et cetera.  SP:  So going off of that, do you feel that your vision of theology or understanding of theology is maybe at times at odds with the dominant idea of what normal theology is supposed to be?  MF:  Well, it&#8217;s a hard question to answer because it depends on who you&#8217;re talking about. And I think it depends on who you ask. There&#8217;s still versions of theology that are most interested in doctrine and systematics. I mean I would say whatever my field is, quote unquote, I've moved in a way that is hard to locate me because I started doing ethnography for my second book project and that ended up--. But I called it theological and that ended up opening up to a lot of people and groups like at the American Academy of Religion and other national religious, study of religion groups to what is now often called practical theology. So it&#8217;s hard to give one straight answer to your question. Some, I think and hope more people trained as theologians are actually starting to explore ethnographic work and what it would mean to shape the theological through those kinds of explorations. And I have a colleague in our theology and ethics division who&#8217;s also doing and done a lot of ethnography and wants to think of that as theological. So I am hoping that will have more effect over the ages. That&#8217;s not going to probably substitute for what gets called doctrine and systematics. But my interest is through feminist issues and attention to actual different contexts, I mean one of the features of liberation and feminist and black theology is all theology is contextual. It emerges out of a context and the perspectives of those who think that way. So not to see race is shaped by who&#8217;s writing it and their context. It&#8217;s never simplistic, but given that there&#8217;s been a long going, ongoing tradition of liberation theology that has always insisted social context has everything to do with what kind of theological work is done. Then that almost becomes common sense or should be.  SP:  Interesting and going back to the ethnography, what drew you to ethnographic style work and do you feel you gained certain insights about the church, about women, about leadership in doing these interviews with, quote unquote, church women?  MF:  Yeah. Well, I didn&#8217;t do ethnography for that. I just happened to get a bunch of interviews that were made available to me that had been done by somebody else. These were recorded interviews. I got interested in ethnography because in my first book I had used a lot of culture theory, and I had been really impacted by the lit crit department here at Duke where some of the real groundbreakers in culture theory and literature were doing work. Like Jan [Janice] Radway had done, who was in Women&#8217;s Studies too, had done this wonderful work looking at romance novels from a feminist perspective, but she was using culture theory that again made the push that you have to take seriously the creative ways different groups can use culture to enhance their agency. In fact that I forgot to mention someone like Jan Radway but that influenced why I was paying attention to Presbyterian women. So that culture theory shaped a lot of what I did in that book. And Raymond Williams is this famous British culture theorist who had shaped a lot of the work at Duke and shaped what I was thinking.   Okay, somebody who had read my book who was a cultural anthropologist actually somebody I went to church with read my book and really liked it and she said, &#8220;You know you really ought to do ethnography. You really ought to do participant observation because you get a much thicker sense of a community if you do that kind of work.&#8221; So on her suggestion I took a course in ethnography, and then did a two and a half year participant observation shtick in a multi-racial church because I wanted to write about a community where something important was going on. And multi-racial churches, significantly multi-racial churches are very rare in Protestantism. So I did two and a half years participant observation, interviewing but also the participating and the observing and so forth. And that generated another book. And that really had significance for me as a way to challenge certain kind of categories that count as theological and push for more, some broader categories like using some of the, I guess they&#8217;re sociologists, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel de Certeau and their notions of bodily habituations. That kind of knowledge is operative, and you can&#8217;t simply think about faith as displayed in the form of belief or cognitive kinds of practices. So the interactions that I observed were not always congruent with the beliefs claimed by people in a decisively, I mean intentionally interracial church. So that sort of opened up a whole set of ideas for me to pursue.  SP:  Yeah, could you maybe get the more specific example or a story of anything in particular that stood out to you (           )?  MF:  Yeah, this is one I use all the time. This was a church that started out very small. It was a very shrunken white church. The white minister decided to try to make it a diverse church. So he started off this community. There were some African Americans and white people, and it started to grow. I couldn&#8217;t tell you exactly the numbers, and this is the story he told me before I came. He had to be out of town one Sunday and he invited an African friend to come and preach in his place. And so the African friend came and some of the African preacher&#8217;s friends came too. So there were more black people in the congregation than usual. And the people, some of the white people in the church when the white minister came back complained to him that the church was getting &#8220;too black.&#8221; And they ended up leaving the church. Now they may have been leaving for other reasons. But that was just one example. I mean, here you have supposedly we intend to be diverse. But if there are too many bodies of color in the room, then we feel uncomfortable, and that&#8217;s not the only incident like that where, I mean I've read some literature on how even multi-racial churches, whites can sometimes stay in power, and there&#8217;s a discomfort with the feeling that we are not the majority in control.   So that was one of the events that triggered for me the need for more categories than simply talking about what people believe and what they do. I wanted another category for this pre-conscious, what am I&#8212;what makes me feel comfortable. And that disclosed for me all sorts of things about my own racial habituation. I mean I talk in the book about when I first entered the church. When I went there the first time, I was all excited thinking I&#8217;m this liberal, welcoming, feminist, justice oriented theologian, and the first Sunday I went there happened to be more African American people there than there were whites, and I had never been in a room where I was the minority. And it&#8217;s not like I felt like &#8220;ick, ew, I've got to get out of here.&#8221; But I was very aware in a sort of affective way of my white skin and feeling, I don&#8217;t even know what to call it, all right. But that clued me in especially later as I did more participant observation and started seeing the way other people act like the story I told you. I began to be aware of these, the pre-reflective habituations that we can have even if we&#8217;re well meaning good people. And there&#8217;s been a recent book that came out called Good White People &#8212;I know that&#8217;s not it&#8212;  and it talks about the disconnect between white good intentions and some actual behavior and practices.   SP:  Well, do you find and&#8212;  MF:  And I think that also connects up to gender, okay, because there&#8217;s still people who do not feel comfortable with a female body in the pulpit or doing the communion, serving communion and so forth. So&#8212;  SP:  And do you find in your work that you often engage with maybe perhaps more privileged groups within the church and tried to help them to become more aware of their obliviousness to this privilege and this comfort that they take for granted. Do you ever find yourself engaging with either perhaps male leaders in the church or white leaders in the church to get them to kind of&#8212;?  MF:  I don&#8217;t really have that opportunity very often. I mean I've spoken at Pilgrim UCC, but that&#8217;s a very liberal, about this topic. But that&#8217;s a really liberal church, and it is an inclusive church even though it&#8217;s still predominantly white. I mean it&#8217;s a good question. I don&#8217;t know how open people would be to hearing their normal habituations challenged. And I haven&#8217;t gotten that kind of, that really kind of invite very much. So--  SP:  Well, maybe have you ever had an experience where your theology clashed with someone else&#8217;s beliefs in a church setting or in the university setting? And how did you handle that situation?  MF:  Hmm. Clashed with like whose beliefs?   SP:  Anyone in a church environment or perhaps in the divinity school.  MF:  Oh yeah in the divinity school. I&#8217;ll respond to that in two ways. I've been going okay, once I did that, just one observation for two and a half years, they folded that church because it shrunk into a predominantly African American church, and I kept going to that church and have gone to that church although it&#8217;s now been conjoined with another interracial church. So it&#8217;s name has changed a couple of times. But I've been going to a predominantly African American or at least multi-racial church for the past say seventeen years or so. And one of the things that keeps me going there for very specific reasons, because I don&#8217;t want to just be a tourist, is that we had a Pauli Murray reading group in that church. And it&#8217;s been awesome. It&#8217;s really been wonderful because of the honesty that has happened in that reading group. And Leoneda Inge who&#8217;s an NPR journalist, African American and I have co-lead this reading group for five years. So in fact we&#8217;re supposed to meet this coming Sunday.   So when I think of disagreements in that church&#8212;because some of the people who are still in that church were in that original, but only a couple were in that original church I wrote the book about because all the white people left. I can&#8217;t think of disagreements. But that may have been, I don&#8217;t know how to answer that. My primary participation has been worship and taught a Sunday school class for a number of weeks on the images of God and then this reading group. But I can&#8217;t think of real disagreements.  SP:  And is this a PCUSA church?  MF:  No, it&#8217;s Methodist. [laughing]  SP:  No. Oh wow.   MF:  I mean I don&#8217;t want to go to church just to be with a bunch of people like me. But&#8212;  SP:  Interesting.  MF:  And I&#8217;m also not, by saying how significant the Pauli Murray reading group is, that could happen in any church where you, even if you go every Sunday and you&#8217;re with people who aren&#8217;t like you. That&#8217;s not necessarily going to open up anything new. But this reading group has made it possible, as I said, to have honest conversations about our family histories. I've had to talk about growing up with this white obliviousness and so forth. So, anyway, that to me really makes a difference. Now the other, let&#8217;s see what was the other thing I was going to talk about&#8212;oh disagreements.  SP:  In the divinity school.  MF:  In the divinity school. I've got some great colleagues. But over the years there have been some real disagreements over the LGBTQ issues. I&#8217;m the faculty sponsor of our student advocacy group. It&#8217;s called Sacred Worth because the Methodist church calls LGBTQ folks of sacred worth. That&#8217;s where that name came, but it won&#8217;t ordain them or, but anyway. So yes, some of my colleagues and I are in very different places on that.  SP:  And perhaps you could speak more about your involvement with Sacred Worth and how you understand advocating for LGBTQ inclusion and acceptance in the church as part of your ministry.  MF:  Well, I've written some on it. Not that everybody&#8217;s going to run out and read little journal articles or anything. How do I understand myself advocating for it? Well, one thing that I've done I guess for about three or four years, I started teaching a course actually with Sam Wells who used to be of course the minister of the chapel, Duke Chapel. We started a course called Sexuality&#8212;the Bible, Church and Controversy. And I would say even though it wasn&#8217;t in the title it was basically an advocacy course around LGBTQ issues. But it was coming at that, so it&#8217;s not dealing with sexuality per se, but it&#8217;s at least, it's value I think--. And then the next year, then of course Sam left, and Willie Jennings who&#8217;s one of my colleagues who is an African American theologian, fabulous guy, and we started teaching it together. So we taught it together at least two years. And this past spring I had to teach it without Willie, which was a real loss because he was overworked in terms of all the extra work he&#8217;s had to do around some other organizations here in the Div school, but I want to teach it&#8212;I want it to be taught every year. Now we bring in people who are specialists on scripture. So we&#8217;ll have a session on Old Testament, on New Testament, on the history of sexuality in the church and all sorts of topics that are relevant. And the value of it is to shape students so they see the much broader more accurate ways in which sexuality has been defined, is biblical or not, et cetera, et cetera and the blindnesses and the unjust ways in which this issue has been both defined and addressed.   The focus on finding texts to authorize exclusion is intellectually extremely problematic not to mention whether those texts actually are about what we&#8217;re talking about today. And the selectivity in which those arguments are made. I&#8217;m going to use the Bible to solve this so called ethical problem, but I&#8217;m going to ignore what the Bible says about stoning to death adulterers, and there&#8217;s all sorts of stuff in the Bible that we don&#8217;t want to do anymore and it gets ignored. So I mean Jesus was single for god&#8217;s sakes. Why aren&#8217;t we supposed to follow Jesus in that? Why are there certain things we don&#8217;t follow about Jesus and yet and the claim that heterosexual marriage and nuclear families is the tradition is simply bullshit. It&#8217;s not true. I mean are there a lot of people who qualify for that. That doesn&#8217;t make it wrong, but it doesn&#8217;t authorize it as the only thing that&#8217;s right. So anyway, I [hope] that [the] course is very helpful, and in terms of advocacy I&#8217;m on the university task force on this topic and have been for quite a long time. Occasionally try to bring in a speaker on the topic, and I guess in terms of advocacy I&#8217;m not out on the street all the time or anything like that, but I hope this is making some kind of small difference.   SP:  Do you see it making a difference in any students&#8217; lives who come to the divinity school?  MF:  Well, I've had students tell me how important the class was, and I think that makes sense given how little this is addressed at least my assumption is. As I said I read a study saying that a lot of divinity schools don&#8217;t address sexuality in general, and from everything I've heard from all the students who&#8217;ve taken the course who&#8217;ve spoken up, they tend to just get taught that it&#8217;s bad and it&#8217;s a sin, period. And a lot of denominations don&#8217;t ordain. They typically don&#8217;t know enough to make what I would call intelligent morally appropriate judgments about this. So I mean fortunately my denomination has just approved ordination. We still haven&#8217;t okayed the marriage thing yet, but it&#8217;s hopefully going to happen.  SP:  Are you talking about PCUSA?  MF:  Yeah.  SP:  Okay. I believe the general assembly just passed a&#8212;  MF:  Yes, yes. Supposedly but it has to be approved at other levels.  SP:  Ah I see. Well, on that note where do you think the church stands right now on the inclusion of LGBTQ people?  MF:  The church, what is the church?  SP:  The Presbyterian Church USA.  MF:  Well, that&#8217;s really hard to answer because I haven&#8217;t done stats or studies of any sort. From what I read the younger generation, your generation has grown up with less prejudice. Do you think, has that been your observance?  SP:  That&#8217;s been my experience.  MF:  Okay. Good, good, good. Did you grow up in a church?  SP:  I grew up in PCUSA.  MF:  Yeah, yeah. What did you get taught there if anything?  SP:  Well, I was definitely not taught that identifying as LGBTQ was okay. But it wasn&#8217;t really, sexuality wasn&#8217;t really discussed, and I wouldn&#8217;t consider myself to belong to a very progressively minded Presbyterian church.  MF:  So it sounds sort of familiar&#8212;  SP:  Right.  MF:  To what I observed or know about, it is just not talked about much.  SP:  No, discussion of race. Nothing was politicized, gender nothing. Well, I guess what I&#8217;m wondering is have you found any effective strategies in pushing the discourse past this very heteronormative dogma that marks the Christian tradition?  MF:  I've had a few students in the class, and I don&#8217;t know how many because nobody in the class begins the class by telling us what they really think. They&#8217;re obviously open, but a number of students have said that they came in there on the fence, and they&#8217;ve really, this has really opened up a new way for them to think about it. So I like to hope that&#8217;s true for as many as possible. I know I&#8217;m only aware of one student who was pissed by the course because he said so, and I didn&#8217;t realize that for a while. But he was gay. And he was out, but he thought it was a sin. And oddly after he graduated and then was at Emory for something, I forget what, he came back here and he happened to wander by my office and he stuck his head in to thank me so much for the course because he had eventually changed his mind and accepted himself as loved by God for being LGBTQ. And he was so grateful. He said it just hadn&#8217;t immediately happened during the course. It took some other experience at Emory but, I teared up when he told me that because that was just so wonderful to hear even the one person who we thought we&#8217;d actually got as I said gotten pissed, had altered eventually his attitude and his own self-esteem. So I&#8217;m glad.   So I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re quick changes. I don&#8217;t know, I can&#8217;t ascribe causal force to anything particular, but I don&#8217;t think, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. Something is being challenged if you push back about use of biblical passages, but I&#8217;m not sure what all is being challenged or what is still, I mean I&#8217;m going on and on and sort of blathering here because I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s a deeply seated, affective prejudice that&#8217;s operative like the white aversiveness to blackness. It couldn&#8217;t be the same thing, but are there, I don&#8217;t know. So what changes that? Experience with people who are different from you. I don&#8217;t know, maybe so. So it&#8217;s a huge question. I mean I grew up with what I thought was a wonderful family. My dad had one sibling, a brother, a younger brother who became a physician and turns out he was gay. But it wasn&#8217;t okay to be gay in that family. So I didn&#8217;t know about it for years. Oh I shouldn&#8217;t laugh. So he had his own separate life down in Florida with his partner, and only later when my sister and I were grown ups did we find out. Sad.   SP:  I think that leads into maybe a discussion of your book, Places of Redemption because you&#8217;re dealing with a lot of issues of what you call social brokenness. I think what we&#8217;ve been speaking about is touching on a lot of different issues where you see social brokenness in our world. And I was wondering what you think the role of religious leaders what the role is for religious leaders and healing social brokenness or raising consciousness.   MF:  Well, it depends of course on the kind of calling that you have. I mean some people, I mean I was talking with a colleague whose Ph.D. is in pastoral care today. When you get trained in pastoral care and you become a minister, you have gifts in terms of meeting with people and helping people when they&#8217;ve got issues of depression or advising people when they&#8217;re having personal troubles, not that you would be the one and only resource for people who might need a therapist or whatever. But there&#8217;s that kind of pastoral care, and one of the really important things, ways that needs to happen more and more is that ministers be trained to deal with domestic violence and domestic abuse because that&#8217;s been really underreported, and there&#8217;s lots of literature on that. Now I don&#8217;t have those skills, but I&#8217;m just suggesting there are different kinds of skills.   I think obviously one, and this comes from my academic focus, attention to images and symbols that are used can be helpful. I find the dominance of language for God that is male is really not disclosive for me, and there are lots of theologies that employ broader images. There are other images in the Bible besides God as omnipotent, big white guy in the sky somewhere. So images can help alter the imagination, and it would be more helpful if that comes from your minister rather than some little weirdo academic theologian [laughing] who happens to go to the church. But broadening out, I did the Sunday school class that I taught at this current church I go to was on images of God, and people were really interested in that. But that can gradually help alter your imagination.   Let&#8217;s see. I mean, there are all sorts of things people can do. People can be invocative, wonderful preachers, open up reality in a new way. As I said, bringing people together across boundaries in churches would be as our Pauli Murray reading group has illustrated to me would be really profound. I mean every church has versions of activism, but sometimes it&#8217;s like one or two people that are doing it. I would love to see more, of course this can happen in adult Sunday school classes. So I&#8217;m sort of not addressing all the possibilities, but to get people together with people who&#8217;ve had very different kinds of experience as well as people who have struggles that are similar to your own. Obviously that can be, but sometimes people who are very different, like racially different have had struggles like yours too. So ask the question again.  SP:  Wow. I think it was&#8212;we&#8217;ve kind of gone off on a tangent.  MF:  What can&#8212;?  SP:  How do you see religious leaders as agents of social healing?  MF:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And involvement in local organizations, can get you connected up with people in different class and social locations. So let&#8217;s see. Okay I've been involved in this group for a long time and I&#8217;m blanking on the name. [pause] If you&#8217;ll ask me another question, I&#8217;ll probably think of that one.   SP:  Well, maybe what has your activism or advocacy looked like in a more national focus within the PCUSA. I know you&#8217;ve been involved in the National Advocacy for Women taskforce.  MF:  Yeah. And that organization has not been given the task of actually doing activism. So my only contribution there has been to give talks about issues around gender and race and issues like that. So that&#8217;s been, we&#8217;ll see if that&#8217;s going to expand any. I've really not done that much nationally. I&#8217;ll be glad to if invited, but I can&#8217;t think of any other real examples.   SP:  Well, what about more locally. Have you been engaged?   MF:  Can you stop it? [Break in recording] Really. Gosh.  SP:  So the question or my question is how have you been involved or engaged in local organizations or social justice initiatives?  MF:  Back in [19]95 somebody in the community church person contacted us at the Div school about, and we were trying to figure out how could the Div school get students more involved in doing community stuff other than being volunteers at soup kitchens and stuff like that. So I went to one of my colleagues to ask him--oh somebody had contacted me, I contacted a colleague to talk about and I found out about IAF, Industrial Areas Foundation, which was started ages ago in Chicago. And it was about grassroots organizing. And so they have expanded, and it&#8217;s predominantly church based. It&#8217;s not a religious organization. It&#8217;s just that you can&#8217;t be a member unless you&#8217;re an organization. So predominantly groups that belong have predominantly been churches over the--. And of course it can include Muslim communities or Jewish communities. It&#8217;s not Christian at all. It&#8217;s just that those are the groups that have predominantly made up IAF organizations.   So we brought this guy here to talk to us about IAF and what it does, and it really sounded exciting. So a few of us kept trying to go somewhere with this. And it involved getting people to commit their community. And the way it operates is that once you have significant membership of different groups, the groups all meet alone to decide on what do they think the issues, local issues that need to be addressed CAN should take on. And then all the members, all the representatives from each community get together, and there&#8217;s a vote on which issues are we all going to take up together. And what&#8217;s significant about it is that it&#8217;s based on turnout. So you can get lots of people behind a particular proposal and take it to local dudes in the Durham organizations or&#8212;(         ). But the people who could have power to make changes, you have these group meetings where every member of this organization is called to turn out as many people as possible to stand behind a proposal. So local senators or representatives, you want certain things passed by the senate et cetera. And that we finally got going.   Now I ended up going to Vanderbilt to teach like in the early part, [20]01 or something like that. I was offered a position there and because it&#8217;s such a liberal progressive place I was really thrilled. And I went there and taught for about a year and a half. My husband ended up getting a promotion here, and he couldn&#8217;t find a job at Vandy or in the town that he really wanted. So I ended up coming back. But I missed the birthing of Durham CAN. I was here on a weekend, and I went to the big turnout gathering where we celebrated. But I wasn&#8217;t literally there when we actually pulled it off except to celebrate it. And then I came back and I was involved in the primary organizing committee for a few years. But then I rotated off, and I've been, we&#8217;ve got some people, a few people at the church I go to that are, that tend to represent it. I must confess that I haven&#8217;t been as involved as I was before I got involved in the Pauli Murray project. But that was probably my first, as I started out our conversation, it&#8217;s crucial for me to have some kind of connection in the community. And that served that purpose for a while, and now I think it&#8217;s more the Pauli Murray project. So I will go for turnout to these events, but I haven&#8217;t been part of say a specific work group that&#8217;s focused on doing the research behind a particular issue.  SP:  And maybe you could speak a little bit more about how you first got involved in the Pauli Murray project.  MF:  Okay, well, oddly I got contacted by Barbara Lau and we had lunch together and she wanted to tell me about the project and asked me if I'd be interested in joining. And I just assumed that she must know I'd written that book on an interracial church. Why else would she think that I was&#8212;but she didn&#8217;t know that I'd written on interracial issues. So I think she must&#8217;ve just asked who would be a liberal feminist at the Div school that might--. I guess she probably wanted somebody who was involved in religious stuff. That&#8217;s my guess. But&#8212;  SP:  Did you know who Pauli Murray was before you got&#8212;?  MF:  No, no.   SP:  Wow.  MF:  But it was awesome. It was just wonderful timing with where my interests were developing. So it was a real privilege and thrill to get involved. I mean finding out about her life and, was fabulous and fascinating.   SP:  Do you think that learning more about Pauli Murray affected the way you approached community engagement or organizing or your own academic work?  MF:  Well, if anything is going to be affected by anything it tends to be more my academic work. It was another very significant indicator of how versions of reality need to be constantly revisited to ask how the context that created that lens so that these things became important gets surfaced, so they don&#8217;t get reified. Do you see what I&#8217;m saying?   SP:  Um hmm.  MF:  Views of reality get reified and we can forget and they become normative and authoritative so that we forget that, no, they were contextual. And they may continue to be crucial and important, but we can&#8217;t idolize them or reify them such that they become the norm and we don&#8217;t remember that they came out of particular kinds of wounds or responses to particular wounds. And the wounds may have been altered since then and we need to look at other wounds. I mean that&#8217;s just one image that I'd used for what generates discernment especially if you think, if you think at least the way I do theologically attention to what needs to be addressed emerges out of discernment and caring about particular wounds that have not been addressed.  SP:  And kind of on that note, well, Murray talked a lot about facing our truths and reconciling ourselves with our past. How do you think the church is doing with that in terms of wrestling with wounds and remembering history?  MF:  Well, again the church is too broad. I can&#8217;t speak for the church. I&#8212;  SP:  Who do you feel you could speak for in that sense, maybe the South, maybe--?  MF:  Well, I've written, I&#8217;m writing a book now on white colorblindness as racism in Protestant, particularly Presbyterian churches. And I&#8217;m co-writing it with another white woman who&#8217;s done a lot of work on this issue. And we are, that&#8217;s a tricky ground to navigate because we don&#8217;t want to be generalizing in a way that would piss people off. And yet we&#8217;ve noticed as we&#8217;ve grown up in Presbyterian white churches certain kind of habits that we&#8217;re describing that are well meaning but don&#8217;t necessarily address the issues that we want to raise around race. And so I thought of that when you were asking for generalizations because we are offering descriptions of habits such as how white Eucharist is practiced that some people might say well, that&#8217;s a stereotype. It doesn&#8217;t always look like that because what we&#8217;re drawing attention to is the disconnect between the radical claims that come with that ritual. Welcoming the outsider as Jesus did, all people are welcome at the table, a table of hospitality, but then you end up, you&#8217;re sharing little snippets of bread. Sometimes it&#8217;s not bread and a little dip of grape juice in the connotations of radical, so our description makes it sound very subdued, controlled. And that contrasts with the so-called biblical narrative of the radical welcomeness, radical welcome that is enacted by Jesus&#8217; last supper. So I would use that as an example. But that&#8217;s trying to generate an awareness of a kind of obliviousness that&#8217;s nice. It&#8217;s not your&#8217;e being mean or unjust or anything. It&#8217;s just that you&#8217;re part of a world that sort of reproduces itself. How can we do better to address and become aware of different forms of brokenness? It&#8217;s the awareness that can generate, and I would love for that to happen even more by and as church rather than simply consider it as an outside thing that we then go on and do later on. I mean that&#8217;s ethics or outside ministry. Why not consider [that] we have a story of one, we have a story of Sara Miles, who had created regular meals for homeless people. And she had joined an Episcopal church, this white woman, because she was so attracted to the idea of the Eucharist. She had been an atheist before that. And she had done all this work with homeless people at a shelter and stuff. And so she came up with this idea that they should create these welcoming lunches, meals with homeless people and do it on Sunday as communion. Church said, &#8220;Nope.&#8221; No. The ritual and doing that, no. Not going to&#8212;  SP:  Separate.  MF:  Separate things. So anyway, I can&#8217;t generalize and say all churches would do that in a million years. There are probably churches that would love, but there need to be more. So that&#8217;s the only example I can think of.   SP:  That&#8217;s a good example.  MF:  I mean I'd love for there to be more ways that we address the LGBTQ stuff and stereotypes about that and have classes and churches where we read literature and this broader spectrum of literature on that so people won&#8217;t continue to simply be shaped by what they were taught the Bible stories. Because the Bible my experience has been has so much so called clout in these kind of, this kind of thinking. Now I&#8217;m not dissing the Bible. I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m simply talking about recognition of the hermeneutical assumptions and narratives that we inevitably bring and must bring to get a way to read and frame what is compelling and calls us that we find in scripture. Does that last comment make sense&#8212;?  SP:  Yes.  MF:  Because typically people think you&#8217;re being unbiblical if you&#8217;re talking about a way to identifying how you&#8217;re unifying scripture or narrating it so that you can make choices between what and order those. So anyway, but I'd love to see more attention to that.   SP:  And do you think that that vision for a community of faith not a general but a community of faith, do you think that that&#8217;s in line with Pauli Murray&#8217;s vision of justice?  MF:  Well, she certainly was still faithful, and it was just fascinating how by the end of her life she became even more, given what she&#8217;d been through. That was a real testimony to the narrative of what I would call radical generosity, radical openness for redemption. I mean redemption can mean a million different things. So I don&#8217;t want to use it loosely to refer to every version. I mean the way it shaped her life so constructively, that was really compelling. So anyway, I don&#8217;t think I responded to your specific question. What?  SP:  Yeah, the kind of vision for a community of faith that you just described, do you feel that that aligns with&#8212;  MF:  Oh I would hope that yeah, the honesty part would really be significant. I mean she would definitely be for that. I mean she clearly was about telling the truth. So that&#8217;s one of the reasons our reading groups, back when they first started the idea, we had these handouts that anybody--. I mean it wasn&#8217;t just in churches that you could do a reading group. But we would not just read her material. It wasn&#8217;t even designed to be just about getting together to read Pauli Murray or about her. We had a set of questions that we began with that included telling your own family history and how does it compare to Pauli Murray&#8217;s family history. I think she would&#8217;ve loved that. So that&#8217;s what was key for me to thinking about the constructive function of this idea of reading. It&#8217;s not just about oh isn&#8217;t this interesting. Oh isn&#8217;t this historically fascinating. It&#8217;s about how does this life and our lives intertwine and what does this life mean for our lives. So definitely she would be happy about that.  SP:  Wonderful.  MF:  And having more public discussions too. I mean the fact that we&#8217;ve had these wonderful public discussions is clearly a strategy she would&#8217;ve affirmed. I mean we&#8217;ve had public discussion on race, on LGBTQ issues and her own story and so forth. So--  SP:   Right. Well, is there, I'd just like to offer an opportunity to you to add anything that you feel might be missing from this narrative or if you want to return to a prior topic. If there&#8217;s any lingering&#8212;  MF:  There&#8217;s this great, I&#8217;ll just add to what I just said, there&#8217;s this great phrase used by a theologian Johan Baptist Metz. It&#8217;s called dangerous memory. Now he&#8217;s a theologian. So he&#8217;s Christian theologian, but he used the phrase dangerous memory to talk about how in fact theological tradition but even remembering Jesus is supposed to function as a dangerous memory. I've said this to Barbara Lau before. What dangerous memory means is it&#8217;s using those stories to open up the brokenness of the present and attend to and address them. So you can&#8217;t just remember Jesus to be reading the Bible or reading stories about Jesus. It&#8217;s about that as a lens through which you become more aware of social injustice and how to address it. So that&#8217;s a broadly applicable phrase. It doesn&#8217;t have to just refer to Jesus. Remembering Pauli Murray should function and has been functioning as a dangerous memory in that constructive sense. So that&#8217;s the only thing I'd add.  SP:  That&#8217;s a great thing to add. Well, thank you so much for doing this today.  MF:  Sure. It&#8217;s great y&#8217;all are doing this.  SP:  Yeah.
