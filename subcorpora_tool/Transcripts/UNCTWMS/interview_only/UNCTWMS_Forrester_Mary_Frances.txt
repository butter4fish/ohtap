Evan Faulkenbury: All right, today is September 18, 2014. My name is Evan Faulkenbury with the Southern Oral History Program and I&#8217;m interviewing Mary Frances Forrester in Raleigh, North Carolina. So, to begin, I was hoping you would tell me a bit about your childhood and where you grew up.
Mary Frances Forrester: I was born and raised in Wilmington, North Carolina, the third of a brother and a sister. Our family lived there until I went away to school. I had a normal childhood, very much of a tomboy. I played football, climbed pine trees, and did all the things that tomboys do until my mother told me that I couldn&#8217;t do that anymore. I was a young lady and I had to behave like one, and that was hard for me, but when I made the transition I became very feminine. So I loved all the feminine things, the pinks and the frills, so it was a transition for me.         I graduated from New Hanover High School, which was the only school in the county at that time, a large school. Was in the arts; decided that I wanted to be in the theater. I had studied dance and I wanted to be a prima ballerina so I was looking for a school that would afford me that, and my parents insisted that I have a college education, not in a conservatory but a university level, so that I could experience college. I went to Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana, loved it.         At the same time my high school sweetheart was a young man named Jim Forrester who came to America through Ellis Island. His father had been a professional golfer, and he came over here. [His father] died at a very young age, thirty-three, with appendicitis, probably an abscess from appendicitis. He was the professional golfer for the king of Belgium at Brussels when he died. His mother brought my high school sweetheart and his sister to this country to visit. They got caught in the war and had to stay here. She said that she had taken the children down to the wharf to go back to Scotland and something said to her, &#8220;Do not put those children on this ship.&#8221; So, she came back. She was visiting her sister, and then all Scotsmen went to sea so her sister&#8217;s husband was a port captain there in Wilmington, Delaware. She said, &#8220;Peg, I can&#8217;t put the children on the ship. Something tells me not to go now,&#8221; and that ship was torpedoed.         So she stayed here during the war, she went back to Scotland, they came through Ellis Island, and they came to Wilmington, North Carolina, because at that time you had to have a sponsor, and that&#8217;s where I met Jim. He was not that much older than me but three years ahead of me in school, which baffled me, because here I was a freshman and he was a senior and I couldn&#8217;t figure out how you could be a senior in high school and not have your driver&#8217;s license. But we dated through high school and through college, even though I was in Indiana and he was at Wake Forest.         He decided to go to medical school during his sophomore year. I was in Indiana and he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s time to come back to North Carolina.&#8221; I had loved my art, I loved Butler, I loved what I was doing, but I also found that I wanted to live in the real world. It didn&#8217;t take too many bus tours, studying by flashlight, going to a town and doing a performance and getting on the bus and going to the next town and doing a performance, that, as much as I loved the arts, I wasn&#8217;t sure that I didn&#8217;t want to live in the day world.
EF: Well, if I can, I want to definitely come back to that part of your life but I wonder if I could rewind a little bit and have you describe a little bit about your relationship with your parents and with your family growing up.
MFF: My father was a salesman and then he worked with the railroad. My mother was a nurse. My father was from South Carolina with very established roots, and that goes back to the DAR and the Colonial Dames; I do that. In fact it was recently that I found out that I go all the way back to Dolly Madison and that was an exciting time, to find that connection. My father was very much of a Southern Democrat that South Carolina would be well known for. My mother was a nurse. She was from North Carolina, born in Pitt County, and she became a nurse because in her generation you had the opportunity to become a teacher or a nurse. She was very much a Republican. My father was a Democrat, so we didn&#8217;t have too much. We children stayed out of the way during the election process because you didn&#8217;t want to get them started. But they probably canceled each other&#8217;s vote most of the time. But it was a big day for my mother to take me to register to vote, and I think she probably instilled that history of the privilege of living in this country, the privilege of having that opportunity, and then it was. You took your birth certificate, you went somewhere and registered, and it was a big deal, and then you went out and celebrated because you were old enough to vote.
EF: What was it like growing up in a home where your father was a Democrat and your mother was a Republican?
MFF: It didn&#8217;t matter except during elections. My father did travel until he had a heart attack and they had told him at the time he probably did not have very long to live. Medicine has changed so much now to then. They almost made him an invalid. He cleaned up his affairs, he got everything ready, he came home, he retired from traveling, and, lo and behold, he lived another twenty years. He did work for the railroad, probably was the last telegraph operator, or one of the last, before we went to electronic communications between the train. I mean he did the Morse code, and I would stand as a child--. In fact my sister and I were talking about when my father would babysit, or childcare, [and] would take us to the depot wherever he was working, so I grew up a lot around train stations. I would stand there and watch my father&#8217;s pants flap in the wind. He had a long cane with a big hoop and you put the records, or whatever you needed to give to the engineer and the conductor, and you held it there, and that train was flying by, and they grabbed that from that hoop &#8211; I&#8217;m sure it had a name that I don&#8217;t know &#8211; and I would be so afraid of that as I would see my father standing there, tall &#8211; he was six-foot-four &#8211; holding those orders up for the engineer, and that train flying by, and the wind flapping, and the noise. It was a very poignant memory for me. But I loved going with him and I loved being around trains, so I&#8217;ve always loved trains. I don&#8217;t want to live near them but I like to travel on them.
EF: Right.
MFF: And I did, I always rode trains because we were allowed a certain number of passages on the train. My parents both worked. Of course once my father became a semi-invalid at home my mother cared for him. She would work at night as a private duty nurse and then she would come home and sleep in the daytime when we were at school. So my mother was a product of after World War II when women were then working. My husband&#8217;s mother, who was here during the war as an alien, became almost a Rosie Riveter. She was an electrician, because the only way she could work as an alien then was in the war effort, so she worked in the shipyard in Wilmington, Delaware and was an electrician until she returned to Scotland after the war.         So times were changing in that women were not only allowed to work, they were bringing home those dual incomes, and that was an important part of family life, particularly after the war, and the recovery from still the Depression. And then my father was not as active working because he had retired from his other job, which had no retirement as we know today.
EF: Sure.
MFF: There weren&#8217;t retirement plans. He did have railroad retirement and that was what allowed me to go to school and to still use those train passages until I was twenty-one, and that allowed me to go to a school out of state because that was also on the line.        EF: Right.        MFF: I made sure that any school I chose had to be available by train.         EF: Sure.        MFF: So we all went to college. It was very important for our family. It wasn&#8217;t, did we want to go further education; it was: where do you want to go and how are you going to go? We knew that we would go somewhere.         EF: I want to ask about that. You may have said at the very beginning and I may have missed it, but did you say what your birthday was?        MFF: My birthday is in October, and&#8211;. You want my age? Is that included in there?         EF: Just the year. Is that okay?         MFF: Sure. Well, my age is about the only thing I lie about. I don&#8217;t really go out there and broadcast, though I&#8217;m not ashamed of my age, but I am a young seventy-six, or almost, so&#8211;        EF: Sure. Well, congratulations.        MFF: &#8211;my year was 1938.        EF: Okay.        MFF: But I think that has a lot to do with the physical. I was always very active. I think that&#8217;s one of the issues that we look at today in family health, is that we played outside, I was very active, and certainly you would call ballet an athletic endeavor, if you&#8217;ve ever seen any of the work they do.        EF: Physically impressive.        MFF: And I continued that, and after I could no longer do that I played tennis. Now I swim and do other things. So that has made a difference, and I started to school late. One of the reasons that Jim was older than me in school years was because my birthday was late.        EF: This was in Wilmington?        MFF: This was in Wilmington, and of course Jim started to school at five years old, so when he came over here they didn&#8217;t know what grade to put him in and they moved him up because still that European education was more strict than we had here.        EF: Right. Well, growing up in Wilmington and in the county there, what were your general impressions of growing up in Wilmington?        MFF: I lived outside of town. We were considered rural. Our pasture, since during the war, we had&#8211;. Every home had a cow. We had cows, or one cow, Kate. We raised a lot of our own food. It was rural. I went to a grammar school, middle school there. We didn&#8217;t call them middle schools. You were grammar school. I was probably in the first class of junior highs. I helped to [raise the food]. We raised chickens in the backyard. I wasn&#8217;t living on a farm but I was rural. It was during and after the war and we did produce a lot of our own food, just by necessity.        EF: Sure.        MFF: I took our family back Christmas before last and we all went to the beach and stayed for a week, all eighteen of us in the same house, and we still liked each other when we left.        EF: That&#8217;s good.        MFF: And took them on the trolley to show them where I grew up, because my house is now a fraternity house and our pasture is part of UNCW.        EF: Wow.        MFF: So geography changed.        EF: Yes.        MFF: It was like you couldn&#8217;t believe, and I remember my mother sending me down to tell my father when World War II ended, to run all the way down, tell my father the war was over, and I thought it was such a long run. I thought I was running a marathon. One day as an adult, when I decided to go and see how far it was to the pond, we called it &#8211; where we played growing up and made rafts and probably wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to do today &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t that far at all.        EF: It felt longer, I guess.        MFF: It felt longer as a child, and particularly if it was dusk and I had to go down and feed the animals and I wanted to hurry and get home before dark. But it was a wonderful childhood. We were middle class but not exceptionally so, probably in the lower&#8211;. We had plenty to eat. We didn&#8217;t realize anything we were missing. We had a good home life. It was those values that were established then. We went to church.        EF: What was your denomination?        MFF: Baptist, good Southern Baptist. I mean that&#8217;s most of what you are in the South Bible Belt. The Baptist was the strongest, most members, probably of all the denominations during that time. The Presbyterian church was right across the street, and the Methodist church was right there. I remember as a child helping my mother. My first time that I was mentored to help others was babysitting children and helping them as they would get the polio vaccine, because, you see, we had polio epidemics, and as the vaccine became available it was the house right across from our church, where you&#8211;. They met on the porch and it was the health department or some form of public health was administering those polio shots, so that&#8217;s when my mother said, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to come and you&#8217;re going to help us with the children,&#8221; and I did that. There was always a feeling of giving to others and sharing what you had, helping out in the community. My mother gave lots of vitamin shots and whatever. People would come by. Certainly a lot of that was because she was a nurse and she felt that need to serve others, and as a private duty nurse she nursed very sick people.         EF: Well, you&#8217;ve told me a little bit about your high school education and your high school sweetheart, who you married, and I wonder if you could also talk about, jumping off from there, how did you end up at Butler University?        MFF: Well, because I wanted to be in the arts, and I was looking for a school that offered dance in a university atmosphere because that&#8217;s what my parents insisted upon. I went to the library in the [College Blue Book] and was looking for somewhere. I had the choice of Texas Christian University, Butler University&#8211;. Gosh, there was one in Virginia. I decided [on Butler] and actually went there sight unseen. I didn&#8217;t go. I took the test. We didn&#8217;t call them SAT tests, but an entrance exam that was monitored, and I decided. And of course it had to be available on the railroad. It had to have a railroad station so I could use the train. I looked at the curriculum and I thought, &#8220;You know, I think I can do this,&#8221; and I was going away from home for the first time by myself but have always been a little bit adventurous and willing to try new things and I thought, &#8220;This is for me. I&#8217;m going to go and do it,&#8221; and I loved it.         I loved the school, I loved the art, but when Jim was in medical school and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s time to come back to North Carolina,&#8221; because he was getting ready to go into a two-year, no vacation. I was getting ready to sign a contract for the Indiana Restaurant Association as one of their representatives, because I&#8217;d worked on the side. I worked with Eli Lilly; I poured medicine by the teaspoon from a medicine bottle. I did a lot of photography modeling to help supplement my schooling, because I had to help myself. My father died while I was away at Butler and to stay there I knew I had to do something.        EF: Right.        MFF: So there was an opportunity there because Indianapolis had the Indianapolis 500, we had Eli Lilly; there were opportunities to do those types of things, so I did.        EF: And you mentioned you did some modeling work, and on your r&#233;sum&#233; I saw you had listed that as well, so can you talk about how you got into it and what things you did?        MFF: All right. Well I probably started because I had an aunt that had said, &#8220;You know, there are scholarships available.&#8221; She was the one that encouraged me to enter the Southern beauty queen phase. And I did, I got scholarships. Wilmington always had the Azalea Festival. That&#8217;s still a big thing today, it&#8217;s been there for a long time, so that&#8217;s probably where I started, and realizing that that was perhaps a way to supplement my income so that I could go to school where I wanted to go. That&#8217;s really where I got that beginning, with those scholarships. I thought, okay. Then when I got to Butler and I found that my Southern accent was an asset rather than a liability. I took a lot of teasing but I also did voiceovers in commercials using a Southern accent. For years I tried to get rid of it. My speech professors would, &#8220;You&#8217;re never going to go into theater if you don&#8217;t get rid of your Southern accent,&#8221; and then I&#8217;d come home for two weeks and it was a lost cause. I found out that I could use it in a positive way, that there were people willing to pay, so I did commercials for cars, I did dry cleaning commercials, I did those voiceovers with some little Southern flair in there, inference that would explain the accent. I did that, and it grew so that I did that type of outside work as a freelancer, and took my earnings and kept them in the safe at the dean&#8217;s office and hopefully would have enough for the next semester&#8217;s tuition. The nice thing about going to school in the 1960s was that you could pay along as you were in school. Today I think it&#8217;s pretty much up front. I don&#8217;t think they allow you to pay as you go.         EF: Probably not.        MFF: Probably not. I knew I had certain quotas to meet, and I did that. So, it was actually not only a necessary thing; I just used the talents that I had.         EF: Right. Well, I know that you&#8217;ve become very involved in politics and I&#8217;m interested in trying to trace the root of your politics and your conservatism, so were you involved politically at Butler, and if not where did you begin your activism?        MFF: That&#8217;s a good story. No, I&#8217;ve always felt&#8211;. I would never not vote, or not be an informed voter. I was taught to do that, to appreciate that as a privilege and not just an option. So, when Jim and I were married he had three careers. He was a physician. He was in the Air Force; he retired as a brigadier general flight surgeon. Along the way there someone had asked him would he consent to be a county commissioner, run for it, and at the time we had small children. I was a stay-at-home mom. I did teach dancing in Winston-Salem. I was on the ground floor with the North Carolina School of the Arts. We raised a million dollars in twenty-four hours to put that school at the Graylyn High School, and I would have been happy to stay there forever.         So, I taught, and I would say to him, &#8220;How are we going to do this? We have children. They need two parents. You&#8217;re a physician, you&#8217;re in the Guard,&#8221; and his motives were so pure. He said, &#8220;You know this country has given me so much and that&#8217;s the way I can give back.&#8221; He ran, and he won, and he stayed there for eight years. Then he ran for the North Carolina Senate, and that was as our last child was at NC State, and he said, &#8220;You know, you stayed home with the kids and now I want you with me,&#8221; so I did. I traveled with him. He was in the senate for twenty years. I used to tell him he was definitely a ten. There was no question this man was not a visionary. He knew how to make decisions, he knew how to assess the problems, the only thing that really bothered him was that the political process was so slow, but he appreciated it and I&#8217;d say, &#8220;You are definitely a ten but, darling, you have to remember, I&#8217;m your one through nine,&#8221; and I really was, and I don&#8217;t mean that to be pious. I mean that I helped him write his speeches. Remember that right brain&#8217;s still clicking over here. So, I did all of those things for him. I don&#8217;t know that I carried the title of campaign manager but I was. The thing that I really became active was &#8211; and CWA [Concerned Women for America], if you have any knowledge of the history, is the largest women&#8217;s public policy organization in the nation. We have over five hundred thousand members. Jim was very interested in the marriage amendment when Hawaii first began talking about marriage, allowing marriage, and it was not&#8211;. I don&#8217;t even like the word homophobic. There was never a question of disliking homosexuals. He always said, &#8220;I love them more because I treat them in the office and I understand the problems that they go through,&#8221; but redefining the institution of marriage did not sit well with [him]. He said, &#8220;The family has been the stalwart of civilization for five thousand years,&#8221; and he wanted to keep that. You can have any living arrangement in this country you want, whatever you want to do he didn&#8217;t have any objection to, but he did have objection with redefining that definition. Call it what you will but it&#8217;s not marriage. So, he started with that. That&#8217;s what he wanted to do. And I was with Concerned Women of America at that time.        EF: About what year was this?        MFF: Somewhere in the late 1980s.        EF: Okay.        MFF: 1990s, because he went to the senate in 1991.        EF: Okay. So, before 1991 when he went to the senate, he was a county commissioner for a long time?        MFF: He was a county commissioner for eight years.        EF: In Forsyth County?        MFF: No, in Gaston County.        EF: Oh, okay.        MFF: And there&#8217;s a school there. Now, he loved education. He wanted people to be educated. He wanted to help them because that was the key, and he started the Commissioners School of Excellence there, which is now named after him, for students to go to Belmont Abbey College for a period in the summertime, to learn some of the civil, social, institutional type knowledge that you might not get in your high school education, and he was so much of a proponent for education.         We got started and we went to the senate, never intending to stay that long because he felt like it was a citizen legislature. We didn&#8217;t expect to ever be there.        EF: And what was your husband&#8217;s full name?         MFF: James Summers Forrester. He&#8217;s a senior. His father was also James Summers Forrester but when he came to this country he used the senior. Our son is a junior and we have a grandson who is a third.         EF: Okay.        MFF: He loved this country. He died October 31, 2011. He&#8217;s buried in Arlington. He wanted to be in the heart of the country that he loved, a truly exemplary American dream come true. He was given the community service award with the [WBTV Jefferson Award] back in &#8211; gosh &#8211; that was in the 1980s as well, and they asked him what was his motive for the humanitarian work that he did, and he said, &#8220;You know, I can remember as yesterday standing on the deck of the ship, the USS Ericsson, looking at the Statue of Liberty, and my mother said, &#8216;Son, this is your new home, and you&#8217;re going to be a citizen and you can do anything that you&#8217;re willing to work hard enough to do, but there&#8217;s two things you have to remember. You have to remember those that help you, and you have to turn around and help others.&#8217;&#8221; I mean that was his motto. It&#8217;s hard to dissuade someone with that kind of motive. He never had a personal agenda. It was just wanting to give back, wanting to make things better.         He was a physician. He said, &#8220;You know, we have seventeen departments of state government that deal with health and there hasn&#8217;t been a doctor in the house for fifty years.&#8221; So he was one of the first physicians that ever had been there in many, many, many years. He pretty much treated most of the legislators and their secretaries. He finally got to the place where he said, &#8220;Can&#8217;t take any more patients up here. I&#8217;m not here to be a doctor.&#8221; But many of the issues of the day dealt with health and he served them as a physician when he could. So that&#8217;s how the whole political thing got started, and it moved there into&#8211;. He did a lot of healthcare bills, pretty much on every health committee there was.        EF: As a senator?        MFF: As a senator.        EF: And where did he spend his childhood specifically?        MFF: He was born in Aberdeen, in Cruden Bay, which is in the northern part of Scotland, because his father was a golfer there. His father died when he was eighteen months old and then he was in Belgium, he was at the Brussels&#8211;.        EF: I see.        MFF: And we did a trek back. He wanted to know the details of his father&#8217;s death. We went back, found his father&#8217;s caddy. It was a wonderful story, when we went with the Wake Forest golf team, Walker Cup, and went to Cruden Bay and the whole town was a little seaside town; nobody was there. We saw one person down the street and he said, &#8220;You know, maybe we can hail them and find out where 2 Serald Cottage is, because that&#8217;s where I was born,&#8221; so we hailed this little lady down and we ran and we said, &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for 2 Serald Cottage,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;That&#8217;s where I was born,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;Ah! Are you wee Jimmy?&#8221; He said yes and she said, &#8220;I was your nanny.&#8221; This was incredible. Here we were, just on a day trip, the one person in town and it was his former nanny. So from there we established a relationship with his father&#8217;s caddy and his mother&#8217;s nanny. We went back to visit and they shared with him many tales. He was searching for those roots. And of course now, here I am, searching for my roots. I&#8217;m going back to the DAR and back to the Colonial Dames. So I think you start thinking about those things when you hit your thirties and your forties and your children are coming up and you realize your mortality. You want to know your roots.         EF: Sure.        MFF: So that was his life. He came to this country, he came to Wilmington. When she came to Wilmington, Delaware she got off the ship.        EF: His mother?        MFF: His mother and his sister. Excuse me. She got off the ship in New York at Ellis Island. She was going to get on the ship to go to Wilmington, Delaware. She got on the ship with &#8220;Wilmington&#8221; and it was Wilmington, North Carolina.        EF: Oh. That&#8217;s how they ended up here?        MFF: That&#8217;s how they ended up in North Carolina in Wilmington.        EF: Wow.        MFF: But the sponsor was secured, because she didn&#8217;t have enough money to go back, so she stayed in Wilmington. He worked in the corner drugstore, where I caught the bus after cheerleading practice to go home, so that was all of that, and when you look back now in retrospect it was such a beautiful pattern. We had a lovely marriage and a wonderful relationship and I&#8217;m still dealing with that, but you do begin to understand that some things, with the choices that you make, can certainly put your destiny on a track that was some providential intention. I can&#8217;t look back at my life and his together that it wasn&#8217;t meant to be. I don&#8217;t know if others feel that or not, but it certainly seemed to be true with us. We were very different but we had a very solid core of what a family was, and what we wanted, and that was the one thing he always said to me, &#8220;I want a family. I&#8217;ve never had a family,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;We can have a family.&#8221;         We did have a family. I did stay home. Our children brought people from wherever into our family. If there wasn&#8217;t enough at our Thanksgiving dinner then we went out to seek those that needed a place to have Thanksgiving dinner. I remember when [the kids were] in college at Wake. We weren&#8217;t that far away and they&#8217;d call and say, &#8220;Can I bring one more?&#8221; and I&#8217;d say, &#8220;We&#8217;re out of beds, just day visitors. They can come for dinner.&#8221; So we had an international&#8211;. And then Belmont Abbey had a lot of Hispanic students. We had three foreign exchange &#8211; actually three and a half. We had one from the USSR but that was for a very short period of time for a very short tour, right after perestroika and the Soviet Union opened up and they allowed more travel. But we had one from Peru and one from El Salvador and one from France. So he wanted the children to understand the wide world and to know what a family really was, and that was a new experience for him. He loved being part of a family because it had just been his mother and his sister.         We went on worldwide treks looking for golf clubs made by his father, which we did find [and] gave our son a complete set. We would go around asking and leave a card. Found some in Europe, found some in Texas, some in South Carolina; anybody that had [one]. That&#8217;s the way golfers [are]. They made clubs for their, I guess you&#8217;d say clients or students or whomever. They were pros at the club and they helped their income by making golf clubs.        EF: Wow.        MFF: So I have a number of them that had his father&#8217;s name on it, a lot of his father&#8217;s medals. He came to this country and found a dream that we made, so it was challenging but encouraging to be married&#8211;. This is interesting because when I was sixteen I told my mother, I said, &#8220;You know, I would like to marry him someday,&#8221; and my mother said, as a good Southern mother says to every daughter, &#8220;And what does he plan to do for a living?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;You know, mom, I really don&#8217;t care, as long as it&#8217;s not medicine, as long as it&#8217;s not politics, and as long as it&#8217;s not the military.&#8221; Can you believe I said that?        EF: Wow. Well.         MFF: So when he decided he was going into medicine I was not happy. I thought, &#8220;No, no, no, no, no. I said I&#8217;d never marry a doctor.&#8221; Then when he went into the military he said, &#8220;You know, we have to do this. I&#8217;ve either got to put in the service or I&#8217;ve got to volunteer in some form of service, because as a physician I can be drafted until I&#8217;m fifty-five and I&#8217;d much rather go as a family physician and not be put in somewhere where they needed me,&#8221; because family docs, you could fill any slot. You could deliver babies, you could do minor surgery, but he said, &#8220;I want to go with a group and I want to know,&#8221; and he did that. He served with the Guard in Charlotte. It was a medical transport unit, took hospitals all over the world. [He] was very instrumental in a lot of new developing Baltic countries because he was a state official, he was a physician so he could take care of everybody, and he would go and monitor elections.         So he had a very illustrious career across a broad spectrum that was quite &#8211; to be able to succeed in so many different things. And I found that in the medical profession they really didn&#8217;t need you. I would love to be paid a dime for every hour that I&#8217;ve waited or been left while he took off. In the military I used to give them a hard time because I felt like&#8211;. It was like, walk two steps behind, be dressed well, and be ready to take his arm when we tell you we need you. They would, in fact even with a star, they would put that star on that plane, they&#8217;d put him on that plane and they&#8217;d say, &#8220;We&#8217;ll see you in Nashville,&#8221; and I had to get my own way there. I was not even allowed to purchase a seat on that plane.         So I always said when it came to the political arena a family was important. People wanted to know, if they voted for you, what your background was, whether you had a wife or children, and there was a place, and we talked about that the first time. I said, &#8220;Gee, I don&#8217;t know. You reckon we can get along seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year?&#8221; because he had been in so many different capacities that I&#8217;d celebrated anniversaries by myself with the bill while he had gone on to deliver a baby, but found that in the political realm there was a place for the family.         EF: Well I was going to ask more clarification on that, when he became a county commissioner, I guess in the 1970s sometime?        MFF: Yes.        EF: Is that right?        MFF: Well, probably late 1970s and 1980s, because he came to the North Carolina Senate in 1991 and you subtract eight years from that, so.        EF: Oh, okay, early 1980s.        MFF: Uh huh.        EF: Well what did you see as your role during his political career, and what were your own politics, and how did you contribute to&#8211;        MFF: My husband started out&#8211;        EF: &#8211;that conversation?        MFF: &#8211;as a Democrat, a Southern Democrat. I was always a Republican but I was registered as a Democrat because that was the thing to do in the South. When you got married you changed your name, you joined his church, and, political affiliation, I suppose. But I had seen my mother and father and so I&#8217;d said, &#8220;Okay. We&#8217;ll do this together.&#8221; So I did, and then I reached the point, I said, &#8220;I am not a liberal. I am a conservative, and I&#8217;ve always been a conservative, and I don&#8217;t want to live in the closet anymore, and I want to be a Republican,&#8221; and at that time things were changing and he said, &#8220;You know, I think I&#8217;m a conservative too. I think that I haven&#8217;t left the liberals, the liberals have left me,&#8221; and we did feel that way because of the conservative values that we had and the way we were brought up.         I will say this, because I do believe our founding fathers meant for us to have two different opinions, and that you were to compromise. It was like a zigzag. You had the same end but you had different ways to get there, and we honored that. I don&#8217;t think in today&#8217;s political picture that we want the same end. I&#8217;m sorry to say that, but I think that the conservatives really want to stay with the founding principles. I think that liberals feel like they&#8217;re antiquated. Even one of our Supreme Court justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said, &#8220;Our Constitution is antiquated. If you want to look at a Constitution for the modern world you should look at South Africa.&#8221; So there is a division, and probably most of your social historians will tell you that we are more divided now in our vision of what we see than ever before, except maybe up to the Civil War.         So we saw ourselves, as a family unit, as good Southern stock. That&#8217;s the only way you can describe it because if you will think about it a hundred and twenty-seven, twenty-eight years ago your conservatives went by the label Democrats. Your Republicans were those Northern carpetbaggers. In that period of time we have almost come full circle so that your liberals now, unless&#8211;. And I have Democratic friends, and I always tell them they&#8217;d rather fight than switch, so they really are trying to change the philosophy within their own party belief system. But if you look at &#8211; and the only way you can judge this is by looking at their platform, and if you look at the platform we fit the conservative platform. We believe in the family unit, we believe in the capitalist society and the right to work and all of those things, we believe in giving somebody a hand up but not a hand out. I mean all of those little clich&#233;s that you put in there are in the conservative platform.        EF: And these were your beliefs also when your husband was a public politician. You said you weren&#8217;t officially his campaign manager but you were,&#8211;        MFF: I was working&#8211;.        EF: &#8211;pretty much.         MFF: Yeah, I was working behind, I was helping.        EF: In what ways did you work?        MFF: I did whatever he asked me to help. Well, gosh, I drove him to Raleigh for twenty years, I&#8217;d drive, and I read a lot of material and I&#8217;d excerpt and I&#8217;d say, &#8220;You know, I don&#8217;t have time to read.&#8221; Gosh, I guess we took ten or twelve newspapers, and he&#8217;d say, &#8220;Look at this and give me an excerpt. Give me the gist of this. Give me the meat of the matter and tell me what I need to know.&#8221; So I read a lot and I did this.        EF: Mm hmm, a lot of research.        MFF: I&#8217;d do research. When it came to the marriage amendment I did a lot of research of that because by then I was with Concerned Women for America and I actually wrote them a letter. I said, &#8220;Where were you when we needed you?&#8221; That was my letter and I got a telephone call [and they] said, &#8220;We want you in Dallas the day after tomorrow,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t go to Dallas, and they said, &#8220;We want you.&#8221; I did. I went to Dallas, and they said, &#8220;We want to organize a conservative branch of Concerned Women for America in North Carolina.&#8221; I&#8217;m a parliamentarian. I did this after the children grew up when he said, &#8220;Now, you want to go to work? What do you want to do?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I want a fulltime job anymore. I want to learn. I want to do something productive but I don&#8217;t think I want to be in business.&#8221;         EF: Well maybe we can back up and you can tell me a bit about what is the CWA and how you came to be a part of it.        MFF: That was because I was looking for something as an alternative to NOW.        EF: This was late 1990s or so?        MFF: Yes, this was &#8211; 1988, I think is when it started.        EF: Oh, 1980s. Oh, I see.        MFF: I was an at-large member. When we started into the feminist I wasn&#8217;t a bra-burner. I believe in women having equal rights and equal pay but I didn&#8217;t believe in the format that was coming forth with everything that. To me we were undermining the man of the house. I didn&#8217;t think we were trying to assert feminism and we were undermining our heads of household. I couldn&#8217;t agree with that. Now my husband and I didn&#8217;t agree all the time. We were partners. We were partners. A lot of our differences were gender differences. I didn&#8217;t believe this, and he didn&#8217;t believe this, and we would use those subjects to find a happy medium and sometimes we didn&#8217;t, but at the same time I was not the full-blown feminist. I just couldn&#8217;t [agree with that]. I believe that your family is the basic unit of society, and you can look at your social history of any nation and that family unit has to be a strong family unit. You need a mother and a father, and in a perfect world they are partners and they work together.         So when I started developing CWA and I told Jim, I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time to do this. I don&#8217;t have time to do this,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Of course you do. You make time because you have an opportunity to do this because you&#8217;ve gone to study parliamentary procedure,&#8221; which is, I say, telling other people what to do, but really it&#8217;s a form of organization. You have to put things on the right road. I call it like an air traffic controller. You make sure that things land in the right place. You have your by-laws, all those documents that are your organic rules that you live by and work by, and he said, &#8220;What better person to organize this?&#8221; So, North Carolina probably is the flagship of Concerned Women for America, and they&#8217;ll tell you that. We have a very, very strong organization because we started from grassroots and we did it.        EF: Tell me about that beginning.        MFF: All right. When Jim said, &#8220;You really need to do this,&#8221; at the time I was the county party chair, I was the president of the Sir Walter Cabinet, and the Sir Walter Cabinet is something unique in the whole country in that it is a state organization of women elected leaders. Now we also include like-minded men since we have moved in &#8211; and there are many women legislators who have spouses. But women elected leaders, and I was their first Republican conservative president, and I say that with pride because I never wore a label that said, &#8220;Look, it&#8217;s my way or the highway. I want to see, and I have an open mind, and I&#8217;m a team player, but where I&#8217;m coming from. You know my conservative values and that&#8217;s where they are.&#8221;         So, I didn&#8217;t think I had time to do it, and Jim encouraged me to do that. He said, &#8220;This is something you know how to do,&#8221; and I did, and I had said, &#8220;Okay, I need five people. I can&#8217;t do this. I need somebody that does money, because I hate numbers, I need somebody that can&#8211;.&#8221; We have what we call chapters, and we call them prayer chapters because we are Judeo-Christian, nonpartisan, nondenominational, but we do believe in a creator and we do believe in family values. I said, &#8220;I need somebody that can help me get those chapters, and I need somebody that can help me. Let&#8217;s see: I need money; I need chapters; I can do the organization.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I need a couple other people that can help me make this out.&#8221; You need more than three people. You can start an organization with three people but five is the magic number.         So I took it to my church, really to my Sunday school class, and I said, &#8220;You know, my husband really wants me to do this and we really feel the burden to do this but at the same time I&#8217;m so stretched in what I&#8217;m doing in other obligations. Let&#8217;s pray about it. Let&#8217;s think about it.&#8221; My pastor&#8217;s wife said, &#8220;You know, we could do this.&#8221; So, I said okay, so we sent out a letter to, I don&#8217;t know, maybe three thousand people within a fifty-mile radius and I said, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m looking for fifty people and five leaders,&#8221; and on the day that we did that I sat there and started counting heads and I counted forty-nine and my husband opened the back door and came in and had left his practice to come in and give me his support, and I said, &#8220;Okay, Lord, there&#8217;s our fifty people. I guess I&#8217;m in this for sure.&#8221;        EF: Right.        MFF: So that was the way it all began, and I said, &#8220;Okay, now I just need five people that will help me.&#8221; I had my pastor&#8217;s wife, and I had myself, and I had a girl from Virginia who had been with. We have 535, which is our lobby group, named after five hundred and thirty-five members in Congress, and we are headquartered in Washington and very well known on the Hill, liked by the conservatives and not necessarily liked by the liberals. So, we just started.        EF: Just in your living room.        MFF: It was actually in my church but, yes, in my living room.        EF: Oh, I see.        MFF: Jim actually gave me, I think, two hundred and fifty dollars and said, &#8220;Here. Buy you some stationery with your letterhead on it,&#8221; or something, and we started. Yes, turned my sunroom into an office, and that was really the beginning.        EF: And that was the North Carolina chapter of Concerned Women of&#8211;.        MFF: &#8211;Concerned Women for America, and I led it for ten years, and now&#8211;.        EF: From when to when?        MFF: I&#8217;m trying to think &#8211; 1996, 1997 &#8211; probably 1999. From 1997 to 1998, I was in training. I was sort of like a director-in training because I said I have to finish these other obligations. I can&#8217;t be a party chair and doing this. We&#8217;re nonpartisan.         EF: Oh, I got you.        MFF: Got to work through some obligations, so I did, and I began to lay the groundwork and do it then, and been with them ever since. Now Sheri Miller in Charlotte, whose husband is Tom Miller who does the news for WBT, is our state director, and I&#8217;m the associate director and advisor. I do the media. I do the legislation. I do a day at the legislature. Actually this last year we were called to Washington, two years ago, and [they] said, &#8220;We need you to go back to your states,&#8221; and we probably have anywhere from twenty-seven to thirty-five states organized at any given time. We lose them, they get married, they have children, they move, their husbands are moved.        EF: The leaders of the state chapters.        MFF: The leaders of the state chapters. Sometimes they go up and work at the national headquarters. Oh, I lost my thought. Help me find my place.        EF: You were explaining about the work that you did with the CWA.        MFF: Oh, the CWA. We were called to Washington and they said, &#8220;We need you to go back and do a briefing in all your state levels on Sharia law. We have a real issue with Sharia law that is gradually coming into our judicial system.&#8221; So we went and we listened, and it was for the leaders of Congress, and we came back and was amazed to find out that many of the Sharia law elements were coming within our judiciary system. Never did we think we&#8217;d see in this nation that our Constitutional law could be exchanged or lessened and undermined by a radical law, such as domestic abuse being allowed. I speak on this a lot so one of the examples I like to use is the &#8220;rule of thumb.&#8221; We don&#8217;t think about the rule of thumb but actually the rule of thumb in Sharia law is that you can beat your wife so long as the rod is no thicker than your thumb. So there are things in Sharia law that are not. We&#8217;re dealing with this now, we&#8217;re dealing with radical Islam, and I&#8217;m not saying that all of Islam is radical. I&#8217;m saying that Sharia law is radical. It is medieval.         So we came back and we gave a briefing and we worked and found a legislator, actually Chris Whitmire (R-District 113) from Brevard, North Carolina, former Marine, had been over in the Middle East and understood what Sharia law was taking place, and he said, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll help sponsor your law.&#8221; So we started. We wrote the law. We had a very difficult time getting it passed because of the petro dollars. Now, Bank of America, Wachovia, Wells Fargo &#8211; of course those two are the same &#8211; have Sharia law within their banking system because of the petro dollars. In Sharia law they do not believe in insurance. They do not believe in interest of loans. Now, if you and I go to the bank and get a loan, we pay interest. There&#8217;s no way you can get a loan without interest. But in Sharia law there&#8217;s no interest because they don&#8217;t believe&#8211;. That&#8217;s considered gambling. They don&#8217;t believe in insurance, though many of them &#8211; all of them &#8211; are covered under our national healthcare plan now. They have it. They&#8217;re allowed five wives and as many children as they will bear, even though the women are only allowed one husband, and beating your wife on a regular basis is considered a good thing to keep her in form, so &#8211; I mean to conform.         So we got the bill and we did finally pass it on the last night of session, not this summer session but the long session. This was the short session, and at the&#8211;        EF: Within the state legislature?        MFF: &#8211;ninth hour&#8211;. Within the state, and we only got it on the domestic level. We could not get the state bar to put it in the business. So we have mediation rooms in our banks, but I bet you couldn&#8217;t carry a Bible and put it in their chapel, and that&#8217;s prejudice. That&#8217;s prejudice. We live in a nation where we have freedom of religion, not freedom from religion, and there should be no law that prohibits us from the practice thereof, and not favoring one in your business dealings, but the banks do. But we did get it on the domestic level, so if your wife ends up in court with a domestic issue it will be tried by Constitutional law, North Carolina and national Constitutional law. Did you ever think you&#8217;d live in a country where you needed a law that would guarantee that you would be tried by American law? The bill is called American Law and American Courts. Now we do know that Sharia law has been introduced into the UK, into their judicial system, which is appalling to me.         So, I don&#8217;t know what that means for the future, but we deal with &#8211; and anything that deals with family issues, traditional values, and when you tell me that that&#8217;s not a founding principle you can&#8217;t convince me of that because, I know, if you walk in Washington, gosh; it&#8217;s all over everywhere. &#8220;In God We Trust&#8221; is on our coins. Nobody&#8217;s forcing you to go worship but we do recognize that those basic principles founded this nation so we work to preserve them, and that&#8217;s how it all began.        EF: Well thanks for that explanation. I wonder if I&#8211;.        MFF: That was a long one.        EF: No, it&#8217;s fine. I wonder if you could talk more about your leadership within the North Carolina CWA, talk about the everyday work that you did. I think you worked on the newsletter, I guess you did a lot of behind-the-scenes, grassroots organizing.        MFF: I really did.         EF: What did that look like?        MFF: People who would suddenly be triggered by what you do, and they would say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve never heard of you. Why are you here?&#8221; I mean, &#8220;How did you get to here?&#8221; and we&#8217;re saying, &#8220;Well, something triggered their thinking to see what.&#8221; And I have some information that I&#8217;ll let you carry home, brochures, that you can see some of the things, where we stand, and I brought those for you so you can see that. When someone would get their interest triggered then I really tried to find a place for them using their talents. I mean that&#8217;s what you do as a leader. You don&#8217;t try to put someone where you need them, you try to find out what they&#8217;re good at doing and then you fit them into your plan.        EF: Right.        MFF: So we had someone who was [in] development. She liked to raise money; she was out there with a &#8220;Yay!&#8221; You know the money that we have in the state level we pretty much have to raise for ourselves.        EF: Oh, I see.        MFF: So they give us some options but you&#8217;re pretty much, you have to find ways to finance your endeavors. So, I would do that. I would help direct leaders. We would have informational seminars in churches. We try to use churches, or synagogues, or we did the briefing at the legislature on Sharia law. We brought in experts from Washington, from wherever, and brought them in and went to the leaders in the General Assembly and said, &#8220;We have been asked.&#8221; Congressman Sue Myrick was very instrumental in that and she said, &#8220;We really need this and, Mary Frances, you can do this.&#8221;         So, we have informational seminars. We try to educate people. I am now speaking a lot on Sharia law, what Sharia law really is, and how it is an ideology more so than it is a religion, that Islam is a military way of life, an economic way of life, ideological, and it&#8217;s more than worshiping Allah and we&#8217;re finding that out, and not all aspects of that is good. Now, you can say that there has been much evil and many wars fought in the name of religions. In the modern day world we have an ideology and a religion that wants to live back in the medieval world, and that&#8217;s not the way the world is moving. We&#8217;re supposed to be becoming a global community where we like each other and we&#8217;re going to get along with each other and we&#8217;re going to share ideas and share cultures, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that if you don&#8217;t believe the way I want you to believe I&#8217;m going to chop your head off in the town square. So, I&#8217;m working a lot now with Sharia law.         My husband was the&#8211;. He worked for ten years to get the marriage amendment, and when I said we didn&#8217;t intent to go there and stay and I&#8217;d say, &#8220;How long are we going to do this, dear? It&#8217;s time to travel and sit on the porch and sit in the rocking chairs,&#8221; and he says, &#8220;I cannot finish what I feel like I need to do. I always wanted a family. I know that the family unit is the stabilization of society, and we need this Constitutional amendment. You can do anything in this country you want to do, you can make any living arrangement you want to make, but you cannot change the establishment of the family.&#8221; So, that was done May 8, 2012. He died October 31 of 2011, but he knew that he had it in that May primary, so even after he died I said I never want to look back and say, woulda, shoulda, coulda, so I finished his work.         I did not take his seat in the senate. I think I could have. I felt like my work was in the grassroots. I worked for candidates. That&#8217;s what I spent years doing for him, building relationships, working in the grassroots, educating, getting people to understand that you need to vote, you need to vote your voice. We can disagree but we can find ways that we can work together, and even in my parliamentary work &#8211; and I serve on a hospital board now. I&#8217;ve been there and I&#8217;m about to finish up. I think I&#8217;m ready. I&#8217;ve been there for twelve years and I have always said the thing that frightens me most about sitting on a board that has six-figure millions of dollars budget and you&#8217;re doing things is that a board that doesn&#8217;t discuss, a board that rubberstamps what somebody comes in and says, you can&#8217;t do that. That&#8217;s not what democracy is all about. We talk about it; we debate I; we find common ground; we find a solution.         So that&#8217;s where I felt called to be, to do, and I do the same thing with CWA, and I have served on the national board of CWA in Washington and I have worked with their 535, being a lobbyist on the Hill. I do citizen lobby work here. Right now I&#8217;m working a lot for judicial candidates because I&#8217;m really worried about our courts. I&#8217;m worried about our judges who are legislating from the bench.         I had the privilege of speaking at Duke University to the Christian Lawyers Club and when they invited me to speak, it was Valentine&#8217;s several years ago, and all I remember is it snowed and I thought, oh, I hope I make it to Durham. But I had freshmen, juniors, and seniors, and not being an attorney I thought, what can I speak to these young attorneys about? Then I remembered that we had a woman who was running for the court of appeals in 2002. I worked for her opponent. She won, and she was quoted in the Charlotte Observer as saying &#8211; and now I&#8217;m paraphrasing this &#8211; &#8220;Since the North Carolina Supreme Court is hearing fewer cases and judges are having to&#8211;.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think she used the word &#8220;legislate,&#8221; but &#8220;rule&#8221; from the bench, &#8220;I think that I have the background and the conscientiousness to serve the citizens of this state,&#8221; and I had her direct quote and I asked that to those attorneys, and I said, &#8220;Tell me what&#8217;s wrong with that statement,&#8221; and nobody said a word. I said, &#8220;Let me read it again.&#8221; It took three times, and a little freshman in the back of the room raised his hand and he said, &#8220;You know, Mrs. Forrester, I don&#8217;t think a judge is supposed to rule from the bench.&#8221;         I thought, &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; We finally understand that judges&#8211;. It was one judge that took prayer out of the schools. It was one federal judge in Virginia that said the marriage amendment was unconstitutional. So we now have judges in our judiciary that are ruling according to their personal agendas. That&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re supposed to do. So I&#8217;m working a lot for judges to educate because the judges have been put on the bottom of the ballot with the dogcatcher. They&#8217;re in alphabetical order. They were not allowed to say whether they were conservative or liberal. They were not allowed to raise money, and nobody voted because they didn&#8217;t know who to vote for. We&#8217;re trying to change that in the Voter Reform Law. You will be able to say whether you are liberal or conservative, you will be able to raise money, and you will be able to say what your values are. Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you still have the right to rule from the bench, but it means that you will administer the law according to the Constitution and not according to your personal agenda.         I have a wonderful brochure in here I want you to be sure and read, because we call it judicial tyranny. So Thomas Jefferson said his biggest fear with the judicial branch: what if they ever got out of control? And we have a judicial branch that&#8217;s pretty much out of control, because they are sitting on the bench, they are not administering the law, they are tampering with the law to fit their own agendas. That&#8217;s not the way&#8211;. I may disagree with you personally when I sit on a jury but I&#8217;m not supposed to inflict my personal opinion on whether you are guilty or innocent. I&#8217;m supposed to decide according to the law and according to your offense, and how they have shown me whether you are guilty or not guilty.         So that is a big thing with me right now. I&#8217;m working for a lot of judges, [Laughs] judicial candidates, and the CWA, that&#8217;s one of the things that we want judges that are Constitutionalists that still believe in the Constitution. That is the greatest document of self-government that&#8217;s ever been designed in the history of mankind and yet we have many in the judiciary system, even our own Supreme Court justice, who said that it&#8217;s antiquated, we need to get rid of it and we need to have a new Constitution, and most people aren&#8217;t even aware of this.         So CWA is an educational thing. We educate, we inform, we try to do it in churches and in General Assemblies and in libraries and anywhere we have an opportunity to do that. We find a lot of resistance from people who, number one, don&#8217;t know their history. We don&#8217;t teach history in school anymore, past the fourth grade, I think. It&#8217;s called social studies now. The interesting thing at Duke, when I spoke with the attorney students, I said, &#8220;Do y&#8217;all study the Constitution?&#8221; and they said, &#8220;Not necessarily. It&#8217;s an elective.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You mean you can graduate from law school, you can raise your right hand and swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States, and never studied it or never read it within your law education?&#8221; Yes, and when many people say they teach Constitutional law, what they have really taught are cases that went before the Supreme Court. They haven&#8217;t taught Constitutional law.         So, since the informational revolution back in, what, probably about the 1980s too, we are so inundated with so much information [that] there&#8217;s as much or more misinformation as there is accurate information. So CWA is very strict in that we stick with accurate information, we try to clear up misinformation, and our basic values are the sovereignty of our nation, our Constitution, our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech. We&#8217;re also one of the opponents of Common Core, and that surprised everybody, you know, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want us all to do better?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yes, but I want us to have&#8211;.&#8221; You want to teach in a classroom where there are no textbooks, where parents aren&#8217;t allowed to come in and see what they&#8217;re studying, where forty-four percent of the class must fail? I mean there are some [components] in Common Core that people don&#8217;t know because they have been sold a bill of goods that says we&#8217;re all going to be on the same page, we&#8217;re all going to be on the same level, we&#8217;re all going to take the same test, but that&#8217;s not all of what Common Core is. Most of the states that bought into this bought into this before they saw the instruction. Now, business loves it because they see a lot of new technology that&#8217;s going to be included in this, so that&#8217;s another thing.         So, I&#8217;m an issue-related person.        EF: Right.        MFF: I&#8217;m a conservative issue-related person. I do think I&#8217;m willing to have my mind changed but you&#8217;re going to have to show it to me. You&#8217;re going to have to show me the facts; you&#8217;re going to have to show me the figures. It&#8217;s not going to be based on hearsay or what you think it is. That&#8217;s how it all started, and I became an activist because I love this country, I love what it stands for, I&#8217;m a product of what it&#8217;s meant to be, that you can be anything you&#8217;re willing to work hard enough to be, and that&#8217;s what we taught our children, that there&#8217;s nothing to stop you. Where there&#8217;s a will we&#8217;ll find a way.         Gosh. I&#8217;m talking a lot.        EF: Well, it&#8217;s been great. You went from topic to topic but many of the topics that I had already planned to ask you about, so that was helpful. One other issue that I know the CWA has been really involved with since the 1970s. When did the CWA begin?        MFF: CWA, let&#8217;s see, was back in &#8211; gosh &#8211; in the 1970s. I should know that date because we had something like our twenty-seventh anniversary.         EF: Yeah, I&#8217;ve seen it too. But, in any event, I wanted to ask about what is your personal opinion, and the CWA I know has done a lot about abortion and covering that, so what has been your involvement with the CWA&#8217;s position on abortion and that activism in the state?        MFF: Well, actually CWA was the one &#8211; Karen &#8211; I can&#8217;t think of Karen&#8217;s last name, in Illinois, who uncovered and took it all the way to the Supreme Court on partial-birth abortion where we have babies who were allowed to remain in the birth canal except for their head, and a cannula was inserted into the soft part of the skull &#8211; this is gruesome &#8211; literally suck the brains out, and then they called it an abortion. We say that how can you have a baby in a bathroom and leave it to die and it&#8217;s called murder and you can choose to kill a baby and call it choice? The question started with the feminists when they no longer called a baby a baby. It was a fetus, a blob, a bit of tissue. Abortion as a form of birth control is murder. We now have a bill in the Senate that we&#8217;re working &#8211; this is in Congress &#8211; that after twenty weeks&#8211;. Remember, that&#8217;s five months. After five months you have a heartbeat, you find the sex, it laughs, it cries. That is not choice; that is a living being. So, abortion as a means of birth control is wrong.        EF: Has that been an issue since the time you joined with CWA and worked with them?        MFF: Yes. Now, we live in a world where &#8211; and there&#8217;s difference in opinions here. The Catholics are having a real issue with this because they don&#8217;t believe in any form of contraception. I&#8217;m not a Catholic and I do know that a lot of people do use a form of contraception, before conception, and there are many that believe that any form of contraception is an abortifacient. I don&#8217;t believe in abortion. I believe that life is God-given, it&#8217;s created, and I was a cytotechnologist so I worked in the pathology department, so I saw a lot. My husband delivered babies, we talked about it, I&#8217;ve had four children, wide awake, I mean, birth and life is a gift from God, our creator. Whatever you want to see, that is a life. You can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s not. There&#8217;s no way you can discredit it and say it&#8217;s just a blob of tissue. Sorry.         EF: Well, you&#8217;ve covered a lot of ground, for which I&#8217;m very thankful. That&#8217;s really about the end of my questioning that I have for you, but I wonder, is there anything else that you&#8217;d like to say or&#8211;        MFF: No. You&#8217;ve&#8211;        EF: &#8211;any other topic to cover?        MFF: &#8211;let me talk and I certainly shared my life value system with you. I am a strong believer. I have always been. I was raised that way. But the most important thing is that I know the author of the book and I have a very personal relationship there, so I&#8217;m a strong believer in our creator and that is the basis of my values. I don&#8217;t force my values but at the same time I understand for the last five thousand years of civilization, according to the Hebrew calendar, the Ten Commandments have been the social code of justice for every civilized nation, no matter what your personal belief was. That was the code of justice used throughout the world, and it worked. So, we&#8217;re not perfect. The world is not perfect. But at the same time, if you don&#8217;t have a social code of justice that is black and white, and everything is gray, you have nothing but chaos, uncivilized chaos, and I believe very strongly that there is a plan for this world, and I know the final chapter and there&#8217;s a happy ending. So, between here and there is not necessarily an easy path, but I got the answers.        EF: Well, thank you very much for sharing.
