CM: This is Christy Mobley for the Southern Oral History Program. Am I speaking with Rev. Temple?
GT: Yes, you are.
CM: Rev. Temple, do you give me permission to record this phone call?
GT: Yes, indeed.
CM: Okay, wonderful. This is the twenty-fourth of November. So Rev. Temple, can you tell me a little bit about your early life, where were you born, what did your parents do?
GT: I was born in Washington, D.C., but my parents quickly moved to Rocky Mount, North Carolina on the eastern part of the state. My father was an Episcopal priest and my mother was a homemaker. We lived in Rocky Mount until I was about eleven. We then moved to Charlotte, where we lived for three years. I was sent away to boarding school in Massachusetts at the end of their stay in Charlotte and came home the first Christmas to find that they had moved to Columbia, South Carolina. Subsequently after six years in Columbia, my parents moved to Charleston, where my father worked for the rest of his career. I, after boarding, went to the University of North Carolina and then went to the Theological Seminary at the Episcopal Church in Alexandria, Virginia, and then was assigned to be the vicar of St. Luke&#8217;s Mission Church in Wautauga County, Boone, North Carolina, and the Episcopal campus minister at Appalachian State University. I went to Appalachian in 1968 and stayed until the early spring of 1975.
CM: Wonderful. So would you say that you had a religious upbringing?
GT: Yes, I would.
CM: Do you think that that influenced your decision to go into the ministry?
GT: Of course it did, yes.
CM: Did you always know that you wanted to be a minister?
GT: I think I was eight years old before it occurred to me that everybody&#8217;s father was not  a priest. (laughs) I think there was a certain psychological protocol in my head that that&#8217;s what a person does.
CM: And did you want to get involved with campus ministry?
GT: I was very excited about it. When I first went to the post in Boone, my intent was to be there three years and then go back to graduate school and be an academic, but the experience of being a campus minister and having an actual parish was such fun that I never became an academic.
CM: What did you want to become an academic in?
GT: It would have either been Systematic Theology or the Study of the Old Testament.
CM: So going to seminary in the 60s and then becoming a campus minister in 1968, were you involved in any of the activism of the 1960s? How did you feel about the turmoil of the 60s?
GT: Well, I was involved in the civil rights struggle in Chapel Hill. I went to Chapel Hill in the fall of 1960 and it really began to heat up as an issue around &#8217;61 or &#8216;2, as you recall. I was, to some extent, involved up to 1963 when I went to Germany for a year as an exchange student. When I came back in the fall of 1964, it had really heated up and I got more involved than I had been previously. When I was at Virginia Seminary, I was quite involved with work with racial issues, working in mission stations in impoverished neighborhoods, stuff like that as well. Late in my time at Virginia Seminary, I got out in 1968, we began to become aware of the issue of the war in Vietnam. That really became a political issue and so when I went to Boone, I already had my RPMs up in terms of the civil rights struggle and was beginning to get up to speed in recognizing that we needed to bring the Christian conscience to bear on what we were doing in southeast Asia.
CM: What kind of civil rights activities did you do when you were in Chapel Hill and then in Virginia? Do you remember any specific activities?
GT: Yeah. At Chapel Hill, I participated in marches. When I got to Virginia, I volunteered at mission stations in black neighborhoods in northern Virginia. And then in 1968 when Dr. King was killed and large parts of Washington went up in smoke and essentially it was a militarily-occupied city, a friend and I went into the city for a week and lived on the basement floor of a Methodist church in a badly hit neighborhood and spent the week taking food around to apartments that could no longer get access to grocery stores. That was probably the peak experience of my three years of theological education, that week.
CM: Were your parents involved in civil rights at all or was that a personal decision for you?
GT: Both. My father began to get involved in it in Columbia, South Carolina, in the late 50s after the Brown decision and took a fair amount of heat, as you might imagine, in Columbia for his position on racial integration. And then when he went to Charleston, he went to Charleston as the bishop of South Carolina. The first ten years he was bishop, he integrated the diocese of South Carolina, which he got about the same welcome that General Sherman did.
CM: What was the&#8212;oh, go ahead.
GT: And he was equally effective.
CM: What was the position of the church at that time, and the members of your congregations on civil rights and on activism and the left?
GT: The position of my little congregation in Boone was very favorable to the civil rights struggle, of which there was not a great deal in Wautauga County, and was increasingly sympathetic to the struggle to call people&#8217;s attention to the issues involved in the Vietnam War. There was division in terms of my involvement with the Clergy Consultation Service. That was estranging to some of the older members of the congregation who really didn&#8217;t get it and I wasn&#8217;t very effective in explaining it to them. So I did not face the kind of internal opposition from the people I actually served that, say, my dad had dealt with.
CM: Were these issues talked about? I&#8217;m curious about your experience at the Virginia Seminary.
GT: Civil rights was talked about a great deal at the seminary. We had several faculty who had FBI files on them as thick as the encyclopedia.
CM: Because.
GT: Because since the 30s, they&#8217;d been involved in left-wing activities. So that was a lot of fun and they were quite articulate about the whole complex of issues.
CM: Was that part of the reason you decided to go to that seminary?
GT: It was. The other choice for Episcopal theological students in the South was to go to the Sewanee St. Luke&#8217;s Seminary at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, which was at the time recovering from a racist episode in the 50s, where the seminary had accepted a black seminarian. The board of trustees of the university said that they couldn&#8217;t take him in and so all of the faculty, except two members, had resigned in protest and the board of directors of the university simply rehired a right-wing faculty to replace them. And so for years, it was not a respectable place to study theology because it was being run by the scabs, if you will. So nobody with a liberal conscience would have gone to Sewanee in those years.
CM: So when you got to Boone, how did you get involved with the abortion issue? Was that in your time in Wautauga County?
GT: Yeah, it was, and it caught me by surprise. My little congregation was situated pretty much in the middle of campus, so students were just going past the place all the time. It was an ideal setting for a campus ministry and students would come in and talk issues over with me and with several of the other campus ministers. They also had a student mental health service that was pretty competent. So those were the resources that students had access to when they were disturbed about something. Early on, I think it was probably, I can&#8217;t remember the first time, but I want to say it was around 1970, a young woman came in to talk to me and was pregnant and persuaded me that her circumstances were such that coming full term with the pregnancy really was not a decent or ethical option, and putting the child up for adoption was not going to work for her, and asked my help in finding resources for having an abortion procedure.   So I began to scout around and that&#8217;s when I bumped into Clergy Consultation Services. I can&#8217;t remember who my initial contact was with it, but in those days, this was before Roe v. Wade, what those of us in Clergy Consultation Services were issued once we were vetted and found to be reliable, we were issued a list of clinical facilities that we could refer people to in London, England, in the Bahamas, as well as a very, very private list of physicians in the Carolinas, in the South area who would consult with women in these circumstances and privately due a D&amp;C  [dilation and curettage] that would amount to an abortion. I remember there was a physician in Charlotte who was quite helpful and quite courageous in this way. And so in those days, we would refer people. Essentially, it was an underground railroad.   And then Roe v. Wade changed that. The first thing that happened was that the New York Women&#8217;s Center opened in New York City and that was a facility of choice, and we would send, we almost had a shuttle service going up to New York. Then I think Summit Medical Center opened in Washington, D.C. My recollection is that there were some quality differences. The women who went to New York had a somewhat better experience than the women who went to Summit. And then other abortion clinics began to proliferate and the task of Clergy Consultation Service was to keep track of what results we would get and what feedback we would get from each facility and try to make that information available to women.   There was an additional issue. We were supposed to be neutral as to what a woman would choose. What normally happened was a girl would miss her period. She would go to the campus physician, who was a wonderful, very compassionate man. He would give her a positive pregnancy diagnosis and she would go into a state of shock. He would then refer her either to me or to the Methodist campus minister. We were the only two campus ministers who were open to the abortion procedure and so we would get a timorous phone call from this person asking if they could come see us, and we&#8217;d pretty much know what it was. They would come in and they would tell us the story, and then we would outline to them their options and the pros and cons of each. Their options, of course, were to marry the impregnator, to carry the child full term and raise the child as a single parent, to carry the child full term and put the child up for adoption, and we had several institutions that would facilitate that, or to go to one of several clinical facilities in which you could have an abortion. Depending on how far along she was, the abortion, if she was within twelve or thirteen weeks since her last menstrual period, would be a D&amp;C. If she was past fourteen weeks, it got a little rougher. She would have to have what they called a &#8220;saline evacuation.&#8221; That was really pretty awful.   (break in conversation to answer telephone)
GT: So the campus physician got curious to know what the pressures were on the girls to produce such a high pregnancy rate. At one point, we estimated that something like ten percent of the coed student body was getting some kind of a scare each year. Appalachian State in those days was a strange place. It had been Appalachian State Teachers College and before that it had been a Baptist, it called itself a seminary for young women to teach young Baptist ladies to be good adult Baptist schoolteachers. So it was conservatism, social conservatism was in the DNA of the place. Plus the fact since it was a teachers college, the coeds outnumbered the male students and so sexually, it was a buyers&#8217; market. The people came from very conservative backgrounds. They might dress shaggily in imitation of the hippies and that sort of thing, but their social and political attitudes were very much those of their parents. Many of them were first generation college educated. So consequently, they were desperately naive in terms of sexuality, particularly contraception.   And so the physician asked my Methodist colleague, my colleague and myself, to see if we could ascertain what the prevailing attitude was among coeds on campus about birth control. And so we would insert some questions in our conversations with the women when they&#8217;d come to see us. We would say, &#8220;Were you using birth control?&#8221; And the answer would be no. &#8220;Was your boyfriend or the man using birth control?&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Then I would ask, &#8220;Well, did you discuss it?&#8221; &#8220;Oh no, we didn&#8217;t discuss birth control.&#8221; And I would say, &#8220;I wonder why you didn&#8217;t have that conversation with each other.&#8221; And invariably the answer was, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know each other that well.&#8221; Now when you&#8217;ve heard that several hundred times, it quits being funny.
The thing that we gathered was that the attitude was that if you go ahead and get on the pill or if you carry rubbers with you, that makes it premeditated, which is more sinful, and if it just kind of happens as an accident, it&#8217;s not quite as sinful. But on cynical days, my Methodist colleague and I would agree the primary form of birth control on campus was prayer.  CM: What was his name?  GT: Manuel Wortman. He was a wonderful man and I don&#8217;t know where he is today.   CM: Was there any effort to increase sexual education on campus?  GT: No. As a matter of fact, I called my congregation&#8217;s attention to the fact that we had this, I don&#8217;t want to be hyperbolic, but something like a sexual holocaust happening on campus. Some young women, young married women in the congregation, including my wife, formed a group to be a support to coeds and to offer counseling on sexuality and contraception. They called it &#8220;HUG,&#8221; which stood for Human Understanding and Growth, and they put up posters in women&#8217;s dormitories to have meetings in the dormitories with coeds, these were coed dormitories in those days, to talk about these issues. And they had two or three meetings like that and then the administration of the university came down on them with both feet and said, &#8220;You simply cannot come on campus and talk to people about contraception.&#8221; So that was that. They tried to offer meetings to coeds on the church grounds, but nobody came to those meetings and I think again the reason was that if you came to the meeting, you were acknowledging that you were actively interested in sex and that would be sinful, that it was somehow spiritually preferable to have it just happen.   CM: Go ahead.
GT: Go.
CM: Can you say a little about your wife? Was she involved with you in these issues? When did you meet her?
GT: Yes, she was. I met Jean when I came back from Germany at the beginning of my senior year. In those days in Carolina, coeds didn&#8217;t move into the university until their junior year unless they were in the nursing or dental hygiene school. So Jean had come in as a junior. She was from Connecticut and had gone to a small college in Pennsylvania. She had come in from Connecticut as a junior the year I was away, which I lost academically. So when I came back, we were classmates and gradually were together in various activities and were engaged by spring. We were engaged for a year or so and then the summer after my first year of seminary, we got married. By then, she was beginning to get interested in psychology and while I was the campus minister at Appalachia&#8212;are you there?
CM: Yes, I&#8217;m here.
GT: By then, she started working on her master of science in clinical psychology, and today she&#8217;s a psychotherapist in private practice here in Atlanta. So she already had sort of a temperamental disposition to be of help to women of this circumstance. She was never with me actually in my office when people would come in, but she would kind of absorb my tales and reports when I would come home at night.
CM: Had you always been supportive of abortion rights or was that something that changed when the student came into your office in 1970?
GT: It changed when the student came in. Part of that, I always felt a stigma attached to it, and that sort of thing. Again, something I neglected to say a moment ago, I said we were supposed to offer a spread of options to students. The fact is I think we were all somewhat disingenuous about that. Although we would support the student if she decided that she wanted to go full term or that sort of thing, we really had a bias in favor of abortion. In retrospect, I&#8217;m sure we put some kind of pressure on women to elect the abortion procedure rather than the  other alternatives.
CM: Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Why do you think that was?
GT: I think there was a sense of justice involved in it. The boy was equally implicated in the circumstance, but didn&#8217;t have to carry any of the consequences. He could fade into the woodwork and nobody could come after him. On the other hand, the woman would be saddled with a child or with a marriage that wasn&#8217;t suitable for much of the rest of her life. It would compromise her ability to enter a career or to make a suitable marriage or any of the rest of those considerations, and it just seemed so awfully unfair.   There was an additional consideration. As I would try to get to know the women and ask them, &#8220;Tell me a little about your family background,&#8221; and that sort of thing, the thing that came up again and again, recall that these are women from usually socially very conservative households, is, &#8220;My mom and daddy always told me, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you dare get pregnant, don&#8217;t you dare get pregnant. If you get pregnant, don&#8217;t come home,&#8217;&#8221; that kind of stuff. What little any of us knew back then about family systems theory or how the brain works, we still intuited the fact that somehow this woman has been set up all her life by her family to get in this kind of trouble for some reason. I mean, we know now that if you want your child not to drop the plate as the child takes the plate to the sink or the dishwasher, you don&#8217;t say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t drop your plate;&#8221; you say, &#8220;Carry the plate carefully,&#8221; because the brain can&#8217;t process a negative instruction. And so these girls had been set up all their lives to get in trouble sexually and it just seemed so awfully unfair that the family drama now would get to go to its sordid, tragic conclusion. And so for that reason, it seemed to me that abortion, although to some extent morally objectionable, was the least objectionable choice that the young woman faced.   I also continued to think that you can make a distinction between an acorn and a oak tree. People who insist that you&#8217;re taking a human life, or something like that, in some terribly technical way may be sort of correct, but the fact is an embryo is not what we mean by a human being. So the moral terms on which it was and continues to be discussed today seem to me not to have much traction.   CM: Were there things that the girls that came to see you for abortion counseling had in common, their age or their family situation or their relationship with the boys?  GT: In most instances, the relationships with the boys were not adhesive enough to warrant marriage. I would say the majority of them were from socially and religious conservative backgrounds. I mean, it&#8217;s the kind of stuff we see today in red states. Other than that, there was a pretty good age spread. I saw proportionally as many graduate students as undergraduates. What they all had in common was that birth control was not an issue for them. If I saw anybody who was there as a result of birth control failure, I don&#8217;t remember it.   CM: Did you ever have anyone come in with their sexual partner or was it always the woman alone?  GT: Always the woman alone. Also, encouraged by the physician, Manual and I would always offer follow-up conversations with women after they came back to find out what they experience was and how they were managing and that kind of stuff. If one or two percent of the people ever came to talk to us, that would be a large number. Normally, they would avoid our eye on campus if they passed us as though we&#8217;d never met. So I don&#8217;t know what became of a lot of them in terms of how they managed the fallout.   CM: What do you think the effect of the counseling that you and your fellow pastor offered was?  GT: Well, the immediate effect was that the women made a decision that usually was, to some extent in their better, if not best, interest. So I think that was an authentic service and I certainly don&#8217;t regret having offered that to people. My hope is that the fact that they were receiving this information from ordained clergy in recognized Christian denominations allowed them to think that they weren&#8217;t automatically going to hell because of what they were doing. That was my hope, but again that&#8217;s not anything I was ever able to follow up.  CM: Did you have particular allies or perhaps enemies in the community? And were you visible in the community as Clergy Consultation?  GT: Oh, (29:13). Manual was less visible, but I was visible because in those days, Episcopal clergy always wore clerical collars around and so I stuck out pretty well. And the other thing was that I was also increasingly conspicuously active in antiwar and pacifist public activities. So every day I would walk down from my office down to the post office, several blocks down the street, get the mail for the church and come back, and on any number of times had people spit on the sidewalk in front of me.   CM: Because of your political stance or because of your work with Clergy Consultation?  GT: All of it. I mean, that was the rap sheet on me, that I was involved in all these horrible activities.  CM: Was Clergy Consultation visible on campus?   GT: No.  CM: Was there advertising?  GT: No.  CM: Or did the physician have to give you the referral in order to&#8212;  GT: No, the physician gave the referral or word of mouth. We didn&#8217;t advertise.  CM: What types of antiwar activities were you involved in?  GT: We organized several parades and demonstrations against escalations. We had a protest parade, I remember, after the Christmas bombing of Hanoi, where we wiped out some hospitals. We had one demonstration calling for the impeachment of President Nixon. We offered counseling to people in the church office who were struggling with registering as conscientious objectors. That was sort of tricky because a lot of people coming in for that counseling clearly weren&#8217;t conscientious objectors. They simply didn&#8217;t want to serve. So that occasionally required saying, &#8220;You know, I hate this war as bad as you do, but you don&#8217;t qualify.&#8221;   CM: Was there a particular trajectory to your activism? I know that you said that you went to Wautauga County in 1968 and then became involved with Clergy Consultation in 1970. Were you involved in the antiwar between &#8217;68 and &#8217;70?  GT: Yeah, the antiwar started earlier. What started to happen is that guys who were the age of kids were coming back from Vietnam with PTSD that nobody had a name for, but they couldn&#8217;t sleep at night and their wives were scared to wake them up and they were just hollow-eyed and terrible difficulties adjusting. And some of them came in and during the course of talking to me about it, which I&#8217;m sure wasn&#8217;t very helpful to them because obviously I didn&#8217;t know what they were talking about, but I would offer them the opportunity to make a sacramental confession, which like the Roman Catholics, is something that the Episcopal Church offers. During the course of sacramental confessions, I heard stuff that turned my hair white, that these poor guys were carrying around with them. And so very quickly, what I heard really, as one who heard confessions, radicalized me on this particular issue.   Prior to that, I thought, &#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it regrettable that we are involved in this war, but we have to show the communists that we mean business.&#8221; I mean, I was swallowing the government take on it, what New York journalists call the &#8220;justification of war as theater,&#8221; and that is to show the rest of the world that we mean what we say in our treaties. So I went along with that until I started hearing kids actually come back and talk about what was happening over there. I started writing Sen. Sam Irvine about it and saying, &#8220;You guys in the Senate need to pay attention to what you&#8217;re doing to these kids.&#8221; And I would get these wonderful typewritten letters back from Sen. Irvine with a lot of typos in there and without the little thing in the lower left-hand corner saying a secretary did it. He was hand-typing these letters back to me saying, &#8216;It&#8217;s pinko commie clergy like you who are ruining this country,&#8221; and stuff like that. (laughs)  CM: Really?  GT: Oh yeah, he was very much opposed, but it was a wonderfully personal blast. I would always thank him for the work that he was doing on citizen privacy against government intrusion in any letter I sent him, and he would always include a paragraph saying, &#8220;Thank you so much for your support on this issue. It really is a concern.&#8221; It was very personal correspondence and we had about six volleys and I&#8217;ve kicked myself ever since for not keeping those letters because they were the man at his best and worst, but he was great.   CM: What would you say the divisions on campus were in support for antiwar activities and then was there also support for the abortion rights and women&#8217;s rights movement on campus at all?  GT: There was no abortion rights or women&#8217;s rights movement on campus at that point. So all of that was&#8212;  CM: Did that develop later?  GT: I don&#8217;t know. I was gone by 1975, but it had not developed as of 1975.  CM: Okay.  GT: The campus itself was politically and militarily quite conservative. Appalachian State was one of two universities that during the course of the Vietnam War asked for and received a new ROTC program to be installed on campus. And as you can guess, the Pentagon brought it in overnight. The actual officers who taught military science were wonderful guys and one of them wound up on my vestry in my congregation and became a close friend. The bishop of the Armed Forces, who is usually a brigadier general in the army on one of the services and an Episcopal bishop who looks after our chaplains around the world, was a member of my parish.  CM: Oh wow.  GT: Because he had a summer home in Wautauga County and he and I got along wonderfully. I mean, he thoroughly understood my position, was quite guarded as to the extent that he agreed with it, but was pretty tolerant of my pretty shrill screeds against the whole thing. The campus itself, though, was quite conservative and although the kids all had shaggy beards and hair and wore beads and that sort of thing, mostly none of them saw the problem with the war in Asia. So it was a minority of the students, although probably something like half of the faculty, who understood what we were doing. We started a group called Citizens for the Study of Non-Violence, which encouraged people to get to work reading Martin Luther King, reading Mahatma Gandhi, and looking at non-violent resistance as an alternative to military intervention. That was a very rich activity.   CM: I&#8217;m wondering if we can go back a little bit to talk about your work with Clergy Consultation.  GT: Certainly.  CM: How exactly did those networks work? Did you ever have girls that didn&#8217;t have the money to go to London and then later to New York, and what would have happened in that situation?  GT: I&#8217;m trying to remember.   CM: Because it must have been expensive.  GT: Yeah, I think I may have sent one person to London and one person to the Bahamas, or wherever it was we went; maybe it was Jamaica. I remember sending several people to Charlotte and I assume they worked out with that physician whatever they did. Christy, I really don&#8217;t remember how they financed it. I don&#8217;t remember helping because I wouldn&#8217;t have had a budget for it.  CM: Right.  GT: And I don&#8217;t recall that CCS did either.   CM: Were you worried about the legal ramifications of your work with Clergy Consultation?  GT: No.   CM: No?  GT: No. In those days--. (laughs) Now cover the tape, but the fact is most people that go into the ministry are slightly narcissistic. I mean, that&#8217;s how we test out on psychological tests and whatnot. And so those of us who were involved in political activities and abortion counseling and stuff like that cultivated a certain swagger, where opposition actually fed, if that makes sense. So the thought that &#8220;the man&#8221; might be mad at us, whether &#8220;the man&#8221; was the guy from the university administration, simply fed our self-esteem rather than scared us.   CM: Can you say anything about the women&#8217;s experience with the abortion clinics? Were they picked up and provided with a place to spend the night or do you know a little bit about how that system worked?  GT: All I know is the kind of thing that would happen when they went in the door, and the feedback we got from New York Women&#8217;s Center was wonderful, that they were treated with enormous compassion. They were sort of welcomed as little sisters. The staff that they dealt with were principally women. The procedure was very carefully explained to them and they received some preliminary counseling about it. Parenthetically, incidentally, the campus physician had taught Manuel and me how to explain the procedure to women who came in, who wanted to know about it, including get one of those cut-away plastic models of the female reproductive apparatus. Just cover the mike again. I still remember the campus minister calling me up one day, saying, &#8220;Hey, Temple, I got your plastic pussy.&#8221; (laughs) Anyway, the girls already had some idea of what would happen, but they would explain it again up at Women&#8217;s Center and they would be very compassionately treated and they&#8217;d be real okay that they were okay before they were allowed to return home.   I have the sense that at Summit in Washington, they were not quite as solicitous and while I was active in this, there seemed to be a downward drift in the quality of care. The few circumstances I&#8217;ve been involved in in Atlanta since there, where, of course, there are any number of abortion clinics, is that the early standard of care and compassion had badly deteriorated. About twenty years ago, my wife went with a woman in my congregation to get her procedure and said it was really pretty awful.  CM: Two questions, the first being do you think that having a woman involved in the counseling process makes a difference?  GT: I do.  CM: And then do you think having counseling offered at the time of the abortion makes a difference?  GT: I do know that it makes a favorable difference to have a woman do it, rather than a man, because ultimately guys are the problem. The other thing, I don&#8217;t have any data on what the counseling at the time establishes, except I hope it allows some sense of bonding with the people that are going to offer the woman treatment. So certainly it would have that impact. But I don&#8217;t hear of many, I rarely hear of a woman who walks into a clinic and gets the counseling there and changes her mind and walks out. I bet that doesn&#8217;t happen very much.  CM: So did the work of Clergy Consultation end with the Roe v. Wade decision?  GT: No, except it was more above board. We started having meetings, as I recall, after Roe v. Wade, and the work shifted to simply quality control on the different legal facilities around the United States. I don&#8217;t think I went to a CCS meeting in North Carolina until after Roe v. Wade and that was at Chapel Hill at the Unitarian Church.  CM: Was that Bob Johnson or Jim Riddle?  GT: Jim Riddle?  CM: Jim Riddle.  GT: Yeah. As I recall, he was a wonderful guy.  CM: So what was your reaction to Roe v. Wade and why do you think that the need for CCS&#8212;because I&#8217;ve spoke with other ministers that said that after Roe v. Wade, the need for CCS diminished and that their work ended. Why do you think that your work needed to continue after Roe v. Wade?  GT: Because I was on a very conservative campus and the doctor needed somebody to give the woman information to what were now legal facilities, but the doctor, working for a conservative university, could not dispense that information.  CM: That&#8217;s very interesting. Can you say a little bit more about that?  GT: Yeah. The administration, again, was quite conservative and they were just barely okay with his prescribing birth control pills for women who were in their legal majority, but the thought of his giving out information that would a woman to find an abortion was not something the university could sanction. And so that meant that somebody outside the university structure had to be there to do it, and that was Manuel Wortman and myself, in the event.  CM: Did the doctors believe they would lose their jobs if they gave out information on abortion?  GT: They would have.  CM: They would have?  GT: Yes, and I&#8217;m pretty sure at the university psychological counseling center, they would have as well.   CM: Did you ever fear, was there any way for the administration to take action against you and your colleague?  GT: No. No, we were administratively, and probably to some extent politically, invulnerable to the university. There were people within the Episcopal diocese of North Carolina who felt that what I was doing was atrocious and I would hear from them frequently. A lot of colleagues thought it was awful. But we had a very wise bishop who, while he didn&#8217;t do (46:06) blocking actively for the politically active clergy in his diocese, he at least shielded us from having presentments brought against us.  CM: How did your work change or did it change after the Roe decision?  GT: Essentially, the way it changed was it didn&#8217;t have to be so clandestine in terms of our--. First place, after the Roe decision, we knew what the procedure was. When I sent people to London or to the Caribbean or to Charlotte, I didn&#8217;t know what they were going to do. I just knew they would have an abortion and that it would presumably be medically safe, but what the procedure was, was not something I knew or knew how to know, or had any reason to. So it changed favorably that way. You know, we had a greater spread of options that we could offer to people, including some very nice agencies that would help locate an adoptive couple if people wanted to go that direction.   CM: So do you think that adoption then became an easier option after the Roe decision?  GT: No, I think adoption had always been easily accessible to people. There was the Florence Crittenton procedures that as far as I know are probably still going on. So I don&#8217;t think Roe v. Wade, Roe v. Wade may have cut down the number of available babies for adoptive couples considerably, but again adoption is not all that cool an option either. I mean, it has this wonderful sort of moral patina to it, but adoptive children, as I&#8217;m sure you know, frequently have struggles with all kinds of attachment issues as to their parents. It can be pretty rough.   CM: What was the reaction to the decision itself on campus?  GT: I don&#8217;t recall one. Again, my guess is, since I can&#8217;t recall one, there were no fireworks. My guess is that the average student didn&#8217;t think that had anything to do with her or him.   CM: Was there an increase in sex education efforts after Roe v. Wade?  GT: Not while I was there.   CM: Okay. You left in 1975  GT: Yeah, in January.  CM: And so the work continued until then. Do you know if anybody continued the Clergy Consultation work after you left?  GT: Manuel and I left about the same time. I don&#8217;t know who his successor was or what that person did, but my successor did not take it up.  CM: No?  GT: No. As a matter of fact, the congregation itself eventually moved away from their site on campus, jacked up that little building, and carried it to a new property where it&#8217;s now the chapel. And to my disappointment, the parish today doesn&#8217;t have much contact with the university.  CM: Did you see your work as connected to the civil rights movement at all?  GT: Yes, I did and continue to. Let me just talk from the sort of gopher&#8217;s eye view as an Episcopalian. But since I&#8217;ve been in the ministry, the Episcopal Church has been roiled by a series of controversial issues. It started with whether or not we would racially integrate. The next thing had to do with the war in Vietnam. It also had to do with the abortion controversy. It had to do with whether or not we would ordain women. It eventually had to do with whether we would revise the old Book of Common Prayer from which we worship, which was written in Tudor English and inaccessible to someone who walks in off the street, who wasn&#8217;t raised on it. And then finally most recently, what we&#8217;re currently involved in is the sacramental status of homosexual people. I think like mushrooms, each of those issues is the recrudescence of a single root system. They&#8217;re all the same issue.  CM: How so?  GT: It has two circumstances behind everything. The first is a terror of sexuality and the second is privilege as an addictive process. So each of those represents privilege maintenance.  CM: Can you say a little bit about that? That&#8217;s very interesting.  GT: Yeah. The resistance to racial integration in churches was the maintenance of white privilege and, in bizarre instances, the maintenance of black privilege in all-black congregations where the blacks would lose their voice in essence if they--.  CM: So did you witness a push back against integration of churches by the black community?  GT: In some instances, yes, but again, that&#8217;s elitism back and forth, and privilege maintenance. Martin Luther King was the one who called our attention to the fact that the Vietnam War was a social poverty issue because white people weren&#8217;t fighting it and middle class to wealthy people weren&#8217;t fighting it either. Any kid whose daddy had an income could get out of that war, as most of Congress did. So that was a privilege issue. They are the kinds of people who make war. We&#8217;re simply the kind of people who favor it. Obviously, a terror of having women preside over men had something to do with the resistance to the ordination of women and, in some instances, privilege maintenance on behalf of women who preferred to operate in churches behind the scenes and who didn&#8217;t think they would be able to work very well if they were flushed out into official positions. The Book of Common Prayer insistence that we continue to worship in Tudor English is a filter for elitism. So it keeps riff raff out of our pews. That&#8217;s a kind of privilege maintenance. And of course, the resistance to gay people has to do, first, with the terror of sexuality, particularly a sexuality that&#8217;s perceived as unrestrained and, again, privilege maintenance that heterosexuals are better than homosexuals and married people are better than single or divorced people, and all the rest.  CM: Can you say a little bit about the theological issues surrounding the ordination of women and the ordination of homosexuals?  GT: Yeah. As a matter of fact, in terms of the ordination of homosexuals, I wrote a book about it.  CM: Oh, can you give me the name of that book?  GT: Yeah. The book is called Gay Unions by Gray Temple and you can still get it used on Amazon. I think they&#8217;ve stopped printing it.  CM: When did you write it?  GT: I wrote it about eight years ago, I guess.  CM: Okay.  GT: The theological thing about the ordination of women is that essentially what you have to do, the two obstacles you have to get over, one of them is the theology itself divorced from the Bible sees no difficulty with ordaining women to anything you ordain a man to. The other obstacle has to do with the Bible. How do you read it? What is its authority in the church? Is it analogous to the American constitution or is it more analogous to the Declaration of Independence, which, while it embodies the spirit of the country, has no force of law in a court. Those kinds of positions. If you want to say, &#8220;No, the Bible tells us how we have to structure ourselves as institutions,&#8221; you would recognize that in the Old Testament, the restriction of priesthood to men is something which occurs after the golden calf episode in Sinai. And so it&#8217;s a punitive restriction, but it&#8217;s not what we would think of as the original intent of Yahweh, okay? So in a pristine condition, Israel is not restricted from having women in priestly positions and indeed, in the Old Testament, we see several, like Deborah and the prophetess Huldah and people like that who are mentioned by name as holding either prophetic or sacerdotal roles in the Israeli cultus.   In the New Testament, the fact is the only person who talks about the apostles with any interest is the Gospel of Luke. The others mention the twelve and the rest of them, but no two lists of the twelve agree with each other. Luke is the only one who attaches any prestige to them. This could get to be more answer than you want question. But there&#8217;s no denying the fact that given the criteria for the term &#8220;apostle,&#8221; the first apostle was Mary Magdalene because she was the one who was sent by Jesus directly to bear witness to the resurrection. That&#8217;s what apostle means, &#8220;one who is sent to bear that message,&#8221; and she&#8217;s the first one.   The other thing is most of the, all of the opposition to women in holy orders is taken from St. Paul and it&#8217;s mostly taken from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, and it can easily be demonstrated that the apparently misogynistic passages in First Corinthians were actually St. Paul&#8217;s citation of a letter they had written to him, to which he proceeds to argue. So he himself, in fact, was arguing in favor of women in leadership rather than opposed to it. And if you do a decent job of putting the punctuation marks and the quotation marks where they belong in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, you begin to realize that very much to the contrary of St. Paul being opposed to women in holy orders, he was very much in favor of it because elsewhere, he wrote, &#8220;In Christ, there is no distinction between male and female.&#8221; And so the author of that sentiment cannot have been the author of the sentiment that is attributed to him in First Corinthians. Very briefly, that&#8217;s the biblical consideration in favor of women&#8217;s ordination.  CM: I&#8217;m curious what was the trajectory of this issue? How did your parents feel about it? How was it taught in seminary? And then when did it become an issue in the Episcopal Church?  GT: We&#8217;re talking about women?  CM: Yes.  GT: Which issue?  CM: Yes, sir, women&#8217;s ordination.  GT: Okay.  CM: And the equality of women.  GT: It was a matter of discussion in the 60s, but nothing much was happening with it, except that you were beginning to get pockets of feminism in seminaries and in churches. I had two women classmates in seminary in a mostly male environment, one of whom went on to be illegally ordained, but her ordination was later recognized.  CM: So at the time, women could attend seminary, but not be ordained?  GT: But not be ordained as Episcopalians, right. One became a UCC minister with our faculty&#8217;s encouragement. The other went on to get, she was part of the original Philadelphia Seven, I think it was, who were ordained irregularly. My dad was a bishop at the time and he was very much opposed to the illegal ordinations in Philadelphia and Washington because he didn&#8217;t like to make law or policy that way. In general, he was in favor of women&#8217;s ordination and once it was approved in 1976, he ordained and supported quite a number. As far as I know, I can&#8217;t remember my mother having much of an opinion about it, although recalling my mother, who is now in glory, she had pretty strong opinions about a lot of individuals, not all of which were favorable.  CM: So would you say that the rising of the issue of the ordination of women was connected to the women&#8217;s movement and the rise of feminism?  GT: Yes, yeah, definitely.  CM: And when was it that the Episcopal Church decided to ordain women?  GT: 1976. That was the same year they decided to bring the old Tudor 1928 prayer book up to date. So the prayer book we&#8217;re using in Episcopal churches today is in modern English, not as elegant, but it&#8217;s theologically much more refined.  CM: And do you think that the ordination of homosexual ministers has followed a similar trajectory to that of women?  GT: Yes, it has, yeah.   CM: Do you think that the Episcopal Church will ultimately reconcile over the ordination of homosexuals?  GT: I think we will. I also think it will cost us membership in the International Anglican Communion. I think that&#8217;s probably not as bad a thing as other people think it is. I think trying to stay good Anglicans is serving as a drag anchor on us right now. It costs us more than it gains us.   CM: I just realized I don&#8217;t know. Where did you go in 1975 when you left Wautauga County?  GT: I came to Atlanta.   CM: And what did you do in Atlanta?  GT: I had a parish in a suburb and I stayed at that parish for the rest of the ministry. I retired from there after thirty-one years.   CM: What year did you retire?  GT: I retired in 2006, January, and then stayed retired for a couple of years and then in 2008, came out of retirement for a year to serve as the interim rector of an Episcopal church in Munich, Germany.   CM: Oh wow.  GT: Yeah, that was great fun.  CM: And do you speak German?  GT: Yeah, I was an exchange student in college and so I still retain a passing fluency. So I went and pastored that community for about thirteen months. Part of the deal was they didn&#8217;t have to pay me very much because I was retired, but there was no cap on my expense account. So they flew my wife over once a month so that we could have some time together and she could maintain her psychotherapy practice in Atlanta. You can call the United States from Germany very cheaply, about a penny a minute. So using the telephone and Skype, she and I were in touch every day, but together about a week a month.   CM: Have you and your wife, after you moved to Atlanta, have you remained active in civil rights and women&#8217;s rights and abortion rights?  GT: Abortion rights, no, simply because in a suburban parish, there wasn&#8217;t very much pressure for it, and people would take that kind of issue to their physician. Where I connected with abortion as a parish priest in Atlanta was people would come in whose consciences were burdening them and so what we did was to offer them two sacraments. One was to hear their confession and give them absolution and other was to have a very, very private communion service, which would be crafted around the funeral service of the prayer book where they would have a funeral for the little conceptus, name the conceptus, and simply give the conceptus to God. And we would go ahead and have a communion service and that would be that. People told me later on that that was quite helpful to them in getting over whatever they had been carrying around from an abortion or, in fact, a miscarriage, we would do very much the same thing. People rarely came to me, though, in Atlanta saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m pregnant. I don&#8217;t know what to do,&#8221; which I have to tell you was a relief.  CM: Why is that?  GT: There&#8217;s a kind of abortion fatigue that sets in when you just see so much of it. There would be weeks when Manuel and I would see two apiece and just week after week after week after week. That&#8217;s gets to be an awful lot of it. I&#8217;m told that physicians and nurses go though something like the same thing.   CM: Have you been involved politically in the issue at all?  GT: Not since coming to Atlanta, although I vote Democrat and any time there&#8217;s an argument about that issue, I&#8217;m on the pro-choice side. What I&#8217;ve done in terms of civil rights, which in Atlanta is largely, at least juridically, settled&#8212;I mean, the laws are all favorable to integration, although Atlanta is de facto still pretty segregated&#8212;but what I&#8217;ve been mostly involved in is the cause of homeless people in Atlanta. I took one of my summer sabbaticals and lived on the street with a homeless man to get some sense of what that life is like and I&#8217;ve gotten some insights into it and wrote a book about what churches and civic groups can do to help out in that situation.   CM: And what is the name of that book?  GT: Fifty-Two Ways to Help Homeless People.  CM: Okay.   GT: It&#8217;s out of print, but I think you can still get copies on Amazon.  CM: Thank you.  GT: It&#8217;s a pretty old book and not all of its information is pertinent anymore, like all the financial stats are way out of date. But Jimmy Carter endorsed it, actually.  CM: Oh wow.  GT: He read it and said that it was a good manual. So most of my stuff has been with homeless people. We put together a soup kitchen and a food pantry in our congregation. They feed, they give weekly groceries to about a hundred families a week to this day because the old neighborhood, which was pretty middle class, is being increasingly infiltrated by apartment complexes with blacks and Hispanics. So the congregation maintains a pretty good base of compassionate outreach to poor people and homeless people.   And since I was in an Atlanta suburb, much of my job was getting Republicans into heaven. The way you do that, actually, is to take them to a slum area and let them roll up their sleeves and actually get involved. They may still vote Republican, but they thought out in some way. They&#8217;re not as scared or as inquisitive as they were. We used to take them downtown to shelters and soup kitchens, and there was a slum in Tegucigalpa in Honduras where we used to take people. There was a slum project that I think they still support in Nairobi, where we took people several times. You know, it changes people. You see things differently after you&#8217;ve been in that circumstance.  CM: How do you feel about where we are now in terms of both the abortion rights issue and civil rights? I know in North Carolina, we have abstinence only education and funding has just been passed for again and, of course, everything that&#8217;s been going on with the health care debates in the House of Representatives.  GT: Well, I am terribly worried about our country. Ever since I was a student, I&#8217;ve been quite aware of the history of central Europe and Europe in the 20s, 30s, the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the rest of it. And what we&#8217;re seeing in this country comes straight out of Martin Goebbels, particularly under the Bush-Cheney administration where if you tell the big lie again and again and again, it comes true. And you get control of the press, you get control of the industrial sector, and you can do anything you want.   I think the turning point in the country&#8217;s decline was turning the McCain-Feingold finance bill into political theater where they went after the wrong target and Bush made a signing statement that he wasn&#8217;t going to pay any attention to it anyway. What they went after was the lobbyists, but the lobbyists aren&#8217;t the problem. As a matter of fact, lobbyists are, for the most part, helpful. The problem is the industries themselves that ask lobbyists to be their bag men and there&#8217;s no restriction on that and consequently, your senators don&#8217;t serve North Carolina. They serve R. J. Reynolds, they serve all kinds of corporations that allow them to finance their campaigns. We&#8217;ve got worse senators than you do in Georgia. They don&#8217;t serve us. They serve Lockheed and they serve various insurance companies and whatnot. And that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re seeing being enacted on the national scene in terms of health care reform, in terms of our doing something about the environment, global warming, and all that. It&#8217;s being derailed by unrestricted corporations.   Health care, the most favorable, most optimistic program that anybody can even conceive right now is still single payer health care, but if you&#8217;ll notice, that still rests on a platform of assuming that health care comprising medical intervention to existing conditions backed by accessible pharmaceuticals. There&#8217;s no research money in this country going to nutrition. There&#8217;s no research going into the favorable impact on the body of exercise. There&#8217;s no research going into the impact of toxic environments, that sort of thing. All of their research money is going into what drugs work well with what particular illnesses. So if we could get a much better health care reform bill than we&#8217;re likely to get, which would be single payer, we&#8217;d still wouldn&#8217;t have come anywhere close to the rest of the world in terms of health care. The reason for that is the death grip that free market ideology has on us in this country. I think we&#8217;re headed down the slope and it scares me, the rise of the militias, the fact that they can&#8217;t keep ammo on the shelf, the fact that we put up with the likes of people like Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck, Bill O&#8217;Reilly, Fox News itself, the fact that even The New York Times embraces the White House&#8217;s language for its discourse and used it during the Gulf War buildup. All of those are very alarming signals to me.  So, I&#8217;m sorry, you asked the question.
CM: Well, that was actually my last question. Do you have anything else that you would like to say before I turn the recording off?
GT: Well, simply that in terms of the previous answer, part of the symptomotology of what&#8217;s wrong with us is the superstitious notion that if we could just govern, not so much our own, but other people&#8217;s sexuality, that somehow we could right ourselves. We associate that with conservative Christianity. It actually has its root system in Stoicism. It&#8217;s a pagan philosophy that leached its way into Christianity because the Stoics were admirable people, but the whole embarrassment of the ancient world about being sexual and not being able to govern their impulses and that the true fulfilled man can govern whether or not he gets erect or whether or not he smiles during sex, you know I&#8217;m caricaturing it, but there really was an embarrassment about being human in the ancient world, which is largely absent in the Old and New Testament, but makes its way into early Christian literature as Christians began rubbing up against Stoics and other educated people. Unhappily, that&#8217;s one of the strongest features that the Church has inherited from the ancient world. Part of the nation&#8217;s panic at the state that we all sense that we&#8217;re in is if we could just govern how other people behave that things would be better off. So I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to see anything sensible come out of Washington or state legislatures or school boards any time soon about sex education or our health issues.
Now you can turn it off.
CM: Rev. Temple, thank you so much. I&#8217;m going to turn the recording off now.
