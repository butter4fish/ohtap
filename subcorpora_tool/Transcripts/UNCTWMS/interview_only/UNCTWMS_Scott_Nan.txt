Jennifer Donnally: Good morning. Today is Wednesday, May 26th, 2010. This is Jennifer Donnally. It is ten-thirty and I am at the Fountain Head&#8230;?
Nan Scott: &#8230;Fountain City&#8230;
JD: &#8230;Fountain City Art Center, interviewing Nan Scott about her life and her involvement with the women&#8217;s movement and civil rights. So, my first question to you is, what was your childhood like and where did you grow up?
NS: Well, interestingly enough, I grew up in Fountain City, not too far from the Arts Center where we are now. I had pretty much a Mayberry childhood. I had one brother, and my dad worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority. When you live in Tennessee and your dad is from the North, you&#8217;re a little bit segregated off from people. TVA at that time was considered a little bit controversial, and I remember as a kid in the first grade, our schools got mitigation funds from TVA because they were putting in a lot of power plants around the area, and so TVA kids would have to go get in line, and everybody knew that our parents were working for the government. It made us a little bit set aside and not always in a really good way, but other than that, just a great childhood.
JD: You said your parents were from the North and you were brought in as the outsider.
NS: A little bit.
JD: Did you ever become an insider in the community or how did that process go?
NS: Well&#8230;
JD: &#8230;And you can relax.
NS: Okay. Well, one thing about me is maybe from those early times, I learned how to fit in. I observe what&#8217;s going on around me, and I become a chameleon in order to survive. They talk about people having several languages. When I would be up north visiting with my cousins, I would try really hard to have a northern accent. All I have to say: they always made fun of me. [Laughter] Then, down here, people would say, &#8220;Well, she just doesn&#8217;t talk like us.&#8221; But, yeah, I was able to fit in just fine and I was pretty successful socially.
JD: So, then did you go to college?
NS: Oh, yes.
JD: What college and what was it like?
NS: Well, I graduated from Central High School and I went to the University of Tennessee. I had wanted to go into veterinary medicine, but my chemistry scores in high school were not what they should have been, so I went into education because I had always enjoyed teaching. So I got my bachelor&#8217;s degree in elementary education and I taught for three years, and then my school was closed for race desegregation reasons, so I went back to school and I got my master&#8217;s degree in guidance. I was fortunate that I was able to work in some of the schools in the inner city that had just been desegregated, and so as a counselor, an intern counselor, I helped work through a lot of the issues that the students were going through with these transitions. I went and talked to the school board about these things, so I was able at that time too, to sharpen my interest in civil rights and work toward getting people to accept one another, you know, at the high school age. I was at a high school and also at two elementary schools, doing counseling in the inner city.
JD: Let&#8217;s go back a little bit. Can you explain a little bit more about what--when did you graduate from college?
NS: The first time I graduated from college was in [19]69. I got my bachelor&#8217;s degree and then I got my master&#8217;s degree about three years later. Then I completed a doctorate about five years after that, in [19]78.
JD: So, after you got your B.A. in Education in [19]69, you said that you went out to teach, and then your school got closed down due to violence. What--it was not, it wasn&#8217;t violence

NS: It was just, they--in Knoxville when we had desegregation, rather than busing the children, they just closed down my school, which was a ratio of about fifty percent black and white. They closed my school, and the black children walked to Moses School. I mean, to Maynard. Sorry, Maynard School, and the black children had to walk even further and they didn&#8217;t even have buses. They had to walk down a pretty busy intersection to another school that had been primarily white, and these white children were sent to a school that had been primarily black. It caused some consternation among a lot of people, and I went and talked to the Board of Education about it because I thought it was really bad to have those children walking on such a busy highway and walking so far. It was just a way of trying to desegregate in a way that was easy, except if you were the children and families involved. They had not much of a voice because they were all economically disadvantaged people in the inner city.
JD: Okay. So then, what were some of the problems that occurred when you were a guidance counselor? Oh, I just saw a spider out of the corner of my eye.
NS: Oh, it&#8217;s not a black widow I hope. I saw a black widow here once. [Laughter]
JD: So, if you could talk to me about some of the issues that kids were having and what you were counseling about.
NS: The issues in the guidance, particularly the--I worked mostly with the elementary school-age children. One time, for example, I was in the office, looking through some files, and the local Black Panthers--most people didn&#8217;t even realize Knoxville had a Black Panthers chapter, but they came in and took over the office as a protest about these white kids coming into this school. There I was, a white counselor. It was a little bit unnerving, but it was okay, and then they left after they made their statements. Then, I did groups of children, where we would all talk about the things that we shared in common, our differences, and how we could benefit from each others&#8217; differences and learn and how we&#8217;re trying to prepare ourselves for the world community, how there was so much diversity in the world community, and what an opportunity it was for them. We had a thing that was actually--I remember the name of it. It sounds dopey now, but it was called the &#8220;Do So&#8221; and it was a hand puppet. I would talk through the hand puppet about these things, the children really pretty engaged in it. I remember one time telling them all to put their hands on the table and to tell me what they saw about their hands that was different. Of course, the point was that everybody&#8217;s hands were different shades, but they said things like, &#8220;Well, so-and-so&#8217;s wearing a ring.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t really even notice color, which I thought was really beautiful.
JD: And this was with the elementary school kids?
NS: Yes, it was.
JD: Do you have any other comments about the civil rights? Did you actually participate? You participated as a school guidance counselor; did you take part in any civil rights protest at all or not, because you were in college?
NS: Yeah, and you know, I took classes and I did participate in some civil rights confrontations. I remember going to--William Kunstler came and spoke in Knoxville, and he was pretty radical at the time as a radical judge and worked in civil rights. He came and I took one of my favorite professors, and I remember being embarrassed at Kunstler&#8217;s language when [he] got into all the expletive-deleteds right in front of my favorite professor that I was trying to raise his consciousness about things. That&#8217;s really about all I remember. Well, that&#8217;s really about all I remember. I was just in it continuously and then, when I got my first job at the Tennessee Valley Authority, it was as a civil rights worker. I worked in Title VI and I developed for Tennessee Valley Authority, which is a seven-state, largest public power company in the world. They were just instituting the Title VI program and I worked on the educational materials that introduced Title VI to the agency. Some people from the Department of Justice came down and I actually hosted one in my home. I showed them the mountains and it was really great, and that was really raising my consciousness and teaching me at the same time that I was helping to introduce all this to the civil rights responsibilities that we had as government workers. We had a major Title VI conference and brought people in from all the TVA sites for that and I was responsible for it. I even wrote a speech for our then-chairman of TVA, David Freeman. Dave is just a wonderful guy. He is a brilliant person, is a very controversial person, but at any rate, I wrote his speech and I thought it was really good. Unbeknownst to me, he had a speechwriter, and so [laughter] I remember when I met David Beckham, I think was his name, who was his speechwriter, and I went up there and he said, &#8220;Nan, you know, you can&#8217;t write my speeches.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, what do you think of this?&#8221; I remember how he tore it into shreds and threw it in the trash, but it was actually, I&#8217;ll have to say, when he came out with his speech, it sounded almost identical to mine.
JD: Did you face any discrimination, sexual discrimination on the job?
NS: Always.
JD: So what kind of instances?
NS: Most of it wasn&#8217;t too graphic. It was just the thing of being the only female program manager in the economic development, when I moved in at the economic development field, and my salary was quite a bit lower than that of the males. It seemed to me, well, it was just that, and then later on when I did some personnel work, a person came in from the private sector and he didn&#8217;t realize we have a lot of protection in federal agencies. You can&#8217;t just--and he came in when I was talking on the phone my first day at work, grabbed me and kissed me right on the mouth. He was always pulling my bra straps and things. His name was Charles Doddy. He had come from a large paper company up in Kingsport, but he finally learned. You know, I just had to tell him that that wasn&#8217;t acceptable. One time, we went on the road together to introduce a new pay system that TVA was going into, the Hay system of job evaluation, and on that, he&#8217;d had his secretary book us in the same room. So, of course, I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s not acceptable.&#8221; So he said, &#8220;Well, you know, I just like to ask.&#8221; He did ultimately get fired, but I don&#8217;t think it was for sexual harassment reasons. He came by and told me how nice it had been knowing me and that I had helped him learn a lot, so we parted as friends.
JD: So, I want to just clarify really quickly. You went and you got your B.A. in education and then you got your Ph.D. but you were also working for the Tennessee Valley Authority?
NS: I went immediately to TVA after I got my doctorate.
JD: Okay, so this is in the middle eighties?
NS: Yeah, it&#8217;s in the early eighties. I went there in [19]78, actually, and I worked at TVA my whole career. I had a lot of really interesting jobs and a lot of them related to civil rights, and I should say I wrote my dissertation also on--. My doctoral program was extremely interesting to me because it was interdisciplinary and I was able to pick my fields of study. Our major core of study was on systems theory, on how everything worked together. That has been something I had an inclination toward before anyway, because I&#8217;m a lot better on large picture than I am on details, and systems theory worked really well for me. I had an area in human development, an area in consumer economics, and then an area in women&#8217;s studies. My biggest problem with my doctoral program was that I loved interdisciplinary [scholarship] but trying to bring those people together on the doctoral committee, they just had some troubles working together. But then that was a learning [experience] too. I did my research on information and sexual portrayal in network television advertisement.
JD: Wow, so you were cutting edge.
NS: Yeah, it was very interesting because the assumption we investigated was that there would be an inverse relationship between the amount of real information given and the degree of sexist portrayal, because you wouldn&#8217;t want to, if you were doing a factual commercial, you wouldn&#8217;t want to detract people&#8217;s interest by portraying people in a silly, sexist manner, and that was borne out. There were other factors, but that was borne out to be true. For a while, I was getting some royalty checks when people checked out my dissertation. I haven&#8217;t gotten any recently. [Laughter]
JD: I want to go back a little bit. It was interesting to hear about your work at TVA. I want to go back a little bit into the 1970s, and one of my questions is, how did you get to know Jane Weeks?
NS: In the seventies [pause]&#8230;
JD: &#8230;Or a larger question: When did you become involved in the women&#8217;s movement?
NS: Okay, when I got through working in the sixties with the civil rights movement, then when the women&#8217;s movement started happening here in Tennessee, it was just a natural outgrowth for me because I thought we are, as women, even though we&#8217;re really the majority, we have minority status. So I started working in areas that were in the women&#8217;s movement, and one of the things I did was to work with the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center. The Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center was just a great center. We had classes for women who want[ed] to re-enter the job market and we were a place people could come if they had a sexual harassment issues; we had counselors. I was on the board there. Another thing that we did was we had a small business incubator program, and that&#8217;s what I remember being involved the most with, with Jane Weeks because we went to Washington together and were trying to get some funding for a business incubator which would help small women-owned businesses, give them an opportunity to grow so that they could survive on their own. You&#8217;re probably familiar with the business incubator concept. It was new at that time and I was doing that in my work at TVA too. So, we were successful in getting some funds and we hired a young woman named Kala Gentry, and she was the director for Matrix, which was the name we gave our business incubator project. We were, as I recall, successful in incubating a few businesses. It was pretty innovative at that time.
JD: Do you remember any struggles about the ERA in Tennessee?
NS: I remember that there were some. Interesting thing about the ERA in Tennessee, first thing Tennessee did--I mean, they thought on first blush, &#8220;Well, hey, that sounds like a good idea,&#8221; and they actually approved it. Then they rescinded it when they found out that money was involved. [Laughter] You know, it was just great as a universal concept, &#8220;Well, of course, women are equal but hey, wait a minute!&#8221; No one wants to give up power, and men don&#8217;t want to give up power either. They finally started seeing the women&#8217;s movement more as something that was, rather than being something good for women, it would be something bad for them, so Tennessee rescinded it, and of course, we&#8217;ve never passed it. I remember marching at UT; it might have been the only time that I was on the front page on the UT Beacon, which was the university newspaper. I was carrying a sign, and gosh, I did not know that it was possible for my mouth to be open that wide. [Laughter] Apparently, I was shouting pretty loudly. I met a lot of great people through that, even though we weren&#8217;t successful in getting the Equal Rights Amendment passed.
JD: Do you want to comment on any &#8220;stop-ERA&#8221; opponents or your opponents on the Equal Rights Amendment?
NS: Not really. I just remember a lot of jeering. I don&#8217;t remember any organized groups that were against it. We didn&#8217;t have the Tea Party back then or they would have been against it probably. Just an aside. [Laughter]
JD: Do you remember any struggles or any protests surrounding abortion or reproductive rights?
NS: Well, yes I do. I never participated on either side in that, but I do remember, we have a couple of clinics in Knoxville and there were always protesters there. As far as I know, here in Knoxville, it&#8217;s a fairly genteel atmosphere here but people protested. I don&#8217;t recall any of them becoming violent or anyone actually getting hurt, but I&#8217;m sure that people who were going to those clinics felt a lot of humiliation having to go through jeering, yelling people with all kinds of signs. Just recently, here in Knoxville I saw--it&#8217;s still going on, of course, nationally, here too, somebody was driving through with this horrific sign of an aborted fetus, driving down Gay Street with it. It was just really awful. I mean, that continues, but I don&#8217;t remember anything too much more than that.
JD: Do you remember, I talked to Jane about this, the Women&#8217;s Center of Knoxville refused to take any political stands as a center? Was there any conflict, any tensions with many people who wanted them to take political stands in those&#8230;?
NS: The only thing that I really remember much about that--I don&#8217;t remember anything about the abortion right issue, but gay rights was something that was--. We had quite a few lesbian women who participated at the Women&#8217;s Center and they wanted us to take more of a position on it, but we never did. Interesting that Jane said that. I did not know that that was our official position to not take a position, but I remember that we never did, so I guess that was our official position. I should have read the charter and bylaws; it was probably in there.
JD: So you got involved in the Women&#8217;s Center. Did you--anything, any other organizations in the Women&#8217;s Movement? Were you a member of NOW, the Knoxville NOW chapter or any other things that you can comment on about--?
NS: Yes, one thing, at TVA we had a group called Federally Employed Women. It was considered a feminist group, and it generated a lot of fear in top management and eventually, finally, it was pretty much destroyed [laughter], but I was in that group. I believe I was a member of NOW for a few years, and I know that the Martin Luther King parades that we have here in Knoxville on the day of his birthday, I would march with--. I didn&#8217;t have a group to march with, so a lot of times I marched with NOW. I was not ever an officer in NOW or anything though.
JD: Okay, so now I want to get into TVA. I want to cover a little bit more about the seventies. So you started working for TVA in 1978?
NS: I did.
JD: You said you had this Charles Doddy, who&#8230;
NS: &#8230;Doddy [giving pronunciation as &#8220;Dough-dee&#8221;], right&#8230;
JD: &#8230;sexually harassed you.
NS: I didn&#8217;t report him.
JD: Could you ask for any redresses at that point, or how did you handle that and did it impact your environment?
NS: &#8230;You know it was a hostile work environment for me. At the time that I was working for Charles Doddy, I wasn&#8217;t feeling very secure in my job. I had, as I had mentioned before, I was the only woman program manager in economic development and I had to leave that position really because of sex discrimination. There was a hostile work environment there, but it wasn&#8217;t really--yeah, I&#8217;d say it was sexism partly. So, I had taken this job with Charles Doddy to introduce a new pay system to TVA which, I was interested in learning the technologies of the pay system. But he came in, like I said, from the private sector, where it&#8217;s probably more prevalent harassment and people [do] not say anything about it. But because I was in a fragile state, he got by with more than I would have normally let him get by with, and I did not report him. We had Equal Opportunities staff that took complaints, but I was smart enough to know that when you made a complaint through them, you pretty much had sealed your fate and that you would not be working that much longer. It just was not, once you did that, even though reprisal wasn&#8217;t allowed, it would have reprisal because I had seen that. So, I just handled it with him by just telling him it was inappropriate and he never did, I&#8217;ll have to say to his credit, he just kept trying but he never pushed it forward.
JD: What other forms of sexual discrimination? Well, I mean&#8230;
NS: &#8230;Well, there&#8217;s the pay&#8230;
JD: &#8230;the fact that the pay was unequal. Were you getting paid half, or?
NS: I&#8217;d say, maybe, yeah, probably just about half. I was going to say two-thirds, but probably closer to a half.
JD: So you talked a little bit about this organization that you&#8217;re a part of that was Women Federal Employees, that you all got together. Can you tell me a little bit more about that and what were the conversations that you guys had, and the things that you wanted to see?
NS: In Federally Employed Women, we would get the demographics from each department and look at where women were related to men who were doing the same job, how much their salaries were, and we would pass this information on up to top management. We had programs, and we would get top managers to come and be our speakers. That way, we could ask them the hard questions that we would never have the opportunity to from our various job locations. So it was a real good power group. Then, through it, I remember when our secretaries at TVA did a class-action suit against TVA and FEW was able to help them, providing them with information about disparities, and they were ultimately successful in that. And there were other civil rights cases that were successful at TVA that FEW was able to help with.
JD: Did black employees have some of the same big problems? What were some of the big problems black employees were facing in TVA?
NS: Basically, a lot the same as women. They--and women, too, had problems with being tokens. They would put black people in token positions that really didn&#8217;t have any power but they were there for show at pretty high levels. I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s completely gone away, but maybe, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s better now, but I remember a lawsuit that a person named Wes Motley brought. A friend of mine, Kitty Grubb, who had been an attorney at TVA, but who was now on her own, took his case and was able to win it for him. It was unusual to win a case against TVA. They just did a settlement because TVA employs very high-powered attorneys, and they&#8217;re always top in their graduating class. When I was at TVA, they would say that our legal staff was the largest law firm in the southeastern region. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s still true or not.
JD: So it was hard to&#8230;
NS: &#8230;It was hard to prevail. It really was. It was better not to even try. [Laughter] It was better to just find another job and move on. I had a lot of lateral positions when I did that, just moving in a lateral way rather than up.
JD: So what did your meetings look like at the FEW? Or how often did you meet? Do you remember?
NS: It was just a monthly meeting, but we also had a newsletter. In our newsletter, sometimes we tackled some pretty tough topics too. FEW was a real good support group at TVA when there weren&#8217;t that many women employees, particularly in the management area. You know, it&#8217;s an interesting thing; probably other people have mentioned this, but there was always a little antagonism between the clerical support staff and women who came in on the management schedule. We always tried to overcome that and we did some through FEW, but there was just a little of an antagonism. It was unfortunate.
JD: And why do you think that is?
NS: I&#8217;m not sure. Some of the clerical staff thought that the managers came in, and it was one thing to have men telling you what to do, but when a woman comes in and watches you work for her, it was just more than some of them wanted to deal with. So, there was a little bit differential treatment. It would have been a a patronistic society, so it was--I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true everywhere, but in the Southeast that was a little bit of an issue.
JD: What were some of the changes from when you started working at the TVA and then from when you retired, big changes that you saw?
NS: You know, by the time I retired, we had women on the TVA board and we had women leading major departments at TVA. It was quite a sea change, actually, but of course, I was there for twenty-five years. You&#8217;d expect something to happen in all that time, but we made a lot of progress, and minority employees made good progress too. I really don&#8217;t know if their progress was as great as what the women made though. I&#8217;d have to say, looking back at it, I hadn&#8217;t thought about it, but women basically fared better than minority employees.
JD: So then, how did you start becoming involved with working with inner-city kids, in going back to your earliest interests in the 1960s and the 1970s?
NS: It was so fascinating to me; I was working in economic development and because I had a background, people knew that I had a doctorate that had to do with human development and that I had had some education in my background. We had a board member whose name was Bill Kennoy. He was from Kentucky and he had been appointed by the first President Bush. He was an engineer by background, but he had a humanitarian soul, and when it got near his term--they had nine-year terms--they were appointed by the President of the United States, he wanted to leave something of value to the major cities in TVA. Well, he lived downtown in Knoxville, so on weekends he saw how all those buildings were just standing empty and he&#8217;d see kids out without the most productive way to use their weekends. He started thinking about the possibility of having the corporate offices open on weekends to help show the children that there&#8217;s a positive place in the future of their downtown communities. He called together, because he was at the board level, he was able to commandeer enough respect to pull together business leaders and education leaders and some TVA employees to develop this. I was one of the TVA employees who developed what became the Weekend Academy, and then I was selected to be the director of the Weekend Academy. First, it was a TVA program, but the first meeting I had with director Kennoy, he said, &#8220;Nan, we have to worry about the perpetuity of the Weekend Academy.&#8221; I remember laughing and thinking, &#8220;You know, here he is talking about the perpetuity; we haven&#8217;t recruited one child yet.&#8221; But that&#8217;s how a founder thinks. I said, &#8220;Would you like for us to work on, transition it to 501(3)(c) not-for-profit corporation?&#8221; He said, &#8220;That would be good.&#8221; So I had the luxury of getting to develop this Weekend Academy, and I had TVA attorneys to help me with my 501(c)(3) and business leaders to help me with my charter and bylaws and that sort of thing. So, for almost fourteen years now, we&#8217;ve had the Weekend Academy, and it&#8217;s still continuing to motivate and inspire today&#8217;s inner-city children to be tomorrow&#8217;s leaders. It&#8217;s just been such a great opportunity and it did allow me to go full-circle in my career in a way that I didn&#8217;t expect.
JD: So what programs did the Weekend Academy run?
NS: We focus on science, math and computers, trying to help the children to see themselves as having successful futures. We have a lot of career role models come in and talk about what they do; the children go on field trips to businesses. Just yesterday, the director of Weekend Academy, Lisa McClain, and I met with the editor of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, our local paper, about how our children could come over to the   News- Sentinel and learn about writing and how the paper is produced, because a lot of our children enjoy writing and are great writers. They&#8217;re third through fifth-grade kids and they come from the most disadvantaged schools in our area, but they&#8217;re selected by their guidance counselors and their principals and teachers as being children who have the most potential, but the least likelihood of having that potential realized. So, it&#8217;s just a fantastic group of children that we work with. We have high school tutor leaders; many of them now have grown up as they were first Weekend Academy students and now they&#8217;re tutor leaders for the Weekend Academy. We&#8217;re doing great time-wise.
JD: Yeah, we are. Have there been any major changes in the Weekend Academy program?
NS: The only changes have been in the ones that have dealt with finances. At first, we were statewide originally, and that meant that I had four sites and I had program managers or coordinators in each of those four cities. After I retired from TVA, I still worked with Weekend Academy. The board of the Weekend Academy selected me to continue as president, but finances were starting to be a problem, and TVA had helped us to get a good endowment but we were having to pull from our endowment. With the recession, our endowment wasn&#8217;t paying the amount of return that we had started out with. So, we ended up, just last year, having to--our executive director had to resign, and we went to managing the Weekend Academy in each of the four sites independently. So I&#8217;m now the board chair of the Knoxville Weekend Academy. The Memphis Academy is now under the Memphis Light, Gas and Water, and then Memphis City Schools. Chattanooga is under the Chattanooga YMCA. So we&#8217;ve had those organizational changes but the objectives are still the same.
JD: Is there anything that you want to add at this point in time? It&#8217;s been nice and--.
NS: Yeah, it&#8217;s been nice and relaxed, hasn&#8217;t it? Well, I&#8217;ve touched on pretty many of the high points. A couple of the jobs I had at TVA were interesting that I haven&#8217;t mentioned. One, I was the Federal Women&#8217;s Program manager, which was a great job in that I got to have speakers in programs, and we had during Women&#8217;s History Month, we had special programs that I would coordinate. Then also, when I was in economic development, one of my jobs was the Women on Business manager. We had a lot of workshops for women who were starting businesses. Also, I was responsible for making sure that women had access to TVA&#8217;s vast procurement needs that Women on Businesses were able to contract with TVA, and that was interesting. I ended up one day in Federal Court over that.   I had to go to Washington because I had said to one of the contractors that TVA had had problems in discriminating against women among the procurement businesses, which was true, but I didn&#8217;t realize at the time that this Woman on Business did not get a contract and then they cited me as saying that TVA discriminated. So I had to go up to Federal Court and testify, but once again, the Woman on Business was not successful against TVA&#8217;s powerful attorneys, but that was a learning experience for me. What we ended up saying was because TVA had had problems, that&#8217;s why I had the job I had, to try to correct those. Our percentages of procurement from Women on Businesses went up some, but it&#8217;s still not what it should be, but there aren&#8217;t enough Women on Businesses in a sense.   And you know, they were doing minority set-asides and I had actually talked to Marvin Runyon, who was the director of TVA at the time; he was the chairman of the board of directors. I had talked him into doing a woman&#8217;s set-aside program. I missed my plane in Memphis talking to him; had to spend the night in the Memphis airport. Do you know the very next day the headline of the paper was &#8220;MARVIN RUNYON RESIGNS AS CHAIRMAN OF TVA&#8221;? So, his agreement with me was just null and void. He had taken a position as Postmaster General of the United States, so that was null and void, but anyway. [Laughter] It&#8217;s very memorable, I&#8217;ll have to say. But I guess those are the only things I would like to bring up. I&#8217;ve also, here recently, been president of the League of Women Voters, the Knoxville chapter. We&#8217;ve had some really good programs and participated in a re-enactment women&#8217;s suffrage parade several years ago, and I was responsible for organizing the parade. We had banners like the women had carried in the women&#8217;s suffrage movement. I&#8217;m sure Wanda has told you some things about that.
JD: Oh, yes.
NS: So, it was a real hot day, August 23rd, but of course, it was a really hot day in Nashville the day that the women&#8217;s suffrage movement was passed by Tennessee. We were the pivotal state. That&#8217;s something we&#8217;re real proud of.
JD: I want to ask you just one more thing about the League of Women Voters. Nationally, the League of Women Voters often takes positions on community issues and positions on politics. How long have you been a member and what are some of the positions that the league has taken in terms of their study groups and--?
NS: I&#8217;ve been a member of the league for about five years, since I retired. One of the things we worked really hard on during the time I was president was immigration reform. That&#8217;s when I really became educated about the immigration issue. I&#8217;ve learned a lot in the league. We took a position, we voted here locally and we passed our position on up nationally. The League of Women Voters has a position on immigration that supports responsible immigration reform. Just recently, we have some issues in Knoxville around homelessness. We have a ten-year plan in Knoxville about ending chronic homelessness, and there are actually some groups now in Knoxville that have formed to turn that bill around so that it&#8217;s no longer a responsibility to have this long-range housing for homeless, because essentially, nobody wants homeless in their neighborhoods. So, the league is working on a position on that under--when you&#8217;re in the league, your positions have to fit under something that the national league is looking at too. But we were able to fit that one into one of the league&#8217;s positions. We&#8217;re going to support ending chronic homelessness here in the Knoxville community. Plus, we've done some work with environmental issues here in Knoxville. Our developers are really bad about not following the standards that are set, and the standards are pretty low anyway, so we&#8217;ve had a lot of problem with runoff. So, we have a land use plan that I worked on when I was president of the league.
JD: Well, thank you so much for your interview.
NS: You&#8217;re welcome, Jennifer. I hope that I said some things that you hadn&#8217;t heard before or some things that maybe validated some of the things you heard.
JD: It was nice to hear about the TVA because it was such a huge employer in these areas and it&#8217;s so vital to the community.
NS: It is. Basically, I hope I said some things that were positive about TVA. They&#8217;ve had a long way to go but they&#8217;ve made some progress and essentially, in the very beginning, TVA was the only place in this area that hired minority workers, so they always have. Most of the people in Knoxville who are African-American who have made achievements, the greatest achievements, have had at least part of their career at TVA. Even though I don&#8217;t think that they were given fair treatment, it&#8217;s been a stepping stone for a lot of people.
JD: Well, again, thank you so much and have a good day.
NS: You&#8217;re welcome, Jennifer.
