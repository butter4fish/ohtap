 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Wednesday April 23, 2008, and we   re in Stillwater,  Oklahoma interviewing Dr. Larry Claypool. Also joining me is Tanya  Finchum, another project investigator, and she may ask a few questions  during our time today. This interview is being conducted as part of O-STATE  Stories, an oral history project of the OSU Library. Thank you  for joining us today.  You   re welcome.  Well, let   s begin by learning a little more about you. If you could, just  take us through your early life, where you grew up.  Okay. I was born on a dairy farm in southwest Missouri, near  Springfield. My dad was a good farmer, I think, because he made a  pretty good living for us. In that part of the country most families grew  up on 40 to 60 acres and that wouldn   t be possible now with the standard  of living we have. Anyway, I went to Dadeville, Missouri schools,  graduated from high school. Then I went to what   s now the University  of Missouri at Rolla. At the time, it was the Missouri School of Mines.  It   s one of the land grant institutions in the state of Missouri. I was going  to be an engineer and decided I liked math better, so I had to transfer out  then to get a math major, because in those days you could only get an  engineering degree there. So I went to Southwest Missouri State. It   s  now Missouri State University. I got a BS  Bachelors of Science  degree  in education with certification to teach math in high school and also high  school physics. I did not do that.  I went to the University of Missouri at Columbia, got a master   s degree  in mathematics. From there, I taught one year at Baylor University.  While I was there, I was in an office where the woman who had been  5  there before left a lot of her textbook-type things that book salesmen  drop off. I had had one course in statistics and was somewhat skeptical  of what I could ever do with all this mathematics except prove more  theorems, and I wasn   t particularly interested in sitting behind a desk  and proving theorems. So I began to read her statistics books and  decided to go back to graduate school and get a PhD in Statistics. So I  checked out here  Oklahoma State University , Colorado State, and  Texas A M and ended up going to Texas A M at the time. I got my  degree there, and while I was there, Dr. Carl Marshall from the statistics  department here would come through Texas A M every so often  because Dr. Hartley, the head of the department, was his thesis advisor,  so they were good friends. So after a year or year and half of getting to  know him, he invited me to come up here for an interview.  I interviewed here as well as a number of other places, but the job that  was being offered here seemed to fit me better than the others. I was  really more interested in teaching, and I guess service type of work  rather than the basic research program of my own. So I built my career  here, roughly about half time teaching and the other half of the time  providing statistical consulting data analysis services to researchers and  graduate students on campus. That would be a bit more difficult to do in  today   s climate, but I built a pretty good career here. I came here in  1967, and I retired a year ago in 2007, so I was on the faculty here 40  years. During those 40 years, I   ve always been a big sports fan. I grew  up as a Saint Louis Cardinal baseball fan, so baseball and basketball  were my first two loves. I played a little high school basketball, wasn   t a  very good athlete, but I enjoyed playing nevertheless. So after I got here,  I attended just about all of the basketball, baseball, and football games  that have been over the last 40 some years.  As I said, most of my career here, I dealt with helping graduate students  with the statistics on their thesis, rather than having a research program  of my own, so I only had two PhD students of my own in all the time I  was here. That wouldn   t quite progress me along to associate professor  and full professor nowadays. I didn   t have very much in the way of  outside grants. I had a couple, but again that would have been a demerit,  I guess, in today   s climate. I came along at about the right time for my  interests. When I came here, I thought because of that idea, that I   d  probably only be able to survive here five to seven years and then I   d  have to move on to maybe one of the state colleges or something like  that, but with this consulting and data analysis interest, I was able to  build quite a good career for myself.  I enjoyed my career here. I typically say I enjoyed all of it except for the  four years I was a department head. That was a little more stress, mainly  that I put on myself rather than outside stress, but I enjoyed the other  6  Finchum  Claypool  aspects better than being an administrator. Now, I don   t know whether  you want to know anything more. That   s kind of a capsule view of me in  the last so many years.  What was campus like in 1967 when you came?  There was somewhere between 12,000 and 15,000 students on campus  at the time. When I was at Texas A M, just before I came here, that was  still a military school pretty well, at least the undergraduate portions of  it. Officially, it was an all male school, so that when I came here, the  campus here was very much like the one at Texas A M except there  were women on campus here. At Texas A M while I was there, if you  were a woman, you had to be the wife or daughter of a faculty member  or student, or be majoring in something that was not offered at one of the  other state schools, in order for women to be accepted as students. Just  as I was leaving, they were beginning to if you applied they wouldn   t  turn you down because they didn   t want to face a possible law suit. I left  in the summer of 1967, and shortly after that they openly began to admit  women, and they   re a huge campus now, 40,000 or so. But the one here  was two-thirds the number of students that   s here now.  One of the things I remember when I first came here was that the  buildings were not air conditioned. The new ones they were beginning to  build were air conditioned. When I first came here, the Math Sciences  Building was a year from being opened. Life Sciences West was just  maybe a semester later than that. And the end of Ag Hall, out next to  Monroe Street, was being added at the time. It was maybe two years  after I got here that all three of those were air conditioned. Then they  began to add air conditioning to the older buildings on campus also.  That   s probably one of the things students now a days would find most  difficult to deal with. And it still happens when graduate students come  in here, particularly from the northern tier of the states, for a fall  semester. You know, late August, early September, is very warm around  here, so even with the air conditioning, why they   re not quite used to the  heat and humidity combination.  But as far as campus itself in the middle to late 1960s, we had some of  the unrest here on campus dealing with the integration type thing. There  were a few incidents here, but none of them were what you read about in  the newspapers anyway, not that serious. There were one or two  incidents where, I believe some of the athletes, including some men   s  basketball players anyway, sort of boycotted games for a while during  that time. There were some clashes on campus, but none of them that  caught any attention other than locally, I   d say. That   s basically about all  I remember in terms of just campus and student activities during the first  several years I was here.  7  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Well, one of the main reasons we   re really excited to speak to you is  because of your interest and involvement with women   s basketball here  at Oklahoma State. How did your interest develop with the women?  Well, I guess because I am a sports fan to start with, and women   s  basketball started as an intercollegiate sport, like in 1973   the fall of  1973 I believe. That was one other sporting event to go to that I had  some interest in. That   s basically how it started out. In those days, they  were playing all of their games in the Colvin Center. I probably attended  two or three games over there. That was, I believe, just one year before  freshman became eligible to participate in varsity sports, NCAA   National Collegiate Athletic Association . There was a freshmen men   s  team that played a preliminary game prior to the regularly scheduled  basketball games. Well when freshmen became eligible, there was no  longer this freshmen men   s team, so they occasionally would have a  women   s game as a preliminary. So that began to spark my interest in  that team as well.  Like I said, I had seen them play two or three games previously, but as  they began to play a preliminary game I got more familiar with the girls  that were playing and this sort of thing. So I guess over the years, with  my interest in basketball, I got interested in watching. Now when I came  to Oklahoma, certainly the high school game was still three women on  defense and three women on offense, and they didn   t cross midcourt. I  was not familiar with that at all, so I didn   t have that kind of  background. The women just played pretty much the same kind of  basketball game that the men played, and I enjoyed watching them play.  What was the attendance like back in those early days at the Colvin  Center?  Oh, at the Colvin Center there   d be some parents there. I don   t know  how many you   d say, but maybe as many as ten or fifteen fans there that  weren   t in some sense working the game. I have been to a couple of  games over Christmas holidays when the women would play over in  Gallagher Hall, and maybe me and Ada Van Whitley were possibly the  only two fans there that weren   t working the game in some capacity. So  in the early days   in fact, probably until at least the late 1980s here,  there weren   t very many people there as fans, other than maybe some  parents. Down through the years, most of our players, until recently,  have been Oklahoma kids. So parents, for the most part, didn   t live too  far away, and they attended a lot of games. That was probably a lot of  the fan base for many years.  Well, let   s talk a little bit about the early coaches of Cowgirl basketball.  8  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Okay. To start with, women   s basketball here was a club sport. I don   t  know a whole lot of the details there. I   ve done some reading back when  I was putting together a record book and this sort of thing. It turned out  that sometimes four or six schools in the state would maybe get together  on a weekend and have a tournament-type thing. There was a state  tournament sometime late in the season, where the junior colleges and  the what then was called the teacher   s colleges, directional schools in the  state, OU and OSU would get together so many of those teams and have  a    state tournament.     Ada Van Whitley was, to my understanding, the coach during all or  most of those years that women   s basketball was a club sport. I believe it  was the 1973-1974 school year when they became an intercollegiate  sport. A woman named Jacy Showers, J-A-C-Y I believe was her first  name, was the coach for three years. Then I believe in 1976-1977  Brenda Johnson was coach one year. Then Judy Bugher came in and was  here 1977 through 1983 for six years, I believe. Then in 1983, Dick  Halterman came in. He came in with a record of having won some  national junior college tournaments. He had an outstanding record, won-loss  record in his junior college teams and brought Jack Easley in as an  assistant coach, and the two of them were here for, I believe it was 19  years, through 2002, maybe. Then for three years we had Julie  Goodenough, who also had an outstanding record at a small school in  Texas. I   ve forgotten specifically which one it was, but I believe it was a  NAIA  National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics  school. She  was here for three years, and now Coach Kurt Budke has been here from  2005 to 2008. And of course this year was a super year for him. But  that   s sort of a rundown of the coaches that were here. Back in the early  years I don   t know anything about the tenure of these coaches.  It wasn   t too unusual in those days for a head coach, particularly of a  woman   s sport, to maybe also be a graduate student at the institution.  We had one incident here, at least a volleyball coach, who was a  graduate student here. Joanne Rutherford was a volleyball coach  somewhere in that middle 1970s era. She then went on to the University  of Missouri and became head women   s basketball coach, and had a very  outstanding career. Another one that started out as a graduate assistant, a  name that   s well known, is Pat Summit of the University of Tennessee. I  believe her first two years there maybe, that was maybe in effect her  graduate assistantship or something. She was a head coach though. In  those days it wasn   t that unusual. I don   t know whether Jacy Showers  and Brenda Johnson, whether that was their job being head coach, or if  one of them maybe was a graduate student at the same time. I don   t  know that.  Now during those early years in the AIAW  Association for  9  Claypool  Finchum  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Intercollegiate Athletics for Women , where did the team play?  They played both in the Colvin Center and in Gallagher Hall. Let   s see,  AIAW went through the 1981-1982 year, I believe. Starting in 1982-  1983 was the beginning of NCAA for women   s sports. I am of the  opinion   I don   t know this for sure   that probably the first two years  anyway, maybe more than that, they played almost all of their games in  the Colvin Center. Starting in the fall of 1974, they began to play a  preliminary game in Gallagher Hall. It was Gallagher Hall then rather  than Gallagher-Iba. Then they began to occasionally play as the only  event there. I don   t remember just which year that would have been. I  know they were probably playing as the only event there during the first  three years anyway because I remember seeing Jacy Showers there  coaching in some games when that was the only event that day or  evening.  Probably one of the things you   re interested in is early on when they   d  play as the only event in Gallagher Hall, with about two minutes or so  left in the game, the person on the loud speaker would have everybody  pick up their coke cups and their popcorn boxes and put them in the  trash, because when the girls dressed after the game, they had to sweep  out the floor. Of course here recently when they had an alumni function,  something like that was mentioned by two or three different ones of the  women that were back for that alumni function, the girls that play now  don   t have to sweep out the floor anymore. So that   s something of an  indication of the way that women   s basketball has risen in stature, come  to the front.  Of course pretty much the same thing all across campus happened.  Different departments on campus, for example the one I   m in, when I  first came here there were no women faculty members at all, and very  few women graduate students. Now, over half of our faculty is female.  So as you   re quite well aware, that   s sort of the evolution of the woman  as a person, I guess you   d say, over the years. It   s not such a male  dominated society anymore, which is a good thing.  Did the boys have to clean up the gym after their games?  No (Laughter), they didn   t have to. Or at least if they did, I   m not aware  of it. There was never any caution that you should pick up your  disposables anyway, just at a women   s game.  What was the attendance like once the women moved over to Gallagher?  Did it improve? Was there a buzz on campus?  No, I don   t think so. It was a sort of a thing that unless you specifically  10  Finchum  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  had an interest in it or something , no. I don   t remember there being  much of a buzz at all on campus for women   s basketball. During the  early years, we didn   t have teams that had outstanding records. Of  course that   s part of it, but in those days college athletics was more for  the students really. It wasn   t such a money geared thing as it is now.  Once you got past men   s basketball and football and wrestling here, the  other sports suffered attendance wise. And of course over a period of  time, some of the others have gained quite a bit in attendance. Wrestling,  for example, has nowhere near the big draw that it was up through  somewhere in the middle to late 1970s anyway.  When Title IX came in, that had an impact on wrestling. A lot of schools  dropped wrestling in an attempt to balance things between women   s  scholarships and men   s scholarships. I don   t know what percentage of  schools have wrestling now as compared to say 1975. The old Big Eight  had at least five wrestling schools, and those are still the only five  wrestling schools in the Big Twelve. For a number of years, I believe in  wrestling it was the case, every national champion had had a coach who  wrestled at one of the schools in either Oklahoma or Iowa, I think. I  don   t know exactly how that goes, but something like that. So wrestling  was a big deal, up until maybe the 1980s. And of course, as you know  now, you don   t hear very much about wrestling.  Women   s basketball was something that was definitely considered a  minor sport. There wasn   t a very big influx of new fans when they  started playing in Gallagher Hall. Most of the time there were more than  were over in the Colvin Center, but not that many, no. I don   t know  how long it was before they probably had an attendance of 100 fans. It  was probably several years before they ever got to the 100 mark, is my  guess.  Did they have cheerleaders?  No, I don   t think so. I don   t remember them. Now of course when they  played as a preliminary game, probably at least the second half the  cheerleaders showed up. I don   t specifically remember cheerleaders  when they were the only event there.  Well, what about uniforms?  Well, their uniforms were in many ways pretty much the same as they  are now, except both men   s and women   s uniforms had briefer shorts.  They didn   t come all the way to the knees type of thing. They were more  fitted type uniforms than you see now. They weren   t as baggy as they  are now. They went through a period of time, I believe when Judy  Bugher was here, when they had some wild looking uniforms, I   ll say.  11  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  They had different shades of orange and maybe some black stripes that  went horizontally around the body. Kind of patterned after the Houston  Astros baseball team   had a similar type thing. That   s what the first  impression was when they showed up with those stripped uniforms. I  don   t know how many years they had those, probably three to five years.  At least the first year I think Dick Halterman was here we still had those  stripped uniforms. But yeah, they were different all right. But other than  those stripes, the uniforms, they weren   t anything like the dress type  uniforms you see for women   s basketball, certainly back in the 1930s.  No, they were more just a jersey with fitted shorts. I   ll say it that way.  You mentioned earlier that back then it was really more about the  student. At what point did athletic scholarships start to enter the  equation within women   s basketball?  I don   t know exactly what year, but it had to have been possibly 1976 or  so, the fall semester. I believe it   s the case that Donna Ridling was the  first woman to receive any sort of scholarship help as a female athlete on  this campus. There are a total of three women that I know and have  talked to who claim to be the first and I think there   ll all correct with a  technicality. Donna is one of them, and then Sharon Voskuhl whose play  overlapped with Donna in those years. I suspect that she may have been  the first freshman to come in with any athletic assistance at all, freshman  female. And Rhonda Kite, who people know better as Rhonda Fields  nowadays, the mother of Josh Fields, the quarterback/baseball player  here, she also makes that claim, and I think it   s quite possible that she  may have been the first female athlete to come in with what may have  been termed a full athletic scholarship.  So in the progression of giving athletic assistance to women, that could  be the reason you may read in the paper or at least in talking to these  three women, each one of them has some claim to being the first female  scholarship athlete at OSU. I do know in talking with Ada Van Whitley  and the information that she has from Coach Judy Bugher, I think it   s  pretty well safe to say that Donna Ridling was the first one to receive  athletic assistance. Now there   s a fourth woman that enters into that  equation. A woman named Terre Reese that could have been about the  same time that Donna received the first assistance, Terre could have  also. These four women I   ve just named at one time were one, two,  three, and four on the all-time scoring list here too. I don   t know the  specifics there, but I can easily see that with some technicalities why all  three or four of those women could have some claim to being the first   female  scholarship athlete.  Take me through the statistics landscape back in the old AIAW. Did  they keep good statistics, good records?  12  Claypool  Well, yes and no. Back when we first started playing intercollegiate  basketball, they kept primarily points and rebounds probably. The thing  like assists and blocked shots, steals, turnovers those didn   t come until  later, probably near the end of the 1970s. As far as here at OSU, a bank  of records somewhere, in 1986, when I started trying to put together a  record book, there basically wasn   t anything like that. I went back to old  media guides. They put out a little media guide each year, and what it  would amount to was sort of the summary of the girls that had played  the previous year and maybe how many points and rebounds they had,  how many games they played in, and that was probably about it. That   s  where I got a lot of my information to start with was in those kinds of  things. There was some more information from year to year, but again,  initially, points and rebounds were about the only things they began to  work with.  Now there was a woman that played at the University of Kansas. Her  name is Lynette Woodard. I believe she graduated up there in the spring  of 1980. Anyway, her freshman and sophomore years they did not keep  some of these things like steals and assists and blocked shots. By the  time she finished her eligibility, she had records and I know assists and  steals from just her last two years, and I believe she finished in 1980,  that stood until the early to mid 1990s. Of course when they transferred  over from AIAW to NCAA, some of those things like records that  Lynette Woodard had no longer show up anywhere because they   re not  recognized by the NCAA, they   re not NCAA records.  In the old Big Eight, I know, on both the points list and the rebounds list,  it was always a race for second place, because Lynette was so far ahead  of everybody that that wasn   t even in the question. We had a girl here in  the late 1980s, Clinette Jordan, who finished second on one of those lists  and third on the other one. She basically needs her totals at the end of  her junior year added on in order to catch Woodard. Woodard was the  kind of a player, almost like putting a Michael Jordan on a high school  team. Whenever Kansas needed to score, she   d score, either that or  pretend like she was going to and drop the ball off to one of her  teammates who was wide open when all the defense collapsed on  Woodard.  But keeping steals her last two years, I believe we had a girl, Liz Brown,  who broke her steals record in 1991, at least 11years later. Woodard had  just two years, and Liz Brown was Player of the Year in the Big Eight  the year she broke that record, and she played four years. Stacy Coffey  came along later, and she was, I believe, the second person to beat  Woodard   s steals record. And again, two years for Woodard and four  years for Stacy Coffey and the girl from Kansas State that already had  broken it.  13  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  So because of some of those records not being kept in the first place, the  women who played early on maybe don   t show up in some record books  like they would like to have or should have, actually. When they  switched over from the AIAW to NCAA, and Ada Van Whitley can  probably talk more at this than I can, but there were some boxes of  records, just records in general that were misplaced or lost or something  like that. That   s the kind of explanation I got anyway when I was trying  to look for the records that had to do with statistics for women   s  basketball. So I   m not sure where the miscommunication or  misconnection was in there.  Well, what prompted you to take on this career record book in the first  place?  When Dick Halterman came, he and his assistant Jack Easley began to  want to have some additional information about each of their players.  Halterman lived right down the street from me, so I became friends with  him. He began to ask things like,    Can you tell me on the average how  long a girl plays between points or between fouls,    or between this or  something like that, and I said,    Yeah, I can probably get you that kind  of information if I had a box score from each of the games.    He said,     Done,    so immediately I began getting a box score for each and every  game. I started doing some things like that, just taking the summary for  each girl up to this point in the season and she played so many minutes,  scored so many points, so on the average how many minutes between  points type of thing.  Then from that, I guess my interest as much as theirs, I remembered  Donna Ridling had this great career and we started asking questions  maybe about how many people had scored a 1000 points here when they  arrived. Well, it turned out that only Donna Ridling and Rhonda Kite-  Fields had scored a 1,000 points by 1980 anyway. There was another  one, Charmaine Johnson that got in there in about 1982, before  Halterman arrived. It was just an interest of mine, I guess, that kind of  spurred me to try to develop a record book. The first one or two editions  of that I think, I   d have to go back and look, probably had things dealing  with points and rebounds and maybe steals and assists, and that was  about it to start with.  In the process of trying to find information, there was this matter of just  boxes of records for women playing club sports and intercollegiate  sports that were missing that had some of the information I needed.  There was also the year that Brenda Johnson was here. There weren   t,  apparently, any records kept. I ended up talking to at least eight of the  girls who played that year, talked to them on the phone, and none of  them had a page of statistics for the team on that year. In our record  14  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  book listings, there   s a heading on some of the things that says there   s  essentially no records for the 1976-1977 year. In fact, on the point  scoring, at the top of that, I have 1976-1977 records for Reese, Ridling  and Voskuhl only. That was those three totals for that year, they were  the high scorers, and for some reason or other, there was a total number  of points for those three girls.  That was basically all the statistics we had for that one year, with one  exception. Tom Dirato who worked on the radio and that sort of thing  with sports here for a number of years, back in those years he was  writing for the Oklahoma Journal, I believe was the name of that  newspaper down there. So every once in a while, he would have a story  on a Cowgirl basketball game that would indicate somebody got so  many rebounds and this sort of thing. So I went through his stories that  year and pieced together some rebound information for some of those  kids that played that one year. Otherwise, no one seemed to have  anything in the way of statistics that one year.  After that though, there was a pretty good summary at least, for the  entire year that may have included how many field goals they made out  of so many shots, how many free throws they made out of how many  shots. So that after that 1977 year when Judy Bugher came, we began to  get information that was pretty easy to go back and put in a database for  record book purposes. But that one year there   s virtually no information  of a record nature there, and the girls didn   t have any either. I found that  unusual because my experience had been, even with high school teams,  at the end of the season, there was some sort of a summary, but there  wasn   t that one year.  There   s not a lot of information about her either in that whole year.  No, huh-uh. I hesitate to say this. I did talk to her on the phone when I  was trying to gather information, and just suffice to say, she wasn   t  interested in talking to me. So I don   t know what the situation was her  one year and when she left. But no, no one seems to. And see at that  time I was only about ten years, less than ten years removed from when  she was here. There just didn   t seem to be much said about her.  Well, do you think other teams were thinking about statistics the same  way Coach Halterman was, to analyze it at that time?  Yeah, I think so. Now as far as a career record book, I guess one of the  things that spurred me to start this was that most of the other schools in  the Big Eight at the time did have some sort of media guide that had, in  the back of it, some information about their leading scorers and their  leading rebounders, and leading this and leading that, and we basically  15  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  didn   t. In fact, when I started doing some things for Halterman and  Easley, that first year, or one year anyway, when they went to the Big  Eight Tournament, there was some sort of a tournament media guide  printed.  There was a student who worked part time over in athletics that got  assigned women   s basketball in those days. And this student, any  statistics or summary that he or she put out for the media was things that  they   d take a box score and another box score and with pencil and paper  start adding up totals and this sort of thing. It wasn   t anything printed, it  was just something he or she had written on paper. One of those years in  there, either 1986 or 1987, the guy who was assigned to women   s  basketball began to ask me if he could use some of my figures when it  came time to put together this media guide for the Big Eight  Tournament. And I said,    Sure, go ahead.     I think that was probably one of the first times OSU had anything at the  Big Eight Tournament in terms of statistics that had been developed for  the whole season you know, other than just, here   s our leading scorer  and by adding up her numbers all season, she has this many points, and  here   s our leading rebounder and it looks like she has this many  rebounds. That was apparently about all we had up until that point in  time.  So at what point did the phone start ringing and you started to field all  of these questions about Cowgirl statistics? Surely people were  interested in what you were putting together.  Well, they were, but see with sports information here, there was a shield  in there between me and the public, let   s say. I was the one that supplied,  for a number of years, most of the information they got printed on a  statistics nature for Cowgirl basketball. In the late 1980s when Clinette  Jordan was moving up the charts and closing in on second place for both  points and rebounds, why then the Big Eight office would call Sports  Information over here and ask for this or that bit of information on  Clinette Jordan. Invariably they   d get the statement,    Well, we   ll have to  check on that and we   ll get back to you.    So somewhere in all of this,  there were two or three people in the Big Eight office who I had talked  to on the phone in terms of clarification of certain things that initially  maybe looked like discrepancies, and I got explanations for them so they  were aware of my name.  One incident did occur where a fellow called down here to Sports  Information wanting some information on Clinette Jordan, and they said,     We   ll have to check on that,    so the guy said,    Why don   t you just give  me Larry Claypool   s number and I   ll call him directly.    So that created  16  Finchum  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  maybe a little bit of tension at the time, but that was the only type of  incident that ever occurred of that nature at all. I had a good working  relationship with them over there, I   d have to say that. So for the most  part, I did not field that kind of information. Now, Tony Holt, one of the  Holt brothers here in town with the NewsPress, I became good friends  with him. He would call me every once in a while and talk to me in  terms of a story he was going to write or something like that. Other than  that, I was pretty well shielded from the public.  Were you getting paid early on to do this?  No, it was more a matter of   I guess I was a frustrated athlete, so having  these two friends who were coaches in most any sport, that happened to  be women   s basketball, I enjoyed being part of the program in a way. In  some sense as a volunteer, I guess. During the years that Halterman and  Easley were here, a lot of those years anyway, I traveled with the team  on weekends quite a bit. In those days, we usually traveled with two  vans. We   d rent a couple of vans out here at the motor pool. So when I   d  go along, I was willing to drive the van, or when we got to where we  were, I   d help carry bags and luggage into the hotel, and things like that.  The fact that I was willing to go and help out, plus I did quite a bit of  tutoring when I   d go on one of those trips. So those things made me  welcome to go most of the time. I think they mentioned a time or two  that a lot of people who went sort of went along as a free ride.  The thing that really surprised me the first time or two that I ever went  with them was this tutoring thing. I   d spend, you know a lot of times  we   d leave Friday at noon and get back sometime late Sunday, and I  might spend anywhere from four to ten hours tutoring girls in various  classes they might be taking that involved some quantitative things. It  wasn   t always a math class, not always a statistics class, but things that  involved some sort of algebraic type calculations or something like that,  and I enjoyed doing that, of course. They always invited me to go along  the week before finals. Fall semester, that   s when they wanted me to go  along. I never went on any of those trips, because I had my own finals to  get ready for and this sort of thing, but I enjoyed that. And still, from  time to time, I   ll see a parent at a game here that will comment to me on  having spent time helping the girls with various ones of their subjects.  So, from a personal point of view, obviously that makes me feel good.  Well, I   m sure it was very rewarding.  Yes, it was. Of course in some sense you had to be careful in terms of  compliance type issues. While we were gone on road trips I could do  that. I pretty much avoided that when they were at home and this sort of  thing, because I didn   t do it for students in general you see. I couldn   t  17  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  pick out just the female women   s basketball players and tutor them,  because that would get into compliance issues. But apparently there was  no problem when I did it on road trips.  What are some of the more interesting experiences you remember from  your days on the road?  Well, let   s see. I guess one of the most interesting ones was when we  went to Las Vegas to a tournament between Christmas and New Years.  This would have been Christmas of 1988, I believe it was. At that time,  OSU was using a travel agent, I believe, out of Utah   I   m not sure if  this is correct   for    the minor sports.    I know at least wrestling was  involved, because their season was going along with women   s  basketball. Anyway, somehow when we got ready to leave, a day or two  after Christmas, there was some mix up on tickets. So we were delayed  flying out of Oklahoma City, because I think the tickets had gone to the  wrong location and weren   t available to us until just a short time before  the plane was supposed to take off. We got to Denver, I believe is where  we made a connection to go to Las Vegas, and our plane was somewhat  late. Well they had already, I believe, put some standby people on this  plane, thinking we weren   t going to get there. Well, we got there, so a  few standby people were disgruntled because they got removed.  While we were in Vegas, we still didn   t have tickets for our return flight.  Early the morning we were supposed to leave Vegas, Coach Halterman  went to the airport and checked on the ticket information, and yes, the  tickets were there. There were two groups of us. There was one group of  maybe ten fans or so, maybe a dozen, that were flying back to Oklahoma  City. The team was going to fly to Kansas City and rent a couple of vans  and drive to Omaha for a game with Creighton. It turned out that the  tickets were there, but the group that was flying back to Oklahoma City  was leaving at 7 a.m., I believe it was, instead of 9 a.m. So Coach  Halterman called Coach Easley, I was rooming with Easley, and told  him the situation that these people going back to Oklahoma City, their  plane was going to leave at 7 a.m. So he instructed Easley to have me go  get the van and for Easley to call everybody. This was already 4:30 or  five o   clock in the morning. So he got everybody called and we got them  to the airport, and everybody got on that plane. I was going to go to  Omaha with the team, so the rest of us went to Omaha.  We got to Kansas City. As I said, we rented two vans and drove to  Omaha. After we played the game at Creighton and came back to  Kansas City, the flight we were on to Oklahoma City had been canceled,  but they had put us on a different flight. Having put us on a different  flight, we had to pay for the tickets there. So it turned out that the two  coaches had maxed out their credit cards on various things there in  18  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Vegas, so we put about 22 tickets at about 50 or 55 dollars a piece on my  credit card. Just a few days later, from OSU, I got a check to reimburse,  but this was the first few days of the new year. I think it was mid-summer  or so before the university ever got reimbursed from this travel  agency. Needless to say, that travel agency didn   t last long with OSU.  Wrestling had had a few other types of incidents take place also.  You mentioned in earlier meetings with me about a road trip. I think it  was a preseason road trip.  Oh, yeah. Back in   I forgot in what years it was   it was possible for us  to have scrimmage games at the home high school of various ones of  girls on the team. One trip in particular that I remember we made a trip  to Guymon. We had Jennifer Hepner who played on the team like 1987  to 1991, I guess. So we went out there to play a scrimmage game before  the season started. We took two sets of uniforms, and half the team was  road uniforms and half the team was home white uniforms, and played a  game at Guymon High School. But going out there, instead of taking  two vans, we took a motor home. It turned out that somehow OSU had  come into ownership of a motor home through a divorce settlement, so  we took that motor home. Everybody was on bunk beds. It didn   t have  seats like a bus.  Also, Coach Easley drove his checker cab. He had one of these old  checker cabs, so there were four or five of our party that rode with him  out there in this yellow checker cab. We played that game in Guymon,  and then we came back through Cheyenne, Oklahoma, where Jodi Fisher  was from. She was on that same team. And we played a scrimmage  game on Sunday afternoon there. The one in Guymon must have been on  a Saturday afternoon or Saturday evening. We stayed all night in  Guymon, then drove most of the morning to Cheyenne and played a  game there in the afternoon, and then came home. But that motor home  trip was a different experience for sure.  Were those popular, the preseason games in their hometowns? Did a lot  of people turn out?  Well, a lot of teams had scrimmages various places. I don   t know  whether to answer that yes or no. It was allowed, so we did it for two or  three years anyway. We   d do a couple of scrimmages maybe on  somebody   s home court. I remember we went one year down south  toward Hugo. We had a girl on the team, Althea Cox that was from  Grant, Oklahoma, between Hugo and the state line. We had also signed a  girl early from Yuba, Oklahoma. Yuba is in one of the little U-shaped  crooks of the Red River down there, I believe somewhere east of  Ardmore, between Ardmore and Hugo somewhere. Anyhow, Yuba was  19  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  a place, as I recall, that had a service station. That was all there was in  town. I   m not sure they even had a post office. They had this service  station, and I think the building for that service station was a mobile  home. Then there was this high school out in the country there. We  played scrimmage games at at least three high schools like that that were  just kind of out in the middle of nowhere, no town along with it. I think  a lot of those probably were schools that had cropped up during the oil  days.  What were some of the other places you ended up visiting?  We went to Grant, Oklahoma one year. Althea Cox was on the team, and  she came from Grant. That   s a little team south of Hugo, between Hugo  and the Red River down there. Somewhere back west of there, along the  Red River, is the little community of Yuba, Y-U-B-A. We had signed a  girl there, Lorri Hagood I believe was her name, and she was still a  senior in high school. We played a scrimmage game there on this trip to  Grant. Yuba, I don   t remember that as really being a town. There was a  high school there, and I remember a gas station. You wouldn   t call it a  service station, because I think they just pump gas. The building, I  believe, may have been something like a mobile home. I don   t remember  if there was a post office there or not, but that   s all I remember of the  little town, I call it town, of Yuba. That was one of three different places  that I remember going with them to, where we had a scrimmage, that  didn   t really have a town associated with them.  Shelly Blessing was from Indianola, I believe it was, High School, and  as I recall, this high school, I forgot what town it was close to, but it was  somewhere in that southeastern part of Oklahoma. At least immediately  around it, there wasn   t a town. Now it may have been half a mile or  three-quarters of a mile down the road or something. It was a large  frame, wooden building, maybe one of the larger wooden buildings in  Oklahoma at one time. The high school had this gymnasium as part of  the building complex, so it was kind of a spread out, one building type  thing, and it was a wooden frame building.  We also played a scrimmage game one year at Moss, Oklahoma, over in  the Holdenville area, I believe. This school was out in the middle of the  country. It was a ways from Holdenville actually, and part of these  places anyway, had kind of sprung up as school associated with the oil  boom, I believe. So they had some facilities there and just kept adding  on to them. I   m now forgetting. It seems like there was a fourth one of  those. My memory hasn   t put it all together yet. There were a number of  years in there where we would play two or three scrimmage games on  the home court of one of the girls. Some of them would be local, pretty  close here, where in just a few minutes we could drive over there and  20  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Finchum  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Finchum  Claypool  drive back. One of them was at Morrison, and one of them was at  Cashion, I believe it was, down here southwest of Stillwater. Then  sometime in the early1990s, I think it was, 1992 or 1993, the NCAA no  longer allowed that, so of course we quit that when that happened.  Did the girls really enjoy it? Was it like a homecoming?  Oh yes. Yes it was. They   d introduce the players, they   d introduce say  the black team and introduce the white team. The white team always  included the local girl. And of course the local girl was probably the last  one introduced, and there was a big round of applause for her. Yeah, it  was a big deal for the individual girls.  Anything unique about the courts?  There was, particularly this one at Yuba. If I remember correctly, when  you walk in, it was raised up maybe knee-high, and you could walk, I  believe, all the way around that court. The seating was to the side, and  there was a rail down there. I think there was just a walkway between  this rail and the court. The court was maybe knee-high or something like  that. That   s the only one of them that I remember that sort of brought  back the days when I was in high school and we played on courts that  there sometimes wasn   t hardly room to put a court in that room or  building. This was like a community building or center that had been  redone or something like that. I don   t remember all of the details, but  something about when you   d walk in, that court was higher than the  level where you walked in, anyway.  What about in Morrison?  Oh, Morrison. Yeah, it was unique in that it had a carpeted floor. I  assume it was maybe concrete underneath; it could have been a wooden  floor. They had this red carpet with black stripes for out of bounds and  circles and various things like that. I don   t remember all of the details,  but the one thing I do remember is when they   d bounce the ball going up  and down the court, you had the usual sound reduction that you would  imagine in bouncing a ball on a carpeted floor. When you   d sit there and  just watch the game, the noise was a totally different experience than  you think of on a hardwood floor. I believe that the only one of those  kinds of courts I ever saw.  I   m assuming most of these were not air conditioned either, in those  days.  Well, by the time we   re talking about here, probably most of them were.  Earlier on they probably had not been. See in those days when we were  21  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  playing these scrimmage games, probably 1987 to 1992 type of vintage,  so most of those were air conditioned at the time, but some of those  older courts, like the older Morrison court, probably was not. Now when  Gallagher-Iba was renovated somewhere during that period, Morrison  had built a new gym, and I believe the Cowgirls did some of their  practicing up there on that court, which is ten or twelve miles north of us  here. They did some practicing there, and I think some out here at the  high school here in Stillwater. I believe we played at least one of our  games at the Stillwater High School. I forgot who that was we played  one year there early in the season as they were getting ready to open  Gallagher Hall back up.  It seems that with these preseason games occurring in different parts of  Oklahoma, was the team pretty much all Oklahoman?  Yeah, most of the years through there, I would say there were as many  as two to four girls that were non-Oklahoma girls. I particularly  remember going to Denton one time with them to play North Texas  State, and probably at least half of the team was from the southern part  of Oklahoma, and a couple of girls from the Dallas area that year. I   d  say over half the team had parents there at that North Texas State game.  It was closer for them to go to Denton than it was to come to Stillwater.  And when Halterman and Easley first came here, Halterman brought his  two stars from his junior college team. They had just finished their  sophomore season. Kathy Schulz and Jackie Glosson came here. They  were two girls that scored 1,000 points apiece in junior college and came  here and scored 1,000 points apiece. I believe it was the case that for  their four years of playing together, they were within ten points of each  other, having over 2,000 points apiece. One of them scored just a few  more points in junior college, and they flip-flopped when they came  here. The other one scored just a few more points here. They are two of  the three girls that we   ve had come in here from junior college who  scored 1,000 points after they reached here.  The other one was Rhonda Kite-Fields. She had gone to, I believe it was,  Eastern State College in Oklahoma. By the way, she went there because  I believe they offered her a full athletic scholarship, and at the time OSU  could not. So she played two years of junior college, and then I  speculated she may have been the first female to come in here with a full  scholarship. She came in here and played two years here then and scored  over 1,000 points. So those are the three junior college transfers, I  believe those are the only three that we had, that scored 1,000 points  after they got here. We   ve had a lot of other junior college transfers, but  none of them scored 1,000 points after they got here. All three of those  had scored 1,000 points in junior college too.  22  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Finchum  Claypool  Finchum  Claypool  After all of your analysis with the record book, I   m sure you   ve become  pretty familiar with a lot of these girls and where they   re from. Have  you noticed any trends with Oklahoma hot spots for producing women   s  basketball players?  No, I don   t think so. Other than there was a period of years in there in  the latter part of the 1980s where we recruited a number of players  probably out of the southeastern quadrant of the state. I   m not sure why  that is. It could have to do with a lot of maybe smaller schools down in  there, girls who gain more notoriety playing in a smaller school, where  they really stood out above all the ones they played with and against.  But no, I don   t think I would say there was a hot spot, other than that  southeastern quadrant. For a number of years we did have a number of  players that came out of southeastern Oklahoma.  We   ve had players from pretty well all over the state. We have three  women who were assistant coaches here after they finished their careers.  One of them was Rae Rippetoe. Her last name is Blair now. She is now a  head women   s coach at the University of Texas at San Antonio. She was  an assistant coach here for a while. And Clinette Jordan was an assistant  coach here for a couple of years. Clinette got her bachelor   s degree in  four years and then stayed on a couple of years and got a master   s  degree. So she was an assistant coach while she was here as a master   s  student. And Jennifer Hepner also spent, I believe it was two years here  as an assistant coach. Those are the only ones that I believe spent time as  an assistant coach after they played here. I can   t think of any others that  did.  Then Rhonda Kite-Fields coached girls    basketball out here at the high  school. I   m sure there are others that I   m not remembering that have  coached high school girls basketball. She was most recently here at  Stillwater and just moved to Jenks for the past season, so she   s a name  that comes to mind.  Did they live in the dorm together like the men?  Yeah, they lived in different ones of the dorms on campus, but they lived  kind of in the same general section. Then there was a period of time  where a number of them lived off campus also. There   d be two or three  or four of them living in an apartment.  Well when you were traveling to these far away places, what did you do  for food during the early days?  Well, a lot of times we   d stop at a place that had a buffet to kind of  accommodate the different tastes and wishes of the people. If you drive  23  Finchum  Claypool  Finchum  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  Nykolaiszyn  Claypool  into a fast food place, for example, without any advance warning, they   d  usually have trouble getting us all served at one time. A lot of times  though, like on Sunday afternoon, we might play a Sunday afternoon  game somewhere, and before the game was over, whoever the student  manager was would call maybe a pizza place or some other place and  order ahead for so many pizzas or so many hamburgers or whatever, and  we   d just pick it up on our way out of town type of thing. When we   d  go to these scrimmage games, at least two or maybe three times we  stayed overnight. One time when we went to Guymon, some of the local  people there had, essentially a party for us after the game, and that was  our meal situation. That was the only time I can remember that  happening. Other times we   d stop at some restaurant type place. Usually  it was something of a buffet.  Not a McDonald   s, huh?  Well, sometimes we   d stop at a place like McDonald   s. I can   t  remember ever stopping in an upscale restaurant, let   s say. And of  course when they   d go on trips to tournaments and this sort of thing, the  team would eat as a group wherever they ate, and of course the coach  picked up the tab from the university. And when I   d go on those trips,  basically I   d keep a log of the things that maybe had gotten paid through  the university and donate back to whatever fund it was. Basically,  through those years, I paid my way virtually any time I went anywhere,  so it wasn   t a matter of me getting a free load out of something like that.  I was just thinking, in Yuba, Oklahoma, there might not have been too  many choices.  Yeah, that   s right. Some places there weren   t very many choices, like in  Yuba.  Do you have anything else you   d like to say on anything we   ve talked  about so far?  I don   t think of it now (Laughter).  Whenever we turn off the camera.  Yeah, when we turn off the camera, why all sorts of things may come to  mind for all three of us (Laughter).  All right, well thank you very much for your time.  Oh, you are quite welcome.  -------  -------
