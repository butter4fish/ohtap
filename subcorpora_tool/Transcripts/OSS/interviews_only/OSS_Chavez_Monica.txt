 Baeza The following interview is being conducted with Ms. Monica Chavez for the Latino Americans: 500 Years of History Grant Project at Oklahoma State University. The interview will become part of the Oklahoma Oral Research Program at the Edmon Low Library on the Stillwater Campus of Oklahoma State University. The interview is taking place on Thursday, June 30, 2016, at the Southern Oaks Public Library in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The interviewer is Victor Dominguez Baeza, Director of Library Graduate Services. Maybe that   s where you   ve heard graduate services from. Again, thank you for agreeing to participate in this oral history project, Ms. Chavez. I want to remind you that this interview may be published as part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, and that you have granted us permission to publish and transcript the video in part or in its entirety.  Chavez Yes, sir  Baeza Okay, to get started, tell me   . I   ll ask you the questions I asked you before we actually did this officially, so where are you from?  Chavez I was born here in Oklahoma City. My parents are from Mexico, Chihuahua.  Baeza You spent almost your entire life in Oklahoma?  Chavez Yes, minus one year, I lived in Mexico my seventh grade year. (Laughs)  Baeza In Chihuahua?  Chavez Yes, a little tiny ranchito.  Baeza Okay, so tell me something about your parents.  5  Chavez My mom and my   they actually met here. They   re from two different places in Chihuahua. One is from Parral, Chihuahua, and my dad is from a little rancho called La Quemada. It   s about an hour or maybe a little bit more from Cuauht  moc, Chihuahua, closer to Colonia Obreg  n, if anybody knows where that   s at. It   s pretty small too. My dad came here whenever he was fourteen-ish, I think, from what I   ve heard. He doesn   t really talk much, my mom does. She said that he was fourteen when he came by himself, and my mom came to the United States pretty early. She went to high school here, and she lived with her grandmother. I don   t know when she came to Oklahoma, but they came   . From the story that they told me before, I think my dad, supposedly only came to get a truck, and he ended up staying here forever. Then they met, and the rest is history.  Baeza Why did your father come here from Mexico?  Chavez I don   t really know an exact answer, but the little things that I   ve heard is that he, like I said, he wanted to get a truck. I   ve heard that vaguely, so may or may not be true. Don   t quote me. Then he came to certain opportunities, the usual. I don   t think he had papers whenever he came, but he got them eventually because they   re both residents now. Yes, I don   t really   . My dad was never too much of a talker. My mom, she came here for school. She came here to study, and which is ironic because she never finished high school. She dropped out. To this day, she still tries to get her GED and stuff. More recently, she wants to get a job, and she   s like,    I need to get my GED, I need to get my GED,    but she never finished.  Baeza Do you know what year it was that either of them came to the US?  Chavez No idea. My mom was born in    66, my dad was born in    67, so do the math I guess. (Laughs)  Baeza Early eighties, and do you know how they came here?  Chavez No. I know my dad didn   t have papers whenever he came, so I know that he came illegally. My mom came legally. She came with her grandmother, my grandma. Her mom, she worked in Mexico, which is weird because it would have been a different way around. I guess she worked in Mexico, and then helped my grandma pay for her stuff over here, and vice versa. Both of my parents have been, throughout their lives, to themselves. My mom   s relationship with her family has never been too well, so I don   t really know too much about them. Then my dad, he doesn   t talk at all. Everything that I know, I know from whenever I lived in Mexico, especially, to all the little conversations that I hear, here and there, about them talking. I pick up on things.  Baeza You said you lived in Mexico for a year. Where was this again? 6  Chavez Where or when?  Baeza Where?  Chavez I was in the seventh grade, what year would that be, 2000   probably 2009. Yes, it was where my dad is from in La Quemada because it took an hour from Cuauht  moc, Chihuahua.  Baeza Did you stay with family down there?  Chavez Yes, my whole family lived down there except for my older sister. My dad went to start a yonke over there. It   s like a   I translated it as a junkyard, but apparently it has to do with mechanics and stuff. He went to start one over there. We stayed there for the year while he got it up and running, and then he left my uncle in charge of it. That   s whenever we we came back, which I   m really happy that we did because I finished middle school and then got into high school. I never had to repeat a grade, and I   m grateful for that. (Laughs)  Baeza What was it like, that year in Mexico?  Chavez Oh, it was so different and great. It was really, really great. I really loved it, but I wouldn   t live there. (Laughs). It was good. It was a lot of fun, a lot of freedom because it was a small little place. I remember I used to   . Every single day after school, we got out at two thirty. After school, I would go home, eat, and then go to play soccer en las canchas. It was like a baseball diamond, but it was all dirt, and people played baseball. They ran. They played soccer mostly, or people got together, and that was after school every day, except for Fridays and Saturdays, Sundays, the weekend. Other than that, everybody was always there from when everybody got there to whenever the sun started to go down. My curfew was if the sun is   if it   s dark, and you   re not home, you   re in trouble. I would always run home from the very end of the ranchito to my house, because mine was literally at the very, very end and then the canchas was on the opposite end. I ran my little heart out to make it, and I lost a lot of weight that year. (Laughs)  Baeza This was in seventh grade?  Chavez Yes.  Baeza You went through first, up through sixth grade year, and that was in Oklahoma?  Chavez Yes.  7  Baeza What was the school system like down there compared to here?  Chavez I   ve never been one to take an education for granted, and I   ve always been scared. I   ve always had decent grades, and I had really good grades in middle school. I was a straight-A student, and so whenever I left, I obviously took it very seriously. I probably could have honestly went that whole year without doing anything, and I would have been fine. (Laughs) I am really grateful that I did because I learned a lot. I learned how to speak a lot better than I was able to before then, and then I really liked the history classes. I didn   t know anything about Mexico, and it gave me a little understanding, one year of history classes. I felt more in touch with where my dad came from. It was nice being with my family, and school was the least of my worries. I did my part, got my good grades enough because I thought   I mean, I was scared. I was like,    Okay,    I didn   t think that I could blow off that whole year, but in retrospect, I could have. Glad I didn   t though, but yes. It   s calmer to a lot of   . Not as tough, I guess, it   s you do it, and if you don   t, well, I guess that   s on you.  Baeza Were there other kids your age in that family?  Chavez My little sister is two years younger than me, and she was at the la primaria, which would be the elementary school. Then my older sister, she is four years older than me. She tried going to the high school there, but they didn   t accept her, so she never went to the   she dropped out after that. Whenever she came back, she graduated from Emerson High School, and then she   s at OCCC right now, about to graduate. It   s a little delayed because she went over there, and she got married and had a baby, and then came back. Yes, but that was her. (Laughs)  Baeza OCCC?  Chavez Yes, Oklahoma City Community College.  Baeza The reason I was asking about that is so   do you still have family that was your age that   s down there?  Chavez I have a lot of cousins. I have a lot of second and third cousins because my first cousins, very little, and they   re all girls, and they   re all older than me. The large part   there   s probably like ten of us total, and probably like eight of them are all older than me, and two of them are younger. Second and third cousins, I have a lot of them that are my age. It was really fun getting to know all of them. Here in the city, whenever we   re here, there   s nobody   I don   t have any type of family here. I have one aunt from my mom   s side, and we don   t really talk to them too much. Then my other aunt from my mom   s side is in El Paso, so there   s not really a connection there either. Then all of my dad   s family is over there, so it was really, really great 8  getting in touch with that side of the family. I have friends here, and they   re,    I   m doing this with my cousin, I   m doing this with my cousin.    It was really, really nice to go over there, and say,    I   m doing this with my cousins.    I don   t have that here.  Baeza Are you still in contact with them?  Chavez The closer ones, yes. My first cousins we got a lot closer, and then I   m not really in touch with any of them anymore. Life in Mexico is a lot different. A lot of them are married, or they have their kids. They   ve already started their lives, and I don   t go back too often anymore. Mostly because we used to go every summer, and then I don   t know why that stopped. When they got older, my sisters went their own separate ways, so we don   t do that anymore. Then whenever we came back from living there, we went back every few months because my sister was still there. We   d go visit her or help her out as much as we could. Then whenever she came back, we stopped.  I went the longest without ever going. I probably didn   t go for a good two to three years. When I finally went back, it was way different than I imagined. I went back to the las canchas, and I didn   t know anybody there. I went from knowing everybody there and everybody knowing me to   . Now, it was all the younger kids who were there. The people who were my age were all working the whole time, or had to be with their families, or were married. They   d hang out with themselves, and I was like,    Okay, cousins.    (Laughs) Whenever I went that last time, it was more about my sister and I than them.  Baeza You mentioned when you went down there, and you went to school, that you have always taken school seriously? Where did you get that from?  Chavez Fear from my mom and dad. (Laughs) I   ve always been really, really scared of them. Honestly, I always liked learning. I remember whenever I was younger, I couldn   t go to Pre-K. I don   t know why, something with my age or with the time I was born. I didn   t get to go to Pre-K, and I remember I was always really mad because my two older sisters were always at school. They got to carry their backpacks, and get new clothes for school. Then I would stay home while they were gone all day, and I   d be really bored. I always wanted to go to school, and I mean, up until this day, I don   t think I   ve ever not liked going to school. I look at people, and everybody says,    Oh, I hate going to school. I hate this,    but I enjoyed it.  Not the schoolwork, particularly sometimes, especially when it gets harder, but I liked the environment. I   ve never personally been too much about the schoolwork, because I don   t think I   m very good at it, but I like what comes out of being in the learning environment. The experiences, I guess, that you get from it is what I liked a lot. At first, I thought it was,    I   m just a social 9  person. I just like being around people.    In college, I   ve learned it   s where I thrive because it   s the different opportunities that present themselves in that type of environment. That   s what I really like to do. I was being me, and none of my other sisters are like that. It   s just me. (Laughs)  Baeza As you were growing up, when you guys came back to the US, back to Oklahoma City, did you always know you wanted to go to college?  Chavez Yes, most definitely. My two older sisters didn   t go to college. Like I said, one of them   well, they both dropped out. One of them got their GED, and then my other sister, like I said, she graduated from Emerson a couple years later. Me, mostly because I was afraid of getting in trouble   . My mom and my dad were very different with my two older sisters than they were with me and my little sisters. My dad likes to say,    Well, it   s trial and error,    so because of that they   re a lot different. He was a lot stricter with them. He didn   t really let them do much of anything. I remember we had to be asleep by ten. He   d say,    It   s ten o   clock. Turn off the lights.    My sisters, they would try to be on   we had the house phones, like the actual house phones, and you can pick up one from the other line and you could hear. My dad would   sometimes, my sister would be secretly talking on the phone past ten, and we shared a room because we had a two-bedroom house.  All of a sudden, you could hear over the speaker like,    Get off the phone and go to sleep     I was like,    Oh, you   re in trouble.    They were a lot more restricted, and because of that they were a lot sneakier. They had a lot more fun during their   under college years than I did. Their high school, middle school years were a lot crazier than mine. I stuck to school, and sports, and extra-curricular activities because I was scared about   because I would see them get caught, and get in trouble, and it terrified me. (Laughs) I thank them a lot because I feel if I wasn   t as terrified of my parents, I probably would have dropped out, or not enjoyed it as much, or not really been, I don   t know, the person I am. I like to think retrospectively, and think about how everything has affected me in my life, and they   re a big reason as to why I am the way I am.  Baeza What was it like growing up in Oklahoma City with your siblings?  Chavez Chaos. (Laughs) Whenever we were younger, we argued a lot, and sometimes it got pretty bad. My older sisters, they would have fist fights, regularly. (Laughs) Then my mom worked, and so whenever these fights occurred there would be no adults in the house, and so me and my little sister would sit back and,    Are you guys done?    Then me and my little sister never really got along too well until now that we   re a little bit older. We were very different, like complete opposites. I think now that we   re older, we all appreciate each other a lot more, especially whenever   because they moved out. We   re all doing our own thing now, and so whenever we come 10  together, it   s a lot of fun. Growing up, it was horrible, (Laughs) a lot of fighting. My sisters looked out for us, so they were like mom figures, and you know how it goes. (Laughs)  Baeza You said you were the only one that really was taking school seriously?  Chavez My oldest sister, her name is Rocio. She hated it up until recently. Actually she   s more into it, and she   s doing college now, but she hated it all her life. (Laughs) Then my other sister, the one who graduated, actually, she   s really smart. She   s the smart one of the family, and she had good grades all throughout her school years. I don   t know, I don   t think she ever really   . I think she was smart. I don   t think she actually enjoyed it. I think she was really smart. She didn   t have to work hard, which I never did either, but she was double my intelligence. I don   t think I   ve ever told her that, but I think she thinks she   s under me because she took a different path.  I know that she gets her feelings hurt a lot, if I ever say something, so I watch what I say around them. I don   t think that I am better than her because I know that she   s smarter than me. Whenever she dropped out, and she didn   t go back, we were really surprised, and the whole   . My nephew, which we   re all really grateful for, but it was a big like,    Whoa,    like a big shock to everyone. My little sister is lazy. She hates going to school, she   s very introvert. She likes being by herself in her room, and she can   t wait until she graduates. (Laughs) She graduates next year. She doesn   t want to go back. She   s going to do   . I   m trying to convince her to go to the University of Central Oklahoma, to UCO, so I   m working on her, but she doesn   t like it either. (Laughs)  Baeza Where you guys lived in Oklahoma City, was there a large Hispanic population there at your school?  Chavez Always, yes. My older sisters, they went to Columbus Elementary. It   s on the south side of town, and that   s whenever we used to live on the south side of town. We used to live by a little chur   well, it   s not very little. It   s a decent-sized church. (Laughs) What   s it called   Sacred Heart, we lived by Sacred Heart and all Hispanics. All I   ve ever seen is Hispanics, and then specks of other races. Then it wasn   t until middle school where it started to getting a little bit more diverse. I went to Jefferson Middle School, but as far as I can remember, up until college, it   s always been majority Hispanics. I actually saw a really funny picture on Twitter the other day. They were comparing different high schools of Oklahoma City Public Schools, and my high school, they called it like,    Mexican Central.    It was funny because they were like,    They have quincea  eras in their hallways.    I thought that was really funny because looking at it back now, it   s very Hispanic. The large population, the large majority, is Hispanic.  11  Baeza What was their country of origin?  Chavez Mostly Mexican, but there is different areas. It   s not very out there. I usually know whenever they   re not Mexican because if somebody says any type of Mexican is usually like,    I   m not Mexican  I   m Salvadorean, I   m Venezuelan     and I   m like,    I   m sorry     (Laughs) Yes, it   s mostly Mexican.  Baeza How did the community here differ from the community back in Mexico?  Chavez They   re a lot more   . I mean, it   s a different country, so it   s completely different. Here, from the people my age, (anyways from the people that I know) we   re Mexican, and we   re proud of it, but we don   t really know much. We   re like,    Well, yes.    Our parents, they   re from Mexico, and then over there, they know everything. They live there. It   s like me saying I don   t know anything about the US, and going over there, and expecting them not to know. It   s a little crazy, but it   s different customs. It   s an entire   and this is   . Going over there was the first time that I ever felt an outsider, and it sucked. I think of my experiences here in the United States, and all of the discrimination and stuff, which at the time, I really hadn   t felt.  Like I said, it   s always been Hispanics, but you hear stuff. Where I have experienced it the most is whenever we   re crossing the border from the United States to Mexico. Wherever you   re going, they   ll either question you for being American, or they will question you for being Mexican. It   s like,    Where do I fit,    and I   ve learned to accept that I don   t completely fit with either. We   re this little niche of people, who are part this and part that, but not completely at either spectrum. I think it   s really different. Sometimes it gets a little bit lonely, I feel like, because you want to relate to   . You want to relate heavily to your roots, and then you want to relate heavily to where you are, but it   s like,    I   m not fully at either one.     Baeza How involved were you with the Hispanic community here in Oklahoma City?  Chavez Very, very involved actually, especially the last couple years of high school. I joined an organization my   it was 2013, summer 2013. It was the summer after sophomore year, an organization called the League of United Latin American Citizens. That   s the oldest and largest. I have the spiel. The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) is the oldest and the most widely respected Hispanic civil rights organization in the United States. It was founded in 1929 in Corpus Christi, Texas. I love it, it   s my life. I had a friend, who had just come back from the National Convention, and she was like,    LULAC this, LULAC that.    I played soccer, so we were playing soccer together one day, and she was like,    You should totally come to this meeting,    and I was like,    What is that?    I was really bored. It was the summer, so I had nothing better to do, and I was like,    Okay, I   ll go.    I 12  personally blame my first initial love for it on the advisor of the council at the time.  He   s a really great person, very caring, very genuine about the kids, about us. From there, we did all sorts of stuff. We volunteered. Whenever I joined, that council had barely been formed. It was founded January of that year, and there was one that they were a part of in the north side. That   s the one that they emerged from, but it was brand-new, right, and if you look at them now   like everybody knows. All the politicians know who LULAC is because of all of that work. I actually volunteered with them the other day, and I was like,    Man, I feel like a legend. We started this.    Then seeing where it   s at now feels really great, but super involved with the community. We volunteer, we fundraise, we donate, we do everything we can to keep in touch and help on them. I   ve always really been about that, so I blame that for everything.  Baeza Have you done stuff outside of the Oklahoma City area with LULAC?  Chavez We go to conventions. I   ve been to two this far. I went to one in New York City, and that was my first one. It was super great, and then Salt Lake City last summer. That first one was really, really great because it was the first time that I experienced how big it was. I had this understanding that LULAC is this really great community organization that does all these really great things for the youth, and to build leadership skills, and to help the community. It   s super great, but then seeing that at the national level, where there   s hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people, who do the same thing as that little local community organization, it blew my mind. Oklahoma City has a reputation. The youth has a reputation of going and being everywhere, and being very charismatic and very welcoming, I guess, even though we   re the ones that should be being welcomed to New York. I remember, we took ten people, and some   the biggest council had fifty, I think.  I remember our advisor told us,    One of the other advisors told us that he thought that you guys were bigger because he said,    Everywhere I look, there   s one of them.       I remember we had gotten off of the bus that was going to pick us up from the airport, and we were like,    Okay guys. We got to stay away from each other. Be with one at most. You got to meet people and network,    because our advisor was really heavy on networking, so we got to meet people and do all of this. We volunteer whenever we go to those, we have a community service project, so that   s as most as we do with that. Where was it that we   we go to different places to do different events and stuff. The one that I can think of off the top of my head, we donated a bunch of Christmas gifts to an organization in Guthrie, I think, or something like that. I don   t even know, don   t quote me, but yes, it   s really great. It has 13  gotten bigger, so it has begun to spread a little bit into different areas. Really, I think it   s awesome. (Laughs)  Baeza What are you most proud of with your work with LULAC?  Chavez The fact that it   s up and running, and I   m not there anymore. It   s gone through a lot since we left because the advisor that we had, he is not there anymore. He   s having a baby at the end of this month, and so he stepped away. Some other community leaders, who they   re members of the adult LULAC council, and they   re overseeing it. Without him and without the original people   . We were very, very dedicated to it. I can think of four, off the top of my head, who were constantly on top of everything, making sure everything was done, picking up what other people were leaving off. We dedicated all of our time to it. It was everything for us, and we were really worried whenever we were graduating that it wasn   t   .  We   re not going to be there. People looked up to us, and it feels really great, but then leaving and then seeing,    What   s going to happen?    We dedicated a lot of time during the summer, and coming back from the convention to helping the new officers, and the new people who were going to be the leaders of the council, transition and understand what it took to keep it running. We were really, really lucky that the people who came into office work hard. There is that core group of people who keep it going, and that   s what I   m most proud of. We were able to help them get to that place, and keep it going. It   s like a legacy, so I think it   s really cool.  Baeza At what point did you start thinking about attending college?  Chavez Since I was like   I can   t remember a time in my life me not thinking about attending college. The only difference is that when I was younger, it was a dream. It was like,    Yes, I   m going to attend college. I   m going to move out. I   m going to leave my house, and I   m going to go live in a dorm in college.    Everybody was like,    Yes, sure.    It was funny because the more I went through high school, the more that it became real. For a minute, it felt surreal. The time period right around graduation to right as I was leaving, it was like,    Is it really happening? Am I really here?    Thinking back to the beginning of my first semester, even it feels surreal. It feels like a dream,    Did that really happen? Did I really just come back from my first year of college?    It was never not in my mind, but it went from the dream to the actual thing. I think that is the coolest thing ever.  Baeza Was Oklahoma State your first choice?  Chavez (Laughs) I wanted to go to the University of Oklahoma. I was dead set to go to OU, the rival of Oklahoma State University, up until February of my last semester of high school. It didn   t fit. My mom always pushed OU; I always 14  loved OU. It was OU this, and OU that, and then my junior year, I started doing things. I was a part of a couple of leadership groups, leadership organizations whatever   that stuff. I started meeting a lot of people that were going to OU, and they were not very friendly. They weren   t mean and they weren   t rude, but they were   . There was something about them that I didn   t really   and I brushed it off for a long time. I was like,    Oh, it   s whatever.    Then I toured it one time, and I really, really loved it. I knew the tour guide, so that played a part, and I refused to even go to OSU. I didn   t even want to tour it like,    No, that   s our rival school. That   s gross. I don   t want to go there.    I had a conference there, a leadership conference that I went to, and I was like,    Fine,    and it was a different feeling.  It was that vibe that people talk about like    It   s the vibe of it. You   re going to feel it, you   re going to know.    Whenever I stepped on it, it was a lot different because I didn   t know anything about it. The leadership conference is called    Future Collegiate Leaders,    and it was hosted by CASNR,  College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources  by the ag school. I didn   t know what I got myself into. It was so different, and they all did FFA, and they all knew about the country life, and I   m here, feeling like   I had never in my life felt like a city kid until I went to that conference because I didn   t know anything. Even then, feeling completely different than everybody, and feeling like an outsider there, it still felt very welcoming. Everybody was   . Yes, I was different, and yes, I was from the city, and I didn   t know what they were talking about half the time, but they were still like,    Come here  Come talk to us     It felt like home, it felt welcoming, it felt like I was supposed to be there.  Baeza Was that a Hispanic program or   .  Chavez No, it was put on by the CASNR student council, I think. I   m not even honestly sure. I don   t even know how I ended up there. I remember in high school, I used to apply for every leadership thing I could because that   s what we were taught to do. Expand our horizons, and do what we wouldn   t imagine ourselves doing. I remember there was friend that was supposed to go with me, but she couldn   t end up making it because she had to go to some other thing. They collided on the days, and so I was like,    Okay, I   ll go by myself.    It was actually really good that I did because it opened my eyes a lot, and it gave me the new perspective to different world, so that was   .  Baeza The seed was planted. Then how did it grow?  Chavez One of the best teachers I   ve ever had, one of my top three teachers that I   ve ever had, lived in Stillwater and then went to OSU. He loved it, and he always pushed for it. In class, he was always,    OSU this, OSU this, OSU that. You should go there.    Honestly, at first I was like   .(Laughs) After 15  that first thing, I remember I came back, and I was like,    It was all right. It was cool, I guess. It was a lot different. (Laughs) I felt like I forgot to take my hoard or something, but it was cool.    From there, he took that opportunity that I didn   t absolutely hate it and pushed it. I was like,    I like it.    Then it   s a Goldilocks area. It   s far enough from home to where I don   t have to come home every weekend, but it   s close enough that I can if I wanted to.  Baeza How was the application process?  Chavez Fairly easy. I   m not very good at writing essays whenever I have to, whenever it   s a requirement. I can write for days, but if I have to, I feel pressured, and I can   t. I get writer   s block. That was the hardest part of it, figuring out what to write. I got that automatic acceptance because of my ACT score, so it wasn   t really an issue. Honestly, I remember   . I feel bad saying this, but I never didn   t think that I was not going to get accepted because I knew   I had looked over the requirements. Whenever I was younger, I was like,    This is what I need to do, and I   ll be in. There is no way that they can deny me unless I mess up my last semester.    I remember people were really scared about,    I don   t know if I am going to accepted,    and I   m like,    Oh, it   s because you   ve been messing up the whole time, that   s why     I made sure that I was   I am telling you, it was never not an option for me. What I did   . I wanted to go out-of-state for a long time, and that was where I got nervous. I didn   t even apply out-of-state because I was too scared.  Baeza Were you the first in your family to go to college?  Chavez Yes.  Baeza No one had any experience   .  Chavez My sister had started at Oklahoma City Community College, but it was different because it   s in the city. She had her baby, and she was going to classes, but she really wasn   t in college. It was a completely different experience because there was nothing that they could really help me with, as far as application processes go or what I   m supposed to   and since it was a different university, they do things a little bit differently. She helps me a lot now because she   s taking classes that I haven   t taken, and she will give me tips for   . We keep each other on check. If I   m messing up, then she   ll talk to me, or if she   s messing up, then I   ll talk to her. She likes to post on Facebook a lot, whenever she   s stressed, so I   ll be like,    Get to it. This is not going to do itself.    It   s gotten a lot better, so yes. I was the first one.  Baeza Did you have any help or did you know about applying for financial aid or programs like that? 16  Chavez They talk about it so much that you know that you   re supposed to do it, but whenever   the first time I applied for FAFSA  Free Application for Federal Student Aid , I didn   t do it. I was part of the talent search for OSU and Melissa, what   s her last name   I don   t know her last name. One of the ladies that works for OSU Talent Search, she helped me do it, and it was fifteen minutes. The next time I tried to do it, it took me forever, and I didn   t understand it. I was like,    Oh, that   s why,    because I didn   t remember I didn   t do it. (Laughs) Everything else, as far as scholarships go, I didn   t get any scholarships from outside the community. I think I got one community scholarship that wasn   t from OSU, and that   s because they couldn   t deny me of it because it was a year-process and you had requirements. If you met the requirements, you got it, and I got it. No, I was really lucky that OSU   s money, financial aid. (Laughter)  Baeza You moved into the dorms?  Chavez Yes.  Baeza What was that process like?  Chavez I was in Stinchcomb, that building. It   s like the Villages, but you have your own room, and then there   s a shared living area. Then the other person has a room, and then we have a small little kitchen, our bathroom. I was going to be fine like,    If she annoys me, I can go to my room,    but it was worse. It was the worst thing ever, and I moved out after a month. (Laughs) I went to a traditional dorm and moved in with a friend from high school because the potluck thing did not work for me. She was terrible. She ruined my first month of college. (Laughs)  Baeza You mentioned earlier that in Oklahoma City, you had always been surrounded by Hispanic community. Then the first time you went to college, that was the first, and you   re like,    Oh, hey.    What was that experience like?  Chavez Oh man, culture shock to the max. It was   I felt really bad because I have never been the sensitive type to racist remarks and prejudice-ness. I always thought,    Well, just let it go. Just quit over-reacting.    Oh man, it   s so subtle, and you   re like,    Excuse me?    It was very frustrating, the ignorance of these people. I was   . I   m in the President   s Leadership Council for my freshman year, which is last year. We were split into groups, and this was the worst thing that happened, and I was absolutely appalled. We were split into groups. There is 125 total, and you   re split into, I think, it   s twelve-ish groups, and they   re called    families.    There are families, we are facilitators, or our mom and our dad, and then there   s that group of eight to ten, maybe a little more. 17  After our regular giant meetings, we split into group meetings, and I remember this particular day. We went around doing a team-building type of exercise, and I don   t even remember the premises of the game or the activity, but moral of the story is they were taking every person and then complimenting them, right? People would say nice things. There was a question that was asked, but it basically summed up to what   s good about this person? There were all   I   m decent with English, but I don   t have all of that flashy vocabulary. They threw out really great words for all of these people, and I was like,    Dang, that   s cool  I can   t wait until it   s my turn.    It comes my turn, and they were like,    Spicy loco  crazy ,    and I was like,    Did you really just call me loco? Did you really like call me spicy? Do I look like   how?     I was so mad. I sat there like this, and I didn   t say anything. After they said that, I shut down, and I was so mad. Anybody that knows me really, really close knows that whenever I get mad, there   s no coming back. Oh, that took so much out of me, and I was so mad for such a long time, and then I think as the semester went by, I started experiencing a subtleness. More and more, I realized that a lot of the times   . I know they didn   t   they were my friends, and I know that they didn   t mean any harm by it. That   s whenever I started thinking like,    They really don   t know that that was so offensive.    I told our facilitator a few weeks later, I think it was three or four weeks later. I sent her a message, a lengthy, strongly-worded message, and I told her like,    I know that it wasn   t intentionally meant to harm anyone.  It was all in a nice environment.    I told her it was really offensive, and I told her the next time, think about what you   re saying, and the people who you   re saying it to, and how it could be taken by somebody. It was a learning experience for all of us, and I was really proud. I think that   s one of my proudest moments is that I didn   t flip, and I didn   t go off on anyone, and I didn   t yell. I sat on it, and I thought about really what to do with it, and I remember I spoke to Angela about it, but that was after the fact. It was all within myself, and that   s why I   m really proud of it, that I was able to see it from that perspective. What   s gotten me through the culture shock, and everything that comes along with it, has been to think from their perspective, and to think that these people are also coming from places like me.  I came from a majority Hispanic, almost entirely Hispanic, group of people, and I never was exposed to anything other, and they   re the exact same way. I know for a fact that it wasn   t meant to harm anyone, it wasn   t evil. I think it would have been different if it was intentionally bad, but it wasn   t. That   s whenever I realized it   s that they don   t know, and they   re never going to know that that   s offensive if somebody doesn   t tell them. Now what I do is if somebody says something that bothers me, I let myself cool off because I   m human and I get angry. Then I tell them like,    Hey, that wasn   t cool. 18  Maybe you should think about it next time,    and I think that   s one of the biggest things that I got from being around a different group of people. (Laughs)  Baeza When was that?  Chavez This last year, my freshman year. It was   was it first semester, it was first semester of fall semester 2015.  Baeza At what point, or at any point, did you start looking for other Hispanics on campus?  Chavez I went in with quite a few people that I knew from different high schools. I went to two different high schools. My first two years I went to Southeast High School, and then I graduated   . I went the last two years at US Grant High School, so I knew people from both. I knew people from both schools that went, which is an odd year, I guess, because every other year, there   s more people that go to OU than to OSU. There   s always one, or two, maybe three people that go to OSU, but this year, there was over ten. I knew people going in, and I also had gone in before and met Brenda Morales and Angela Vivar, so the connection was already established. Then there was one particular   I knew one person that already went there, and she was my key to everything. She would always be like,    Come to HSA  Hispanic Student Association , come to this meeting, come do this with us, come hang out. Do you need any help moving in?    She   s really, again, welcoming, so it was an immediate   . I guess you need that. You need your bubble of comfort whenever you go somewhere else.  Baeza Did you get involved with any organizations on campus?  Chavez Not my first semester. My first semester, I attended the HSA meetings and that was about it, which I really beat myself up for after   during winter break because I had been used to LULAC, being everywhere, constantly doing something, even in high school. LULAC was a community organization, and in high school, I did soccer, and I did a couple other things, so I was always constantly doing something. Whenever I got to college that first semester, I would like to say that I didn   t join anything so I could focus on my grades, but that wasn   t even the case. It was the transition of it. I had a lot of fun, and I met a lot of people. I went to a lot of informational-type meetings, but I never really committed to anything, and whenever I left for winter break, I felt stagnant. I felt like I had wasted an entire semester of opportunities and not done anything at all, literally nothing. My grades weren   t even all that great, and it was really upsetting. After the winter break of beating myself up for it, I was like,    Well, it isn   t going to change if you don   t change it,    so I went in strong.  19  I remember I wasn   t very happy with my grades. I made a spreadsheet of all of my course work, and what was due when, all in order, so I knew to look, and that was for classes. Then I started a LULAC Council at OSU. Proud of that, it took a lot of work. Then I joined a sorority, and I got more involved with HSA, and I joined   because I am very for   . I like diversification but my pet peeve with diversification is that yes, your college campus is very diverse, but it   s also very segregated. What   s the point of having the numbers and having the faces, and taking the pictures, if at the end of the day, you have your big student government association, and you have the Student Alumni Board. None of that   where are we there, there   s no representation, so I brought it up. I told myself like,    Step out of your comfort, step out of your comfort,    so I applied for the Student Alumni Board, and I got accepted. That was really cool because, again, there was no familiar faces.  I showed up, and there was a few Hispanics here and there, but they were not Hispanic. They grew up in the suburbs and majority white high schools, so they couldn   t really relate to where I was coming from, and I felt different. Whenever I still go there, and I feel really small, but I try to make myself big because now I know people who want to do it because they know that I   m in it. For me, that   s what I feel it is. It   s a ladder. I went to that one person that I told you that helped me, that I knew from OSU. She was part of the reason why I did end up going there because I at least knew somebody there, and so that   s what I think it is. If you can open the door for somebody else to go in and be a little bit bigger than you are, then you   re winning. It doesn   t always have to be about you or what you can do. This is the three things that I focus on: the Student Alumni Board, LULAC, and then the sorority, and that takes up all my time. (Laughs)  Baeza You mentioned that in that first semester, when you were offended, you went and talked to Angela Vivar. How did you know Angela at that point?  Chavez I met Angela   . I mentioned the OSU Talent Search. We went for a tour, and I was introduced to her, and she was very welcoming. She was like,    Here is my contact information. Apply for RISE, do this.    I had that connection where I felt comfortable enough to talk to her because of RISE, because she   s the coordinator and advisor for that program. Me and her have a really good relationship. We talk back and forth. I   m always in her office, and she hates me for it, but it   s fine because I tell her that   s her job, and she   s like,    You   re right.    I feel very comfortable talking to her.  Baeza She talked to you about   . Could you give me more information about this program, RISE?  Chavez RISE is the Retention Initiative for Student Excellence. It   s a program for first-generation, incoming students. It doesn   t have to be freshmen, it can be 20  transfer students, but first-year students at college. It   s a transition program, and we   re required to do study hours, ten a week. We have workshops that we have to attend, there are requirements. We have different   I said workshops, but it   s different sub-workshops, I guess. Then we have weekly   not weekly, we have a few meetings with Angela, individual meetings throughout the semester and throughout the year. Then if we complete everything that   s required of us with a 3.0 GPA minimum, we get a stipend at the end of the year, yes, at the end of semester.  Baeza How did that program help you out this first year?  Chavez I met a ton of people, made a lot of friends because we had to study together and be constantly around each other. I think the Hispanic community in general is always really close-knit, so making that easier, first connection to meet everyone was really helpful. Which at the end of the day, from that organization, it wasn   t just Hispanics. It was people of all different races, and backgrounds, and things like that, and I thought that was the coolest part. That it wasn   t exclusive or anything to just Hispanics or just African Americans. It was any first-generation student, and it gave you an opportunity to meet people from different areas of college. It was a lot of fun, I liked it. Those study hours, they really helped. They helped a lot. I think that   s what I took the most out of it, honestly, is it taught me discipline. I believe that without them, I don   t think I would have studied at all because at first, I was like,    Why are we giving you ten hours? It   s so much     Then I needed to do more, (Laughs) so yes, it was very helpful.  Baeza That was your involvement with Angela. How about with Brenda Morales?  Chavez Brenda   .(Laughs) She judged me a lot because I didn   t go to her office as often as I went to Angela   s, but I was never at the Student Union. I was always doing study hours at Scott Hall, so when I would be there, I remember I would pop in and say hi. Every time, she   s like,    Wow, thanks for visiting me     It   s a very fun relationship. It   s very jokingly, we pick on each other a lot, but she is very helpful. She   s as helpful as Angela, and whenever Angela can   t answer a question, Brenda will answer it. If Brenda can   t answer it, Angela will answer it, so it   s nice having the two of them. I think they   re both familiar with separate areas, and there   s always times whenever one of them knows something that the other doesn   t, so it   s really helpful having them both at the same time. I really like Brenda, she   s so funny, she makes me laugh. (Laughs)  Baeza How did you meet Brenda?  Chavez The first encounter I had with Brenda was at that tour, but it was a brief,    Oh, hi. My name is   .    Then I went into her office the first time, I don   t remember why I was in Stillwater, but I went and I talked to her. Then she 21  told me that her niece was going to be a freshman and was coming in with my class, and she tried to make that connection with us. I didn   t even know who her niece was until halfway through the year, and I was like,    You   re the niece  I was supposed to meet you way earlier     We had already, obviously, known each other, but it was funny that I didn   t know it was her until so much afterwards.  Baeza One of the things you mentioned takes up a lot of your time at OSU is a sorority that you joined.  Chavez Yes, just recently.  Baeza Tell me about the sorority.  Chavez I refused to even   . I didn   t want to do Greek life at all. I was like,    That   s weird,    but I didn   t know anything about it. I went my first semester. They had   at the beginning of the year, they have all these informational stuff, and I remember they had, what did they call it, was it convocation, I think. I don   t know, it was all the MGC, the Multicultural Greek Council organizations have a giant informational, but it   s divided. Then you rotate, it   s stations. That   s where I heard the first about   learned anything about it, and it sounded really fun, but at the same time, I was really skeptical,    Do I really? No.    Then I remember after that, for a solid one or two days, I really wanted to do it, but then I was like,    No. I   m my own person.    I   ve always been very independent, and from what I had heard, it   s not independent. You had to do what people say, people can tell you what to do, you have rules, specific things to wear and all this, and I was like,    Ew, I don   t want to do that.     Then there are those scary stories like,    They   re going to haze you. They   re going to hit you. They   re going to do all this stuff,    and I was like,    Whoa  No, thank you. I won   t let nobody lay no finger on me.    The more I learned about it, the more I learned how much of a myth all of that stuff is, and it doesn   t really happen. I joined Kappa Delta Chi my spring semester, spring    16, and nothing like the movies. No hazing, no hitting me, no making me do uncomfortable things, nothing like that. It was purely very helpful. It was just as helpful as RISE, I think, for me, honestly, that they kept me on track with everything, and going through all of that. I relate that a lot to LULAC because I came back from their conference in Austin, and it was that same feeling. There are so many people that are working for the same thing that you are, that represent the same thing that you do, that have the same values. You share this thing with so many people, and it   s so weird.  I remember when I first was initiated, I went to OU, and I met with the sisters over there, and I didn   t know them. I didn   t know who they were at all, but we have a group message, and I was like,    Hey, I   m going to go.    22     Okay, this is our address,    and I showed up, and everybody welcoming with open arms, and they are super great friends now. I think being able to make those connections because you have that one thing in common, I think that was really cool. I am really grateful to have actually done it, and it really, truly, honestly represents a lot of the things that I stand for, which surprises me more and more every day. Every time I see something online or somebody would share something that I   m like,    Oh my god, I love this. I   m so passionate about this, and you are too,    and it   s awesome. It   s networking and connections, I love it.  Baeza Why did you choose that sorority?  Chavez I felt it was the best fit for me. There   s three different sororities for the Multicultural Greek Council at Stillwater and Oklahoma State, and the other two didn   t really fit the person that I was. The reputation that they carry really wasn   t for me, or I didn   t really get along with the girls. I think a lot   . For something like that to work, you have to get along with the people. What I   ve learned is that it doesn   t matter what the national organization or reputation of a different chapter is. It doesn   t matter because it   s your chapter, and if you don   t get along with the girls there, then it   s not going to work. We   re all friends, but I like the other girls better.  Like I said, their values that they have and what they were able to offer me, I liked it a lot. It   s a service-based organization, and I   m all about service. I   m all about helping other people and helping   . It   s a Latina-founded organization, so I   m all about helping your own and helping us succeed because it   s a ladder. Like I said, you got to help others succeed in order for it to be a progression because you can   t just expect,    Let me be the best I can be, and let me just watch over you guys. Let me be the best I can be, and then let me help somebody be better.    I think that that particular organization really embodies that, and I really like that about them.  Baeza Do you know how long they   ve been on campus?  Chavez They were founded   they colonized 2014, and they got charter status last year, 2015. It   s pretty cool, two years, going on three.  Baeza It   s like with other things, you   re at the beginning  Chavez Very brand-new, yes. I think it   s awesome. I like being a part of all that.  Baeza What kind of activities, because you said the Latino-based, so what kind of activities have you done with that sorority?  Chavez I   ve been a part of it for that semester, and for that semester, it was mostly going through the process of becoming a sister and learning about the 23  organization. Me, personally, I haven   t done too much because I   m brand-new. I   m going to start next semester, but they do a lot of volunteer work. They volunteer with different organizations in Stillwater. They   ll come to the city and volunteer here. Then the most Latina-ish thing that they do is that they promote the culture. Any opportunity that they can, they will be at an event or something, and be there, and represent who we are. They do, what   s it called, the different events that HSA puts on. It   s a lot, it   s different things, here and there.  Baeza Okay, so do you have, or have they told you, plans for things to get involved in next year?  Chavez Definitely, we have our entire schedule planned out for next semester. I already know that the first two weeks of school, I   m going to be busy. We planned different events and things, so there   s   . We already know   any of the big things that   s going to happen throughout the year, we already know what that   s going to be. There   s a lot of   since it is a service-based organization, there   s a lot of community service that goes into work, so we do any type of community service that we can. One of my favorite ones is the big ones hosted by the school, the BIG Event and Into the Streets. I did that with them because I was brand-new for the spring one, and it was the most fun thing ever. It was hard work, but it was fun. That was real community service.  That was real labor. You were really doing something good for the community, and helping these people that honestly can   t. We helped one man, and we didn   t see him, but he had   . His family there was telling us about him. He had recently had to get some surgeries, and they told us that he was usually on top of everything, but with that, he hadn   t been able to do anything, and his yard was a mess. I had never seen something so bad in my life before, and it took almost all of MGC to get it cleaned up, but we did, and it got cleaned. I felt really nice because that was real work, something that you would pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for somebody to do. To help somebody who has been struggling, has surgeries, and who is usually on top of it, and be able to be like,    Hey, we got you,    I think that   s really cool.  Baeza Which event was this?  Chavez This one was Into   which one is for the spring, I think it was Into the Streets. The BIG Event, it was the BIG Event, yes. It was the BIG Event. Into the Streets is the fall one, and then the BIG Event was the spring.  Baeza Okay, so that   s the sorority. You also mentioned the other thing that   s taking up a lot of   or is probably going to be taking up a lot of your time     24  Chavez Student Alumni Board or LULAC?  Baeza    LULAC.  Chavez LULAC. Pumped. Next week, we are going on our National Convention, and it   s been a struggle because I   m not used to the restrictions that come along with being an organization in a school. Our council was community-based. Basically, we made all the decisions. Of course, we had our advisor, and he made all the decisions, but we made the decision. Then we decided what to do with what money, it was all us. Then the biggest struggle that I come across now is the restrictions that come with   that the university sets, and having to work around that, but I think it   s because I   m learning how it all works, that   s why it   s such a hassle right now. I think once I get the hang of it it will be fine. I   m really excited for next semester because we   re going to get things going, and the reason why I set that up, my biggest goal with that was our LULAC council in high school was very, very structured. It was very well-organized, it was very well-run, it was very well-advised.  Whenever we weren   t on top of our game, or whenever we were not doing our thing at our meetings   and they   re very professional meetings whenever they   re official meetings. Other than that, we   ll do team-building stuff or whatever works in. There   s always like,    You got to be respectful, and you have to pay attention, and you have to be quiet when it comes time to be quiet.    We   re old enough to where we know when to be respectful, and there   s a time and a place. Going from something like that to   there   s items that we have to take care of on the agenda, there   s things that need to be done to going to HSA, and it   s a very social gathering and not a lot of anything getting done. I was very frustrated for that first semester. I was like,    What is this?    I was so excited to come and find LULAC, and that was one of the reasons why I started it. For the first semester, I wanted to run for an office in HSA because I was like,    I   m going to flip this upside down. I   m going to structure it, and it   s going to be life-changing, and all of this.     I was up on my high-horse like,    Okay, freshmen,    and so I went from that type of thinking to,    Well, let me start LULAC.    Then whenever I actually started working on LULAC and come the spring semester, I got to realizing that,    Man, I like HSA the way it is. I really like that it   s a social meeting where things do get done.    It   s not what I was used to, and I was very, I guess, close-minded whenever I barely went in, and I wanted things done my way. That   s how I always am, and I have to like,    Control yourself. It   s not all about you.    Again, I talked to Angela about that a lot, and I was like,    I   m so frustrated. There   s nothing   .    Through talk after talk, and listening to myself, because when I talk to Angela, she lets me do a lot of talking, like this interview. I started contradicting myself. One day, I would say,    I really had a lot of fun, and I really liked it,    and then the next day, it   d be like, 25     They don   t do anything. We don   t do anything. What is this?    I started thinking about it more in-depth, and I realize that it   s there for a purpose.  It   s there   people need their bubble of comfort. They need to be around familiar faces, somebody who looks like them, somebody who they can relate to, somebody who they can talk about their day with, and unravel with and feel comfortable. The more that I started realizing it, the more that I understood that there   s a time and a place. HSA is the time and the place for the family. We   re a community and the HSA family, and you hear it over and over again, and now I understand. Then LULAC, I want it to be more business. I want it to a stepping stone between the Hispanic community, the diversity, to the actual inclusion part, where they can feel confident enough to step away from their bubble. Whereas having the bubble is nice, but you don   t want to live in the bubble to actually diversify the university. Truly diversifying and representing us, and representing who we are, what we stand for, and what we want, and what we deserve and have a voice.  I think to do that, it needs to, they need to be   what   s the word   exposed to that type of structure because the Student Government Association structured like that, might as well be in Congress. Then the Student Alumni Board, also very structured. They give us a booklet this big whenever I did orientation, and I was like,    Okay, this is a lot more than I   m used to, but all right,    and it   s all very structured. I don   t think a lot of the people have been ever exposed to that, or if they have, it   s been very minimal. Even I, who thought I was coming from something very structured was like,    Whoa, how do I do this?    I want to be able to help people. I want to help progress, and I want to   . If I can leave any type of legacy, I wouldn   t want it to be,    This person is so successful.    I would want it to be,    This person helped so many people be successful.    I want to be the helper, not the one who did it. I could care less if I did it. I want to know that it   s being done. (Laughs)  Baeza Take me through the steps from the point when you told yourself,    I want to start LULAC here on campus,    to actually being a recognized group.  Chavez The first semester I had the idea because it was hard leaving LULAC, here in the city, and not having it anymore because my entire life revolved around it. There is not one aspect of my life that it didn   t touch, my friends, my family, everything. The person who I am today is because of LULAC. It was one of those things that you   re like,    Man, this is life-changing. If it wasn   t for this, where would I honestly be? What would I be doing? I wouldn   t be me.    It was really hard, so whenever I left, I really wanted to start one, and mostly because I wanted it. I   m really into diversifying OSU because there is so many Hispanics at OU because it   s so close. You hear in the city,    OU this, OU that,    and you don   t ever hear anything from Stillwater because it   s too far.  26  One of the reasons whenever I left is that I want other people to know that Stillwater is there. I want people to know that there is a different option, and you don   t have to go to OU, if you don   t want to. You can go to OSU, so whenever I got there, and I talked to Angela, she knew what it was. She   s very encouraging like,    Yes, you should do it     I started talking. It was a lot of talking at first like,    Hey, I think I want to do this. Would you be interested?    Gathering that interest like,    Would you be interested if I did this? Would you want to do this with me?    That was the entire first semester, and then like I said, that winter break, I went and I realized, I was like,    I haven   t done anything. What am I? What did I become?    I went in spring semester strong, and I was like,    Okay, let   s do this.     I contacted the campus life person that I needed to get everything   . Get the ball rolling, and she gave me a list of everything that I needed to do. I had to write a constitution, and I had to fill out all these applications, and I had to wait for this meeting, and I had a month-long wait. Then I had to do this in-between and then I had to   . They handed me back my constitution three times to fix typos, or errors, or things that needed to be corrected. It was such a long process. I was so frustrated by the end of it, I wanted it to be over. Then I finally got the meeting with the   what   s his position   the chair for student organizations or something like that. Basically, the board that was going to decide if it was going to be a group or not, and I was so nervous. I was like,    They   re going to ask me so many questions. They   re going to be like,    Why do we need this?        I literally walked in, and they asked me a couple   they made a couple suggestions for editing on the constitution, more editing on the constitution. Then they were like,    All right, you   re approved,    and I was like,    All of that for a five-minute conference for you to tell me that I   m approved,    (Laughs) but it took all of that. Then after we were registered   right now, we   re a registered group. We   re not recognized yet. We have to have a trial period to where they know we   re not   . I don   t know what they   I don   t know what we would do to not be an organization, but yes, we have a trial period. Right now, we   re technically considered a registered group, but I think next year, we will be considered a recognized group, so I can   t wait.  Baeza How many people are on the group with you?  Chavez I got twenty-three people to apply. There   s that core is a good ten people that are on it, who really want to be there. I think what I consider my biggest accomplishment is that I didn   t get those twenty-three people by begging anybody like,    Hey, fill this application out. Please be a part of my group.    I didn   t do that. I think I hyped it up enough to where people wanted to do it. I told them enough about it, and all the great things that I get from it, and the benefits of being a part of it, and people wanted to do it. At the end of the day, I didn   t have to beg anybody to be a part of it. People wanted to do it 27  and people want to do it now. I feel if for whatever reason I left it, I feel somebody would pick it up because they know that there   s something good there.  I   m really excited for this convention, and that was my biggest goal, but it wasn   t my only goal for this. It was to get a couple of people there because what made sense for me   . I stayed there with LULAC after that first meeting that I ever had because of the advisor, and because I was like,    This is kind of cool.    I had a really good advisor, and it was already super well-off on its own. They didn   t even need me, and it was all right, but I think had I been any other person, I would have been like,    Whatever.    I didn   t want that lack of my advisor being there to like,    I   m so great   .    He wasn   t like that, but he is so great, you could tell. I didn   t want it to be something that people weren   t really interested in, and so   . Oh, I lost my train of thought. What was I talking about? I completely lost it. I don   t know. I saw a bird. (Laughs)  Baeza The founding of LULAC.  Chavez Okay, yes. Whenever I did it   . I don   t know. It   s all gone. Can you re-ask the question? What were we talking about? (Laughter)  Baeza Basically, we were talking about you starting LULAC and the activities. You were getting into the conference, how you really wanted to make sure   .  Chavez Oh, how did I.    Honestly, I saw a bird.  Baeza You started talking about the advisor that you had in high school, and how you didn   t want not having an advisor in college to mess up the group.  Chavez Yes, so I didn   t want that to happen. I went, and I decided,    Okay, I need to get them to the convention,    because the thing that without my advisor did it for me was going to the convention, and seeing like,    Man, this is more than   this isn   t a club. This is a real organization. This is a national organization with a national president with all these great people.    My first conference, Michelle Obama went, and she spoke to us, and I was in awe. A bunch of the Hispanic people from Univision and all those news people, they were there, and I saw so many professional people. That was something that I wasn   t used to and that did it for me.  I was like,    I want to be a part of this,    so I want to bring them. I want to take them to Washington because I want them to know like,    Hey, this isn   t just me hyping something up that isn   t real. This is me telling you like,    Hey, come look at this, and then you can decide whether you want to continue it or not.       I feel once these   . I   m taking eight people with me, me plus seven. Once those seven people see the convention, and they see what 28  is actually going on, they   re not going to need me anymore because they   re going to want it from the bottom of their hearts. They   re going to make it happen because they   re going to want to go back, and I   m really happy about that. I think it   s   . I   m blessed that I was able to muster up, and gather people, and get the help that was needed to make it happen.  Baeza Who are the big founders with you?  Chavez Nobody, Angela. (Laughs) As far as students go, there   s three or four that have consistently been there with me the entire time, but they alternate by parts. At the beginning, it was a girl named Karolina del Bosque. She helped me with the roster, and doing all the secretary stuff of typing everything up, and making sure I was on top of everything. Then from there, my two friends that I have. One of the girls was in the youth council with me for a while, and she went to Salt Lake City with me, so she already had an idea. She studies a lot, so she wasn   t available too much of the time. (Laughs) It was a lot of moral support. A lot of the things that needed to be done were things that needed to be done me because I knew what they didn   t, right, so I got a lot of help with the application-type paperwork, favors here and there.  Honestly, it was me and Angela. The most help that I got was Angela. Angela is the advisor for our council, and she was like,    Yes, I   ll help you with it,    and I can   t tell you how many   I can   t even count. I think I need more fingers to count how many times I went into her office, having a mental breakdown and had to sit there and cry it out because it was so stressful. It was things that   . It was so hard because you   re connecting this national organization that   s already existing to this university that has its own things, its own requirements, its own restrictions, its own process to this other thing that has its own process, its own little thing. Trying to bring those two together, trying to be that liaison, being pulled this side, and then being pulled this side, you just   . It wore me out.  Baeza You talked about the work you had to do with the university. What about the work you had to do with LULAC about opening a chapter at the university?  Chavez Yes, I had a contact. His name is Manuel Rend  n. I met him my first conference that I went to in New York, and he was the national vice president for young adults for five years. He basically made collegiate LULAC what it is today. He took it from something baby. He took the idea basically. It was already established, but nothing was done with it. It was there, and he took that little idea and that little thing that was there, and he blossomed it. He more than doubled the size of the membership, and I think now, I don   t even know how many people. He traveled to so many places and sacrificed his time, and the stories that I   ve heard that   . He told me one time, that one of the times that he had to go somewhere, he slept in his car and showered at a friend   s, one of the friend   s that he   d had from LULAC. 29  To make that trip happen and be able to get something started, and that type of sacrifice, I think I was really honored to know him. Then I served on the national youth board for a little while, and we went to Washington DC.  I met with him because I told him,    Hey, I   m interested in doing this, but I don   t really know the logistics of it. I don   t really know even where to start. I want to have a conversation,    and he was like,    Okay.    We met the very last day because whenever you go to these things, the schedule is everywhere, especially him being who he is and being so important. With the youth board and everything, it was very hard. The very last night that we were there, we met at ten o   clock in the hotel lobby and talked for hours. He told me about collegiate LULAC, and his experiences and everything he   s done, and I was like this whole time,    Oh my god, I want to be you. You   re a hard worker, and that   s so much sacrifice is what I saw. You made this. This is your baby, this is your creation,    and I befriended him, and he is a mentor to me now.  He is a very good friend, and he helped me through everything. Him and Angela were the reason   he was my LULAC person and Angela was my OSU person, and he helped me through the entire paperwork of it. He told me how to   . He gave me shortcuts to everything basically. The stuff that would have taken me a long time to figure out by myself, he basically was like,    This is what you got to do. Here   s a list, this, this, this and that.    He saved me the work from having to figure out how to do everything on my own to like,    Here, this is what you need to do. Get it done. If you need anything, I   m your person.    He made a couple of trips to Stillwater as well to talk to people and let them know that it   s not just me blabbing on about some non-existent thing. It was super helpful.  Baeza You talked about this conference, that you   re going to take eight people with you. How are you funding this trip?  Chavez OSU is very helpful. I got donations from the Spears School of Business. They donated twenty-five hundred, and then Dr. Lee Bird donated another twelve hundred, and then we fundraised some money outside of that. Then we   re contributing some money, but it   s less than seventy dollars. We   re making it work.  Baeza Are there other collegiate chapters nearby?  Chavez Yes, there is, but they don   t do anything. I think they were chartered at UCO. The University of Central Oklahoma, from my understanding, had a council chartered. I spoke with Manuel, which is my contact that I just mentioned a minute ago, and he told me that they   re not. I think they   re probably   . There is something there, but they never filed the paperwork correctly, or never really got through, or I don   t know what that was. Then 30  there was one at OU, the University of Oklahoma, and they chartered, and they were on record, but they   . The girl who started it graduated, and then nobody else took over, so it went away. Right now, I have a friend who is working on trying to get it started, so it   s coming soon. Yes, for now, Oklahoma is the only one, Oklahoma State. Proud of that. Go Pokes.  Baeza What goal do you have for the chapter there at OSU?  Chavez I want it to be that stepping stone, and I think that   s what I   ve said the whole time is that I don   t honestly care if the organization itself gets too much recognition, but I want the people in it to get recognition. I want somebody to look at a person, and doing whatever they   re doing, and see LULAC somewhere on their resume. I want   . It doesn   t even, like I said, it   s not about the recognition, it   s about what it can get done. If it can help even one person make contact or do something, gain a little bit of confidence to do something else, that   s more than what I could have ever asked for. That   s what I want from it. That was my initial thing, and then that and I wanted to bring more students from the city because nobody ever does anything from Stillwater to students here. I talked to Angela, and she said it   s because it   s too far, and so I   m going to work on that. That   s my goal is bringing more diversity and then doing something with that diversity. Not having it sit there, because I don   t know. I   ve read an article recently.  I was so frustrated because it   s the diversity   and it frustrates me whenever I feel like I   m being used like a pawn, like a colored face there waiting for whenever somebody wants to take a picture or a statistic,    Yes, we   re so diverse. We have so many Hispanic students.    It   s frustrating because I   m not just a number, and I   m not just a face. I have something to contribute and I have something to do, so whenever I   m a part of something where there   s no faces like mine, I feel little because I feel they don   t really see my potential. They see my ethnicity, and that   s the part that they   re like,    Yes, we have a diverse student.    What are you going to do with me? You don   t give me an opportunity to grow, to do anything else, and that   s what I want it to be. I want to give them the confidence to not wait for it to be given to them, to take it,    I belong here, I went through the same process that you did to get here. I   m just as deserving.    I want them to be able to have the confidence and to stand up to anybody, whoever tries to think less of them. I want them to be able to have that confidence.  Baeza What are your future goals?  Chavez Oh, I don   t know. I   ve changed my major three times already. I went from physical education to landscape management, to   no, physical education to non-profit management. I   m doing landscape management now, and honestly, I   m thinking about changing it as soon as school starts. I   m going to give it a week to see how it goes. I don   t know how to do anything. My 31  biggest hope in life is that the organizations that I   m a part of will get me connections because I   ve heard plenty of times that it   s not what you know, it   s who you know. I think that   s what   s going to get me through life. I   ve never gotten anything that I   ve applied for because I suck at applications, but I   ve done a lot through knowing somebody who knows what I am capable of and what I do. Obviously, it   s not a,    Here you go because you   re my friend,    but it   s like,    This person is doing something, and I want them to have another opportunity.     If it   s not for that, then I   m not going to go anywhere because I don   t know what it is. I   m not good with having to prove myself to anyone, because that   s what applications are, you have to prove yourself worthy, and I   m not good at that. You either know that I am or you don   t. I   m hoping that here, within the next couple of years, I can figure out my career path and figure out what I really want to do. I don   t want to settle for something that I   m not going to love because I   m going to be doing that for the rest of my life. I   m lying. I don   t think I   m going to do the same thing for the rest of my life. I think I   m ADD  Attention Deficit Disorder  a little bit. I get bored really fast, so I don   t know. I   m going to have an interesting life ahead of me.  Baeza I guess what because I know you   re going to want to. Is there something that you want to say to both current Hispanic students at OSU and any possible future students at OSU?  Chavez I think for any current students, I think it   s really important that they are go-getters, that they can find it within themselves, and it   s not easy. I struggle so much to be a part of something different, to willingly go somewhere where I feel little and invisible. I know it takes a lot, but it   s things that need to be done for us to get anywhere, and by us, I mean the Hispanic people, La Raza. As far as incoming students, I hope that they make the most out of their opportunity, and I guess that   s for both because there is so much. I   ve been overwhelmed by the opportunity that there is at Oklahoma State University, and at any university really, the opportunity for growth. I think everything is about growth. I think if you   re   . You can do whatever, but if you don   t feel you   re getting anything out of it personally, then is it really worth it? Always keep yourself in mind. I think it   s really important to think about others, but at the same time, you have to make sure you   re okay too, so make yourself succeed.  Baeza Is there anything I haven   t asked you about or anything that you   d like to contribute to the interview?  Chavez This is way off, but I thought it   d be interesting, I guess. Homecoming Parade, I was hit by the car, it hit me right here. I had a big, old bruise. It barely nicked me. That was probably   . I   m still traumatized by that. When 32  I hear a loud noise, it   s scary. I jump and everybody jumps, but I   m like,    Whoa, okay.     Baeza Can you give background on the   .  Chavez We weren   t going to go. Me and two of my friends, we woke up late and we decided,    Let   s not go.    Then we went to the Homecoming Parade for the 2015 fall parade, and we were on the corner of Hall of Fame and Main Street. We were actually the ones that closed off. If you see in the video from the Homecoming crash Parade, Homecoming Parade video, you can see that the street is   . Here   s the street, and then half of the street is blocked off by people. We   re the ones that started that because we couldn   t see from all the way on the other corner, so we moved. Then as soon as we moved, other people followed us. They formed that line, and I was at the very front of it. Angela had actually sent me a picture. My phone was not working, but she had sent me a picture of myself, and she was like,    I see you.    I saw that a couple days later whenever my phone started working again, and we were   it was about to be over.  Nothing special, it was a parade. It was cool, it was a lot of fun. It was really interesting to see all of the people. Then I remember, I was facing away from the direction of the car, where it came from. It came from behind, and I heard people   I heard a crash. My first thought was it   s Pistol Pete. Pistol Pete shot his gun. I turned around, but it was so crowded, and people were pushing me, and I was like,    Get off of me     That was my first   this was all within quick thoughts, like one, two, maybe three seconds. I turn around, and people are pushing me, and then they start falling, and I   m like,    What?    Then all of a sudden, I see something, and then I   m on the floor. Obviously I saw it, but I didn   t really comprehend. I fell on top of somebody, and I was like,    Oh my god, I   m so sorry. Let me get up,    because I still didn   t know what was going on. Once I stood up, I got up really fast.  As fast as that car went by, I was up because it barely hit me. I think it might have been the mirror, or the headlight of it, I   m not sure. It hit me right here, and I had a big bruise. I think I still have a little bump, but I got up super fast. The first thing that I saw was a little boy, sliding from the other end of the street, to stop right in front of me. He looked dead. He was in shock. It looked like he had been sitting down, and he had gotten hit and then didn   t move. He stayed in that sitting position. Then I had a friend, and my friend that was with me, she got really bad anxiety. I was in shock, and I had another friend, and she was crying. I was trying to still figure out what the heck was going on, but as soon as I saw the little boy, she saw him too. She ran, and my first thing was,    Oh my God, Monica. Go get her.     33  Her keys were missing, and we were right there. Where we were, she couldn   t go back and look because she couldn   t see what was going on. I went to go look for them, and her keys were under one of the people who passed away, and I had to grab them. Then   . I don   t know. It took a long time. I remember I drove home, and as soon as I got home   I held it together until   . I was still in shock, but as soon as I got home   . Like I said, my phone wasn   t working, so I couldn   t get in contact with my family, but whenever I got there, they were already watching it on the news. The first thing like,    Are you okay,    and I lost it. Ever since then, I was really   . Angela called it survivor   s guilt, and it was like,    Why, why, why, why?    I was right there. I had literally just taken a step back. Had I not taken that step back, I would have been up in the air with everybody else, and that   s really hard.  It   s still like being at the actual scene, and actually seeing it right there as opposed to hearing it. People feel it, whenever hearing it and being there, but really being a part of it, and that just   . It was really hard, and it   s still really hard, like I said. There was a soccer game here that I volunteered for. It was Energy FC versus Chivas, and I was volunteering. At the end of the game, they popped fireworks. I jumped, (Laughs) and I still jump every time I   m somewhere where there   s a large group of people and I hear a loud noise, or a pop or something, and I jump. It   s not like I   m terrified, but it   s like,    Oh my god, there it is again,    and then it   s that sigh of relief afterwards. After that initial shock, and you   re like,    Okay nothing is happening,    and it   s that constant thing. It took me a long time to get it out of my head.  Baeza Since you were at the actual scene where it happened, how long were you there?  Chavez Just enough, until I found her keys. Unfortunately, it was the very center where it all happened, so I saw everything. About as bad as it gets, I saw it, and that   s all it took. What gets me, what still bothers me to this day is that I left. I walked back like all of that wasn   t going on behind me, like all these people didn   t get killed and hurt behind me. My first reaction was   you know how they say it   s a fight or flight? I flew, I left, I ran. I didn   t, for one minute, stop to try and see if the little boy was okay. I walked back whenever I was looking for the key.  He was fine, he wasn   t the one who passed away. Thinking that he was and seeing him   . Then I was like,    Man, I didn   t even think to check if he was okay.    I literally ran away from him, if he was some weird creature like,    Don   t touch me.    I feel bad for it because I looked around me, and I remember it   s a chaos. It   s blurry, and everybody   s burning, and I remember people ran straight to the people who were injured like,    Are you okay? Do you need help? Hold your head up,    and I left. I think that sucks. I wish I 34  would have reacted in a different way. Angela tried to make me feel better by telling me that I was trying to help my friends, so helped a little bit, I guess.  Baeza You were also hit. I guess, I mean, it   s weird in that you didn   t observe what happened. You were part of what happened, and I think that makes a difference.  Chavez Yes, my two friends that were with us, there was three of us. It was my two friends. We left that day. We didn   t do any of the other Homecoming festivities. People continued their day, people who weren   t close to it. They continued about their day, and we didn   t. For a long time   . I remember months later, we were in our dorm, and it came about. None of us had really talked to anybody. We all were sent to counseling, and we all did this and that, but it didn   t feel real like,    You don   t know what I went through. You   re just asking me generic questions. You don   t know anything.    Having them there and them understand like,    Wow, that really sucked,    feel what you feel, I think that   s really helpful. They were the people who helped me to get through it, and it still sucks. I don   t think I   ll ever be able to enjoy Homecoming because I   m always going to have that thought lingering.  It   s like I said, it   s not like I   m going to break down again, but it   s that thought like,    Man, that was Homecoming.    The one that really hit me, the girl from UCO. She was   . On impact   there is no way that she suffered at all, I   m pretty sure, because of how bad it looked. Whenever everybody was running, and trying to see if everybody was okay, she was by herself. I don   t know why, and I still wonder like,    Who was she there with?    Nobody was around her, nobody was trying to help her. Looking at this stand-still   . Think of a dot, and then everything it around is moving, but that one person is there, all by herself. I didn   t understand who was there with her that they didn   t go to her. Little stuff like that I still think about. Anyhow, it was an experience.  Baeza I guess we   ll end with that.  Chavez Yes. Sorry to end it on a Debbie downer. (Laughter)  Baeza No, it   s part of your experience, and it   s something that will always be a part of your experience at OSU. Thank you very much for the interview.  Chavez Thank you for asking, for listening.  -------  -------
