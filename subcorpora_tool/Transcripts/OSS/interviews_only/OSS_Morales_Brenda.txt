 Baeza The following interview is being conducted with Ms. Brenda Morales for the Latino Americans: Five Hundred Years of History Grant Project at Oklahoma State University. The interview will become part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the Edmon Low Library on the Stillwater campus of Oklahoma State University. The interview is taking place on Thursday, June 2, 2016, in the Edmon Low Library in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The interviewer is Victor Dominguez Baeza, Director of Library Graduate Services. Brenda, thank you for agreeing to participate in this oral history project. I want to remind you that this may be published as part of the Oklahoma Oral Research Program at Oklahoma State University, here in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and that you have granted us permission to publish the transcript and video in part or in its entirety. (Laughs) Okay, so if you could for me   to start the interview, could you give me some sort of background information on yourself?  Morales Yeah  As you mentioned, I am Brenda Morales. I am originally from south Texas and north Mexico. I grew up in both areas, it   s called the Rio Grande Valley, so it   s a border area. The way I became acquainted with OSU is I did my undergrad in University of Texas Pan-American, and   well, at the time. Now, I think it   s called UT-RGV, which is University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley. Through my junior year, there was an internship opportunity that was offered here at OSU through NSF, through National Science Foundation. I applied, got accepted and came to OSU. That was my first acquaintance with OSU, came for a summer to do research and loved it. Only applied here for grad school, and I applied and came back, and then yeah. I finished my graduate school here, and thought I was going back to Texas. I did for several months, (Laughs) and they called me back, OSU called me back. Now I   m here, been working here for about eight and a half years.  Baeza Where were you born?  5  Morales Okay, so I was actually born in Pharr, Texas, but I   ve never lived there. It   s part of the Rio Grande Valley Area, and I was raised in Mexico, so it   s kind of a particular situation. Like I said, I was born in the United States, but most of my education was in both sides of the border, but I lived mostly in Mexico until I was fifteen. Then I came back to the United States.  Baeza Can you tell me a little bit about your family?  Morales Yeah, so we are a medium-sized family. There   s four children, and my two parents. My parents are actually from   well, they   re close by. They   re Monterrey, Mexico, and General Ter  n, Mexico. They   re both northern towns, and all of the   once they got married, they moved to Reynosa, which is where I grew up. Being there, that   s where all of us were born, so   well, not in Reynosa. I don   t think any of us were actually born there, which is interesting. Though we were all born in the United States, with the exception of one brother, who was born in Monterrey, but yeah. We   re a pretty close-knit family. Like I said, we are a medium-sized family. I   m currently the old   well, no. I   m the second born, so (Laughs) I had to think about it. It   s my parents, then it   s my sister, and then myself, so my sister is forty right now, I   m thirty-seven. Then my brother that   s after me is, oh, let   s see. I   m thirty-seven, so he is   .(Laughs) It   s so funny, I have to calculate everything now  He   s thirty, and then the youngest one is twenty-six, twenty-five   twenty-six, (Laughs) something like that.  Baeza What are all their names?  Morales Okay, so the oldest one   well, my parents. My dad is Hector Javier Morales. My mom is Yolanda Morales or D  vila de Morales. My sister is now, she changed her name, she   s married, so she   s Yolanda. (Laughs) That   s so funny, Yolanda Flores, no. Yolanda Morales Flores, yeah. I get confused, but we call her Cheli, so if you hear me by any chance refer to anybody that   s Cheli, and then it   s myself. Then my brother is the same as my dad, Hector Javier Morales. There is no junior, it   s just the same name, and then the youngest one is Pedro Walberto Morales.  Baeza When you were growing up, was education sort of a topic in the family, going to college?  Morales We were very fortunate it. It was, but my parents, especially my mom, she was very much an advocate for education, but she kind of didn   t know much about it. My dad was educated until his sixth grade year in elementary school, and that was partly by choice. Unfortunately, he   well, fortunately, he wanted to be a veterinarian, but unfortunately, there was a teacher that, he wasn   t doing good in school, especially in science subjects, she told him,    Oh, you   re not going to amount to anything,    which is interesting because he went to really good private schools. I mean, I guess people are going to 6  be mean wherever you go, it doesn   t matter. He decided after sixth grade,    Well, if I   m just wasting my time, I   m just going to leave school,    so he did, and he began working then. My mom actually did finish.  Well, it   s interesting too because in her hometown, they only had up to sixth grade. They didn   t have any more, so she had to move to the city, which they did, to continue her education. She did and she graduated high school, and she even got a certificate program. It wasn   t through a college, it was a technical school, and she got a certificate for bilingual secretary at the time. My mom, and actually she wanted to be a teacher, so when she told her parents she wanted to go to college and study education, unfortunately, my grandfather told her that shouldn   t   that   s not a possibility because (this is horrible to admit but) the teachers are whores. You don   t go into that type of education, or you don   t go into that field basically. My mom   both of them, unfortunately, were kind of truncated in regards to their education. They both were advocates for it, more my mom than my dad, but kind of not knowing what to suggest.  They were like,    Yes, you need to get educated,    and my mom was very   she loves reading so she was   we were very fortunate to have books in our house growing up. Even that was, I think, very rare because most of our community, like friends and stuff, didn   t have that push of like,    Oh, yes  Let   s read, let   s get educated,    even if that   s not the field you want to go into. Yeah, so education was definitely a big priority, but without the knowledge of how to even get there, and especially since we moved to the US. They both had only navigated the Mexican system of education, so having to try to figure out, I mean, even just the grades. I remember when we came to the US, everything in Mexico was one to ten in regards to grading, like a grading scale, and here, it   s A, B, C, D, there is no E, and it   s the F. It   s like,    Wait, what   s going on?    Even navigating through that was kind of interesting, but regardless, the push for education was always there, yes.  Baeza Were you   are you first-generation college?  Morales Yes, so I am first-generation college student, regardless of what country you look at, because I know some students are like,    Yeah  I   m first generation college   in the US.    (Laughs) But no, my parents, like I said, did not get a college education, or even   like I said, even the certification program that my mom went through wasn   t even a university or college, it was a little technical school. Yes, I am first-generation. Well, all of my siblings are too, and only, out of the four siblings, my sister and myself are the only ones that have a bachelor   s and a master   s, and I have partial PhD. I didn   t finish it. My youngest two brothers, they started college, and they decided not to continue it.  7  Baeza What was it like growing up?  Morales (Laughs) Now, I realize it was very different. To me, it was normal, I mean, it was just   I moved a lot actually. I mentioned that I was between two cities, or between two countries actually, and so every two years I changed schools, which was weird. It wasn   t because my parents were like,    Oh, you need to move schools,    it was just by coincidence. Like I mentioned, even when I lived in Mexico, there was times that I went to school in the US, so I never realized how much of a privilege that was. Especially the fact that the sacrifices that my mom had to make. We had to wake up at five in the morning, get ready to go to school. This is like   I   m talking about if we were living in Mexico at the time and going to school in the US.  We   d have to wake up at five in the morning, get ready, get into uniforms, my mom would cross the border to take us. At the time, thank goodness, it was only about thirty minutes, but still it   s a sacrifice to every morning have to drive you to a different country, and take you to school so you could be there on time, and things like that. To me, it was normal. Like I said, it was   I never thought anything of it until   I think the first time I started to realize that it was a little bit different was when I was in junior high because I had gone back to Mexico. Even though most of my friends, they teach them English since you   re growing up in Mexico, it was very different. I realized that they couldn   t go back and forth between languages as easily as I could, so then I realized,    Oh, this is different.     The way I grew up is different, and especially in regards to education, because other stuff   I mean, like I said, I went back to Mexico, so we   d still play on the streets basketball, and still be all the regular stuff. Growing up, I think, I mean, it was just interesting to see the opportunities that we had. Even though, let   s say, we were very fortunate that we were able to go to private school, and sometimes it was on scholarship because it wasn   t   financially, we weren   t all there, but still that opportunity wasn   t either given to or received by other people. That was   it   s a major thing that now, I realize the difference. Before, I was just like,    Oh, it   s just life.     Baeza So it was you and all your siblings were doing this back and forth?  Morales It was mostly my older sister and myself, and then   okay, so let me see, and actually I   ll go back into it. My sister did a little bit longer school in Mexico, I think, so I actually   let   s see. Kindergarten, so in Mexico, we have three years of kindergarten, and so my first two years of kindergarten were done in Mexico. Then I did kindergarten again here in the US, first and second grade, and then I went back. I did third and fourth grade in Mexico, then I came back. I did fifth, sixth, and seventh in the US, two different schools. Then I went back, and I did ninth grade in Mexico, and then I did my last three years in the US. 8  As you can tell, it was kind of a back and forth of where I did schooling. It was very confusing, but   I mean, it wasn   t confusing, and now it   s very confusing. (Laughs) My sister did that as well, except for her high school, she finished high school over there. At the time, we had the opportunity   I had the opportunity to move with my grandparents, so that   s what we did to come back to school here, but my sister stayed with my parents in Mexico to finish her high school degree over there, and then she came back for college.  Then my younger siblings, since we   re kind of   from me to the one that   s after me, it   s six years, and then twelve years from me to the youngest. Since it   s such an age difference, by the time that they were in school, most of their school was in the US. Actually, the youngest one, all of his schooling was in the US, but the one right after me, Hector, he did several years of kindergarten. I think even   no, just kindergarten in Mexico, and then he did the rest in the U.S. It was mostly my sister and myself that went through that going back and forth, back and forth. The other ones didn   t as much. By then, we were fully established in the US.  Baeza You kind of mentioned this when I asked you about yourself, but how did you first hear about Oklahoma State University?  Morales It was by coincidence. I was taking a   in undergrad, I was studying psychology, and I was taking a priming behavior class. My professor at the time, Dr. James Aldri   not James, Docto   yes, James Aldrige, which is a female, that   s why it   s confusing, the James part. (Laughs) She, I think, had gotten a degree from OSU. I   m not very sure about that because I looked, I remember trying to look for her thesis, and I couldn   t find it. She had at one point said that she had come to OSU, and I didn   t know if it was for a degree, or just to do research, I don   t know. She had received an email from, at the time, Dr. Melanie Paige, promoting this REU program, Research Experience for Undergrads, from NSF, National Science Foundation. In her priming behavior class, she announced it. She said,    Hey, there   s this opportunity for an internship, psychology internship in Oklahoma State University if anybody wants to apply.     At the time, there wasn   t that many psychology internships. I don   t think there was that many internships to begin with at the time, but for psychology even less. I was like,    Oh yes  Of course, I   ll take it     I actually was interested in research, but the interesting part is where I was at, it   s a teaching institution. Now it   s becoming more research, but at the time it was mostly teaching, so coming to OSU or seeing that opportunity, I was like,    I have to go there because I need to get some experience.    Yeah, I took the opportunity and coming to OSU is amazing. That   s the first time I found out about it, and when I got accepted, it was so eye-opening. Just to see such a big library, see, I mean, just so many resources that even though my 9  university was pretty big, the environment was very different. Anyways, yeah, going back to it, that   s how I found out about OSU.  Baeza What were your first thoughts when you first arrived on campus?  Morales Well, I actually had been to another university before. Not in regards to psychology, and in a little bit different experience, but I went to University of Laval in Quebec as a study abroad opportunity. I remember there thinking,    Oh my goodness  This is humongous  There   s streets in between the university     When I came to OSU, I thought the same thing. I thought,    Oh my goodness, it   s so big,    but it didn   t surprise me as much because I had already seen a university that was that big, but then what was very different was the architecture. Just to see what you normally see on TV   I know this sounds very clich  , but what you normally see on TV of American universities.  Well, my university, even though it was American, it wasn   t like that. It didn   t look like that, having this old-looking architecture. I remember coming in and seeing the library, and I think that was one of my biggest impacts was honestly the library. Just the outside was to me   just how big those copper doors, to me is amazing, I still like,    I love them,    they   re so freaking heavy, but I love them. That was one of my biggest surprises was just seeing such a amazingly big library within the university, and I don   t know, it seemed like a very beautiful campus. One thing that still surprises me that I remember thinking then and still thinking now was there is no OSU sign.  There is no   where you can go to take   you come into universities, and there   s the entrance sign of    Here  Welcome to such and such University     Well, OSU has a maroon type plaque, (Laughs) brownish plaque that   s marble over by the gardens by Theta Pond, but it   s not orange, and it doesn   t have a big OSU sign. I remember that was another thing that I was like,    I can   t take a picture,    like,    Where am I going to take a picture?    Anyways, that was my biggest impressions. I remember just the structure of it, architecture, how big it was, and the resources it had was   I think those were my biggest impressions of OSU.  Baeza How long were you here for that internship?  Morales That was two months, or three months It was May to July, so maybe two and a half months about. Even though it was in   well, that was, let me see, summer of   I graduated 2002, so 2001, summer of 2001. Actually, that   s another thing that the university looked very different too. I mean, Boone Pickens Stadium wasn   t there, it was Lewis Field, and I remember even that seemed ginormous to me. I don   t know what it would have been like to come to Boone Pickens, and be like,    Oh my goodness     Yeah, it looked 10  very different, but yeah, that was in 2001, and I forgot your question. (Laughs) What was your question?  Baeza How long your first stay was here?  Morales Oh yeah, so about two and a half months. Yeah, and it was, I think, if I   m not mistaken, it was end of May to   well, middle of May to end of July.  Baeza At that time, did you look for or see other Hispanics in the area?  Morales I did, and there was hardly any. (Laughs) At the time, and it   s still active now, but at the time, there was LDCC that actually was active during the summers. LDCC is the Latin Dance and Cultural Club, and that organization basically had students teach other students salsa dancing, a lot of the Caribbean   well, not just Caribbean, but a lot of the Caribbean dances. I remember that summer being here, actually   so in the cohort that was there for that group, there was two Hispanics, and both of us came from the same university, and it   s actually my best friend and myself. It was really funny because we came here, and we   re like   we both knew each other, and so we got here, and we   re like,    Okay     We weren   t, I don   t know, it wasn   t like,    Oh, it   s very white,    but it was different.  The culture   I don   t know, I guess part of it is I   m very open in regards to culture, and actually the high school that I went to in Texas is, and this is horrible but it   s the    white    high school. We   because it   s ninety percent Hispanic where I go, but that high school wasn   t. It was maybe about fifty-fifty at the time, so to me that wasn   t going to be a big shock. Going to undergrad in Pan-Am also was a little bit diverse, and so the majority is Hispanic, but there was other cultures there. That wasn   t the biggest different, I think, it was the cultural difference, so because of that, of missing to hear Spanish radio, Spanish TV, music, so we did look for those other Hispanic people on campus. We couldn   t really find them. Even in LDCC, there was actually a lot of Indians at the time teaching classes, and they were amazing so they were a great group of people too.  That was, I think, the way that we found keeping, or being able to identify with other people here on campus because at least they knew the culture. Even though they were Indian, they were like,    Oh yeah  We listen to Spanish music, we appreciate the culture and the dance,    and things like that. That was really cool, but other than that, I don   t think we met that many other Hispanic people because even   unfortunately, where we were at, we were in Patchins and Jones, and then North Murray. Since we were doing research and stuff all the time, we didn   t really have, except for the library, an outlet to meet people unless somebody else happened to know them. Because of that, I didn   t meet any of the people that either might have worked here at the time. Patricia Diaz was one of the only ones I met, but 11  she works in the psychology department, and that was it. I don   t think   yeah, that particular summer, I think, there wasn   t that many Hispanic people that I met at all.  Baeza Where did you live during those two months?  Morales In Patchins and Jones. Yeah, they had the university actually, or the program gave us those locations to live in, so all of us lived in Patchins and Jones, just the different wings of it.  Baeza Then you left, finished school, and then what did you do after that?  Morales So you mean my undergrad? Or   .  Baeza You finished your undergrad.  Morales Yeah, so that was during my undergrad years, and I finished undergrad. That was, so when I came here was the summer before I graduated, so I finished that next year, and I knew   well, actually that whole next year was the process of applying here. At the time, I was debating between child psychology and animal behavior, and unfortunately, I had a bad encounter with a child psychologist back in undergrad. Kind of with, similar to my dad   s like,     No, with that GPA, you   re not going to get anywhere. You   re not going to even get admitted to a program.    Unfortunately, I partially believed him, and I only applied to animal behavior programs, and so one of them was here. I was like,    Why apply anywhere else? If I knew I liked it, if I liked the professor, let me just apply here.    That   s all I did, I just applied to OSU.  That was the next year, so that next year it was GREs. It was, at the time I had to take subject GREs, it was prepping for all that, applying, getting into OSU. I found out in March that I got in, so I was like    Woohoo     Then after that, I was like,    Okay,    just prepping for coming to OSU. That next summer, I actually went to work in Walt Disney World. That   s a totally different thing for the summer, which actually was interesting, because prior to that, not that summer, I had done an internship for Walt Disney World but it was also an animal-behavior-based. That actually kind of still tied me into OSU, to kind of be like,    Yeah, you should do this. This is what you want to do,    which is interesting because that   s not what I do now. (Laughs) Yeah, so that   s what happened, and then I came in August and started grad school.  Baeza What was it like coming to campus a second time?  Morales It was actually different. I mean, it was still very like,    Oh,    you admire it and it looks awesome, but it   s like,    Okay, it   s game time.    Now, it   s not so much you   re on tour, and you   re looking around, it   s like,    Okay, you have 12  to find resources, and get your stuff done for grad school.    It was really cool. Actually the first several years for grad school were very much about,    Okay, what do I need to do for grad school?    What I need to do because I felt, and I was, ill-prepared for it. As I mentioned, my undergrad was not a research institution, or it wasn   t at the time, so I felt like I had to do a lot of catching up.  Those first several years, it was just kind of North Murray, North Murray, North Murray. Once I kind of let my guard down in the sense of,    Okay, I got the kind of gist of it. I can do this,    then a different side of OSU came out to me, which was getting very involved with the International Student Organization, with the Latin American Student Association, with LDCC for just dances and things like that. Then I started to meet more the OSU culture in regards to its people, started going to football games, different things like that. That was, I guess, this different side of OSU that I saw, but I didn   t see it immediately. I saw it after two years of being here.  Baeza Your first time was during the summer, so then during the regular semesters, the fall and spring, did you notice more Hispanics then?  Morales Well, actually when I came for grad school, still no. (Laughs) The summer really didn   t make a difference. It wasn   t   I mean, there was, but there was very few of us back then. I remember going to HOLA, which is the Hispanic Orientation of Leadership Associations hosted by the Hispanic Student Association, and I remember going to HSA meetings, and honestly, there was sometimes six people there. They were mostly officers of the organization, so not to mean that there was only six Hispanics on campus, I know that there   s more, but in the sense of people seeking their own people or whatever, it was very, very few. In my department, there was only two Hispanics, myself and another young lady, Elaine Fernandez, but she was very Americanized. I mean, she didn   t speak Spanish, she didn   t eat anything that was Hispanic, even though both her parents were Mexican-American.  I think she had been here for generations because I remember her telling me like,    No, I don   t really like tortillas,    and I was like,    What? How is that possible? No     Yeah, so it was very different because you would meet a lot of people like that, that were you know second-third generation. I mean, of course, they are Hispanic, but that   what you   re looking for, like the culture, the language, the traditions, they   re not really there. It   s like,    Okay, well then. Nice to have that last name,    I don   t know. (Laughs) It was very different, so yeah, that second time that I came    honestly, from the summer to the regular school year, in regards to seeing more Hispanics, didn   t make much of a difference. It was still very few people. I think over years, it made a difference, but not initially, no.  13  Baeza As a student who was moving here from south Texas, northern Mexico, how did that affect you, not having a Hispanic community, a Mexican community in the area, or did it?  Morales I mean, I know in certain aspects it did, not all the time. I think my personality is very different to most people too. I tend to be very positive, so I   m like,    Yeah sure,    and,    I   ll make the best of everything,    or whatever. I mean, there   d be times, of course, that we   d crave certain foods, and I couldn   t get them at Wal-Mart. Now we can, thank goodness, but at the time, it wasn   t a possibility. I think the Hispanic aisle at the time only had tortillas and rice, which is really funny. Yeah, so that   s I think how it affected me the most was I re   actually, I specifically remember with my dad, we used to watch old Mexican movies, like the ones from the   30s or   20s. I don   t even know what years they are, maybe they   re older, but anyways, I remember purposefully buying movies from Pedro Infante or whatever because I would get nostalgic. I wouldn   t have that type of stuff here, so when I would go down to the Valley, I   d buy them, and I   d randomly start watching them here on DVD. It was just a way for me to like,    Okay. I   m back in my little zone of listening to Spanish,    or whatever. I guess it did affect me a few times, but not anything that I remember just like,    Oh, it kind of   it was really bad,    or    so overall I don   t think it was that bad. Yeah, I think, especially like you said, somebody from south Texas, you always look for those things.  You always look   I mean, regardless of where you   re from, you always look to identify with people, right, and so the way that I would identify was speaking Spanish, or   . It   s really interesting because, I mean, of course, and you hear me now. I   m completely comfortable speaking in English, but I remember someone saying   well, this particular person was actually   they had just gotten here, so it made more sense for them, but I identified that they were talking to me in Spanish, and they said,    You know, after a whole day of speaking in English, I   m tired. I just want to talk in Spanish.    I was like,    Yeah  Me too,    and so it   s interesting because I know that they meant that they have to struggle with their English because they had only been here for a few weeks. It was a visiting professor that said that. Even though I have been here the majority of my life, it is   I talk English at school, and work, and whatever, but at home it   s Spanish, and at the time   well, actually, all of my roommates, most of my roommates have been English-speaking roommates, so I didn   t even have that. To be able to go home, and kind of like,    Oh, que estas hacienda,    or what   no, that wasn   t there. I had   it   s like,    Oh my goodness  Do I ever get to speak Spanish again?    I think those were the times that I saw that it affected me, or that I noticed that it was like,    Oh my goodness, I have to cope with this or whatever.     14  Baeza Were you on a scholarship when you were here?  Morales Yeah, so the psychology program actually offers   well, I don   t think there   s a name for it, but it   s kind of a full-ride. Basically through a graduate assistantship, and if you meet their criteria that they ask, they do fund your way through graduate school. All you had to pay was a small amount of fees I think at the time, and so yes, I was here on scholarship, but I don   t think it had a name. It was just the department that gave it to us as long as we had the requirements, but it   s interesting because even that was a whole different dynamic. In undergrad, I was very fortunate because we were low-income. I got FAFSA, and everything was covered. Even sometimes because of the low cost of the university, we even had money left over to potentially buy a computer, things that we needed for school.  Then coming here and still thinking,    Oh, okay. I   m going to be able to handle it. I will have this money or whatever,    but then I realized,    Wait, I don   t live with my parents. I have to manage rent and food,    and realizing that my lifestyle was very different to that of my roommates because my roommate was like,    Oh, yeah  Let   s eat out all the time,    and I was like,    Wait, I   ve never really eaten out.    Because at home, we always eat at home, so even that was an interesting dynamic to have to figure out yes, you do have a full-ride, but how do you make that work because you still have these bills to pay. That was very interesting actually, and seeing the difference in culture of   I remember even asking her at one time,    Well, what did your mom cook?     She   s like,    What do you mean,    and I said,    Well, I understand that you don   t like some of my spicy food, so then you cook.    She   s like,    Well, I only know how to cook eggs and pasta, but spaghetti,    and I was like, and I don   t really like spaghetti. I do, but it   s not like I can have it every day, so I was like,    Doesn   t your mom cook,    and she   s like,    Well, like Stouffer   s,    and I was like,    Oh my goodness.    It was such a different culture, and granted, I know that not everybody is like her family, but it just happened that that was who my roommate was. That was my experience, so it was very different.  Baeza What kind of work did you do when you were here?  Morales My first two years, I was actually a GA for Patricia Diaz in the Psychology of Diversified Students Program. I did a lot of work for her in regards to, at the time, we had a small newsletter of resources for students that were of underrepresented populations, so minority students in the program. We would   I   d google different scholarships that were available, jobs, internships, things that were opportunities for grad students, which at the time was not many either. I did that, I did a lot of secretarial-type work inside the office. That was my first two years, and then my third year, I did a 15  TA for two semesters. I taught two classes in fall, two classes in spring, and then my fourth year, I was a computer   oh, I don   t remember the exact title. I was a lab technician, basically, for one of the labs here on campus that belonged to the psychology department, but it was in the speech department. That   s what I did, yeah.  Baeza Okay, so then graduation?  Morales Can I tell you   I don   t know if you were going to ask me about graduation, but I am going to tell you a story about graduation that definitely talks about my culture, and I love it to this day. People still remember, it   s funny. For my graduation, my whole family came, and at the time, it was my siblings, my parents, my brother-in-law, so pretty much everybody in my immediate family came. We have at home, we bought them I think for, I don   t know if it was from   actually, maybe they bought them from my graduation, or it was high school. I don   t know, but we bought some matracas. They   re these big noise makers, but so they   re the ones that you twist like this. (Laughs) Instead of normally the play ones are about this small, but these were about this big, and they   re wooden and they   re big. We were in Gallagher-Iba, and I was walking for graduation, and so sure enough, here my family is, way on the top or whatever, and here,    Brenda Morales,    or whatever.  They start making so much noise, so to me it   s like,    Yay     (Laughs) It was so much noise, I love it, and people, I mean instead of people focusing on who was graduating, it was like,    Who   ,    to the family. It was so, so funny to see, and people   it was such a different experience to see. Some people were like,    Ugh,    kind of even disgusted like,    Why are you making so much noise?    Then there was others that are   I guess, the cultures similar to ours because a lot of Indians were the ones like,    Yoooo  Woohoo     (Laughs) It was really, really cool to see that even how we celebrate certain milestones in our lives is very different, and so that to me brings me so much joy. It   s so funny because people will still like,    Your parents were the ones with the big   ,       Yes, those were my parents.    (Laughs) Anyways, that was graduation.  Baeza What year was this?  Morales In 2005, when I walked, yeah.  Baeza When they started making the noise, did you notice a reaction from anyone on stage?  Morales Yes  I   m telling you, literally the whole Gallagher-Iba. Even I think when I was shaking hands with I don   t remember who it was, one of the deans I   m guessing or something, that I was shaking hands with them. Even them initially were like   of course, they tried to focus, but they were like, 16     What   s going on?    It was a lot of noise, so it is an attention-grabber, even if you don   t want to turn. (Laughs)  Baeza So you graduated and you left.  Morales Yes.  Baeza So what brought you back?  Morales I was very, very fortunate the way that I got the job. I left, and I honestly, I think most of us, if you go to a university, you think,    Okay. Well, I got what I needed to get. Now I need to look for a job.    As I mentioned before, my area of expertise was animal behavior, so I thought,    Okay, I   m going to work at a zoo doing research, or a place maybe like Disney   s Animal Kingdom, Busch Gardens,    something that has basically a lot of animals, and either do training or do research with the animals. I did start looking, and unfortunately, nothing was coming about. I had experience before of working at a Girl Scout Camp in Colorado, so they called me up, and they said,    Hey, do you want to be our Assistant Camp Director,    and I said,    Yes, because I need a job.    I left for a few months, but they told me it   s just going to be a few months, and I said yeah, that   s fine. When I left for that, and Colorado was from March to August, so come July, I started looking for jobs again.  I was like,    Okay. I need to really get a fulltime job.    Right around the same time, a friend of mine, Adelina Longordia, she was a graduate student here at the time as well, called me up, and said,    Hey, there   s a position, Hispanic Coordinator, on campus that is open. You should apply.    I was like,    No. What   s the point of me going back to campus?    That   s not even my degree, that   s not my area of expertise, and so she   s like,    Well, you should consider it,    and I was like,    Yeah, sure, sure, whatever.    I told tell her,    Yeah, sure,    but I   m not going to apply. Then another friend of mine calls, which is another close friend, Javier Flores, and he calls too, and he   s like,    Hey, did you know that this position is available here at OSU?    I said,    Well, Adelina called me,    and he   s like,    Well, you should apply     I said,    No, what am I going to do there? No      I actually had met the people that were previously in those positions. I know this sounds really kind of dumb, but I met them and I knew how good of a resource they were for undergrad students, but I didn   t know overall what they did. Even for me to apply, I was like,    Okay, what can I offer to this position?    I don   t even know what it overall does besides be there for students. Then that was that, and Adelina kept on calling me or texting me, and I was like,    No, no, leave me alone. No.    Several weeks passed, and Dr. Figueroa, which was at the time, he was director of   I think he was Diversity Academic Support or something related to that. He called me up, 17  and he had been actually one of the coordinators before, and he   s like,    Hey, Adelina mentioned that you don   t have a job. You should apply to this job.    I was like,    No  Why don   t you guys leave me alone?    He   s like,    No, but just consider,    and I said,    Okay, sure. Whatever.    Once again, I was like,    Yeah, whatever.    Well, right after him, maybe like a day or two later, Dr. Thomas, which at the time was the VP for Institutional Diversity, called me up, and he, I had actually met when I was president.  I was president of the International Student Organization in 2005, and I had met him because of that, because of the meetings that they have, and so anyways, he called me up. He said,    Hey, Brenda. Long time no talk to you,    whatever. He   s like,    I heard you   re not   you don   t have a job. You should think about applying,    and so once the VP calls you, I was like,    Yes, sir. Okay, I   ll make sure to apply. Of course, the next day I applied, and then the rest is history. I came for an interview, I really enjoyed the interview. They give me a better understanding of what the position was. I mean, once I read the position and then when I came, I realized like,    I love this  I love working with students, with people. Why would I not apply to this?    I applied, and I interviewed, like I said, and I got accepted, and so I came back.  Baeza What are your job responsibilities, or what   s your job title, and then your job responsibilities?  Morales My job title has changed a little bit, so not a lot. I   m currently Coordinator of Hispanic and Latino Affairs within the Office of Multicultural Affairs. My overall job responsibilities is kind of a breadth of things, so we do a lot of recruitment, retention, and push to graduation of students. My particular instance is for Hispanic and Latino students, and so we get a list of all the students that identify as Hispanic and Latino, and provide them with resources. Maybe through different organizations that may pertain to their field, or even through Hispanic Student Association, which I advise. I send them emails about once a month, letting them know about different scholarships, different internship opportunities, different things that might be available to them.  Basically, all the little things that we mostly do, or I mostly do throughout the year, are stuff that are going to help them stay here. Make sure that they are doing good in their classes   I mean, I don   t check their grades one-on-one, but if I establish a relationship with the students, then I do. I   m not required to do that, it   s just something that I   ve learned that it helps them if they   they always   not they always say, but some of them say that I   m like their aunt, or like their mom away from home, or stuff like that. It   s kind of that job that I take on. It   s basically watching for them, making sure that they   re doing good in their classes or overall, because sometimes they might be doing okay in their classes, but you see that their demeanor changes. It   s 18  a very broad spectrum of stuff that I do, but it   s basically helping students overall, here at OSU.  Baeza What year was it that you were hired?  Morales In fall of 2007, (Laughs) and I laugh because I remember specifically telling my dad like,    Oh, I   ll just be there two years. I   ll get experience, and then I   ll get another job.    Eight and a half years later, (Laughs) I   m still here, but I love it  I think that   s why I didn   t leave is because it   s become so hard to leave when you actually like what you do.  Baeza How much have you seen the Hispanic culture or the students change in the time you   ve been here?  Morales Oh my goodness. It   s been such a blessing. It   s such a difference, it   s so interesting because I mentioned having the experience of being here as a student and seeing very few Hispanic/Latino students on campus. When I started working, there was four hundred, and I think it was 427, if I remember correctly, Hispanic/Latino students. Even then, once again, you would go to the HSA meetings, and now you start to see more. You   d see about twenty students go, but once again, the majority of them were the officers, and then the others were just other students. That was   when I started working was in 2007 fall, and we   ve seen such a growth. Every year has been an amazing growth of population of Hispanic/Latino students. Right now, the numbers are at   well, this was of last year, I don   t know the incoming class yet, but last year was 1,537 students, something like that. Just to see that growth in numbers, it   s amazing. A lot of my students will still come in, especially the new ones will be like,    Well, I come in, and I don   t see any Hispanics.     I   m like,    What do you mean you don   t see any Hispanics? What do we look like?    They   re like,    Well   ,    and they stay quiet. Of course, you stay quiet because we look so different  Some of us get confused for African Americans, some of us get confused for white, some of us get confused for Native American. Then there   s, unfortunately, if you want to say it like that, the stereotypical ones of,    You   re a little bit brown, and you   re short,    or whatever,    Oh, then you   re Hispanic     Yeah, but they   ll realize that when they go to the meetings now, the HSA meetings, we have an average of seventy to eighty students going to every meeting, which is amazing. It   s just really amazing to see such a growth, and we still have, of course, the range from,    I don   t speak Spanish, and I barely know my culture,    to,    I speak and breathe in everything Hispanic that I can do.    You have everybody, but it   s really cool because that camaraderie has really been established regardless of where you   re at within your identity of Hispanic and Latino culture.  19  Baeza What   s the make up of the students in the Hispanic Student Association     Morales In regards to?  Baeza    or on campus, like Mexican American?  Morales The majority   there   s no way for me to know that except for by asking them.     There   s no real way for me to know that expect for, like I said, just asking, the self-identifying, but even then self-identifying with me, not with a piece of paper. The majority   sorry, and I   m getting these numbers, let   s say from HSA because I know that some of our students have said,    Well, you guys don   t represent,    let   s say, I don   t know, Dominicans or Puerto Ricans. On the contrary, we   ve told them,    No, you guys need to come so we can start representing them,    but the majority, I would say two-thirds of our Hispanic/Latino students, or even more probably, are Mexican-American. Then the other third, or less than that, like I said, is from everywhere. It could be   we   ve had more Guatemalans, Salvadorians, we had a few Costa Ricans. A few years ago, there was quite a few Puerto Ricans. There isn   t now, or at least not to my knowledge, so that fluctuates too because actually right now, there   s a lot of Venezuelans. I don   t know if it also has to do with generational moves, I guess, from different countries to the US, but right now, still, the majority is Mexican American. Then there   s a few from different countries, or their parents are from different countries.  Baeza Can you tell a difference between the Hispanic students from 2007 and those from 2016?  Morales Well, yes in different aspects, and then no in different aspects. Just overall, I think every student that comes in (or this is one of the things that I love to tell them because they laugh at it but) is almost every single student comes in with an idea of like,    I got this.    Even though they   re scared beyond their mind, they come in freshman year, and they like,    Oh, well, I already got this. I did high school, and I got good grades or I was okay, so I know where to find resources, or I know where to   ,    this and that or whatever. Then they realize how little they know, or even just how to communicate with others. They thought,    Oh, I got this. I   m great, I   m social. I   m this, I   m that.    Then you realize no, everybody comes from a different background, or not only that, but different communities, so you respond differently to different things, so that is still the same. It   s so funny. Year after year after year, every freshman class comes in or first year class comes in, and it   s that identity of,    I got this.    Senior year, they   re like,    Oh my goodness  This is so scary  What am I going do,    because they   ve learned so much, so that   s still there. I think pride has changed, and that   s actually a really good thing, and I mean pride in our culture. I think when I first started in 2007, students would definitely identify as Hispanic or Latino, but they didn   t know what to expect when they had to say it out loud to other people. 20  Was it going to be a stereotype of,    Oh, yeah  I love Mexican food,    or different things like that, to where now they don   t care if   not that they don   t care. They might, but they   re still proud of saying it like   so here is an example. If people would have said back then like,    Oh, what are you?    Well, that in itself is already like   so back then, I think people were like,    Well, what do you mean? Why?    Some would say it, but they would still be reluctant to like,    Why are you asking me this?    Versus now, it   s like,    Oh  Well, I   m Puerto Rican. Why?    They   re more prideful of their culture, where they came from, or,    Yeah, I   m from Enid,    or,    I   m from wherever       There   s definitely more pride there, and I think, of course, times have changed, even just in the US in regards to how we as Latinos perceive ourselves. It   s funny because over time I know that, especially California, those areas, there was   the Chicano movement was a long time ago. There was pride there a long time ago, (Laughs) but the rest of the country didn   t get it because we didn   t have that many Hispanics to still feel prideful of the situation or of what was going on. I think now they see the importance of numbers, or how many people identify with them, or have the same issues, or come from the same background. It   s really funny to hear their stories of,    Do you remember when you had a parent-teacher conference meeting, and you had to translate for your mom?     All of them have those stories, so it   s really funny because many   not all of them, but the majority of them, and actually, we did   they have so many things in common, but they take pride in them, which is really cool. Recently, we did a game, actually in one of the HSA meetings, where you would ask a question, and they would move to one side if the answer was yes, and you would move to the other side if the answer was no. One of the questions was,    If you   re an only child, move to this side. If you   re not       so of course, the majority of the room was to like,    We have big families, or not big families, but we have   we don   t really know the concept of an only child within our culture.    Then another question was,    Are you a first-generation college student,    and a hundred percent, all of the students within that meeting were   oh, no, actually with the exception of one, sorry, so ninety-nice percent, were first-generation. Even then, their faces, I think before would have been like you slowly move, you   re looking away but you move to the answer that you are, but now everybody   s like,    Yeah  Yeah, we are, and it   s okay. We   re here to help each other.    The pride has definitely changed with time.  Baeza In the time that you   ve been working here and working with Hispanic students, what   s the most meaningful experience that you   ve had?  Morales I   ve had several, but I think they all tie into one thing. It   s the growth that I see in them, and that, it brings tears to my eyes every time. Seeing them from their first year here, it might not be their freshman year, it might be 21  that they transferred in, but to see   . I   ve had students that came into my office when they were juniors in high school considering   their parents brought them, or Gear-Up brought them because many of our students are from those type of programs, having no clue of what they wanted to do. There   s a specific student that I remember, like I   ve said, I   ve cried with quite a few students because it   s the growth that I see in them, but I remember so many things about this particular student. I met him   he doesn   t remember that I met him in his junior year of high school, but he came to a program that the engineering department had for high schools students.  I met him there, and I just remember him being funny and mischievous and whatever, and coming his freshman year and meeting him again, and we got acquainted and really close. I remember telling him,    Oh   of course, not his first day of school, but within a few weeks or within whatever, I said,    Just as much as you ask questions, you look like you like research. You should consider that, look into this program, the O-Camp program.    He said,    You   re insane  I don   t like research,    and I   m like,    Okay, sure, whatever.    It   s things that you have to continue with them, right, like,    Okay, you should try, you should try, you should try.    I remember also telling this particular student,    You love to explore  You should think about   have you ever left the country?    They   re like,    Well, just to Mexico, and I think just once or whatever,       So study abroad     and they   re like,    No, but how am I going to do that?     Well, this student just graduated, is going to grad school to do research, and studied abroad three times during his undergrad career. Those are the experiences that   it   s so awesome to me. It   s so heartwarming, and I remember   it   s so funny because you just made me think of this. I remember when I first started here (Laughs) there was no students in my office, and I remember complaining to you about that like,    Nobody comes to my office  There   s no students, they don   t love me, they don   t       Part of it is they didn   t know me yet, and so having to get this repertoire of like,    Come to my office, feel comfortable. Come in,    and from that to now. Sometimes, it   s so funny because I can   t get them out. They   re there, and they   re like,    So what are we doing,    and I   m like,    Leave  I need to do work.    (Laughs) It   s a very heartwarming experience, or just events that I go through, but it   s mostly because of their growth, seeing the growth that they go through.  Baeza Now just about you. What   s your happiest moment?  Morales In general? I don   t know if I could say I have one. In my life, or in school, OSU-related?  Baeza Up to you. 22  Morales I have so many. (Laughs) I don   t think I have one. Yeah, I think I have so many because there   s so many different things, and I love adventure so I love travelling. I recently got married, so that was another thing that (Laughs) I thought impossible. It was a very awesome experience for me, not only because I got married, but I was able to get married in India. My husband   s Indian, so I was able to go get married in India, so that was an amazing experience. I love adventure, so I went skydiving, and that   s so much   I don   t know, there   s so many things  Yeah, I don   t know.  Baeza You mentioned getting married, and being surprised by that, so where did you meet your husband?  Morales At OSU, (Laughs) and our cake had orange because of OSU. (Laughs) Yeah, so I met him here. I was working at the time already, so it was when I came back for work. He was a grad stu   a PhD student in mechanical and aerospace engineering. Actually, in graduate school, I had met an Italian friend, Carlo Branca is his name, and he   kind of like us, that you asked me like,    Did you find other Hispanics here?    Well, he   s Italian. He looked for other Italians, and there was nobody, poor guy at the time. This was a long time ago, now there   s more Italians, but so he didn   t have anybody, so he hung out with the Latinos because that was as close as he could get to his culture. I met him through that, and we became really close friends, and we would hang out and stuff. When I came back to work, we would have lunch together every day, and it was him, myself, and another friend, Carina.  We would have lunch every day, and then when Carlo   during that time that I came back, he actually finished his master   s and got a job, but he decided   he went for the job for a week, I think, (Laughs) and he came back, and he   s like,    This is not for me     When he came back, he came back for a PhD program, and it was with the same professor that my husband was working with already. Because of that, since we were meeting up for lunch, he started inviting my hus   well, at the time he wasn   t my husband, but (Laughs) he started inviting Ativan to lunch, and that   s how I met him. It wasn   t anything like,    Oh, it   s   .    I don   t know, it wasn   t anything like   I don   t know, but it was over time. We were friends for three years, and I would have never expected it like that, to be honest. Maybe meeting somebody at the university, yes, but not   I don   t know. Not the way that it happened, but I   m glad that it did, and it was really awesome, so he   s an awesome husband.  Baeza What are your dreams for the future?  Morales Oh, I have so many, and they change all the time too. (Laughs) I think many of us are scared of potentially changing career paths because we   ve studied, and we have so much pride in what we   ve studied, and whatever, and so 23  changing career paths is very scary, but I think I might do that. I don   t know to what yet, (Laughs) but a passion of mine has always been singing and dancing, things like that and so   . When I was growing up, the role models I guess that I had for that were in Mexico, so living in a country where there was hardly any last names that were like mine, or that had the ability to speak both languages. I didn   t see that as a possibility, so unfortunately, I never pursued it, and granted, that   s my mistake, but you the older I get, the more I realize that I shouldn   t be scared for that. I should try it, and if it doesn   t happen, then it doesn   t happen, but I should try something. Lately, I   ve been thinking about what I want to do, and especially because, like I said, I love my job, and I   ve been there for eight-and-a-half years, but I don   t want to see myself there past ten years.  A goal of mine was always a PhD as well, so I   ve been contemplating doing a PhD in business, but I   ve also been contemplating like,    Well, maybe I should go into singing and acting type of thing, actually get training for that, and see if that does anything for me,    and not for me. For me, I will enjoy it, I know for a fact, but if other people will actually cast me on stuff. Regardless, I don   t know necessarily what my dream is. I don   t have a concrete dream, I guess, but whatever it is, I know it will be with a career change, or a path career changer, whatever, but I   m excited. It   s interesting, a lot of people get, like I said, so scared about it. Don   t get me wrong, I am, but I am very excited too because you only live once. Then I actually just heard the commencement speaker the other day, and he was funny too because he actually didn   t finish his PhD either. I don   t remember his name, unfortunately, but he was doing a PhD in accounting, I think it was. He decided to not finish his degree.  Well, he didn   t decide like that, he wanted to pursue singing and writing songs, and he went to Nashville, and he made it. He did well for himself, and so that also made me think   I had already been contemplating it before, but I was like,    You   re throwing signs at me     (Laughs) That was really cool, and to see that there   s so many of us that go through those paths, but we think that we   re alone on it. We think that we are the only ones that are thinking like that, and so to   granted, I don   t know this gentleman, but he was at OSU. He went through the same situation, so that was really cool to see like,    I could probably do this too.    Who knows if I   ll be famous like he will, I don   t know, but at least I want to try, and that   s   when he left school, that   s what he said. He   s like,    I don   t know if I   ll make it, but at least I want to try,    and so that   s, I guess, my dream, to at least try. (Laughs)  Baeza Is there anything, thinking about the work you do here at OSU, working with Hispanic students, that you would say to current or future Hispanic students?  24  Morales Oh my goodness. Well, one of the   not one. Two things that I always tell students, and I think you   ve kind of gotten it too, from when I talked about my experiences or whatever. In regards to students particularly, some recommendations that I always have is while your experience at OSU, experience it to your fullest. Yes, you need to focus on your grades because if you don   t, then you can   t be here to experience the rest, but within that, do an internship. Some people are like,    Oh, that   s   I don   t need that,    or,    That   s just work,    or,    That   s nerdy.    Do it because you learn so much from yourself, in regards to because of that internship, and preferably a paid one, but if you can   t get a paid one, (Laughs) then it   s okay.  The other thing is study abroad, and the same thing applies there is you learn so much from yourself when you study abroad. Those two things   it   s you learn what you   re capable of. How far you   re willing to go, how much you   re   how hard you   re willing to work, how vulnerable you are. Putting yourself into situations where you don   t know your new co-workers, or you don   t know that different country, or maybe it doesn   t have to be a country. It could be just national study abroad, but you   re in a brand-new situation, so you learn so much from yourself, and it goes back to growth. Those experiences let you grow so much because you   okay, now you learn,    Let   s see, oh  I need to balance my budget because this is the only cash I have,    or,    I need to figure out how to manage my new environment.     Not only by the culture, but how do I navigate, do I use public transportation? Do I use   do I walk? That   s another thing that   s really fascinating, I remember   OSU is really small. It   s a really big university, but the Stillwater is very small, so I remember where I came from, you have to drive everywhere because it   s so wide. Here, I sometimes walk from my house to campus because I live pretty close by, or I walk to different places, or I   ll take a bike ride or whatever, and people are like,    Why are you riding a bike? Why   ?    It   s so foreign to them because we   re so used to places where you drive, but then again you miss the exploring part of you being in a small community.  I think in regards to the advice that I have for people is be open to explore different things, different opportunities, and it doesn   t have to be just with your culture. I love my culture, and you kind of need it to be yourself, and to feel yourself, but don   t be limited to that. Explore different cultures. Go to different events that are not just the Latin night. Go to, I don   t know, African night, and see how similar or different you are to those cultures. Because we do have similarities and differences with everybody, but looking and observing those things are what makes us, I think, appreciate who we are as a person. I think that would be my advice.  Baeza Is there anything that I haven   t asked you? Something you want to talk about, or something you want to say for the interview? 25  Morales Well, I thought you kind of hit at it a little bit when you were asking about, I guess, my   over time my process in regards to the growth I   ve seen in the culture. Another thing is that when I got here, I learned so much about our culture here at OSU, and how unfortunately, we weren   t able to be identified before. I find that fascinating. I think   I talked about it with Dr. Cida Chase, she   s a Span   well, an Emeritus Spanish professor or foreign language professor, and I think I spoke about it with you at one point in time as well. It could be good or bad that sometimes Hispanics can live a very inconspicuous life. It   s good or bad because sometimes you   re treated good for it, and sometimes you are treated bad, you don   t get to be yourself because of it.  Within OSU, it   s easy to identify,    Oh, the first African American to graduate,    or the first Native American because they have travel cards. In regards to finding our heritage within OSU, we don   t know, or at least I don   t think we   ve found out yet who the first Hispanic was. Not that it necessarily matters like,    Oh when   ,    but we do like role models. We do look up to people, we do look like,    Oh my goodness  They did this awesome work,    or whatever. It   s interesting, I think, throughout my time at OSU that I find that we can blend in really well, and that   s a good thing, but it   s also a bad thing because we lose ourselves. In regards to our culture, I think it   s very fascinating how OSU is now trying to, I think between all of us   and once again, I think it goes to the pride. I think in the US it   s easier to be prideful of being Hispanic and Latino.  We look for those things now within our OSU community, but it   s been hard for us to find those records, to find   . I was looking over, as an advisor to the Hispanic Student Association and advisor to the Latin American Student Association, it was amazing to see that they   ve been here longer than I   ve been born. LASA was established in 1976, I think, and HSA in 1978. Both of them are older than I am, that says a lot, and for   I know that there wasn   t that many students then, but for them to fight for it, that means a lot. To find those, and the only reason I know about that is because I found it in the constitution, and thank goodness it says the year  If not, I wouldn   t have known, but I remember talking to some students, and once again it goes back to the pride that we talk about,    That   s awesome      That   s awesome to see that there was other Hispanics here, and they were probably fighting more than we were for their education because there were probably a lot more barriers for them back then than there is for us. It is a privilege for us to be here, but it   s amazing that we look for those records or things to kind of be like,    Oh,    inspired by those that came before us, and it   s been harder to find here at OSU. I   m sure that we   ll get to them. I   m sure that we   ll find them, and we   re getting there, I think, and you guys are doing awesome job about it. That   s one of the things that I did want to add, 26  that OSU has an amazing, I   m sure, and it   s an amazing history and rich history of Hispanic and Latino students or professors that have made a difference here on campus, but it   s just now being found. I think it   s awesome.  Baeza Well, thank you very much  Morales You   re welcome.  -------  -------
