 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Also joining me is Jon Loffi, who may ask a few questions today, as  well. Today is Tuesday, November 11, and we   re in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma, interviewing Bob Lemon as part of the O-STATE Stories Oral  History Project. Thank you for joining me today, Bob.  Lemon Well, thank you, and Jon, and     Denise Unruh Denise.  Lemon    oh, gracious, what   s her first name? I know it.  Nykolaiszyn Denise.  Lemon What?  Nykolaiszyn Denise?  Lemon Denise, and her beautiful jacket on. Now, that is a touch of class right there.  Nykolaiszyn Absolutely. We have Denise with the OSU Foundation with us, as well, and  also we may hear your daughter chiming in a little bit as well, Robin   Sellers , today.  Lemon Well, I should tell you that Robin, she makes life for me possible, and that   s  the truth. She does. When you get to be an old devil, you just need a lot of  help sometimes. Robin, she at one point in her young life, she was a pilot.  She soloed and got a few hours in, and then for some unknown reason she  just decided to quit flying and stick to the ground or the oceans or  somewhere.  5  Nykolaiszyn Let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Could you tell me the  year you were born and where you were born?  Lemon I was born on the third day of January in 1929 in Shattuck, Oklahoma.  Shattuck, Oklahoma, is just about straight west of here, about probably two  hundred miles.  Nykolaiszyn Can you tell me a little bit about your parents?  Lemon My parents? Yes. My father was a native Oklahoman. His parents had a  small acreage up at Nash, Oklahoma. That   s in either Garfield or Grant  County. I can   t remember where it is from Oklahoma City, but from  Stillwater it   s thirty miles or so, I think, northwest. When he finished high  school, that would   ve been in 1921. He was born the year   03, 1903. At the  age of eighteen he finished high school. One of his high school classmates  and my father drove a herd of cattle from Nash. These two high school  students drove those cattle west to a small acreage a few miles northeast of  the town of Booker, Texas. Booker, Texas, was where I grew up and  finished high school and lived all my life, but the reason we landed in  Booker, Texas, was because they drove those cattle there to put them on a  place. Now, my mother was a young woman. She was the oldest of six  children, and her last name was Talafarrow. Just earlier, what was it, we had  the young woman named Talafarrow here.  Robin Sellers Yes, last week.  Lemon Just last week. Kim Talafarrow, with a large bank down in Tyler, Texas. She  and a couple other bankers had come up to talk to Robin and me. My mother  was born south of Booker, Texas, on a ranch. She was the oldest of six  children, and her mother died in the flu epidemic of 1918, I think. She found  herself as the   she was twelve. She was the oldest of six children, and she  never went to school another day in her life. She stayed at home and helped  her father. His name was D. D. Talafarrow. They tried to look after a small  group of cattle there on a small   they had about two sections of grassland, I  think. Although she never went to school, she became an amazing woman.  Both of my parents lived to be eighty-four years old. They lived all of their  lives there in Booker, Texas, and they lived there all of their life.  When I was five years old, somehow my mother developed the ability to  train high school speakers. These were people who would take part in your  literary contests once a year. They would do declamations and debates and  so forth. One year, when I was about five, I   d got to where I liked to just be  in the house when she   d have high school students, and she would help train  them so they could give a better debate or say a better declamation. One  year, one of the declamations that several of them worked on, I think, was  entitled,    A Plea for Prohibition.    I heard that so many times that I got to  6  where I could speak it. I might   ve been six years old because it was in the  spring and I wouldn   t have started school until September, anyway. I was  either five or six.  Mother thought I knew that piece well enough. When the high school  students put on a play there that spring, in between the first and second acts  while you had a few minutes there when they   d pull the curtain down and  they got ready for the next act, Mother told the superintendent that if they  wanted a fill-in there, I could get up and give    A Plea for Prohibition.    He  was delighted. Of course, this was a very small town. There was about three  hundred people lived there at the time. They all knew Mother, and they  knew my father real well. She got me up on the stage, and she got back to  the back of the auditorium. We had this system worked out where if I  needed to be speaking louder, she   d do like this. (Gestures) If I was  speaking too loud, she   d come down like this. (Gestures) Then she had a  few other signals. Now, am I taking too long?  Nykolaiszyn No, you   re fine.  Lemon I   m still okay? Okay. Well, I started through this, and, boy, I was rattling it  out there. This auditorium was packed. Everybody there, I doubt that many  of them knew me, but they all knew Mother. I got about halfway through  this declamation, and I forgot suddenly. I   d gone over this thing at home  probably a hundred times. I think it was the crowd and the atmosphere and  everything, but for some reason I just forgot. I couldn   t think of the next   .  Mother started, she came down about halfway and tried to cup her   do like  this and say the next line. She knew if she could get me started again, I   d  probably finish. Well, I couldn   t quite hear her, and I can remember I  walked to the front of the stage there. Mother, she kept trying to tell me  what it was. She came on down more, and she was almost down there. By  this time, the crowd was (what would you call it) kind of a little chuckle,  laughing at the distress we were in. All of a sudden, I just knew that our act  was failing, so all I could think of   I can remember this like it was  yesterday. I kind of kicked my foot out there, and I said,    Oh, you old  heifer.    Well, that broke the house down. I think I got a standing ovation  right there. They just died laughing. Of course, by that time, it was time for  the next act in the play, so Mother walked up on the stage and helped me get  off. We got out.  Nykolaiszyn You still remember it? Can you still say the    Plea for        Lemon No. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn    because that would be something.  Lemon I can   t, but I could at that time. Except on rare occasions, I forgot. (Laughs)  7  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about the house where you grew up in.  Lemon It was a very small home over on the east side of Booker, Texas. It was a  very small home and a one-bedroom. I forget where I slept. I had a younger  brother who was also, he was my best friend. He was four years younger. He  went to OSU, and he was just a great guy. He died in an airplane crash in  1986. His name was Glen, Glen Edward Lemon. I think, it seemed like to  me had something to do with the O   Colly  Daily O   Collegian . When he  was in college, he majored in journalism. He was a better OSU booster than  I ever was. He was just a great guy. Well, when he came along, we had to  add a bedroom for us. They built onto this house. It was still a small house,  but it now had two bedrooms. Glen and I, we were in one of them, and the  folks were in the other one. We still had one bathroom, and it still had an  old-fashioned electric heater in it. When you wanted hot water, you   d turn  the switch down here. It   d take it about forty minutes, and you   d have it hot  enough to get a hot shower or something.  Nykolaiszyn You grew up during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. Did you know  as a young man that these things were going on?  Lemon No, I did not, but in answer to your first question, I knew them both very  well. In    29, of course, I think it was in October of    29 when the stock  market crashed. My father had had a good job in the real small town of  Booker, Texas. Had two lumber yards. It wasn   t large enough to support  one, I don   t think, but then the Panhandle Lumber Company, Dad, he  managed the Panhandle Lumber Company. We were getting along pretty  well. Then October came, and the stock market crashed. First thing you  know, he didn   t have a job. That was kind of that way for a while. He did  anything you could do for a salary, for some money to live on. By the time  Glen came along in    33, the Dust Bowl was going full bore, you might say.  We had the double-whammy out there: We had the Depression and the Dust  Bowl.  I could take you to Booker, Texas, today and show you where I was  standing. On a Sunday afternoon, I think it was on Palm Sunday, about three  o   clock in the afternoon. I was out playing in the yard, and Glen was  outside. My mother looked out the backdoor and said,    Robert, where   s  Glen?    I looked around and couldn   t find him. I remember that as the most  terrifying thing in my life. I only looked for him probably just a minute or  two, but it seemed like an eternity when I found him in a little bit. He was  on his tricycle, and he was riding around. This would   ve been in about 1935,  I think, maybe    36. All of a sudden, he and I both became aware of this huge  cloud of dust that was slowly rolling in from the north. By the time we got  to the house and got both in   .  8  It was a warm day because I remember he had, I don   t remember what we  called them. It wasn   t coveralls, but it might   ve been called unionalls, had  legs down to about here, and he didn   t have a shirt on. He had a strap over  each shoulder, and it hooked right here. That was   getting inside. That was  Black Sunday. People who are familiar with the Dust Bowl, they   ll  remember Black Sunday. It was so bad, somehow there was so much  electricity in the air. We didn   t have lights in our house, and you couldn   t  see anything. I remember I put my hand right here in front of my face, and I  couldn   t see it, but when I hit my nose, I could feel it. That was Black  Sunday. One other part about Black Sunday, it got so bad there in those  years. We were just about forty miles southeast of Hooker, Oklahoma.  Booker, Texas / Hooker, Oklahoma, used to get the mail mixed up a lot in  there. Well, let   s see here.  Oh, I was going to tell you about the rabbits. It got so bad, there just wasn   t  anything for even wild animals to eat. We lived three miles south of the  Oklahoma Panhandle south boundary there in the northeast corner of the  Texas Panhandle. The rabbits came down, they would say, from the  mountains. They   d work on what little grass there might be. There wasn   t  enough grass for the cattle, but still those rabbits would nibble on grass  there. Finally, what people remained in that area at that time decided they  had to do something, so they started the rabbit drive. The first rabbit drive  they did, they rounded up several rabbits. The men all had guns, and they   d  kill them. Well, they didn   t kill any people, but they decided that was  dangerous. They wanted to have another one, so this one happened there in  the Oklahoma Panhandle, probably southwest of Beaver or southeast of,  well, southwest of Beaver. It   d be Beaver County, I   m pretty sure. That   s  one of those panhandle counties. You have Beaver, Texas, (that   s Guymon)  and then Cimarron County, I believe.  Nykolaiszyn Did you participate in any of the rabbit drives with the clubbing?  Lemon One. The rabbit drives, you just had enough men. Once in a while, a rabbit  would go through and get away, but generally speaking you round up  rabbits. There must have been, I don   t remember whether it was twenty  farmers and ranchers or a hundred. It seemed like to me they outnumbered  the rabbits. Anyhow, they were in a large circle here, and they   d keep  coming in. They all had some kind of a wooden club. They   d herd the  rabbits in, and they finally got enough, got them rounded up here that they  closed their ranks here and got a smaller   . The rabbits would just hover  there. They probably didn   t know what to do, either. They   d hit them in the  head, so you had some dead rabbits and a lot of wounded rabbits. The thing  that I remember most vividly is that those rabbits, when they   d hit them in  the head or hit them somewhere else and just beat them, why, they   d cry like  a baby. That sort of shook me up. I can remember telling my father that I  9  didn   t want to go on anymore rabbit drives. That was my last one. That was  one of the big, another casualty of the Dust Bowl.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk a little bit about your early schooling. Tell me about going to  school as a young man.  Lemon Well, I went to school. I started to school at Booker, Texas, and that   s where  I graduated.  Nykolaiszyn Were they big schools, small schools?  Lemon I might even call this a minute school. In my high school graduating class,  there were, I believe, twenty-one of us. Going to school there, my parents  always insisted that my brother and I bring home books every night and we  study every night. We made good grades, both of us. In fact, when I  graduated, I was valedictorian of my class. You know, that   s a big deal. I  didn   t have to write my own valedictory address. I was handed one. By that  time, I was a little better at remembering things, but I think I gave that  without looking at it. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn How would you get to school as a young man, as a little boy?  Lemon I walked.  Nykolaiszyn You walked. How far did you walk?  Lemon Well, it would   ve been about   I   d say it was, from over in the east part of  Booker, it was most of a mile, I imagine. Glen and I, we always walked  together. In my first grade, (I forget) it was smaller, probably ten students.  By this time, you must remember, with the Dust Bowl   I started school in  1936. I would   ve been seven. For the first four years, I walked by myself.  I   d come home for lunch every day, and we nearly always had pinto beans.  You could buy a hundred-pound bag of pinto beans for three dollars. That  was what we   d eat most of the time. Let   s see. I don   t know how I got to  telling you about that, but     Nykolaiszyn That   s okay. I was going to ask you about that.  Lemon At Booker, we didn   t have a gymnasium while I was in school. We did have  a concrete tennis court, one concrete tennis court, and two tennis courts just  on ground. Of course, when it rained you didn   t play tennis over there. You  could still maybe play on the concrete one. It seldom rained. (Laughs) That  was another big deal. Anyway, sports, I played football. We played six-man  football. In Lipscomb County, there were five schools in Lipscomb County.  They were all about the same size: small, little, wide places in the road  nearly. We played football, and we played basketball. We had a basketball  10  goal set up on each end of this tennis court, this concrete tennis court. We   d  play basketball sometimes. On windy days, you learned if you took a long  shot, you had to allow for the wind.  Nykolaiszyn Were there any subjects you felt drawn to during schooling?  Lemon Well, yes, storytelling. My mother always   we did storytelling. In the  county meet each year, I   d usually represent Booker for my class, and I   d  tell a story. I never won it. I did that for about three or four years in grade  school, and I never could win it. I might win Second or Third, no First.  Nykolaiszyn You did pretty well in school to become valedictorian.  Lemon Well, yes, I did. I did. I had good grades all the way.  Nykolaiszyn Did you work during the same time as going to school?  Lemon Oh, yes, I worked on Friday evenings and all day Saturday. I worked for a  family that was very close friends. They ran a grocery store, Leeman   s  Store, down on Main Street in Booker, Texas. I was working there when we  didn   t even have paved roads in Booker, Texas. Few of them, we had some  gravel scattered. You could get around, but a lot of times you just couldn   t  get around. Anyway, now, let   s see. You had asked me     Nykolaiszyn Jobs. You   re telling me about working in the grocery store.  Lemon Yes, I made fifty cents. I worked Friday evening after school and all day  Saturday. I   d get home about eight or nine o   clock Saturday evening.  Nykolaiszyn What would you do in the grocery store?  Lemon Oh, my goodness. First thing, I got there on Friday, I got the sacks of  potatoes ready. I   d fill those brown sacks of potatoes, and they   d hold about  fifteen pounds. Also on Saturday, the farmers would come in. We never  handled cream or milk, but we handled eggs. I got to where I could just  about pick up four eggs. Well, not quite. I   d break one once in a while, but  I   d put those eggs in. You had a box here. It was about this long, I think, and  it had a middle in it. Then on each side, it had little (I forget what we call  them) things you put in there. You could put six eggs here and six eggs that  way, and that   s three dozen eggs. Then we   d put something on top of it to  protect it, and we   d put thirty-six more eggs. You   d do that, seems like,  about six times. Then you   d have a box full of eggs.  We always had to have those boxes ready and completed because the truck  would come by and pick them up Saturday evening. They   d take them in  and get them cold somewhere and sell them back to us for a lot more than  11  we   . These people, I don   t ever remember paying out money for their eggs,  but we   d always give them credit on their bill that day. I also got to where I  could help the customers that came in the store back behind   well, they had  a desk here for customers to stand while you, right behind where there   s this  stack of canned goods. They   d tell you they wanted a can of beans or peas.  You reach over there and get a Number 2 can or a Number 2   can. Two-and-  a-half was about twice as large as a Number 2 can. Of course, it sold for  more money.  Nykolaiszyn You studied a lot, and you worked when you were in high school. Did you do  anything for fun?  Lemon Oh, yes. Every day was fun. (Laughter)  Sellers Horses, you rode your horses.  Lemon Oh, yes. Glen and I, by the time we were   and this would   ve been in the  very late    30s. We always had horses because Father always ran cattle. He  learned that we could go to a sale in Beaver, Oklahoma, twenty-eight miles  straight north of Booker, Texas, and you could by small calves that had just  been weaned, that had been taken off their mamas, and you could buy them  very cheap. We   d just buy so many. First, when I was going up there with  him, we   d take a horse trailer. You could put about six of those calves in it.  Sometimes we   d make two or three trips. In later years, we   d have a larger  truck, some neighbor who made a living out of hauling livestock on  situations like that. That was one thing we did. Now, that was fun. I can  remember when I first started going to Beaver with my father, he   d give me,  I think it was either fifteen cents or a quarter, and that would buy a  hamburger. For me to go with him to the sale at Beaver, Oklahoma, and buy  a hamburger and have lunch, now, that was a big deal.  Nykolaiszyn Did Booker have a movie house, a theater?  Lemon Not in the years that I was there. To go to a movie, we went to Perryton   Texas . It was the only one. Perryton is where my wife and I and all of our  children lived for a half-century while I practiced law, but we   ll come to that  later, I guess. Now, what did you ask me there?  Nykolaiszyn I asked you about the theater growing up, in Perryton.  Lemon Yes, many a time when I was in high school, that would be the recreation  for the week. Mary Lou and I would drive. At that time, she lived southeast  of Booker about eight miles. I   d go on Sunday   well, we went to the same  church. When I was growing up, we went to the First Christian Church in  Booker, and her parents, they had just moved to that area. Her father worked  for the Phillips Pipeline Company. He had a good job, and they lived in a  12  camp there. Phillips had these camps about every, oh, forty or fifty miles.  The people who worked at that station, I believe they called it, they could  live for nothing in these small houses. That   s where Mary Lou, and her  parents, and her   she had an older brother. That   s where they lived. They   d  come in for church on Sunday, and she and I would go on over to Perryton  and go to the movie. That was sort of the standard social activities for the  week.  Nykolaiszyn We   ll talk more about her in a little bit, but I want to know how you decided  to go to Oklahoma A M.  Lemon That was its name when I went there, and I   ll tell you why that was. The  only place that we ever visited out of Perryton was Enid, Oklahoma. That  was because my father having grown up at Nash, Oklahoma, up there  northwest of Enid a little ways, he knew some friends: the Cummings family  and the Humphrey family. The Cummings family, they had three sons. They  were all older than me. The Humphreys, they had two sons, one older and  one my age. Jim was older, and Bill was the young Humphrey, Bill  Humphrey. All of those five fellows, I   d see them from time to time, and  they became very close friends. I just loved to make that trip to Enid  occasionally. We   d always stay three, well, not always, but usually we   d  stay three nights. My mother used to say,    You never want to wear out your  welcome, boys.    We   d stay one night with the Humphreys, one night with  the Cummings, and one night with   oh, my Uncle Bob.  My father had an uncle named Robert A. Lemon who was a fairly well-to-do  businessman. He lived there in Enid at 1917 West Broadway. That house is  still there. All the time I was growing up, that   s where Uncle Bob lived. By  that time, he had bought   in fact, he owned this track of land where Dad  and his friend had driven the cattle. He owned a little other land. In fact, he  owned a few sections in Lipscomb and Ochiltree Counties. We would stay  with Uncle Bob, and he had a parrot in his house there. They always would  say that this parrot would say,    Polly wants a cracker.    I think that was the  line. Sometimes it would kind of talk to you. I never did get it quite that  clear. We   d stay a night there. If we had to stay over for some reason, we  might stay two nights with Uncle Bob.  Nykolaiszyn You visited Enid. Did you come to Stillwater at all?  Lemon My first trip to Stillwater, Oklahoma, was the day that my parents drove  me   well, these five young men that I was telling you about, the Cummings  and the Humphreys, they all stayed at an address of 913 College Avenue.  Right there, if you   re familiar with the campus, there   s a pond there. What   s  the name of that pond?  Sellers Now it   s University Street, I think. Theta Pond.  13  Lemon Theta Pond, yeah. Then today that is University Avenue, I think. It goes  right in front of this house. This was a fraternity house. I didn   t know a thing  about fraternities, but my folks let me out there one Sunday afternoon about  three o   clock. I walked up the sidewalk, and knocked on the door, and  waited there a little bit. Nobody came to the door. I reached over there, and I  remember it had kind of a tough, (what do you call that?) a latch, I guess, on  this door. You just pushed it open. I had my suitcase, and I walked in. I  didn   t see a soul. This would   ve been in    47, right after the war, and the  veterans are coming back. I think there had been some veterans or maybe  some female veterans had lived there in that house throughout most of war.  This was our fraternity, the Sigma Nu fraternity, and they were just getting  started up after World War II. I got there on a Sunday afternoon.  I remember I walked in, and I looked around and didn   t hear a soul. I said,     Anybody home?    Well, not a voice. I didn   t know what to do. There was  steps here, so I walked up. Walked on the second floor, and had more steps.  Walked up to the third floor. I looked over all the places there. There on the  second floor, I saw a room that looked like it was a nice place, so I walked  in just like I owned the place and hung up my clothes. I didn   t have many  clothes. I think I had one suit and some kind of workaday britches, very  plain clothes. Hung it up there in the closet, and I just moved in. Later that  day, some of these members of the fraternity were coming back in. They all  knew each other. Of course, after two or three of them got there, I got to  where I tried to meet them and say hello, shake hands or something. I  noticed they were all doing some work. We did some real basic work there,  and I chipped in and helped them just like I owned the place or was at home  with them. We did that about three days.  By the time the third day got through there, this house was full of people  starting to school. These were all what they call members of this fraternity,  the Sigma Nu fraternity. Now, the Cummings boys, they were older. Some  of them had been in the Army, I remember, and none of them showed up  there on the day school was about to start. One of the Humphreys, I believe  he may have showed up there or maybe he got there the second or third day.  Then he had a younger brother, Bill, who was just a little younger than I. He  got there   well, I didn   t get acquainted with him until after school had  started in maybe my sophomore year. Anyway, we got the house cleaned up.  Then they said,    Well, now our rushees will start coming Monday.    No, this  would   ve been about Friday or Saturday.    They   ll come here in a day or  two.     The house was in pretty good shape. At least the floors were swept. The  windows, we   d wash windows. Swept floors, and mowed the lawn, and did  everything you do when you   re trying to take over a big house here that   s  been used for several years and then it   s been idle for nearly a year.  14  Everybody comes back and does all those things. I didn   t know a thing  about Rush, but I had moved in. When the rushees, (I guess these were these  freshmen) what happens, these members get in touch with freshmen who  start to school usually in September, and they invite them to what they call  Rush Week. I believe that   s what we called it. We   d have about ten or  twenty guests there for each of the next two or three days, and we   d get  acquainted with them. I didn   t understand what we were doing, really, the  word fraternity and sorority. Later, I   d learned quite a little bit about that,  but I didn   t understand any of it that day.  Nykolaiszyn Why did you decide to come to Stillwater to begin with?  Lemon Because we knew these Cummings and Humphrey boys, and talked to my  folks and told them that they ought to bring me to Oklahoma A M.  Nykolaiszyn How did your parents feel about this?  Lemon Mother always wanted Glen and me to go to college and pass, make our  grades. I was the first one in her family who had ever gone to college. None  of her siblings went to college. She didn   t know what college was, hardly.  That was the only college students   . Now, a few years later, I might   ve  gone to TCU  Texas Christian University  because we were affiliated with  TCU through the Christian Church in Booker, Texas. I might   ve gone to  Texas Tech, or I might   ve gone to a school  Oklahoma Panhandle State  University  up in Goodwell, Oklahoma. That was a college. To answer your  question, that was really the only college I knew anything about, I felt.  These five guys that I got acquainted with (three Cummings, two  Humphreys) they were big gung-ho   they had all gone to OSU, so I decided  that was the best college in the continent.  Nykolaiszyn And you lived in the Sigma Nu house to start.  Lemon I did, and I think it   s probably   they used to kid a lot about this. I am the  only member of the Sigma Nu Chapter Epsilon, Epsilon Sigma Nu   I had a  number just like everybody else, but I was the only guy who never went  through Rush Week. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Because you moved in  (Laughter)  Lemon I just moved in and took over and acted like I felt right at home.  Nykolaiszyn I think that   s wonderful.  Lemon Well, there were some of those older Sigma Nu guys, they didn   t think it  was so wonderful, but the majority was with me.  15  Nykolaiszyn Your stuff was already hanging up in the closet.  Lemon That   s right. I missed all the blackball procedure, or I   d have probably never  made it. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk a little bit about your major and your classes. What did you study?  Lemon When I started to college, at that time my father and the grandfather of one  of my law partners today, they operated what was known as the Frass  Ranch. That was a ranch that was there in Lipscomb County. It had about,  oh, it must   ve had ten thousand acres in it. It was the largest ranch   well,  no. That isn   t right, either. It was a large ranch, and it was all grassland  except for about two hundred acres. We   d sow a little, trying to raise a little  row crop or something. We   d put it in bundles, and stack it, and feed it to  cattle during the wintertime. When I was doing that, Glen and I, we spent a  lot of time riding our horses on the Frass Ranch and helping work the cattle  once a year, once or twice a year, and manage a ranch. This is another  reason that I was interested about Oklahoma A M was because I thought I  would probably farm or ranch when I got out of school. Four years is a long  time. I continued to   every time I was home, why, we   d be on our horses  doing something over at the Frass Ranch.  Nykolaiszyn Did you take a lot of classes in agriculture?  Lemon I took at least one or two at first. It seemed like the first year, it was pretty  much we took English, and a math course, and a history course, and  something else. Then maybe the second year or the second semester the first  year, I took a course in agriculture and made two or three trips a week to the  agricultural barns there west of Stillwater. Oh, then I took some, some of my  first classes   I think there   s still a building there. Morrill Hall?  Nykolaiszyn Yes.  Lemon Well, that was a nice building when I had my first classes in it. I had several  classes in Morrill Hall. This would   ve been in    47,    48. At some point, I  want to tell you a little bit about Mary Lou. She was a pilot.  Nykolaiszyn Yes, we will definitely get to her.  Lemon They   ve got an airplane named after her.  Sellers That   s so great. It   s really   that is great.  Lemon We were saying we might put that airplane on a float. We could do that  easy, and make that part of Perryton   s parade. We   ll enter that as a float, and  the law firm might even do that, you know.  16  Unruh That   s great.  Lemon That   d be a winner.  Unruh That would be a winner.  Lemon Let   s see. What else     Nykolaiszyn You were telling me about taking some classes in Morrill Hall. Now, what  did you end up majoring in?  Lemon I believe that I had what you call a general business major.  Nykolaiszyn Okay.  Lemon I had a few courses that were really more in the School of Agriculture, some  of which I mentioned to you and some of which I   ve forgotten, but my  major was general business. Later, of course, I went to law school, but I  hadn   t even thought about that until my father told me one time   I had  pretty well given up being a rancher or a farmer. I thought I   d be a banker.  One day he told me,    Robert, I think you   d be a better banker if you had a  law degree. Why don   t you go to law school?    I drove down to Norman,  Oklahoma, and I met the dean, who was a man named Page Keeton. Dean  Keeton gave me a very nice reception. He had looked at my grades, and he  said,    Yes, we   d be delighted to have you here.    That was a nice interview.  Got ready to go, and I remember I said,    Well, Dean Keeton, I   ll see you  here in September,    or August, whatever. He said,    Well, now, if you   re  going to see me, you   re going to have to travel a long way because  September 1, I take over as dean of the law school at the University of  Texas.    He didn   t really encourage me to go to Texas instead of OU. I forget  what all he said, but it kind of made me think that maybe I should go to law  school at Austin, Texas, rather than in Norman, Oklahoma. I decided I   d talk  to my wife. I was married by now. I got married during my senior year at  OSU. Got married on the twentieth day of December in 1950. That marriage  lasted fifty-two years and two days, until Mary Lou died on the twenty-second  day of December in 2002. Now, let   s see. What was I     Nykolaiszyn You were telling me about consulting with your wife about going to law  school in Texas.  Lemon Oh, yes. She hadn   t really thought too much about that, either. We just  decided one day,    Well, I   ll still be a banker, but let   s do that.    My parents  by this time   I   ll tell you, during the Depression and the Dust Bowl years,  we were a poor family. I mean dirt poor, literally. By this time, my father  17  had a job at a bank, and he was getting along very well. He encouraged us.  He said,    I think we can figure out a way to keep you in school somehow,     and he encouraged us to do that. Mary Lou and I thought that   d be kind of  unusual. Neither one of us, I don   t think, had ever been to Austin, Texas. By  this time we had a car, so we drove down to Austin. We stayed, eventually,  (this was after we had been admitted to the law school down there) we  stayed at a half of a duplex.  The address was 4716 Harmon Avenue, I think. That was our home, and  that   s where Robin   s two older brothers were born, there in that house. We  leased from a lady named Mrs. Stanhold. She talked to us and finally told us  what the rent would be, which we decided we could afford after we had  talked to my parents. She was a very gracious lady, an older lady. I guess  she had a few other properties there, rental properties. We learned that by  the time Mary Lou was pregnant the second time that if we had more than  one child, the rent would go up a little bit. By that time, she thought so much  of Mary Lou that she did not charge us anymore rent. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn I   m going to pull you back to OSU for a second, and then we   ll get back to  your law career. While you were at OSU and enjoying life in the Sigma Nu  house, I   m sure there were some other things you were doing in your spare  time. I want to talk a little bit about the Flying Aggies, but before we get  there, I want you to tell me about your interest in flying and how that  developed.  Lemon When I was about   well, there in Booker we had some very close friends  who grew up on ranches and farms south of Booker. The Mitchells, Harry  Mitchell, his family owned a beautiful home right there. We   d walk by it  every day going to and from school. He became a good friend. One time,  asked me if I would be interested in going with him. He had been in the Air  Force. He wanted to start giving flight lessons to people in Booker, Texas.  He said that he was going to buy a brand new Piper Cub. I think they call  that a J-3 maybe, Piper Cub. This would   ve been in about 1945.  Sellers You were about twelve or thirteen?  Lemon Let   s see   twelve in    29 would be    41. Fourteen would   ve been    43. I was  about fifteen or maybe sixteen because this would   ve been after he got out  of the service at the end of the war. Anyway, he said,    I   m going to go to        someplace where they make Piper Cubs. That was either in Pennsylvania or  in Connecticut, and it seems like to me it was in Connecticut. He said,    I   m  going to go up there. If you   re interested, you could go with me, and you  could help me fly this Piper Cub back to Texas.    I talked to my father and  my brother, and they said,    Yes, that   s okay,    much to my surprise, I might  say. (Laughs) Anyhow, this was kind of a new experience for me. Mr.  18  Mitchell and I, I forget where we got on the train, either Shattuck,  Oklahoma, or up in maybe Kansas someplace.  It took us three days to get to the city where Piper Cubs were manufactured.  Incidentally, coming back, we had a headwind. It took us longer to fly home  in that Piper Cub than it did to ride the train up. Took us three and a half  days to come back, and three days going up. Well, we got up and went to the  airport there where they had this beautiful Piper Cub. We got in it, and got it  started, and started home. It was the summertime; it was in August. It was  hot everywhere, and you seemed like you had a headwind every minute of  every day. One day as we were starting home, we were on the way home,  we were paralleling some highway there, and I think we were getting close  to the place where they run the auto races, the 500? Is that in Indiana? Is it  Terre Haute?  Loffi Indianapolis.  Lemon Anyhow, we started home, and just before we got there, though, we had  landed. It was lunchtime. Mr. Mitchell asked me,    Well, what do you want  to eat?    I decided I wanted to eat some ice cream. He asked me,    How many  dips you want here?    I remember I said,    Mr. Mitchell, I   m so hungry, I  could eat a quart of that ice cream.    I sat down and very hurriedly ate that  ice cream. Here pretty quick, we got in our airplane and took off. One  stretch there, we were parallel to a highway, and there was a convoy of  Army trucks on this highway. Mr. Mitchell had, of course, just got out of the  service, and he was very interested in it. We got to doing these S turns, back  and forth like this, very low, but it was rough. I mean that Piper Cub, we   d  bounce up and down five hundred feet, I think.  Sellers You   re in the front seat?  Lemon I   m in the front seat, sadly. (Laughter) He   s in the backseat. The Piper Cub,  that model Piper Cub, you got up on the wing to get in. You didn   t have  doors like this. They opened up like this, and you   d hook it up here  underneath the wing and fly with the top half of the door down. Bottom half,  it stayed here. You   re sitting here, and that bottom door would hit you right  across here, and top door would be up here like this. Well, we got home, and  he got to doing these S turns so he could study what kind of trucks those  were and what they were hauling and so forth, back and forth, and up and  down.  Temperature, about 130, I think, hot. Pretty soon I began to get a little  woozy at the stomach, and we kept making those S turns. Seemed like it was  up and down, and up and down. Finally, I just vomited all that ice cream. I  kind of felt better. I haven   t been sick in a long time, but I know when  you   re sick at your stomach you have some tension down here. Then after I  19  got through vomiting, I turned around to look at Mr. Mitchell, and he was  white. (Laughter) He was white. He was taking off his glasses, and the only  clean place on his face was right around his eyes. Well, that was good  because he needed to see. He was flying that thing. Without describing any  more of those details   . Say, by the way, I think I   ll make a pit stop.  (Laughter)     This airplane   s ready to fly again.  Nykolaiszyn Bob, I   d like you to tell me a little bit about how the Flying Aggies got  started.  Lemon Well, okay. Now, in telling you this, I   ll have to have to have another  embarrassing airplane story. How did the Flying   . By the time I got to  OSU, I was still very interested in flying. I can   t remember for certain where  I was when I soloed. I think I had soloed at the Perryton, Texas, airport, but  it may have been in the Stillwater airport. It was just about the time I soloed,  and I was in school at OSU. I just loved to fly, and thank heavens I did  because later on it meant so much to me. I never flew for recreational  purposes but strictly for business purposes. Anyway, I was interested in  flying, and I would go out to the Stillwater airport. I got acquainted with a  flight instructor there, and I think his name was Hoyt Walkup. Do you  happen to know, is that the correct pronunciation on his name?  Loffi Yeah, it was Hoyt Walkup.  Lemon Walkup?  Loffi Walkup. W-A-L-K-U-P, Walkup.  Lemon Last letter is P?  Loffi Yes.  Lemon Okay, well, that   s right. He was not only a great flight instructor, but for me,  he was a great friend. I loved to be with him, and I   d take flight lessons from  him. Even after I had soloed, I think I took a few flight lessons from him,  just to try to learn from him. He was a good instructor. I can   t remember  exactly how the Flying Aggies started, but I kind of think it was just starting  the year I was a sophomore at OSU. That would   ve been in September of     48. There were several of us who flew a little bit out there. There weren   t  very many, but Hoyt Walkup was our flight instructor for all of us. I don   t  remember the college having another flight instructor at that time. It had  some airplanes.  After we could fly solo, if we wanted to log some time, it was relatively  inexpensive to do so. We thought we ought to have a group name, and we  started the Flying Aggies. It was just natural because the name of the college  20  at that time was Oklahoma either A M or Agricultural and Mechanical  College. We developed the name the Flying Aggies, and we kind of made an  organization out of it. I can   t even remember how many   I don   t think we  had over a dozen members in 1948, although it may have been more than  that. One day, I had been flying around, and I came in. It was one of those  hot days in the fall.  Sellers First, didn   t you decide to have a safety chair?  Lemon Well, yes, we did. I think maybe I was supposed to help write up some rules,  safety rules, for our group that we were just starting up. That   s right. I was  acting as a chairman of that group and keeping notes of what we talked  about, rules we ought to have, trying to think of anything we could to make  flying safer. I came in one day, taxied up to the gas pump there on the     what do we call that? Is that the tarmac or     Loffi Yes.  Lemon Stopped, and there wasn   t a soul in sight. I was alone, but I decided I   d go  ahead. We always tried to fill up our airplanes before we put them away to  keep   if you didn   t do that, you had more air in there, and then the air  condensed, and you got a little bit of water. It was bad flying practice.  That   s something, as long as I flew, I   d always fill up just as soon as I  finished a trip. I got out, and there wasn   t anybody around to help me.  Sellers Broke a rule.  Lemon Well, yes. The first thing, we were always supposed to have some chucks     what do we call those?  Loffi Chucks.  Lemon Chucks. Then, of course, you always had somebody to help you in the  airplane.  Sellers Another rule.  Lemon Yes, I was alone. (Laughter) Then you   let   s see. What did we do next?  This was an airplane. This was one of the old Taildraggers. It was a Cessna,  I   m pretty sure, probably a two-place Cessna. I   m not sure about that. It  didn   t have a starter. Later on, airplanes had starters, but not this one. I got  the gas tank filled up, and I   m ready to start.  Sellers To pull the prop.  21  Lemon That was the next thing I had to do. I did try to set my brakes, but these  brakes must   ve been pretty well shot. Then I got around, and I     Sellers It   s a hot day.  Lemon Yeah, it   s a hot day. The engine was still hot. I was thinking that I   d pull it  through two or three times, and usually you had to do that to start an  airplane.  Sellers And have plenty of time to get back to the     Lemon Yes, and so I got around in front, and I just barely moved that propeller  about this far, and, boy, it took off. Oh, another thing, I don   t remember we  even had a rule on this, but I thought I had set my brakes, and I thought I  had set my throttle to where it would keep it going while I ran from around  in front of the airplane, got in, and taxied back to the hangar. Well, that old  airplane, I just barely moved that prop, and, boy, it took off. I had set the  throttle a little stout. Later, they were discussing this. They said I must   ve  had it set up around 2,100, which is pretty good, pretty fast. That airplane  started moving. It didn   t have a pilot, and     Sellers No brakes, no chucks.  Lemon That   s right.  Sellers Lots of fuel     Lemon A tank full of fuel. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn What happened to the plane?  Lemon Well, that   s the interesting part here. Those Cessnas have those   what do  you call those? Struts or     Loffi Yeah, wing struts.  Lemon Wing struts. I couldn   t get in to grab the throttle, and all I could do was grab  the tail as it went by. Here I am. I   ve got my arm around the tail of this     how do you describe that area right in front of the tail, that horizontal tail  and the end of the fuselage?  Loffi Just the tail section? The empennage?  Lemon Well, that was back there, and I was trying to keep my legs in front of me so  I could stop it. Well, it wasn   t that easy. I soon learned that I needed to keep  it going in a circle, or it was going to pull me out in the pasture.  22  Sellers It was going to hit the gas tank. You also thought it might hit the gas pump.  Lemon Oh  That was what   the first circle, I made damn sure I missed that gas  pump. Then my circles were getting larger all the time     Sellers And faster.  Lemon    and faster, yes. Then the next one, I came around, and I missed the gas  pumps again. Now I   m looking for some open country here because I   m  about ready to let that baby go. (Laughter) Just as I was getting around and  missing that gas pump the third time, there was an airport manager who was  in his office or in a point there in the office where he could see what was  going on. He could tell that I was in distress. His name, I think, was Rucker,  Mr. Rucker. He wasn   t a flyer, but he could tell when a flyer was needing  some assistance that he could give. He ran out, and just as I   m coming  around the third time, he risked his life a little bit to get around and come in  behind that flight strut, open the door, and reach for the throttle. Thank God  he found it. He didn   t know that much about airplanes. He knew where the  throttle was. He was also helping me slow down. I don   t know how fast I  was going, but I   m pretty sure I was breaking some speed limit. (Laughter)  He never said a word. He just said,    Bob, here   s your plane.    He walked  back to the office, and I taxied to the hangar and put it up and hoped nobody  saw it besides him. Got in my car, and went back to the Sigma Nu house and  took a nap, I think.  Nykolaiszyn How did becoming the safety chair go for you?  Lemon I got a lot of   you know, guy   s like that. They like to make fun of one  another.  Nykolaiszyn Sure.  Lemon A few times at meetings, even after I had been elected to an office in the  Flying Aggies, they might introduce me as our safety chairman.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk about how the group was structured and the offices that were  established.  Lemon Well, I know we had a president, and a vice president, and a secretary, and a  treasurer. I   m sure we had a safety chairman.  Nykolaiszyn Okay. I heard you were elected the first president. Is that correct?  Lemon That   s right.  23  Nykolaiszyn How did that come about?  Lemon I can   t remember whether it came about before or after my airport incident.  It probably came about before. (Laughter) I think, honestly, I think it did  come about before. I was elected     Sellers He was a one-termer.  Lemon    president. Yes, I just got one term. (Laughter) Of course, there wasn   t any  salaries, nobody drew any salaries. That wasn   t even the purpose of it.  Nykolaiszyn What was your role as president? What would you do?  Lemon As president?  Nykolaiszyn Sure.  Lemon I   d simply decide when our next meeting was going to happen. I can   t  remember. It seemed to me like we simply called, and we may have had  some of us take turns doing the calling and get word to our members. We  always tried to recruit new members, especially where we had someone who  came to the airport for any reason. I remember later, I had two sons in  school over there at the same time. By that time, I was flying in a lot of  times, and they would be out there to meet me or leave a car out there or  something. For an organization like that, we did a lot of the work that  organizations have to do to exist.  Nykolaiszyn Would you have dues, member dues?  Lemon I   m sure we did, yes, but I   m sure they were very small.  Loffi Bob, can I ask, what was the purpose of the club? Why was the club formed?  Lemon Well, we were all students at Oklahoma State, and we had an interest in  flying, and we had an interest in flying safely. We always stressed safety,  yes.  Sellers I guess it   s a good thing  It was needed. (Laughs)  Lemon Later, we were just beginning to get in   do they still, Jon, do they still drop  items?  Nykolaiszyn Tell us a little bit about that. Tell us about that process.  Lemon Well, you know, that was just starting about the time I was leaving OSU.  24  Loffi You were president in your junior or senior year?  Lemon Probably would   ve been, well, either one. No, no, it   d been sophomore or  junior. Might   ve been the end of my sophomore year or the beginning of my  junior year.  Nykolaiszyn The dropping of the stuff out of the airplane, can you tell me   walk me  through that. I know nothing. Pretend I don   t know anything about it.  Lemon I don   t even remember what was in those sacks, but when I was involved  with it, we would open an airplane door while you were flying. You always  had to have two people in the airplane to do that. That was one rule, and I   m  sure we followed it. I guess we did, unless we were in a hurry. You had a  sack of something that was fairly heavy, and you just dropped it like you  would a bomb. You had to be so many feet high. Had some, they wouldn   t  let you get too low. You dropped it, and they had markers there on the  runway, so you could tell pretty quick   . Oh, and you always tried to hit the  line. I forget what we call that, but you   d miss it ten feet, or ten yards, or  half a mile, or whatever. Every time you made a drop, this was something  that, it might   ve just been a sack of some dirt in it. You could get rid of it  after each drop, keep your runway clean.  Loffi Was this just a competition that you did as club members, just something fun  to do, the bomb drop?  Lemon Yes, we   d have contests. You had so many drops. Seems to me like maybe  we each did three drops, and it also seems like we charged a few dollars to  enter this contest. Then you would keep track each time, how many feet. It  seems like if you hit on the downwind side of this line, you were  disqualified. I wonder if they still do that.  Loffi No, it   s just closest to the target now, regardless.  Lemon Okay, well I think at one time, we required that if you didn   t get   we called  that the end of the runway, and if you didn   t get to the end of the runway,  you   re disqualified. In fact, I   m pretty sure that was the way we did that  because we wanted fellows to get, we want them to stay close to the line, but  we damn sure didn   t want them to drive out here in the pastures or some  place.  Loffi That was just all Aggies or whoever wanted to come out and fly and do that?  There wasn   t other schools here, then?  Lemon It   d just be the Flying Aggie members     Loffi Yes, right, okay.  25  Lemon    who had to go for contests, that   s right. We kind of advertised it a little  bit     Loffi Sure.  Lemon    about these drops because you always have some students who have some  interest in flying and airplanes. I think we probably drummed up quite a  little interest among students. Sometimes we had those drops, we   d have  several, maybe, I don   t know, maybe a hundred students out there just  watching.  Loffi How long were you president? When did you quit being active?  Lemon Just a year.  Loffi One year?  Lemon One year.  Loffi Okay. Did you stay active with the Flying Aggies after that?  Lemon I did as long   well, I did it as long as I was in school. I think   let   s see. I  probably was inactive when I was down in law school at Austin, Texas. In     54, I got back, and I   m pretty sure I started being a member of Flying  Aggies and maybe attending a few of their meetings because it was no trick  at all to fly from where I lived. Mary Lou and I used to drive it a lot. It was a  five-hour drive, but you could fly it in an hour, hour and ten minutes maybe.  Loffi Do you remember some of the other officers that were in the club with you,  or were there other Flying Aggies who you can think of that were successful  and did things out there in the real world? Do you recall any of those  people?  Lemon God, I used to. I used to could name off fifty or a bunch of them because I  knew all of them.  Loffi Yeah.  Lemon You know, I   m eighty-five years old. I   ve had a little health problem a time  or two, and it just destroyed some of my memory. Let me think for just a  minute. Surely   . Hoyt Walkup, I remember him. Now, does he still live?  Loffi No, Hoyt passed away several years ago.  Lemon Well, he was a class act.  26  Loffi Yeah.  Lemon He used to make some trips to Guymon, Oklahoma, and if he had room,  he   d call me a time or two. Asked if I wanted to fly with him, and a few  times I did.  Loffi If we go back just a little bit, Hoyt was the inspiration for you starting the  Flying Aggies?  Lemon Oh, I think so. I think so. I would definitely say that. Yeah, that   s true. You  know, he might   ve   we surely had a faculty advisor. People hold the same  role you do. I   m sure he was our faculty advisor. The only two people I  knew was   I got better acquainted with Mr. Rucker later on (Laughs) after  he caught my runaway airplane that day, but he was really the only two  adults that I knew very much about. If my brother were living today, Glen  could probably tell you his name. I don   t think Glen was a Flying Aggie. I  just, I can   t remember. He flew, and he had flown to, he made a jillion trips  to Stillwater. He had flown to Stillwater the day before he made a trip, flew,  to Colorado. On the way home that night, he landed at Liberal, Kansas, and  let out a passenger, and then took off and lost an engine on a Cessna 310,  and crashed and burned, and killed him, November 5, 1986. He was the first  out-of-state president of the alumni, I believe, OSU Alumni. What do we  have? Alumni     Nykolaiszyn Alumni Association.  Loffi Yeah.  Lemon Association? I think he was the first out-of-state president of that.  Loffi How many Aggies, did you say, were in the club during your time there,  total number?  Lemon Well, I   m going to guess that we might   ve got up to forty or fifty. I   m sure it  wasn   t more than that, and it might not have been that high yet. How many  do you have now?  Loffi We have about ninety, about ninety right now, today, in the club.  Lemon How many of them are active in your flight program where you engage in     Loffi All of them.  Lemon All of them?  27  Loffi Oh, yeah. Yeah, we   ve got about three hundred-and-some total students in  the flight program, and about ninety of those are Aggies, Flying Aggies.  Lemon I think that flight club performs a vital, vital role in student flying, and I  would imagine that there   s going to be a few of those ninety members who  would tell you that the Flying Aggies had some part in them taking up  flying. Do a lot of our graduates, do they get into commercial flying?  Loffi Yeah, that   s the only reason they   re there in the academic program of flying  is to become a pro pilot. Most of them, that   s their goal orientation is to  become a commercial pilot in some regard, either for the airlines or in  corporate.  Lemon Glen and I were both pilots, and then of course my wife became a pilot after  the FAA yanked my flying license. Glen, he flew. He was president of the  Texas Bankers Association, and that   s the largest bankers association group  in the United States, except the American Bankers.  Loffi Were you aware of any other student organizations prior to joining the  Flying Aggies? Were there any other flying organizations in the university  that you were aware of?  Lemon No. Do you have any others now?  Loffi No.  Lemon There sure wasn   t back before I got there.  Loffi Can you just tell me a little bit about, as you look back on your years with  the Flying Aggies, did being involved and serving as president, how did that  impact your life after college, being a member of a group like that?  Lemon Well, it really got me totally interested in flying, and that was so important  to my business. I   m a lawyer, and after I finished at the University of Texas,  I turned down some good jobs. I could   ve gone with firms in Houston and in  Dallas that still exist and     Sellers New York.  Lemon    New York, yes. I had a good opportunity with a big law firm in New  York. One of the factors that Mary Lou and I decided on in going to  Perryton was   there were several reasons why we were there, but one of  them was that we could tell then that we were going to be traveling a lot to  places like Oklahoma City and of course Stillwater to see some athletic  events and maybe take some clients with us, which we nearly always did.  We did a lot of other flying. Glen and I were in banking, and we wanted to  28  make loans in other states, other areas besides Perryton and Booker. It made  it possible for us to do that. We could fly to   we organized a group that our  bank could make loans outside the state of Texas. We wanted somehow to  make loans for businesses in Oklahoma, Kansas, and at that time, New  Mexico, Colorado. We still have interest together in Colorado. You just  can   t do all that and drive a car, but you can if you fly.  We always had one or two airplanes that we could   . Gosh, I don   t have any  idea how many trips we made to Wichita, Kansas. If you drove up there and  transacted your business and drive home, you   re up from early in the  morning until late at night. A lot of times we had enough business in lending  money to cattle in feedlots. That was the beginning of the feedlot era out  there. We had enough of that loan paper to take to the Federal Land Bank in  Wichita. They   d meet us at the airport, and we   d bring back the money, you  might say. We could close deals and get those notes sold to the Federal Land  Bank. It made it possible for customers to come in the bank in Booker, little  bank. It grew to over a hundred million dollars on deposits, and it had a trust  department that did that much or more. The subsidiary that did the cattle  lending all up north in the feedlots, that had business in Wichita every day,  and it justified the expense of flying.  Loffi Certainly. If you had one piece of advice to give to the Flying Aggie students  today, what would you say to them?  Lemon I   d tell them to always address safety regulations carefully, and study them  and practice them. Really try to do everything, as we used to say, according  to Hoyle. I don   t know who Hoyle was, (Laughter) but we sure watched  that. Among our friends and family, the only loss we   ve ever had was my  brother. I   ve flown across the Rocky Mountains several times a month for  twenty-one years. I fly to Deming, New Mexico, where I made a mistake. I  went out there with a client one time. He got ready to buy some land, and he  said,    Bob, this deal   s too big for me, but it   s a good deal. You want half of  it?    I said yes instead of no. No would   ve been the better answer, but the  first thing you know I had to buy him out. I later took bankruptcy over that  deal. All the way I flew until   Robin when was it that I flew to Colorado  Springs with all you children and my mother?  Sellers In the summer of 1964.  Lemon Was that that early?  Sellers In June of    64, yeah.  Lemon Well, I got up there, and I   ve been a diabetic forever. Once in a while,  diabetics don   t manage your system right. When you don   t manage it, it  manages you. About an hour after I got up there that day, boy, I fainted.  29  Sellers You flew us up there. You had been the pilot. You flew us up there and got  out of the plane and fainted.  Lemon Did that happen there at the airport?  Sellers Not at the airport. In the car, leaving the airport as we approached the     Lemon Well, it was a bad deal. Anyway, my mother, she     Sellers It was a low blood sugar insulin reaction.  Lemon    notified the FAA because she knew that getting out of that airplane and  all that, that was not a good thing. There about a week later, I got a nice  letter from the FAA. They told me that a review of my record (however,  they didn   t tell me what it was, but I knew) that    you are no longer  authorized to fly as a private pilot, and you can contest this action by filing  an appeal with the FAA,    but I never filed it. I quit flying. Then my wife,  this lady for whom this airplane is named after   and, say, I don   t want to  forget that. I   m very interested in having that airplane show up in Texas by  next year. I might even ride in with it. How many passenger   is it just a  two-seater?  Loffi It   s a Cessna 150, two-place, not all that dissimilar from the one you did the  loop de loops with on the ground.  Sellers You could ride on the tail.  Unruh Grabbing onto the tail. (Laughs)  Loffi You   re going to see it. Soon as I get the sticker on the plane, you   re going to  see it because we   re going to bring it down here to show it to you.  Nykolaiszyn Well, Bob, throughout our interview today you   ve been telling us a little bit  about your wife, but I want you to tell me more about your wife. Tell me     we know you met her when you were younger, so just share a little bit more  about her with us.  Lemon Mary Lou Smith. Her parents and her older brother moved to a Phillips  camp. Her father had worked for the Phillips Pipeline Company a long time,  and he had a pretty good job. He moved to a Phillips camp about halfway  between Booker and Darrouzett, Texas. She happened to decide to start to  high school in Booker, Texas. They had moved down there. Mary Lou grew  up and started to first grade at a little school called Sharp, Kansas. She and I  was there one time in the little one-room schoolhouse. Still exists. Then her  30  parents had somehow moved, and she went to high school, at least her  freshman year, in Burlington, Kansas.  She was a beautiful young woman, and she had a boyfriend there. Not too  long after she had moved to the Booker area, he   d even come down to visit  her and see her. I got to meet him. I was introduced to him, and he was a  nice fellow. That was the last time he came back. By this time, she and I  were sophomores. We dated rarely; and as juniors, frequently; and as  seniors, constantly. The first time I ever met her was on a class picnic on a  September day. There was an area there southeast of Perryton and almost  around about southwest of Booker, about twenty-five miles called Lake  Fryer. Our class had a picnic down there at the beginning of school and  there that   s where I was introduced to Mary Lou. I never will forget. We had  a mutual friend named Wilda Ray Marshall, and she was also be a  sophomore in the Booker High School that fall.  She introduced us. I remember Mary Lou coming over and putting out her  hand and said,    My name is Mary Lou Smith.    I was kind of embarrassed at  the time. I couldn   t think what would be appropriate, and all I could say  was,    My   name   is   Robert   Dell   Lemon.    (Laughs) We used to laugh  a lot about that. She was a good student and at first just a good friend. We  start dating a lot, and we had an excellent relationship. In fact, she had to  drop out of college. She started to college at Oklahoma Panhandle State  University at Goodwell. She was a very popular young woman on the  campus and took part in a lot of activities, one of which was singing. She  was always a great pianist, and she was a great singing. There she enrolled  in a musical class, and they learned   what   s that Christmas song that she  learned?  Sellers The cantata, you mean? Messiah?  Lemon The Messiah, yeah. She knew every word of that, backwards and forwards.  A little later, that song would be sung in Perryton each year at Christmas  night. I think that   s still a tradition, but it grew a lot during the years that she  was involved because it got so big that they   first, they used to hold it in the  Methodist Church. Then for a decade or maybe two decades, they moved it  to the high school auditorium. They   d just about fill it every year. She was  one of the head honchos of that to help raise the money. It got so big that,  rather than try to use local musicians, they   d hire several from Amarillo  who   d drive up there on that Sunday evening and rehearse and then sing the  Messiah. That was a big part of our lives for a long time. She went to  college at Panhandle, and at the time, she told me she wanted to drop out of  school because she thought her grades would improve. I never thought  anything about that.  31  She went to work in a newspaper office in Booker, and she worked there a  little bit. Then she got a good job working as a secretary or something for  Booker Equity. That was one of these outfits that build these concrete  elevators, round, concrete, elevators. They were a big firm that paid some  nice salaries. She had a good job, went to work there and worked there a  short time. They gave her a nice raise, and she could practically run that  place. She worked there, and then she got to where she was just constantly  on the road, driving out to her home at the Phillips plant there east of Booker  about eight miles. My grandfather had died while Mary Lou and I were in  Austin, so she stayed with my grandmother. I never did know exactly what  the economics of that transaction were. In fact, I didn   t know she was going  to do that until she was moved in, but my father had set that up. I   ve always  assumed she probably didn   t pay anything because we were so thrilled to  have her there to check on Grandmother every morning and evening. That  worked out that way as long as Mary Lou was single.  Sellers You eventually found out why she didn   t go back to school, really.  Lemon Oh, yes. She didn   t go back to school at Panhandle because her parents  couldn   t afford to send her. She never admitted that or never said that.  Nykolaiszyn You all married while you were still in college. How did that come about?  Lemon Well, we   let   s see. I was a senior, and she had been out of school a couple  of years. Every time the Sigma Nus had any kind of a social event, (they   d  have at least two big ones a year) I   d drive out and pick her up, and bring  her back, and get her a room there at the Student Union. That went on  awhile. I was twenty-one, and she was twenty-one.  Sellers Didn   t you fly her to Dalhart and get her some new boots?  Lemon Oh, yes, yes, yes. While we were seniors, we lived there in the cattle  country, and we decided we needed a pair of twin boots. We knew we   d  have to have them made, and the only bootmaker that I knew anything about  was at Dalhart, Texas. That was about 150 miles straight west of Perryton.  We flew out there and took our measurements. Fellow said,    Come back in  about six weeks, and I   ll have your boots made for you.    We flew home,  and I called him and asked him about the boots. He said,    Yes, sir, you can  pick them up anytime,    and we set a date. We flew out to Dalhart and  bought our boots. I said,    Well, how much we owe you?    I was afraid it was  going to be quite a little because handmade boots in that economy in that  day, those were pretty expensive. These were good-looking. What were they  made out of?  Sellers I don   t know.  32  Lemon Alligator hide?  Sellers I don   t know. Maybe, yes, I think they were.  Lemon They were kind of expensive boots. We flew out to get them and asked him  how much. He said,    Well, Bob, I   m just going to give you those.    He said,     I never had a couple fly in from anywhere and order and then pick up their  boots. I   ll just give these   .    Of course, I think he kind of liked Mary Lou  by that time, too. She was easy to get along with. (Laughter) That   s one trip  we took.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your children.  Lemon Well, Mary Lou and I had, while we were in law school, we had two  children: Del and Jim. Del lives in Austin, Texas, today, and he keeps telling  us that he   his wife is also an OSU graduate. Del is an OSU graduate. They  used to talk about moving back to Stillwater sometime, but I don   t think  that   ll ever happen. Jim is my second son, and he   s an OSU graduate. They  both lived at 913 University Avenue. He now works for   what   s the name  of that corporation?  Sellers United Technologies.  Lemon Yeah, it   s a large corporation. He   s been working with them, gosh     Sellers About thirty years.  Lemon    long time. He gets back, both of those guys. Del will be up here this  coming weekend for the Texas game. He and I are both solid OSU fans even  though I went to school at Texas and he lives there with those Longhorns.  (Laughter) Let   s see     Sellers You have two more.  Lemon Oh, and then I have two more children, one of whom is here, (Laughter) so I  have to be real careful with what I say. Robin has a twin brother named  Chrys, and Chrys didn   t go to OSU because he had an appointment to the  Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, which he accepted. He graduated  there four years later with honors, and then he went into the Air Force and  served in the Air Force. How many years?  Sellers Well, he became a pilot and an instructor. He instructed. He was an  instructor.  Lemon That   s right. After he finished the Air Force Academy, he became a flight  instructor, and he was stationed at Vance Air Base in Enid, Oklahoma. At  33  that time, Robin was in college at Phillips University in Enid, Oklahoma.  That later became Phillips Theological Seminary. Chrys, he taught flight  instructing for how many years?  Sellers Hmm, five or six.  Lemon Five or six years.  Sellers Then became an attorney.  Lemon Oh, yes, and he decided at that time that he didn   t want to spend, as he put  it, the rest of his life looking at horizons. He withdrew from the Air Force  and enrolled in law school at American University in Washington, DC.  Today he is a practicing lawyer in Washington, DC.  Sellers Then you adopted an adult child. You adopted an adult child,  Eli  Moque.  Lemon Oh, by God, yes. He   s the one that we   re so concerned about. He   s going to  be about fifty. He   s a Muscogee Creek Indian. He lived in California for a  number of years, and he  knew  a man named Robert Mayo.  Sellers  Moque  was a friend of Robert   s.  Lemon Yeah, he was a friend of Robert Mayo, and Robert Mayo was a gay man. He  grew up   now, this all happened back in the 1950s when a lot of people  looked differently at gay people. Today, we call that the LGBT  Lesbian,  Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender  community. Robert Bale was a gay man,  and there was so much   his family owned a large ranch in Beaver County,  Texas. Was his name Mayo? I believe it was. Robert Mayo was a   was he a  scientist or   . He was some professional man. He might   ve been a teacher.  The hatred against homosexuals back in 1950 was so strong in Beaver  County, that although he had built a nice home on this ranch that lies there  on the Beaver River about twelve or fifteen miles east of Beaver, and his  mother also   . Well, anyhow, he had to leave that area.  Sellers He moved to California, and he met Moque. They all had a lot of friends and  fun together. The AIDS epidemic hit, and Robert died. Moque came out to  your law firm where Robert   s estate was being probated, and Moque became  acquainted with Mother and you at your law firm. Eventually, he was  adopted into our family, symbolically.  Lemon Right.  Sellers Now lives in Tulsa, where he   s quite ill, but just this month was inducted  into the Creek Hall of Fame.  34  Lemon The Muscogee Creek Hall of Fame. Very big honor for a fellow like him.  We were there for that event, and that was a big deal.  Nykolaiszyn Something we haven   t talked a whole lot about today has been your work  with diversity and equality and social justice. Do you want to say a little bit  about that?  Lemon Yes, Mary Lou and I became involved with the gay community, God, so  many years ago. I can   t remember exactly.  Sellers Probably in the   70s.  Lemon Oh, honey, before that. Oh, I   ll tell you when it was. The Stonewall event in  New York City was in about    69. You   re right. It was about    69. We had  actually been, to some extent, involved before that time, before that event.  That really got us interested in it, and we started supporting events in  Oklahoma like the Gay Pride Parade here in Oklahoma City each year. We  support that in several different ways, and still do and always will. Mary  Lou was a champion for the gay community. You ought to be taping her. It   s  a shame she   s not alive so she could tell you firsthand of things that she did.  There was a fellow in Perryton, Texas, named Donny Anderson. Was that  his name? That was it, wasn   t it? Mary Lou was a humanitarian. Donny  Anderson just had one friend in Perryton, Texas, and it was Mary Lou  Lemon. She saw to it that he had something to eat, and she saw to it that he  had clothes he could wear.  She was his only   well, she and I, she was much more active than I was. In  fact, one time I came home from work at the office there in Perryton at  about five thirty one evening, and when I got there, she was giving Donny  Anderson a bath in our bathtub. Later, we were talking about that, and she  said,    Bob, I   ll bet he hadn   t had a bath in a year, and he needed one.    So  she just gave him one. (Laughs) There was another time that we were on a  trip to Amarillo. I always had a bad habit of saying something about what is  our situation, what do we favor. I always liked to use that word,    we.    We  were on our way to Amarillo one morning, and we crossed   there   s a place  right there east of Pampa, Texas, on Highway 40, I believe. You cross the  railroad track, and you kind of pull up here, and you can make a taxi stop  and then pull up on the highway.  Off to the right, down low, right after you cross the railroad before you cross  the highway, there was this fellow sitting in a wheelchair. He   d lost his legs  below the knee, sitting there in a wheelchair. I saw him, but I just kind of  made my usual taxi stop, pulled up on the highway, and I was turning east to  head to Amarillo. Mary Lou says,    Well, what are we going to do?    I didn   t  answer. I just did a 180 and went back. We turned around and pulled up by  this gentleman and got off. We asked him where he was going. Well, he was  35  going to Hereford, Texas. That   s a city about forty, fifty miles southwest of  Amarillo. We had told him we were going to Amarillo, and he said,    Well,  yes, I could ride with you. If I could get to Amarillo, I   ll have a ride on into  Hereford.    They were supposed to come in later today sometime and pick  him up.  We did that, and that worked out very well. We finally got his wheelchair  loaded in the trunk of the car and got him loaded in the backseat. We got  him to his motel, and I loaded him in his wheelchair. We put him there in  the office and where he wanted to go. When Mary Lou told him, said,     Now, we   ll check here before we go home this evening. We hadn   t planned  to leave until about five, and we   ll check and see if your ride came.    Well,  we did. We checked it, and his ride had come. As far as we know, he made  it on to Hereford, Texas. That is just what kind of a person she was. Of  course, I   m proud of that, and all of my children are proud of it. People who  need help and people in the gay community, they have needed help for  decades, even today. Just this week here in Oklahoma City, we   ve traveled  lots around. The federal courts handed down a ruling either this day, today,  or recently that made it possible for same-sex people to be married. They do  that now in Oklahoma, but it took a federal lawsuit to make that possible.  After my deal that I kind of got off on a while ago, after the FAA dismissed  me as a private pilot, Mary Lou started taking flight lessons. She became a  private pilot. She was an unusual person.  Sellers She didn   t tell you that she was taking lessons.  Lemon Oh, no, no, she didn   t do that. She was a private person. (Laughter) She was  living up to her reputation. One day, she informed me that we were back in  the airplane business.  Nykolaiszyn Were you shocked?  Lemon I was, yes, totally surprised. We did that, then, for another many years.  Sellers Should you tell them about her one most fun flight?  Lemon She had a good friend named Roselle Wilson who was related to the lady,  Wilda Ray Marshall Wilson, who had introduced us down at Lake Fryer.  Her name was Roselle. Mary Lou and Roselle were very good friends. We  had a book club, and Roselle was one of the members in it. She was a good  friend. One day, one morning, Mary Lou called her and said,    Rosie, what  are you doing tomorrow?    Roselle said,    Well, nothing. I   m just here on the  farm.    Mary Lou told her,    Well, why don   t you come in, and we   ll make a  trip together tomorrow.    Roselle was also   was she a pilot, or just had  flown a lot?  36  Sellers She was a pilot, and she rode motorcycles.  Lemon She said,    Sure, I   ll see you at nine o   clock.    They drove to the airport, and  got in the airplane, and took off, and had flown a few minutes there,  probably fifty or seventy-five miles northwest of Perryton. Roselle said,    By  the way, where are we going?    I don   t think Mary Lou ever told her. We  always filed a flight plan, and Mary Lou, I think, had filed her flight plan for  this trip she was going to take Roselle on. Anyhow, make that story a little  shorter, they flew to Colorado Springs which was quite a trip, even in an  airplane. I didn   t know about that until Mary Lou had died, and in her  obituary one of our sons, I think Del, had put that in there. He had written it  up. He said,    So Mary Lou and Roselle flew to Peterson Field in Colorado  Springs, caught a cab, drove in to the Golden Bee.    This was this night club  that we always patronized every time we   re up there     Sellers It   s at the Broadmoor.  Loffi Yeah.  Lemon    and says,    They took a cab to the Golden Bee, and drank a yard of ale,  and flew back to Texas.    (Laughter) When I read that, I was, first of all,  amazed that it had happened, and second, I made Del change that    yard of  ale    to    glass of ale.    (Laughter) Something about a yard of ale, that   s the  way you order it. If you go into some Irish pub today, at least at the Golden  Bee, you could get this deal about so long. It was enough ale in it for two  people, I   m sure.  Sellers Better if you   re not going to go fly an airplane. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Well, you   ve been very supportive of Oklahoma State through many different  avenues through the years, and I   d like you to share and talk about some of  these efforts from some of the professorships you   ve established. We know  you   re very supportive of the Flying Aggies, also some scholarships. Can  you just share a little bit about what you   ve been doing at OSU?  Lemon Well, I   ve said a lot of times I wish I were a wealthy man. I have made a  few gifts, but my gifts do not have near as many zeros in them as T. Boone  Pickens    gifts. His gifts to OSU have lots of zeros out here.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk a little bit about the importance of giving back.  Lemon Of what?  Nykolaiszyn The importance of giving back. Why do you feel compelled to give back to  OSU?  37  Lemon Four of the best years of my life were spent at OSU as a college student. I  joined a lot of   it was probably a fault, but we used to have an organization  called Hell Hounds. That was a Greek   . We supported athletics, kind of a  pep club here for athletics. I joined the organizations like that, but later on I  finally got out and started practicing law and had some good fortune. Some  of it was in Oklahoma; most of it was in Texas. Made some money, and  Mary Lou and I could make some gifts. I don   t have any idea how many  times we would drive the five hours from Perryton, Texas, to Stillwater and  see a football, or a basketball, or a baseball, or a wrestling match, and then  five hours back. We did that a lot of times.  I felt that people who are lucky enough to go to college and as lucky as I  was, and to be able to do the things that I was able to do, and that Glen, my  brother, later joined me and was later to do   . I got acquainted with the  people in the Arts and Science Department, particularly. I just decided, as I  could, I   d try to make some gifts that would help other people go to college.  I established one (I forget what exactly the name of it) in honor of Mary  Lou, and then for my brother, Glen. I set up something that would be  receptive of gifts that I make through the Oklahoma State University  Foundation and would help others in the form of scholarships and also  sometimes, as scholarships do, enable the university to really get some top-notch  instructors.  Nykolaiszyn You know, often when we talk with alumni we notice this loyalty. What is it  about OSU that   s special to you?  Lemon Oh, my gracious, I could talk all day about that. Are any of you familiar  with Henry Bennett     Nykolaiszyn Yes.  Lemon    who was president of OSU at least for a few years there in the   40s? He  died in an airplane crash on his way to Ethiopia? Is that it?  Nykolaiszyn Iran. He was leaving Iran, I believe, as part of the Point Four Program.  Lemon Point Four, that   s it. He was active in the Point Four Program that had been  started under, I think, maybe Truman     Nykolaiszyn Truman.  Lemon    President Truman. Wasn   t that really for the purpose of going to this far-off  country to try to help teach people how to raise at least enough food for  themselves? Was that what Point Four was about? I think that was what  Henry Bennett   s job was   he was going over there sort of as an ambassador  for the Point Four Program, to get it up and going, and to helping the people  38  of Ethiopia grow food, at least for themselves. That impressed me. Here was  a man who, God, he didn   t have to do that. All he had to do was run a state  university there in Stillwater, Oklahoma, just live a comfortable life, but he  wasn   t content. I think that   s   I never have said very much about it, but that  had a lot of influence on me. I respected Dr. Bennett as a college  administrator just like I respect Burns Hargis today. Henry Bennett, he was a  man I never met. Never got to know him, but now I wish I had.  Nykolaiszyn Great impact.  Lemon Yeah.  Nykolaiszyn Well, you know, we   ve only scratched the surface, Mr. Lemon, with you  today. I hope you understand this after almost three hours, but is there  anything else you   d like to share with us before we close out? I know we   ve  barely touched upon your career in law, and we   ve only touched upon your  family and your impact on the university, but is there anything else you   d  like to share before we close out today?  Lemon Well, I   ll be honest with you. I wish I could somehow become a wealthy  man because I know young people are influenced by high school, but I think  young minds are really influenced by colleges. I think that today you look at  Oklahoma State and you look at Burns Hargis and what he   s advocating  for   frequently, I   ll read something that Oklahoma State, they   re doing, and  the research, some type of research, just to make people   s lives better.  They   re doing that, and they   re training young men and women to not only  want to come out and take care of themselves but to try to do something for  other people. They were doing that in the days of Henry Bennett, and I think  they   ve been at it ever since, from the stories I read occasionally about what  the university   . When I   m talking with my family about the    little school  over at Stillwater,    or something about our    little school over at Stillwater,     that little school was founded in 1890. It   s done a lot of good for a lot of  people, and it   s still at it. I don   t care whether they   re teaching them to fly so  that some of them will wind up as pilots of commercial airliners and really  make huge contributions in that way, but in so many other ways.  Nykolaiszyn We definitely appreciate your passion for the university and all you do. I  think we could all echo that here. Thank you very much for your time this  afternoon. We really appreciate it.  -------  -------
