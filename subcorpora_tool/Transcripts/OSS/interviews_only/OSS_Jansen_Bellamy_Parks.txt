 Paustenbaugh, and it is Friday, February 20, 2009. I   m  here in the Angie Debo Room of the OSU Library, and I   m with Bellamy  Parks Jansen who is a botanical illustrator and artist. She is a guest on  our campus today, and we   re going to talk a little bit more about her  and about her work. Can you tell me a little bit about your background,  like where you were born, where you grew up, and where you went to  school?  Sure. Born in Fort Collins, 1961, March 20. And background   well, my  father was still in veterinary school at Fort Collins, so the year I was  born he was graduating. They basically picked me up, newborn baby,  and moved to Ogallala, and he went into partnership with another  veterinarian there, and he began establishing himself so that he could get  a private practice, which he did, and so I grew up in Ogallala.  And that   s Nebraska?  Right.  Western Nebraska?  Western Nebraska, yes. Really close to Colorado, too. Actually, it   s  within thirty miles. It   s right in the cut of the panhandle.  Okay.  You just drive right into there; there   s Ogallala. It   s on the south side of  the Sandhills, I guess would be the way to describe them. He had most  of his practice there, so growing up I was exposed to cattle, horses, pigs  constantly. He would put me in the seat of his truck, and I would ride  5  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  with him out to ranches and farms and watch him treat animals, because  he didn   t want to do small-animal veterinary work. He wanted to do  large, so that   s what I was exposed to, and it was a bizarre way to grow  up, because even though I was living in town I had at least 50 percent of  my life exposure out in the country. So, I didn   t fit in with the    townies,     as the country kids called them, and I didn   t fit in with the    country  kids,    as the townies called them. It was just an interesting sort of a  cross section of being in both worlds. In a way I liked it, because it  allowed me to see two different ways of living a life.  Well, I guess my next question is at what age did you discover that you  had artistic talent?  Oh, immediately. I mean, one of my first memories   you want a child to  become expressive, and you hand them crayons or markers and paper  and whatever. I did the same thing with my kids. I distinctly remember  being very, very young and Mom giving me a box of crayons and paper,  and me coloring and getting lost, literally getting lost in the idea that you  could create. And from that moment, I wanted to be an artist, and it  never changed. You know how kids go through periods where they   re  exploring? I never changed, ever. I always knew that I was supposed to  be an artist, which is kind of odd. My father actually tried to dissuade  me (Laughs) for years.    Oh, you can   t be an artist because they only  make money when they   re dead. Everybody makes money off of them,  and you don   t really actually make anything.    I just would not be  dissuaded, because I knew that I had ability and I knew that I needed to  do it, so I did pursue it. He tried really hard. I mean, he drove me into  the Sandhills and introduced me to trees and plants and grass and just  anything to get me outside of that little focused point, and it did. It  expanded it, but it never took away the desire to continue with art, even  through high school.  So, gradually, I did develop a passion for science, but it wasn   t the initial  passion. Years of him constantly trying to wear me down to get me to  focus on something else until the passion for science became as high as  the passion for art, and then it created dichotomy because as soon as I  got to school ... I had a really wonderful high school art teacher. He  could see that I had ability, so he focused in on me, and I always  thought,    Well, that   s kind of not fair to the other students.    But it  wasn   t like I didn   t appreciate it because he saw talent, so he would give  me extra projects when the other kids were doing what was required, and  he would make time for me after school to teach me special things which  was marvelous. He helped me actually put together a slide portfolio to  submit to colleges, and because of what he did for me, I ended up with a  full-tuition scholarship. I wouldn   t have known how to do that because  my father   s at home going,    Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not art.    (Laughs)  6  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  So, there wouldn   t have been support there for that endeavor. So, here   s  my art teacher going,    Oh, we   ve got to get her focused. She   s got  ability.     We send off the slide presentation to Chadron, and they said,    Oh, yes,  let   s get this person here.    So, I started at Chadron with this major in art  and a full-tuition scholarship, but it was not quite the right fit for me. I  started taking biology classes, and I met the botany professor, Dr. Ron  Weedon, and he was funny. I mean, he spoke in ways that I had seen  some of the hired hands speak in, you know, a little bit blue (Laughs) in  the classroom, and in a curious sort of way it charmed me. He got me  hooked into botany, plus he was a very dynamic teacher. He was good. I  was engaged immediately, and as a result I started really enjoying  botany, and I thought,    Oh, this is more fun. Intellectually it   s more  stimulating    than what I was getting from the course work in art. So, I  decided,    I   ll switch to a biology major,    and of course as soon as I  switched to a biology major I   m not creating art anymore, so the creative  side of me is kind of going. So, this basic, almost 50/50 dichotomy   the  only way I resolved it was after the second year of school. I   d completed  four semesters, just back and forth and back and forth, just couldn   t get  this dichotomy resolved. Ron had been watching me. He struggled with  this, because he knew I wanted to do the artwork, and he was trying to  keep me in the science building, and so he finally said,    Why don   t you  just be an illustrator?    And he started showing me books of pictures, and  I was like      So, that idea hadn   t really occurred to you?  Well, no, because when you look at the curriculum, you didn   t have any  crossover between life sciences and art. I mean there   s just no crossover  at all. Even the humanities are different. It   s like, if you do this, you end  up having almost two completely separate bodies of work because cross-qualifying     plus, if you spend any time with artists as a group, they   re  pretty    let   s go with the flow.    They are not rigid thinkers. They don   t  think scientifically. They don   t   some of them do. I mean, I   m speaking  in very general terms. And then the science people, it   s,    What can you  prove? What can you hypothesize? What can you theorize? What can  you demonstrate?    and,    Let   s explore down to the nth degree whatever  it is we   re looking at.    In this case, for me, it would have been cellular  botany, looking at plant tissues on a cellular level. That appealed to my  nature in terms of my meticulousness, wanting to get in and really look  at things and understand not only how it works, but you don   t get that in  art.  In art, I craved instruction, and I don   t know if it was just some sort of  fad in the art world at the time that I took it, but they would basically  7  say,    Okay, here   s a list of requirements. Here   s the media we want you  to use. Here   s the paper we want you to use. Now go do it.    And it really  wasn   t   I wanted to learn how to use the medium. You know, if I   m  taking oils, I want them to show me,    Okay, this is the level that you  mix the oil with, with this much solvent to get this kind of surface, or  this kind of technique.    There was no instruction. It was mostly just,     Here   s the supplies. Here   s the list of requirements. Here   s the models.     Sometimes they wanted you to use still lifes, and they would set up a  still life in the room.  I guess the theory was, and I came to disagree with it as an artist, that  you   ll develop your own style. But if you don   t know how to use the  medium that you   re working in, if you don   t know what it can do, its  limitations and its flexibilities, you   re going to be fighting with the  medium the whole time. You   re not going to be able to create what you  visualize, because you   re not being taught how to do that with the paint.  So, it was my frustration with the art community that it was so hands-off.  I always thought,    Well, gee, they   re getting paid for doing basically  nothing.    And it was very frustrating, because as someone who really  gets into structure and technique as far as how to approach something so  that you can do as well at it or be as accomplished with it as you can,  that was aggravating to the last to me to pay that kind of money and get  no instruction. I think there are some artists in academia that still  approach it that way, but I actually disagree. I think the beginning  students should be given instruction in how to use the medium and then  told,    These are the requirements. We want you to use it this way. Now  go create something,    to both master the technique of the medium itself  and to master your own style. I don   t think that they should be mutually  exclusive. So, that   s basically why I kept switching back and forth.  But Ron Weedon actually created a course for me when he realized that  I wanted to do botanical illustration or at least I was interested enough to  pursue it. He actually went to the college administration and asked them  if I could qualify by doing x-number of botanical illustrations for credit,  and they okayed it. They gave me one hour, and Ron looked at the level  of work involved with botanicals and decided that twenty illustrations  would be a qualifier for one hour, provided they were a different species.  You know, you can   t do all grass or all trees. If you   re going to do this,  you need to have a range because you need to learn to draw all of it. So,  that was the initial thing, and he really was passionate. He really did  spend the time to get me to develop this. He had been doing the same  thing for years, too, and I think when he found someone that could do  something that he had seen in books but never had a student, that it gave  him an additional,    Oh, this is something different. Let   s see what we  can do with this.     8  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  So, yes, it was an interesting experience, but he could only take it so far.  Chadron only has a certain amount of curriculum that they can teach,  and the professors have to multi-task. When I was there, Ron was  teaching all of the botany courses: taxonomy, botany, and any course  related to plants. In addition, he was also doing microbiology and all the  labs, so it was like they were really working hard for their pay, and I  never felt slighted. I mean, I think I got a pretty good education, but the  curriculum was extremely limited. They had four biology professors in  the whole science building (Laughs) for everything. That included pre-med  and everything. So, at the end of four years, I was like,    Well, I  really want to get into this deeper. I want to take plant anatomy. I want  to take more advanced taxonomy. I want to get into a much deeper  understanding of the plants so that I can do better illustrations.    So, I just  picked up and went down to the University of Nebraska and got the  course catalog out and just started thumbing through, going,    I want to  take this and this and this.    Pretty soon, a course augmentation turned  into three and a half years  It was almost like a treasure chest, having  that catalog in front of you, and learning is so much fun that you just,    I  can just do another year of loans and another year of loans.    But  ultimately I finally ended up with like 176 hours of undergrad course  work.  That   s amazing.  And even though I have the BS, I actually have enough course work to  qualify for a BA in art and a BS in science, and so Chadron got kind of  grouchy at the end because I had transferred down to UNL to get all  these extra courses. Their administration was a little grouchy about that,  so they wouldn   t give me   I don   t know. I hesitate to use this word.  Maybe I shouldn   t on tape  (Laughs) The competition between the  colleges      There was tension?  Yes. So, I transferred down to UNL, and I   m thinking,    Well, maybe I   ll  just use the credit from Chadron to get the degree from UNL.    Well,  UNL wouldn   t take seventy-six of the credit hours. They refused to use  them. So, that aggravated me because I knew that the course work was  really good. I   d been there. I had a very good education from Chadron in  spite of the actual limitations of the number of courses, but then I  wanted to go back to Chadron. Well, Chadron didn   t want to recognize  (Laughs) what UNL was doing, so they took the course work that I did  from them and said,    Yes, we   ll give you a BA for the stuff you did for  us, and you can just have this whole university thing over here as just  extra.    So, I was a little aggravated with the sort of administrative  clashing going on that I got caught in the middle of, because I really did  9  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  earn two degrees even though the two of them were just not going to  give me two degrees, you know. (Laughs) I   m like,    Fine, okay. I   m not  going to play bureaucratic games with the upper echelons of the  university. I   m just going to go get busy and start illustrating.    So, I had  made connections in the Department of Agronomy at UNL, plus Ron  Weedon knew a bunch of people down there that he   d worked with, and  he gave me recommendations, so they hired me as staff illustrator in  1986, and I worked full-time after that.  Okay, so you did that there for four years?  Four years, from 1986 to 1990. It was good, because ultimately in the  middle of that I got married in 1985, and then I got pregnant in 1986, so  I could work at home, because I wanted a certain amount of money for  each illustration, and they could only pay me by the hour. So, I came to  an agreement with my supervisor that each illustration      If you pay me  this much money per hour, then this is how many illustrations you   ll get  for the amount of hours that you   re paying for.    So, I could then go  home and   we ultimately agreed to five illustrations a week, which was  one per day, which I wouldn   t be able to do now because the level of  incredible complexity that I put in now. I would probably be going,    No.  You can have two per week for full-time, because of the amount of work  I do.     Well, just based on what I   ve seen in the exhibit that we   re doing here, I  just can   t imagine how you could produce      Right. It would be slave labor.  Two a week would be      It would be incredible. Well, and I look at maximum twenty hours. So, if  they   re paying me for forty hours, that   s two a week, because they are  paying me as a staff illustrator, so that   s fair. But at that time, I agreed to  an eight-hour block for each illustration, so that was five per week. So, I  could work at home and take care of my child, and it ended up being,  you know ... Thank goodness I was young because   take care of the  baby all day and do that and then stay up half the night and draw,  because I couldn   t take care of the baby and draw in the same block of  time. So, I spent four years there kind of sleep deprived, but I was young  enough that I could do that. No way could I do that now. I   m almost  fifty. It would kill me   So, what kinds of things did they have you do?  Everything. It literally was just whoever in the department  needed  10  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  something.  So, she   s hired by the Department of Agronomy. There are  umpteen-jillion professors (Laughs) in the Department of Agronomy. I  mean, floors   the whole agronomy building was several floors. The guy  that hired me, he was kind of territorial. He wanted to monopolize my  time, so I did the bulk of the work for his projects, but other professors  would come in. One guy wanted me to draw a little   it was a corner of  barbed wire. Sometimes, and I don   t know why the ranchers do this,  sometimes you   ll see a post. Maybe it   s a property line end point where  they   ll do a post, and then they   ll put a diagonal barbed wire stake down,  and I can   t think it would be anything more than just the edge of the  property marker. He wanted me to draw a little baby calf curled up in  this little nook for spring, and then he wanted me to draw summer   just  four seasons of this same corner. It was interesting the things that people  would have me draw. One guy wanted me to draw a center pivot. It was  just whatever they happened to think of. Most of it was botanicals,  though. A lot of it was grasses and how they developed rhizomes  underground and tracked how   one guy, he would have me draw the  grass, and then he said,    Okay, the rhizome is going to grow off to one  side,    and he said,    I want you to show each stage of it as it comes out  and sends up and then goes ahead and flowers itself.    And so I would do  stages and stages for him. It was just whatever they needed that they  wanted for their publications.  It seems like this is a highly specialized area of art. So, how do you get  better, and was there someone that mentored you?  Just Ron, yes. I mean, getting the administration to create a little niche  for me where he could work with me individually. He did let me have  access to his library in the herbarium. When I took plant taxonomy from  him at Chadron my third year, he actually would take me   and there  were two or three other students that were as interested in plant  taxonomy as I was, so he would actually take us into the field and help  us collect specimens, and I thought that was interesting because  taxonomy, in and of itself, the students are required to do that  themselves. So, he knows we   re very into it, so he   s all plugged in all  around the countryside around Chadron, which is just beautiful, and  there   s a lot of little varied ecosystems right around in that area. So, he  would take us to his favorite places and show us,    This plant is this. This  plant is this. This is the soil it   s growing in,    and we would just be  rapidly writing and collecting. We would dig up the specimen, clean it,  take it back to the lab, get it pressed. He gave us access to his personal  passion, where the rest of the students who were just taking it as a  requirement didn   t get as much access.  So, yes, that one-on-one that I got from Chadron was highly beneficial  to me because it gave me a deeper understanding of what I needed to do  11  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  in the beginning, to see the plants. I mean, if you didn   t see it in the  field, if you   re just going into the herbarium and opening the cabinet and  pulling out those pressed specimens, it   s beautiful in the sense that  you   ve got this archived, but to see it in the field and take it from a  living plant all the way through pressed specimen, it aided me later in  terms of looking at the pressed specimen and going,    Okay, I can  visualize this in the field because I was trained to collect it from the  field.    And even if I   d never seen it, I could still extrapolate. So, the  longer I did it, the better I got. I could actually get a pressed specimen  and look at it, read the description that Ron provides for me, and just  visually pick it up off the page and blow it into three dimension in my  mind, and turn it around in my mind. And it got better. The more years I  did it, I could visualize almost everything. There were rare occasions  where I couldn   t, when I was completely unfamiliar with the flower. It   s  really complicated, and I   m like,    I need a photo of this,    (Laughs) or,     You   ve got to send me something, because this specimen is mangled to  the point where I   m having trouble figuring out what slot A went into  slot B,    you know. (Laughs)    It   s just not working for me. We need  more resources.     What kinds of things do you think you see when you look at a plant that  other people don   t?  Oh, everything. I mean, it   s amazing. I guess the best way to describe  the way I view the world is my husband taking me   we live near the  mountains, obviously, and when we first moved there, he wants to go  explore every little back road and,    Let   s go check out these views,    and  I   m with him. I   m great, you know. He   s standing there going,    Check  out that mountain.    I   m down here on the ground looking at the plants,  going,    Cool. Look at this,    because to me, my entire focus for the  world, especially when I   m in nature, is to look at what   s growing. I  don   t even see the scenery first. I mean, I have to get up and go,    Okay,  that   s nice. Now let   s get into this.    You sort of stand there and go,     Cool. Now         And it   s funny because I   ll actually look at the plant, and if it   s growing  in a particular kind of soil, I actually want to pull it up and look  sometimes. If there   s a lot of them, sometimes I will, but if it looks like  it   s one, I don   t want to disturb it, because I was trained from the very  beginning that some plants are rare, and if you go into an area, you don   t  know whether this plant is rare. So, if you go in and there   s like 5,000 of  these things growing, well, pull one up and have a look, but if it   s the  only one growing that you can see, don   t do that because you might be  destroying something that   s on the edges of oblivion. So, I actually pay  attention to what   s growing where, and if there   s a lot, I will pull it up if  I want to see what the root looks like or if it   s something I   ve drawn that  12  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  I   ve never actually seen in the wild. Better, because then I know what it  looks like, and I want to compare what I   ve visualized with reality, and  99.9 percent of the time, my visualizations are as accurate as reality. So,  it   s almost like a validation when you see something growing that  you   ve never really been exposed to and go,    Okay, I   ve got that right.  Cool.  (Laughs)  So, how did you establish your connection with Ron Terrell?  That was a funny story. We actually had to think back on that because it  was like,    How did we meet?    In 1988, Ron Weedon came down from  Chadron, and I was already living in Lincoln working for the  Department of Agronomy as an illustrator, and he was taking a bunch of  students down to Missouri Botanical Garden to a symposium. He came  through Lincoln, stopped and picked me up, and then we all went down  there. There were like three cars. I met a lot of nice people that weekend,  and he was encouraging me to meet professors. He said,    You really  need to,    because I had expressed some dislike for working in an  environment where I had so little creative control because at UNL, I  mean, it was great. You   re a production artist. You do just sheer volume,  and you get better just by sheer repetition, but you don   t have any  creative control. So, he was like,    Well, you should just go out and  freelance.    And I had already been kind of leaning toward freelancing  anyway, but I had a young baby, and I was still putting my husband  through college, so I needed a steady paycheck. But he   s like,    No, you  still need to go out and make some connections for when your husband  graduates and you go ahead and pursue working on your own.     So, I went down there with him and got a list of a lot of the professors  that were there, because there were lists of people. I forget who  (somebody at the Missouri Botanical Gardens) said,    We have lists of  people from Texas and Oklahoma,    and various surrounding states that  had come in for the symposium, and I just started writing down all the  names and sending out portfolios to everybody on the list. Ron was one  of those people, and he contacted me immediately. He was like,    I need  an illustrator. I want to do this field guide to Oklahoma plants,    and  we   ve been hooked up ever since. And even though I didn   t actually  meet him in person until two days ago, (Laughs) I feel like after a  twenty-year relationship on the phone, he is a good friend. He   s hung  with me through thick and thin and thick and thick, you know. It   s just  been a wonderful working relationship. For what I do, I never really  needed to be in the same room. He could send me specimens and  descriptions of what he wanted. I had all the equipment, and I could  produce it and send stuff back to him, and it works, provided the mail  doesn   t lose things, and occasionally once in a while that happened.  Fortunately, none of the originals were ever lost, but occasionally stuff  13  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  would get lost once in a while, but for the most part it was really  beneficial to both of us.  It   s kind of strange though. I mean, two days ago, I get to put a face  together with a voice, and he essentially looked the same as I pictured  him, except I pictured him for some reason with brown hair, and he   s  silver, but he   s sixty-five, (Laughs) so of course he   s going to have  silver hair. You know, when you have someone in your mind, and you  hold an image after you haven   t met them, it is an odd thing, particularly  for an artist who visualizes everything. You just don   t picture them  aging. It   s not part of the process because the voice is always the same.  So, you get this sort of static imagery in your mind of how your children  grow, and you   re forced to re-assess that image. With a phone  conversation, you   re not forced to see the changes, so you don   t  mentally change that, and it   s a strange thing I think for him, too,  although he   s not the artist, so he maybe didn   t focus so much on what I  looked like, but      Right. One of the questions that, obviously, I wanted to ask you, but I   m  sort of hesitating to ask you because I know you   re going to talk about it  in our presentation later      Oh, that   s all right. I mean, I don   t mind being repetitive. Go for it.  Okay. Well, I   m interested in just sort of how the process works from     you get something in the mail, and then what happens?  Basically, assuming that it comes in good shape, get it out, get the  description. The first thing I do is set the description aside, and I just  interact with the plant material, because in most cases it   s something  I   ve not seen, or if I have seen it, I haven   t seen it like this, and so I will  just   and the labels: who collected it, when they collected it, where they  collected it, the dates. I   m always intrigued. Ron occasionally sends me  specimens. I   ve even seen some that were collected in the late 1800s      Wow.      which are just like   you look at them, and you   re like,    Wow.    The  first thing that occurs to me is,    Here   s this person that did this, and it   s  a legacy of them.    They   re dead, but wow, it   s still here, and you think  about the age of the specimen and how well it was preserved and just  getting into the science behind the specimen itself. And then looking at  the beauty of the plant itself, depending on the pressing. Some of the  plants I look at, and I   m like,    Okay. I just can   t find that attractive no  matter what.    Rarely though, because I am very passionate about plants.  And then I will read what he has written as taxonomically correct or  14  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  relevant to the identification of this plant as such, and it   s funny because  in a lot of the cases, Ron   s so thorough that he   ll have gone through and  done what is called an annotation label to bring the labels up to date,  because, as I told you, my frustration with taxonomists is they love to  change the names of things. Every little whipstitch, you just think  you   ve got this under your belt and,    You changed it to what?    I would  think it would make a lot more work for them, because they   re going to  have to go through and annotate every specimen in those herbariums,  and if it   s a big herbarium, oh, that   s a big job.  But he   ll put his little annotation labels and   I don   t know, just the  whole process of getting familiar with the plant. Then I read the  description, and I look at what   s there, and sometimes what he wants  and what   s there, I   ll have to call him up and say,    Okay, this is not  showing this. Can you send me some additional plant material?    or     This is here. It doesn   t seem to match what you want me to draw and  the way you seem to have indicated.    But a lot of times   and when I  first started working with him, I was like,    Okay, you can   t send me  specimens that are glued down to within an inch of their life because if I  can   t dissect it, I can   t draw it, because I can   t do the tiny structures on  the mount. They won   t fit under my scope. I   ll end up having to shove  the paper under there, and it   ll bend, and it can crack the specimens and  damage them, and I   m not willing to do that.    So, I   m like,    Send me the  scrappy old specimens that aren   t glued down that you don   t care about,  (Laughs) because I am going to cut things off of them.    So, I generally  wouldn   t get the pristine things that,    Oh, this is the best example of this  we   ve ever seen.    Stick it aside.  Send me the second best example, right?  Well, I   m actually going,    Okay, send me the stuff that   s representative  that you don   t care about ultimately.    Sometimes they don   t have much  choice, but Ron   s very passionate about what he does, so he usually has  quite a few examples. I require a minimum of four because if I   ve just  got one specimen, what if it   s a little tiny bit different? What if there   s  been some tiny adaptation that some plant has gotten because of where it  grew, whether it was more dry or whether it had more sun or whether it  had better soil or what kind of competition it had? Anything that can  affect the growth habit. I need to see at least enough samples that I know  that this is statistically relevant as a structure. He would send at least  four, but sometimes he   d send twelve or fifteen, depending on what he  had that   if a flower was too well glued down on this one but the seed  pods are great, then we   re going to send a flower. On his end, he does  just as much work preparing for me to draw as I do drawing it. I guess  that   s kind of a long-winded explanation.  15  Then I will take and look at this thing and   I was talking to Mary last  night in the department, the taxonomist, and she was like,    Well, what  do you do with these really complicated things like sage or something  that you look at, and it   s just this wad (Laughs) of incredibly   like fifty  stems and a thousand leaves, and they   re all really tiny and they   re  branching pretty much ad infinitum?    That   s where that ability that I  have to sort of pick the whole plant up in my mind and visualize it in  three dimension comes into play, because I will look at something, read  the description, look at it again, and read the description again, and then  I will figure out what is important structurally that makes this plant what  it is. Then I will mentally take,    That doesn   t need to be there, that  doesn   t need to be there, that doesn   t need to be there,    and preserve the  integrity of the plant by simplifying it and yet retaining its complexity so  it   s accurate. That is something that no computer will ever be able to do,  because I   m actually just interpreting what I see, to simplify it to the  point where it   s a useful illustration.  So, after that   s done, then I do some preliminary sketching on the board,  kind of like Matisse, you know? I don   t know if you   re familiar with his  work, but draw a line here, draw a line there, over here, and there   s a  little hint of   okay, so you   ve got fibrous roots through it, so I   ll take  my pencil and go ... You know, nothing detailed, just a basic layout.  Then when I begin, then I draw it as I want it finished in every bit as  much detail as the ink, because later I   m going to go back and ink over  those lines, so they have to be accurate. So, the pencil sketch is as  accurate as the ink; it just doesn   t have any shading. Or if I come to a  plant that   s covered with a bunch of hairs, I will draw one little section  of the stem that has hairs, but I   m not going to take the time to put every  single hair in pencil because that   s a waste of my time. I need to do it in  ink, but I   m not going to do it in pencil. I   ll just indicate it, and then I   ll  write a little note to myself,    Hairs like this on all other surfaces,    so  when I come back to it, okay. Then you just sit there for hours and put  five million hairs on it, you know, (Laughs) because that is the tedious  part, but it   s also my favorite part. Once I get that inked and I draw that  outline in, then I carefully erase those pencil lines. I leave the notations  in. I   ll just erase the drawing out from under, and then I go back using  my own notes that I   ve written very lightly in pencil and then ink  everything and shade everything, and then when I   m finally done, then I  erase my pencil notations and it   s finished.  I recently, in the last   I think I started Photoshop in 2004. Then I   ll go  scan it into the computer and enlarge and move it around and   I love  Photoshop. It   s taken something where I had to be really careful about  where I was laying things out and sizing things initially. Now with  Photoshop, I can just draw anything any-old-where I want because I can  take it, and I can rotate it in space. I can turn it around. It   s the most  16  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  amazing thing. You can take a drawing that would have normally been  static (the way you drew it is the way it is) and create incredible fluidity.  So, for me Photoshop is like artistic nirvana. You get in there and you  go,    Everything   s drawn. Now let   s make it cool (Laughs) for the final  product,    and that   s what Ron and I have gotten to do. Originally, we  were sending pencil sketches back and forth in the mail, and we still do  to some extent, but mostly now we just e-mail, attach files, and he   ll  take a look and make notes, and then he   ll scan it, and then he   ll send me  that back, scanned. So, no, not even a paper trail exists for the last few  drawings that we did, which is in a way kind of sad because there won   t  be anything for you to archive (Laughs) from the last batch  So, that  basically is it.  That   s the whole process, and of course with the PowerPoint, I   ve shown  examples. I mean, I have pieces of his descriptions, and I have examples  of my pencil sketches. I get into a lot more detail about how Ron works  his corrections on my work, because if I   m working with a pressed  specimen, it   s not going to look the way it looks in the field, and  sometimes if I   m completely unfamiliar with it, its growth habit could be  different. For instance, if you   ve got a tree where the branches hang  down like this, they   re not going to press it that way. They   re just going  to lay everything down to try and expose the structure. So, I   m looking  at this, thinking,    Okay, it grows like this, not like this.    So, when I  draw something as it looks on the specimen, not being familiar with it,  that   s where errors creep in. So, he goes,    No, no. This doesn   t actually  grow like it does on the specimen. You   ve got to bend it, or you   ve got  to         and then I make corrections.  Are there any particular memories that really stand out for you in terms  of your working relationship with Ron and with the rest of the team for  the field guide?  Wow. Specific plants, things that just give me   either they   re so  beautiful that I was just like,    Oh,    or they were so aggravating that  when you   re finished it, you   re like,    Oh, finally.    (Laughs) There   s one  in the presentation that I talk about, and I put it in there simply because  of the incredibly aggravating nature of it. It   s called the Antelope Horn  Milkweed. You   ll see it. Milkweed as a group has these little structures  called pollinium, which are very odd looking little things. You   ll see a  photo of it. It looks like an upside-down set of horns.  And what   s the purpose of those?  It produces pollen for the flower, but they   re miniscule. They   re teeny,  tiny little things, and you have to sort of coax them out. Milkweed  flowers are small. You   re looking at an umbel of things that mostly     17  they grow in a ball where the flower stalks all come from a single point  called an umbel, and so when they press them, you get this mushed   the  flowers get crushed into the flowers because they   re just kind of spread  out. You can put one over here or here or here. Now they   re crunched  down into this squished little ball, and I   m in there with the tweezers,  lifting, trying to pull one out, drop it in the wetting solution, and trying  to coax out a pollinium. Tears, cracks, breaks, you know. I must have  done that forty times with that bloody plant, and I was just like,    Ron,  I   m going to have your whole specimen destroyed because I can   t get a  pollinium out of these flowers. It   s driving me nuts. Do you have  anything a little fresher?    I finally managed to get one. I was like,    It  didn   t break     Because something that small, you can   t infer. You can   t  visualize it because you haven   t seen it. So, you have to have it intact in  order to infer. But I finally got it coaxed out of the flower, and it was  intact. It   s floating around in the water, and I   m like,    Okay, I   ve got to  get it out of here before it floats off because it   s so small     So, I did.  When I finally got it drawn and it was accurate and Ron okayed it, I was  like,    Thank God. (Laughs) It   s done.    Those are the kinds of events that  stand out for me, where something is either so aggravatingly difficult or  so incredibly beautiful.  I love the genus Oenothera, which is the evening primrose genus, and he  hadn   t included many of those in the first edition. So, when he pulled the  next   I think he had seventy-four or seventy-five new plants for the  second edition that I did. There were so many beautiful flowers in that  set. I was just,  Oh, my gosh.  All these beautiful Oenotheras just     Lobelias, Penstemons, a lot of the large showy flowers. Those things,  when I draw them, they   re just amazing. Like I have   I don   t know if  you   ve heard of trumpet vine. A lot of people use them in their gardens,  but they   re also wild. So, I have trumpet vine in my yard, and he sends  me specimens, and I   m like,    Oh, trumpet vine.    So you put it together  that, okay, it is wild and it is an ornamental, too. People use it. So, I   m  out in the garden pulling live specimens, because it   s always better when  you can use something fresh, and ended up with that trumpet vine being  one of my favorite illustrations simply because I got to work with the  pressed and the living, and the plant is so beautiful. When someone says  draw   oh, golly, there was a couple of sages that were just so incredibly  repetitive, drawing the same tiny little leaf five thousand times. Those  kinds of things get to be no fun. They   re tedious. They still have to be  accurate. You still have to include all of that. That kind of stuff, or if I  can   t quite get it right.  There was one grass that I did for Ron, and I never was happy with it  even though we finally just said,    Okay, fine. Let   s just quit here. We   ve  drawn it three times now. It   s just not working.    Where something is so  fuzzy that if you were to draw every single line it would just be black, so  18  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  you have to learn to not put stuff in and still imply the fuzz, and I was  never happy with that one, and I don   t think he was either, but he didn   t  want to hurt my feelings. I   m like,    Okay, hurt them. I   m great.    I   m so  flexible, I can take criticism from anybody, particularly with my art. If  you like it, great. If you don   t, okay, no biggie, and if it   s not right, let   s  work on it until it is. I didn   t have ego attached to this process at all. If  he hires me to do this job, I want to do the best I can, period. And that  was the great thing about working with Ron. He was never all that  worried about my ego because it was never an issue, so we could work  and he could say,    I need you to change this. It still isn   t right,    and I   d  be like,    No problem.    So, there   s this incredible fluidity of comfort as  working with the scientist where we both know each other well enough  that there   s no issues involved around the kinds of changes he needed to  make.  He liked the fact that I was such a perfectionist. He really did, because it  made his job easier. He didn   t have to make extensive corrections. A lot  of times he would put    ready to ink.    I   d send him a pencil sketch, and  he   d just take his little red pen and write    ready to ink.    You can tell he  was a grader because he always had the red pen  (Laughs) Cracked me  up. I   m like,    Cool,    and I would say probably 75-80 percent of them  would come back with    ready to ink    written on them. I wouldn   t even  have to make changes. If there were changes, they were subtle. One time  in one flower, I think it was Colinicea,  possibly Commelina or  Commelinaceae  anyway, it looked to me like a violet, even though I  know it wasn   t a violet, but it was similar to that kind of structure. I had  drawn it flat, and he basically wanted me to turn it into a three-quarter  view so you could get more of a three-dimensional feeling from the  flower, because sometimes you want the diagrammatic look because  that   s what the student looks for accuracy. But he actually wanted a  more artsy     So I just erased it and redrew it in the three-quarter, and  he was like,    Cool.    Sometimes it was preference; sometimes it was just  straight practicality.  What about color? I mean, when you get dried specimens, how do you  end up accurately replicating the      Color?  Yes. And also, in what you were doing for him, these are black and  white, but for what you do?  The color   well, that   s such a fluid thing, because really even within  plants growing, the color can vary. Ultimately I end up with people     because color work for me is commission work because they don   t  publish it. It   s too expensive to reprint. So, if someone comes to me and  19  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  says,    I want a violet-purple iris,    I   m like,    Okay, how violet? Give me  a little paint swatch, and I   ll just paint it the way you want it.    That   s  largely the determining factor with my color. If I   m doing it for myself, I  will look at a color range in a flower, and I   ll pick my favorite. And  there   s one piece in here that Ron didn   t want to include in the exhibit  because it was a commissioned piece, and it   s the Opuntia. And the  Macrorhiza as I was telling you was a polyacantha.  Oh, right.     and they   ve changed it this year again. (Laughs) So, a person came to  me who wanted this Macrorhiza painted in neon fluorescent pink, and it  doesn   t occur that way in nature, but they wanted it. To me, it   s like,     You   re going to take a piece of my black and white, and you want me  to color it for something that you want to hang on your wall. Okay.     There   s a part of me that will be fluid about the artistic end. Dealing  with Ron, he   s looking at this piece going,    It doesn   t go like that,    and  I   m like,    I know. (Laughs) I figured you   d nix that from the exhibit  because it   s not technically accurate,    but it is a beautiful piece of a  painting, so I   m actually able to bridge back and forth to people who  commission pieces to do whatever they want. If they want it accurate,  then I   ll try to find a photograph that I think is as accurate as possible,  because photographs, depending on where they   re taken, can be  completely inaccurate, too. It   s just easier to go to the person  commissioning.    Well, what color do you want it?    Then you   ll be  happy, I   ll be happy, I   ll get my money, the artwork will be beautiful.  Everybody wins.  That sounds like a good plan. You recently have had to call an end to  your work as a botanical illustrator.  Breaks my heart. (Laughs)  I mean, as much as you want to talk about that, could you just tell us  about that and what your plans are?  Really, it took my doctors basically waving their finger under my nose  last August, because I knew it was getting to be a serious problem. I  knew that working was beginning to create so much pain, and I was  doing everything I could think of. I was having surgeries. I did physical  therapy. I did everything I could to stop this degeneration in my spine,  and it wasn   t working. And finally I finished up the project for Ron in  July of 2007, and I was scheduled for my entire annual workup with my  spine in August in Omaha, because all of my doctors are in Omaha. I  haven   t found anybody that I think is worth their salt in Denver, which  kind of surprises me because you   ve got a bigger pool of doctors in  20  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Denver than Omaha, but whatever. (Laughs) So, I   m going back to  Omaha to have my workup, and my two doctors, especially my  physiatrist, (he   s a pain doctor) took a look at the x-ray of my spine and  basically said,    Are you nuts? I cannot help you anymore if you keep  doing this, because you are causing the degeneration to accelerate so fast  that you   re going to be crippled by the time you   re sixty. Absolutely  crippled. You will not be able to hold your head up. You will lose  sensation in your hands because the nerves are going to be so damaged  that       I   m like,    Okay.     I already have been a chronic-pain sufferer because of two back  surgeries for the last   golly, when did I have my first one? 1997. Over  ten years I   ve been dealing with chronic pain. I don   t want it to get any  worse. It   s already at the threshold of,    Gosh, this is kind of wrecking  my life.    And if it   s worse, and it can be because coming out of post-op  after a couple of back surgeries, you really understand how bad pain can  be when you have something that catastrophic. I   m looking at that,  going,    I   m kind of at the limit of what I can tolerate now. I don   t want  it to get worse.    And it was very hard, because I just adore Ron, and the  relationship that we have is so good. Our working relationship is so  fluid. I don   t want to disappoint him. So, I literally had to   and I   ve  been trying to stop for five years. I mean, I   ve been kind of telling him,     I need to quit, I need to quit,    and he   s like,    But just do one more  thing,    (Laughs) because we just work well together, and he   s passionate  and so am I, and he   s so nice, I never wanted to say,    No.    It was so  hard, and I ultimately ended up having to write it down in a letter  because I was so sad. I thought,    I can   t have this conversation with him  on the phone or I   m going to cry.    It was so horrible.  So, I wrote him this big long letter, and I didn   t hear from him for three  weeks, and I was like,    Uh-oh. I hurt his feelings.    But he calls me up in  three weeks, and he   s like,    Well, I understand.    He was so cool about  it, and then he said,    Well, we want to do some honorariums for you,     and that   s when he set up this weekend. I was like,    That says it all right  there.    The respect that he gave back to me ... He knew, because he   s  had to nurse me through two back surgeries. I mean, talk about patience  of Job  (Laughs)    I can   t work for two years, Ron. I   ve got to do rehab.  Sorry about your project, but there it is.     So, did he wait, or did he find      He waited. He absolutely waited. He knew that we had such a good  working relationship, and he likes my style. I   ve been told by people that  look at it when they finally understand what I do, the visualizing, the  simplifying, the interpreting to get to the illustration, or they go into the  literature and look at some of the existing illustrations which in most  21  cases are, not to sound arrogant, but, they   re just inferior. They   re hard  to see. They   re jumbled. They   re, in some cases, inaccurate. They   ve  been blacked out because they   ve been drawn too small to begin with, so  they don   t have enough detail. I had an artist look at my presentation on  Monday. She   s a college professor, and I wanted to run it by her. I   m  like,    I want to run this speech by you. I want you to see the PowerPoint.  Give me your feedback. You   ve got both graphic and teaching skill. I  lack the teaching skill. I want your critique.    She looked at my work,  and she said,    Oh, my God.    She said,    You   re so much more than an  illustrator is. You   re not copying. You   re not taking an image and  creating an illustration. You   re actually using this incredible ability that  you have.    Because she looked at the pressed specimen, and she   s like,     How did you get from that pile of junk, that wadded up mess of  mangled plant material, to this beautiful thing? What   s cool about what  you do is we can look at this image and it   s simple and you can see  everything at a glance.    I never had looked at it that way.  I thought, having not had all that much contact with other illustrators,  particularly in my field because there just aren   t that many of us, I didn   t  realize that another illustrator who I hold in great esteem for her skill  would look at my work and go,    I couldn   t do it. I just could not  visualize that mangled mess and create that beautiful interpretation. I  couldn   t do it.    And I thought,    Wow, okay. Maybe I am a little  unique.    It was kind of a little shot of blood to the ego, you know. I  mean, honestly, it   s an odd thing to watch other artists as they interact  with their audience. I don   t, not ever. I   m sitting up there producing  drawing after drawing after drawing, and the only person I have any  contact with is Ron, for twenty years, you know. Plus the commission  piece is so   I find when I come down here and I meet all these people  that like my work, I   m like,    Really? Wow. (Laughs) Who knew?     Somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew that people were using my  work, and it was a benefit to them to learn the science, which is  ultimately your ultimate goal.  When I   m creating art and looking at it   how can I simplify this for the  student and everybody? Not only is it beautiful, but it   s accurate, and it   s  easy to interpret, and the structures are large enough that they can ...  Those things I do in my work, but the piece that was missing was the  actual interaction with the audience. So, that   s been kind of interesting  (Laughs) for me, because lay people, they look at my work, and they go,     Oh, it   s a nice botanical,    but when they really understand what I do,  they kind of go,    Oh, my gosh. That   s not the usual botanical thing  that   s in, say, the big book of petunias (Laughs) or the coffee-table book  of roses.    I mean, they   re beautiful, and their craftsmanship is  outstanding, but they don   t do what I do. So, I don   t know. You sit by  yourself for years, and it is a solitary thing. I spend a lot of time just  22  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  thinking about visualizing what I   m doing. Put on a little music,  sometimes I have the TV on in the background, depending on how  boring the specimen is, because sometimes if there   s five thousand little  leaves, turn on some TV program that you can listen to that   ll engage  your brain. But if it   s something I   m really passionate about, I don   t  need that. I don   t need the distraction from the TV. I   m sorry I   m kind of  all over the map.  Oh, no.  No one   s asked me to describe this in such an intricate fashion before, so  it   s prompting sort of a cascade of connections in the way I   m telling  you this, because it   s like,    Oh, yes, this and this and this.    (Laughs)  Well, I think it   ll be so helpful to people that come and use the material  later on to encourage you to think about it this way.  I hope so, and ultimately that comes down to it. Instead of being really  sad that I   m not going to be able to do this anymore, the consolation of  this is, I look back on over two thousand illustrations, artwork that I   ve  legitimately authorized in over seventy-five publications. I Googled my  name once on the Internet, and I   m looking,    Okay, I authorized this, not  this, not this, not this, not this, not this.    It was kind of like,    Oh,  bummer.    But then, on the other hand, I may not have gotten paid for it,  but wasn   t the ultimate goal to get it out there for the students to use?  And if the professors are taking it out of publications that I   ve done and  reusing it, they like it. It   s accurate. It   s become public domain, and  maybe I didn   t make any money off it, but I   m never really all that much  into the money in the first place. It was more about creating the art for  the art   s sake so that the students and people could get in and have an  easier time of things. So, I stepped back from that initial,    Gosh, I didn   t  authorize that,    to,    Wow, a lot of people are using my work     (Laughs)  Well, it   s still an incredibly generous philosophy, though.  Well, and I know other artists that get really bitter, because they look at  their work and it   s theirs. And I understand the idea that when you create  something you really do put a piece of yourself into it, because you  invest your time and your creative effort, and even though you may not  visualize your brain power as something that   s tangible on the paper, it  really is when you create art. And when someone takes their imagery  and uses it without authorization, they get bitter because they didn   t get  compensated for this time. I decided very early on I   m too happy a  person for that. Ultimately, the students will benefit, and in a curious  sort of way, I   ve seen myself in a very tiny little narrow niche become  famous in my lifetime while I   m still alive.  23  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Right, which most artists seldom      And so, in a way I   ve proved my father wrong. You know,    If your work  becomes known at all, you   re never going to benefit from it. You   re  never going to know, because they   re not going to want to purchase a  body of your work until it   s a finite supply,    i.e. no more is being made,  and that   s not the case here.  So, is he still alive?  Oh, yes. He   s thirty years older than I am. I   m forty-seven. He   s  seventy-seven, so     I turn forty-eight next month. It   s funny that one  time he turned sixty, I turned thirty in the same year. It was like,    Oh,  wow. Cool.    (Laughs) No, he still has a lot of impact on my life, and it   s  so cool to come down here and see this school and realize that he went  to college here. I   m like,    How did I miss that?    All these years I   ve  been working with Ron and OSU, and I knew it, but then getting down  here and seeing how beautiful this school is and walking around on the  grounds and sort of getting back into the college milieu, not locked up in  the studio by yourself, going,    Wow, I can see why Ron wants to be here  all the time. It   s a stimulating and beautiful place.    See, but both my  aunt, my father   s sister, and my dad went here.  Oh, okay. So, do you know when he graduated?  I don   t. I really don   t, and that   s been the kind of questioning that   s  going through my mind, and I   m making this little list of  Call Dad up  when you get back and ask him this and this and this and this. Was this  building still here, and did you do that?  Suddenly it   s prompted a whole  series of inquiry that I   m going to have with him. I   m trying to get      We could find him in the yearbook before you leave.  If he   s there. I think that he ended up being tapped to go to Korea.  Honestly, I really don   t think he finished here. I don   t know for sure.  That   s why I   ve got this list of questions, because I do know that he  served in Korea in a MASH  Mobile Army Surgical Hospital  unit, and I  do know that it interrupted his college career. I   m just not sure what part,  so I   ve got to find out, if for nothing else than for my children and  keeping the family archive accurate.  Sure. Well, that   s an interesting connection. I didn   t realize that until  you said that.  Well, and then like I told you, coming down here and finding out how  friendly everybody is, and I   m thinking,    I want to live here.    (Laughs)  24  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Everybody   s so nice.  It   s a wonderful place. What advice would you offer to someone that   s  looking at botanical illustration as a career path?  A lot of people say that   and I think there   s kind of a mythology out  there that artistic ability is innate, it   s inborn. I do think that happens, but  I don   t think that if you aren   t born with it you can   t acquire it. So start  from the premise that, okay, this like any technical skill, with practice,  can be acquired. I   ve felt that way from the very beginning because,  okay, I had this basic love of art, almost like knowing in your heart what  you   re supposed to do just at a very young age. That   s very unusual.  Maybe someone isn   t born with that, but they have a lot of technical  skill and interest, and interest really is the key. If you   ve got a passion  about something, you can become excellent at it. You just have to train  yourself.  When I was speaking to Mary last night, working with Ron   she   s  working on her master   s in taxonomy, and I think she   s teaching, was  what I gleaned from the conversation last night. She   s expressed some  interest in having me train her. She   s like,    But I   m not an artist,    and  I   m like,    Oh, that doesn   t matter. You   re obviously passionate about  taxonomy. You understand the terminology. You love the plants as  much as I do.    It was almost like we went to this meeting-of-the-minds  moment. But I told her,    Come to Longmont for a week or two. Stay  with me, and I will train you.    I can train her because she has the innate  passion for the plants and the understanding of the science already under  her belt which is the hardest part. Most people come at it from the other  direction, like me, where you   re coming in from the artistic standpoint  and you look at the science. There really are people that are right brain  or left brain. I just happen to be probably a little bit   I   m a little more  right brain than most, but I do have a good left brain component that can  really get into the science and the detail. If you   re coming at it from that  way, you can train yourself to be an artist more easily, I think, than  coming at it from an artistic standpoint and trying to train yourself to be  a meticulous scientist.  Having done both and worked with people that are interested in coming  at it from both directions, teaching her the art will be easier than  teaching her the science, because right brain people have a hard time  with the meticulous organization of plant tax. I tell people,    You think  about what a doctor has to know for terminology, for anatomy   s sake.  You have to learn every organ, every tissue, every muscle, every  insertion, every origin.    Everything is named. Even parts of specific  things have names within names. Taxonomy is even more complex, and  every plant has different structures. At least with the human body you  25  have a finite number of things to learn. You get to a new plant, you   ve  got to get a whole new range of descriptive terminology to describe  what   s different about this than this one. So, it almost becomes a  proposition of infinity, even though for people who aren   t trained, they  go,    Oh, I can   t do it.    If you can   t, you can   t.  I   m going to train her. I   m going to start her off with some basic,    What  do you like?    She likes roses.  Okay, draw a rose. Let   s see how you  visualize.  So, my first step would be to see how she   s visualizing so I  can train her to visualize accurately, because if she   s not visualizing in  three-dimension, which you have to do, then I have to train her to make  that leap, which isn   t that hard. You can start by copying photographs.  You get your own photographs. Go out in the field, and take some  pictures. That   s what I   ve done. My husband has taken countless  photographs for me, and then I   ll go look at the photograph, and that  automatically trains my brain in three dimensions. The more of those  three-dimensional photographs you look at, that   s just another step in the  training process. And then of course draftsmanship, that   s an acquired  skill. So, once you   ve made the leap from interpretive and three-dimensional  visualization, then it   s just a drafting skill, and then you  train yourself. You want to draw a hairy stem. There   s two levels of  things you have to draw there. You have to contour that stem so it looks  round. So, I have to train her how to do the lines.  If you would, picture just the stem of a plant. Let   s pick three basic  features that you   re going to try to draw in the drawing so that it will  look like it looks on the specimen. First of all, a stem is basically one big  long cylinder, so you have to learn to shade for that. Now, what if that  stem has hairs all over it? You can   t draw so many hairs that you   ve  obscured the shading of the cylinder. Or if it has hairs and grooves, some  stems have   you can see the venation. Think of the grass where you can  see all the parallel venation in the leaves and in the stocks. You   ve got  hairs; you   ve got venation; you   ve got curvature. You have to learn to  balance each of those draftsman skills and not overdo, because if you put  too much in, when you reproduce it, it   s going to turn black, particularly  if it gets reduced radically. I try to start small. I start 8x10, anyway,  because I don   t want to go much further from 8x10. Usually we go from  8x10 down to 5x7. You go much further and even my stuff gets fused  and blacks out. I just call it reduction obscurity.  I know some scientists who were not artists who draw things  unbelievably huge. They   ll go in and draw a bud that   s this big on the  page, and they   ll do dots that are so large, and they   ll almost use a magic  marker, and then when they reduce it, it looks like my illustration. But  they have to start big because they know that if they start small and  reduce it smaller, it   s going to be lost. I   m not into gigantic reductions. I  26  try to stay as close as possible, but I will be training her in basic  draftsmanship.  These are all the kinds of things you   re going to  encounter. These are all the surfaces you   re going to encounter. These  are the basic things you need to do to shade a leaf, to shade a flower  petal, to shade a stem, to shade a root, to create these structures. Start  with some basis and then, okay, you get more complicated. This is what  you do to preserve the underlying drawing and then add detail to that.   It   s just a matter of teaching, as I spoke of earlier, the process, for pity   s  sake, and no one ever taught me the process. If you look at my work, if  you track it, and I did after Ron prompted me to produce this piece about  what made me an artist. I   m going back through my portfolio; even from  my young childhood I have everything. My mother was passionate about  saving every last scrap I ever stuck a crayon on, and I was always a  botanical illustrator, even when I didn   t know it. I   ve got flowers and  plants and twigs in every medium I was ever working with or taught  with or exposed to. I   m drawing plants. It must have just been what I  was supposed to do.  I can still train the technique, and they can develop their own style, but  you don   t have all that much room for stylistic interpretation with  botanicals because they have to be accurate, period. And if it   s this scale,  and it   s this level of shading and this level of complication, you can only  do so much, which is why I included some of my pieces in the exhibit to  show what my individual style is, particularly those watercolor irises.  That   s what I   m going to do. That   s where I   m going to end up.  Now that I   m done with the illustration, which is just sitting like this,  hunching forward, your body has to be held so still in order for the lines  to be so accurate that my spine just goes,    Ouch.    But with watercolor, I  can lay a piece of paper out and get the paint on the brush and swoosh  and swing, and I   m not sitting here hunched over for hours and hours  and hours creating five thousand dots or five million hairs. People are  like,    How can you draw a straight line?    and I   m like,    I can   t draw a  straight line. What I can draw is an uninterrupted line,    because  botanicals can   t be a series of lines like you   re just doing a rough sketch.  You have to have extremely fine control, which is why I ended up  having two surgeries for carpal tunnel, because I   m holding my hand for  hours very still and just precisely moving.  I would hazard a guess, with two thousand illustrations, millions of hairs  and millions of dots that I   ve created with my hand. After that, you do  come up against the wall of physical limitation, but paint, oh my gosh,  it   s fluid. It   s like woosh, woosh, woosh, take a break.    Cool, look what  that did.    And then woosh, woosh, you know? (Laughs) I can still create  beautiful work without the incredibly taxing nature of the precision  27  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  involved. So, that   s what I   m going to do. I have this painting at home. I  wish I had finished it for this exhibit. It   s about half the size of this table.  It   s a watercolor iris again, only this time   well, you know how the  irises are roughly accurate in size on the painting that   s next to the  podium? The iris in this picture, this big. (Laughs) I love Georgia  O   Keefe.  I was just thinking that Georgia O   Keefe      It   s not her style in the sense that I   m copying. First, she works in oils,  and she did things that were interpretive. I actually am going to try to  keep it accurate. I   m just going to get big, and then my level of  interpretation is coming in the   she blended all her colors, and the style  that I   ve developed with watercolors is to draw everything out in pencil  and make each shape a discreet little bubble. In other words, if you go  look at that iris picture, every petal, every leaf, everything is separate,  but then I blend it out in the end. So, I   m still even kind of anal about the  paint, but I allow the paint within each of those little bubbles to do what  it   s going to do, you know. I   ll just wet that one little spot, and then I   ll  get the colors I want on the palette, and then I   ll just start dropping it in  and just let it lead and flow. Sometimes I have to step back and go,    Let  it go. Don   t try to control it,    because after years of controlling every  last dot, the exercise of painting is actually very freeing for me. It   s a  stimulating thing. I   m looking forward to it enormously, and I have  eighteen-foot ceilings in my living room. My husband bought me a  beautiful home.  So, you have some great spaces.  I have this fantastic, huge empty space up there, and you can   t put little  stuff up there because it   s way the heck up there. You   ve got to have  big, which is why I thought,    Okay, I   m going to start with an iris this  big, because it needs to be able to be seen from way up there.     Right.  So, that was prompted by a space necessity, but then getting into it  going,    Hey, this is fun. I can see why Georgia O   Keefe wanted to make  it big.     You have two children. What about them? Do they have any artistic  talent?  They do, but it manifests in different ways. My son, when he was little,  he used to draw tiny, tiny little things. I mean, he would draw itty-bitty  little cars, little people. It was very good, and it was all very small, and I  28  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  thought,    Oh, gosh. He   s got my same ability, this ability to focus in to  the tiniest little minutiae.    But he gradually moved away from art, and  now he   s a writer. He   ll be twenty-two years old next month, and he   s  already written three novels, so he paints with words, and what he   s let  me read is astonishingly good. I believe that if he will pursue it, if the  details of life do not get in the way, you know, having to earn a  paycheck and having to do the big details, not the little ones, that he  could potentially be a very great author.  And then of course my daughter, her talent   she   s more like me in the  fact that she   s both right and left brained, and she   s absolutely gifted  with music. I bought her a flute in sixth grade. The first week she had it,  she taught herself to play Beethoven   s Ode to Joy with no instruction. I  heard her playing that in her room five days after I bought that flute for  her, and I went up there,    What are you doing?       I   m playing my flute      She played it for me, and I picked my jaw up off the floor. Who teaches  themselves fingering and notes by themselves in sixth grade, you know?  She   s astonishing. She really is, and for someone so young, she   s tough.  I   ve never met anyone whose ego is so intact at such a young age, so  able to be who they are and not care what anyone else thinks or does.  She could potentially be a politician. I   ve watched her work a room. I  like to have dinner parties and people over, and I don   t exclude my  children from any event. She   ll work the room like a politician. She   s  very talented. She wants to be a transplant surgeon   hearts, kidneys,  livers. She hasn   t quite picked out what she wants to do yet.  How old is she?  Right now she   s fourteen, and she   s a powerhouse. She   s got an  extremely high IQ. I actually had one teacher in third grade who  wouldn   t put her in the gifted club because she was, get this, too gifted.  She saw her IQ from the test, and she goes,    Well, I   ve never had a  student with this high an IQ.    I   m like,    Excuse me? So, you   re going to  put her in with a regular classroom because she   s too gifted for the  gifted? Tell me about the logic in this because at least the gifted would  be a little more challenging than the regular classroom. She   d be less  bored.    But she is. She   s extremely bored in school. I saw her one  summer reading encyclopedias, and then another summer I saw her  reading dictionaries. In fifth grade, who reads a dictionary? Even if  you   re an adult, you know? She   s amazing, but her father   s also really  smart. She   s gifted with words.  She   s doing flute, and I buy her sketchbooks. She   s filled seven  sketchbooks. She won   t let me see anything she draws, but she is  obviously producing. And I keep telling her,    Do not use me as an  example, because I have a lifetime of experience as an artist, and there   s  29  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  no way at fourteen that you   re going to have the skill level that I have.  So, do not set yourself up against what I can do now as the yardstick for  what you think you should be able to do at fourteen.    I look at that, and I  hope she   s not going to be setting goals for herself that are unrealistic for  her age, because it is a skill acquisition. It does take time.  Well, I have two questions still left for you. One was based off of  something that you told me earlier, and I   m involved with a couple of  faculty members who are looking at designing a crossover course. Right  now it   s a mammalogist and the art department, but they   re interested in  combining their areas to come up with a course in scientific illustration,  which I think is a great idea.  I do, too.  And I   m just curious what kind of advice you would give to them about  the things that you think should be covered in a class like that.  Well, as I said a little bit earlier, I think coming at it from a science base  is easier than going at it from the art into the science. If you   ve got  students that are interested in reducing the imagery that you   re looking  at in the classroom (say you   ve got a photograph, or you   re working in  the field or whatever) to a line drawing or a pencil, or even a painting,  you need to focus on the dimensionality. You obviously want to learn  the structures, because if it   s going to be a scientific illustration   I don   t  have a lot of experience with zoology, so I can   t speak on that. The  image that comes to mind is, say you   re looking at a bear. The first thing  I   m going to see with the bear are the claws and the fur and the features.  I   m going to look at the dimensional, but I don   t know the science  behind that. So, they would still need to teach the students   they would  have to look at it from a morphological point of view. What muscle  groups? How does he look when he   s standing? How does he look when  he   s running? How does he look when he   s sleeping? How does he look  when he   s eating? What is important as representative imagery for that  science? In other words, do you want to know all of that, or do you want  to limit it to just a basic   the bear standing there, side view, front view?  But you have to focus on the science, and you have to look at it from a  strictly structural standpoint. You can   t get into what the bear eats or  anything like that unless you want to draw him eating, and then that   s  just very incidental to the picture. It   s not the main part. Then you go in  and you bring in an artist who does what I do, who can look at this and  describe it visually through the steps of the process. Now, if I were to  refer back visually to what I do with plants, I   m looking at the basic  overall structure first. So, I guess with a bear you   d look at the  proportions and the shape, and then once you get the structure down and  30  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  that   s reasonably accurate, then you   ve got to work on perspectives,  because with anything that you illustrate, you have to have three-dimensionality  to it. So, you have to learn perspectives. Once you get  that basic sketch down, then you have to look at,    Well, what makes the  bear the bear?    The hair, the look of the eyes. You need to layer in the  technique. You need to teach the technique for creating dimension. So,  the science has to begin with what makes a bear a bear, and then the art  has to come in: Well, how do you make a bear look like a bear on a two-dimensional  medium?  So, it has to be twofold. You have to start, I believe, with the science,  and then add the artistic skill later. And you would almost need to have  someone who was good in zoological illustrations to liaison with the  scientist so that they could develop the technique of interpretation from  the science to the art and back and forth. It   s like you need to make a  circle. Having never done it and ultimately never really even conceived  of it, because usually when I   m working with someone, they don   t want  to know the science. They just want me to teach them the art.    Oh, that   s  so pretty. Could you teach me to draw?    Well, okay, I can teach you  technique, but if you   re not going to be doing the science, it   s a lot of  work. I   m used to working at it from the art end, but I really do think the  science is the more important end of it. So, I would be better doing a  course in botanicals, obviously, because I know the material at the  science end of it.  Right, and I think it   s just that someone in the zo ology department was  the one that approached the person in the art department, and we have a  lot of biological specimens in a museum collection that we administer.  The collection is no longer viewable, but it would be a great way to  make some of those specimens available to students.  You mean like stuffed animals or bones or      Like professionally taxidermically prepared animals that are related to  this area.  Yes, in that case you   ve already got a static image. You   re not even  having to conceive it. You   re just essentially interpreting what   s there,  which is much easier. I mean, the process that makes botanical  illustration so complicated, from my perspective, is working from  pressed specimens that you then have to conceive to a three-dimensional  nature. With that, it   s just a strictly      It   s already in three dimensions.  Yes. With that, it becomes straight artistic training at that point. It is  31  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  beginning-drawing classes where they   re going to start.    Okay, we   re  going to start you with a pile of cubes and how you shade these surfaces  and how you get the perspectives correct, and train yourself in basic  three-dimensional shape reproduction, and then you just advance  through that.    So, I don   t see, in a case like that, where you would really  have to worry that much about the science end of it because it would be  more of a      Well, that   s just one of the sets of objects from which people could work.  I don   t      Right. I actually mentally went right to, say, bones that you wouldn   t  necessarily want people to be handling because skin oils and exposure to  air, they can really be damaged. So, yes, you get one person in there in a  controlled situation where they can draw the bone, and then you don   t  need the bone anymore because you   ve got the drawing of the bone. And  in a lot of cases, as you   ll see when you look at that presentation, pay  particular attention to the slide that I do of the sand bird, because the  photograph that I provide, though accurate, is not as good as the  illustration. I sat them right next to each other on the PowerPoint so that  you could see why the illustration was actually better than the  photograph, because you can see more at a glance with the illustration.  So, in that case, yes, having your collections reduced to imagery would  be very helpful to protect the collection, plus they   re still available for  viewing. And depending on the level of accuracy, they would be able to  identify which bone using the illustration if you get someone who really,  like me, who   s just incredibly into every last little line and groove and  bump and knob and     (Laughs)  So, is there anything that you wish that I had asked you that I didn   t?  No, I find your questions very thorough actually. You obviously put a  lot of thought into this. A lot of lay people that look at my work will ask  me,    Well, why do we even need illustrations?    I get that question all  the time.    Can   t we just use photographs?    Photographs are great, and in  my presentation I talk about why illustration is so much more valuable  than a photograph in terms of the scientific value of the image.  Photographs are great. They really are. You can get context. Okay, so  you look at my illustration. You   re not going to see where it   s growing.  You   re not going to see what color it is. You   re not going to see what   s  growing with it that   s its competition. Those kinds of things can be  gleaned from photographs, and they are necessary because you really  can   t illustrate something like that because it gets lost in the amount of  detail that it would have to contain. It really does. I   ve tried. Some  people have said,    Well, can you draw a field with some of these and  some of those and some of these?    and I   m like,    Yes, I can, but the  32  Paustenbaugh  Jansen  detail is going to be sparse, because in order to include all of that, I can   t  put in the kind of detail because it   ll just black out.     So, I see the value of photographs, but as far as a teaching tool, they   re  not as good as an illustration. I think really, ultimately, the best  publication has both, so you can see it in the habitat. You see the habit of  the plant, which is actually how it   s growing in its habitat with its  competing species, whether it   s growing on a sand bank or in the bottom  of a river or on a hillside or whatever, the amount of light that it has.  Those kinds of things are interesting, and then of course seeing what  makes that plant taxonomically that plant. So, to me, that   s the best kind  of book. You know, I always tried to get Ron to put photos in. (Laughs)  Have the illustration here and a little photo here off to the corner so they  can see what color it is. Ultimately, I always wanted to   and what  breaks my heart, ultimately   the last and final thing and we can  probably end.  Before I had to quit, Ron and I were actually planning on doing a color  version of the Field Guide to Oklahoma Plants, and I   m just not going to  be able to do it. Physically, the precision that hand tipping takes is not  on par with the illustrations themselves, because I have to sit, and I have  to control the paint within those lines, and I have to have a special paper  to have those ink illustrations printed on so that I can paint them.  Imagine if you will me running it on copy paper. You put the watercolor  on there, and you get bubble, you know, and then the paint runs to the  side, and you   ve got a mess. So, I have to have them printed on special  paper in order to hand tip them, which the process for hand tipping is  arduous. So, I   m kind of bummed, but again I look at it like, well, a lot  of artists never even create two thousand pieces of work. So, the glass is  half full. I   m very pleased. (Laughs)  Well, thank you so much for spending this time.  Sure.  -------  -------
