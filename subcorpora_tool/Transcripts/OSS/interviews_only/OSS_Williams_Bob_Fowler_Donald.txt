 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Saturday, October 20, 2007 and I   m at the  ConocoPhillips OSU Alumni Center interviewing Donald Fowler and  Bobby Williams. This interview is being conducted as part of O-STATE  Stories, an Oral History project of the OSU Library. Thank you for  joining us today.  We appreciate the opportunity.  Well let   s begin. I   d like to learn a little bit about the both of you. Mr.  Williams, if you could start. Tell me where you grew up, where you are  from originally     I   m an Army brat. I was born at Fort Sill. My dad joined the Army in  1913 and retired in 1944. My brothers were all born at Fort Sill. I went  to Cameron College one year and then I hitchhiked to Oklahoma A M.  I arrived here with about a nickel in my pocket. And I got to the Field  House   the reason I came here was interesting. I enrolled at Cameron  A M, a junior college at Lawton and I used the Oklahoma A M  catalog to enroll at Cameron, but I followed their program for  graduation.  I went there one year as the athletic trainer under Lyle Yarborough. I  saw Coach Lookabaugh at the 1943 All-State game where he was  recruiting. They were playing the All-State football game at Taft  Stadium. I jumped the fence there and ran across the field and caught  him. I hadn   t seen him in five years. I saw him in 1938 when he took the  job at Oklahoma A M. I was underneath the stadium at Lawton,  Oklahoma taking care of equipment and he came up to me and he asked  me where the coach was   Coach Brian Griffin. I said,    He   s right down  5  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  the hall.    And he said,    Well I   m Coach Jim Lookabaugh.    I saw him  five years later and he called me by name. But anyway, I asked him,    Do  you need a trainer.    He said,    We might. You   ll have to come to  Stillwater and contact Coach Iba.    So, I thought,    Well that   s a  chance   opportunity.     About a month later I hitchhiked to Stillwater. I didn   t know where  Stillwater was   I had no idea. By myself. I got here and went to the  Field House and asked if Coach Iba was here. Coach Iba wasn   t there, he  was out fishing. He was on vacation. Well I had a nickel in my pocket. I  came out the east door of Gallagher Hall and there was a guy that I went  to school with at Cameron chopping goat heads  weeds with stickers  on  the end of the practice field   J.C. Colhouer. And I said,    What are you  doing up here?    He says,    I   m trying to get a scholarship.    He   s a  football player. He and I attended Cameron College together. It   s  interesting   he hadn   t played high school football. He played basketball  at Warren, Oklahoma. To make a long story short, he got a scholarship  and played guard on the football team. Don knows him. Don played with  him. But anyway, he put me up for the night. I didn   t have any money.  He bought me a hamburger and put me up for the night.  The next day Coach Iba returned. So I was sitting on the steps on the  east side of Gallagher Hall and another guy was sitting on the other side.  He had a suit on. I had a t-shirt on and jeans or Levi   s   that   s all I  owned. He went in first. I thought,    Well, there goes the job. He looks  better than me.    Anyway he finally called me into the office and he said,     What can you do?    I said,    I can do anything you   ve got to do. You just  name it.    He said,    No, what do you do in athletics?    I told him, taped  ankles and all that stuff. So he said,    Okay.    And he put both of us on.  Bob Jameson was the other boy   s name and he was from Woodward,  Bob Fenimore   s hometown. So then the season started. I was a trainer in  the training room in the afternoon for football and at night for basketball.  Jameson quit about October or November and I got the job. I was it. So I  spent the next three or four years as the trainer   athletic trainer for  Oklahoma A M. That   s my story.  Well we   re going to get back to more of that story in a second. Mr.  Fowler, tell me a little about yourself. Where are you from originally?  I was born in Tulsa in 1926. I moved to Cleveland with my parents,  obviously, in 1929. I came here in    44 on an athletic scholarship in  football. Played that year until we went to the Cotton Bowl and at the  Cotton Bowl, Uncle Sam drafted me, which was fine. And I was there  two years, came back out of the service. I was in the infantry in  Arkansas and at Fort Benning. I was not overseas at the time. I came  back. I had played ball at the end of the war. Why, the commanders at  6  each large military institution checked through the rosters to see if  anybody had ever played college football. And it made no difference     Air Corps, Navy, whatever you were in, if you   d played ball, they  wanted you to stay in because each of those guys wanted a  championship team.  Well, (Laughs) the way I wound up in the infantry was, when I was  drafted, I got my draft call in the first of December but we were going to  go to the Cotton Bowl. We   d already been told we were going to the  Cotton Bowl. So another good friend, Jim Patton, played ball and he was  from Stroud. His birthday was one day apart from mine in September.  Well we went to Coach Lookabaugh and we said,    Look we   ve got our  draft calls.    And Coach Lookabaugh said,    Don   t worry about that,  boys, I   ll take care of it.    So we didn   t worry about it. We came back  after we won and we did win (Laughs). We came back and we   d been  back four or five days and I told old Patton,    Patton let   s go down and  tell them we   re here.    And we walked in that office and there were three  of us   myself, Jim Patton and Jim Spavital.  Well Jim Spavital had gotten his draft call the first of that December. So  he didn   t have any problems when we come in with qualifying for his  choice of service. So when we went through the line we went down to  Oklahoma City on a bus. And I was seated next to a man who was 38-  years-old and manager of F.W. Woolworth Five and Dime. He had a son  who was a first lieutenant and a pilot in the Air Corps and he was being  drafted   the father was. We sat next to him on the bus. Anyhow, they  put us up in the Egbert Hotel in Oklahoma City. The next morning we  go down and they were going to run us through. So start through that  line and they asked us   well, I was ahead. I was the first one through I  guess because I was the shortest. And they asked me what I   d like. And I  said,    I think I   d like the Navy.    They said,    You   ve got the Army and  the Navy, either one.    I said,    The Navy sounds good.    And he looked  down at my papers and he said,    Why you   re delinquent.    And he      makes stamping motion  infantry on there. And Jim Patton got the same  treatment that I did. He went through and Patton was about eight inches  taller than I was and he went through and he got the same treatment     infantry. Spavital, who wasn   t delinquent, followed in and he said,    I  think I   d like the Navy.    Well they sent him to Great Lakes Naval  training.  So I was two years in there. The war ended and after Japan surrendered  that   s when they put out   all the commanders or commandants at the  different military establishments   put out the papers on who had played  college ball. Well I had been to Benning before that anyhow but I was  back in Arkansas. So I wound up in Fort Benning and I played. And half  of that team were graduates of the military academy. So anyhow, we  7  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  wound up as national service champions, we beat everybody. And the  interesting part about that was   I told you a little bit about the military.  The commandant was Iron Michael Daniel. Well after we won the first  three or four games, when we would come back, he always wanted some  military group down there, a band and everything, welcoming home the  winners of these football games. And we would fly around up there     one time we came in and generally we could land. One time we came in  and that group was not down there. He would not let   there were three  planes. There were two planes for the players and one plane for his other  officers who he would take to the games. We flew around for about an  hour waiting for that honor guard to get there, spending the good old  military   s money. Anyhow we landed and as soon as that was over, as  soon as the season was over, why they gave us gold footballs and a gold  fountain pen and said,    Thank you for being here and good bye.     I left and came back to Oklahoma A M again. And I hurt my back  when I was in the service and I was out here   I came back in January of     47. I was there through the Fall but I   d injured my back and then in the  Spring why I had problems. Then the next Fall, the Fall of    48 I hurt my  back again. So then I decided that I shouldn   t be playing ball. I  transferred over to Tulsa because my brother who   d also played ball  over there was back out of the service and going to Tulsa. So I  transferred over to the University of Tulsa and got my degree out of  there in    49. That was the extent of my time here was in    44 and then  back in    47 and then at the University of Tulsa.  Now Mr. Williams, when you were on campus working and going to  school, where did you live?  Gallagher Hall.  Now explain the set-up for me. How did that work?  At that particular time, it wasn   t like it is now. As you know they   ve  remodeled it. At that time, there was a room next to the training room  and I roomed there with Bob Kurland, Joe Halbert over the years. My  first roommates were Tom Jaquet, who was a basketball player and  Kurland. The outlay of the gym   Gallagher   was on that side was a  hallway with a bedroom and the training room. It was sort of an  apartment style thing. It was a room with a bath in there.  Kurland had those long beds, I don   t know whether you   ve heard of  them or not. He was about 6   10    or maybe 7 feet   advertised as 7 feet.  But anyway, he had the long bed. And Jaquet was about 6   3    or 4    he  had the bed in there   long bed. Well Halbert was about 6   7    or 6   8     something like that. He was from Throckmorton, Texas. Later on, why  8  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Blake Williams, a friend of mine, came up from Lawton and played  basketball on the national champions. There were two kids from Lawton  on that team   Blake Williams and Weldon Kern. But anyway, Kurland  was my roommate and Tom Jaquet that first year. Of course, I   d never  heard of Bob Kurland, being from Lawton and all that. I didn   t even  know where Stillwater was in a way   I hadn   t been out of Comanche  County. But anyway we were out there practicing football and I was out  there on the field with the teams. This big tall red-headed guy came out  there and said,    Give me the key to the room.    I said,    I don   t know you.  I   m not giving you anything.    Of course, I don   t know why I said that  because I didn   t have anything but two pair of Levi   s and t-shirts   he  couldn   t wear them anyway. Anyway, I said,    I   m not giving you a  key.    We went in and Coach Iba straightened it out and I gave him the  key to the room where we stayed.  But I can   t tell you what Oklahoma A M meant to me. Words cannot  describe it. The camaraderie of everybody up here, from the faculty on,  there   s no price   it can   t be bought. And they still have my loyalty. But,  Kurland was my roommate. In many years, we stayed here and  graduated together and Colhouer played guard and Don played guard.  To me it   s a mark of a character that played guard because he wasn   t  very big. At that time, they weren   t very big. Colhouer was a big guy at  that time. He weighed about 200 pounds I think. But that   s another story  too. Colhouer played for Cameron. We were practicing out there and I  was, again, the trainer for Lyle Yarborough at Cameron   Lyle  Yarborough is the coach. Colhouer had played basketball at Warren,  Oklahoma and he came out there and watched us practice. We were  running plays for timing in football, you have to practice. He said,    I  believe I can do that.    So we asked Coach Yarborough if he could check  out a suit. Coach Yarborough said,    Yeah.    Of course everybody was in  the Army and the Navy then. We were all on borrowed time waiting for  the draft. But anyway, Colhouer went out for football. He didn   t know  how to put his equipment on or anything else. We got him lined out and  he boxed there, he played football and boxed there for the school. Then  came up here in 1943.  But that   s sort of my story. And after I trained here and graduated, I  coached at Eastern Oklahoma A M at Wilburton, a junior college. Then  they quit football at the school there and so I moved on to Borger Texas  High School then to Lawton High School and then to Shawnee High  School, where I retired.  How did you become involved in athletic training?  At Lawton High School I had a coach by the name of Brian Griffin. He  was practicing football in 1938   or before that, 1937. And he was  9  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  practicing about a block from where I lived. I went up there and I was  picking up the footballs after practice. He thought I was trying to steal  them. But anyway, we met then, Coach Brian Griffin and myself and  another guy was there, Coach Glen Dosser who is a graduate of  Oklahoma A M. Coach Griffin, later on, I became his water boy and  that   s literally what it was   carrying 12-quart bottled water on the field.  They didn   t have all these jugs on the sidelines.  You have to realize, in football at that time   eleven guys started the  game and eleven guys played both ways. It wasn   t eleven guys coming  in or out or substituting a lot. You didn   t get to substitute unless it was a  time out or someone got hurt. But anyway, I was the water boy and he  taught me how to tape ankles and a few other things where I can help the  team, so I did. So I was the trainer there for the football and the  basketball team. Coach Dosser was the basketball coach. And then, one  of the football coaches was the track coach and I became the trainer  there taping ankles and all that. Then I went to Cameron and trained  basketball and football. Hitchhiked up there in 1943 after talking to  Coach Lookabaugh.  In 1945, I had appendicitis and they took me to the hospital, Coach  Lookabaugh did. First of all, Joe Halbert, my roommate, he walked me  across the campus into the infirmary. We got there and Coach  Lookabaugh came and Coach Iba. They took me to the hospital and took  my appendix out. They were going to play OU that week. I believe that  week we played Texas Tech too. And then later, I was in the hospital at  the time, they played OU the next week. Something like that. I was still  in the hospital. While I was in there, they brought Coach Lookabaugh   s  son in. They called him Buzz   Eddie Lookabaugh. Well his mother   he  was wanting to go to the OU game. He had pneumonia. His mother said,     No, you can   t go. You have to go to the hospital.    She told him I was  there so he agreed, he   d come. (Laughs) That was the way Oklahoma  A M was. It was family   it really was. Well, Mrs. Lookabaugh, she  brought some soup up there to Eddie and she brought me soup too. She  was taking care of me. I never shall forget it.  Mr. Fowler, was there a big sense of Bedlam back then, when you  played OU?  Oh yes, always. Always was because we beat them. (Laughs) We hurt  them greatly. Anyway, there was another Cleveland boy playing for OU  at the time. So it was   I think the score was 28 to 6.  Do you remember every win and every loss?  I do.  10  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  And every score. (Laughs)  I do. I suffered the torture of the damned when we   d lose.  How did you make the transition from being the trainer to coaching?  Well again, it was Colhouer. I was hitchhiking all over the state at that  time. I didn   t have any money, still. You don   t have much money after  you graduate. I was hitchhiking all over the state trying to find me a job.  Well you can imagine somebody 4 feet 11 trying to get a job. So I  hitchhiked up here, checked to see if anybody was looking for somebody  to help them. Colhouer was up here. He was playing for the Chicago  Cardinals. And he said,    Well Guy Gardner is hunting a coach. He just  left here about an hour ago.    I said,    Well I missed him.    So he said,     He   s coaching at Eastern A M at Wilburton.    So I thought,    Well, it   s  an opportunity.    So I found a way to get to Wilburton and Mr. President,  C.C. Dunlap hired me to help Guy Gardner coach football and basketball  at Eastern. I started baseball at Eastern while I was there to keep the kids  out of trouble. You know how athletes get in trouble if they are on their  own. I started baseball to get those guys out of the dorm so they  wouldn   t get in trouble. Of course, I kept the dorm and coached football  and basketball, all that kind of stuff. I did the taping and all that while I  was there. So that   s    Coach Gardner and Mr. Dunlap hired me at  Eastern, so that   s where I started.  Every football coach I had was a winner. Coach Lookabaugh was a  winner at Capitol Hill and he came up here was a winner. Coach Griffin  was a winner at Lawton. Coach Dosser was a winner. There was one  year   the first year I was the water boy at Lawton in 1938   well, we  were undefeated going on the end of the season and we played Hollis. It  was a    smaller    school at that time, supposedly. Perry Sedden and Don  Royal who was a brother to Darryl Royal was on the Hollis team and  they were very good players. Both of them were All-State and all that. I  later refereed for Don Royal at Tipton   Don coached at Tipton High  School. But anyway, we were 11-0 when we played Hollis and they beat  us (Laughs) so it was 11-1, winning.  I went to Cameron and they won the junior college championship. And I  went two years at Lawton High School. We were undefeated in football.  We took our licks in basketball   we were terrible but we had a couple  of good players on those teams. One of them was Weldon Kern who  came up here and played. And then Blake Williams played up here and  they were on the national champions. And Blake   s senior year they went  to the Final Four and went to the finals against Kentucky. They were  good players. Weldon Kern even played fullback on the football team.  He wasn   t very big. I   ve had a lot of good experience considering my  11  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Williams  Fowler  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  size and everything   considering athletics. And some of the guys we  had then I feel I couldn   t even get a suit today on account of the size and  everything. But that   I   ve never worried about it. To me it   s not the size  of the dog in the fight a lot of times. It   s the size of the fight in the dog.  I   ve always felt that way. I   ve always tried to impress that on my players  and my children. (Laughs)  Let   s talk a little bit about the Cotton Bowl. What was it like for you, Mr.  Fowler, to play in that game?  It was wonderful. (Laughs) It was   in the first place we really womped  them. It was 34 to   was it 34 to nothing?  Yes, I thought I was going to get to play. (Laughter)  So it was a real thrill. And the fact that we got to   I guess we owed the  fact that Coach Lookabaugh didn   t turn us in and that   s why we got to  choose the infantry. (Laughter) That   s why we went to the infantry  instead of where we wanted to go. But when we came back, they had for  us here, if you lettered, you got a suede jacket that came down midway  between your belt and your knees. It had your letter on there and inside  it had a big engraved deal that said,    Cotton Bowl Champions 1945.     And we had a little gold football from playing there and it was right after  that that we went off to play for the (Laughs)   to go to the service and  fight in the big one. But no, it was a great thrill as anything like that  would be. Now you must remember, I was a small town boy. Cleveland  is a town the size of 2,000 people. I would like to mention that one of  my grade school teachers was Jessie Thatcher who was the first woman  graduate from Oklahoma A M. And at that time, she was Jessie  Thatcher-Bost and during the war she lost her one son.  What do you remember from that game   that Cotton Bowl game?  Oh, I was expecting to play when they got ahead. (Laughter) I thought,     Boy I   ll get to play.    But there was a guy from Texas University     Andrews, I believe they called him Rooster Andrews. And he kicked  extra points. Well I could drop kick a ball. I thought,    Well he   ll let me  go out there and kick the extra point.    It never happened. Of course,  when I was in high school I thought the high school coach would let me  play. We were beating somebody 40 to nothing in high school, I thought,     Well, I   ll get to play tonight.     But the only time I ever got to play football was in the spring. Coach  Lookabaugh didn   t have enough players to practice spring football. He  scrimmaged the high school team and he let me suit up and I got to play.  And I threw a pass to Harvey Griffin and he scored a touchdown. And I  12  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  thought,    Man, alive.    (Laughs) No sweat. Then that kid later played for  OU. I threw a pass and he intercepted. And I thought,    He isn   t going to  score. He thinks he   s going to score but he   s not.    I ran out there and  grabbed him around the waist and threw my legs around his legs and he  fell on top of me and my helmet was   I was looking out the ear hole of  the helmet and all that   Mickey Mouse. (Laughs) They piled on me and  old Lookabaugh run out there, he thought I was dead, I think. The  players all ran out, got around and were throwing those high school kids  off of me like they   d killed me. But anyway, it was a wonderful time for  me. And I really liked to dance so that   s another story too.  Did you attend many dances on campus?  That was one of the siren calls to me. I was walking up to Gallagher.  Swim   s   I heard that jukebox going up there at Swim   s and I went in  there and Melba Osborne, who was the drum majorette for the band. She  was in there and man, she could dance. And we danced. So that was  another tie. I have a lot of wonderful memories.  Did you dance anywhere else on campus?  Oh, the Howdy Dance they had then   I don   t know if you   ve ever heard  of that or not. On campus, when the first freshman came in or it was the  first day of classes or something, they had a Howdy Dance. We enjoyed  that   or I did. But anytime they had the dancing going, I was ready.  What type of music did you listen to back then?  Glen Miller.  And you sir?  Oh, the same. Music has never been the same since the    40s. You all are  much too young to understand how good it was in the    40s and poor old  Glen Miller went down in his plane going across the English Channel to  France. So we lost all of Glen Miller   s good stuff. But all of the music in  those days was excellent. What there is out there now   people in my era  wouldn   t give a flip for, they wouldn   t even listen to it. And, right on     I   m one of those folks. Those were great days.  Did a lot of the football players and other athletes get together to go to  dances?  Jimmy Spavital was a good dancer. Jimmy Palmer   both of them  fullbacks, had a lot of rhythm. Of course, Cameron is like that. They had  a shop across the street. A great big old man named Barker. He weighed  13  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Fowler  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  about 300 pounds and ran that shop there at Cameron. They had a little  old dance floor out there about as big as Swim   s had. But Leslie Swim  and his family go back a long ways. Their dad loaned a lot of money to  kids in the    30s to go the Oklahoma A M and every kid came back and  paid him off   every kid that graduated came back and paid him off. But  I remember the Swim family. They were excellent for Oklahoma A M  kids.  Did you visit any other places off campus to hang out   outside of  Swim   s?  Not me. There wasn   t any way to get there, nobody had cars. You had  to walk everywhere.  Most of the people came down here just as I did. You came by your  thumb. I came here with one suitcase.  Most of the guys we had, that   s   of course J.L. Parks and Bill Walker     Walker played on the football team and Parks played on the basketball  team and Joe Thomas played on the football team. They came up by  train from Pauls Valley  Oklahoma  and when they got here they  reported and Coach Lookabaugh put football pads on J.L. Parks who  was a basketball player. He sent Parks out to the football field for Coach  Baker to check out to see if he could play. Well Parks got out there and  he didn   t know straight up from sick    em about football. He was from  Payola  Oklahoma . Coach Iba came out and he said,    What are you  doing out here?    The secretary had sent him a football letter, but Coach  Baker asked him   he said,    What did you play in high school?    He said,     Guard.    He   d been a guard in basketball. So he was out there on the  seven man sled and all that stuff.  Did he make the team? (Laughter)  No. Coach Iba ran him off the football field.  Now you trained for football, basketball     Basketball, wrestling and track.  What was your favorite?  Football.  Football?  Probably.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Fowler  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  What   s your favorite football memory?  Oh they were all good. I didn   t have bad memories. I guess the Sugar  Bowl and the Cotton Bowl were the best memories. It and the Tulsa  game of 1945, I guess it was.     44.  Okay. The reason it was, was because my dad   we had eaten lunch, a  pre-game lunch. Coach Lookabaugh sent us around the block to walk it  off. We were walking down the street, down there I believe east of the  Mays Hotel and my dad was behind us. I didn   t know that. I didn   t even  know he was in town. My dad was in the Army 31 years. He had stripes  that he   d served, service stripes on his arm. He was a Master Sergeant  and all that. But anyway, Joe Shunkamolah who was a guard or tackle,  he said,    Hello, Sarge.    And I turned around and it was my dad. I said,     What are you doing here?    Coach Lookabaugh put him on the bus and  took him to the ball game.  Wow.  Fed him lunch and put him on the bus and took him to the ball game. I   ll  tell you, they had a good staff. Coach Lookabaugh   they had three  coaches   Coach Lookabaugh, Coach Baker and Toby Green. They were  fine people.  What was it like working with Coach Iba?  Great. I can   t tell you what he meant to the team   and disciplined, very  highly disciplined. When they put    Mister    on his name it had some  value. It wasn   t just a title   it was respect all right. It was earned, very  valuable. My experience   one experience was one night we were  practicing and time was sort of nebulous to him. I was standing there  and he said,    What time is it?    I said,    Oh about ten o   clock.    He said,     I didn   t ask you    about,    I asked you what time it was.    Whew. Man I  went out there in the hall to find out what time it was because I didn   t  have a watch. I came back and told him the right time. I never forgot it.  He was in a class by himself. I can   t tell you the knowledge he gave in  basketball. These people today, they owe him a lot. And they don   t  know it, they really don   t. His value to me was integrity   compete and  don   t leave anything to chance. You don   t make a bunch of mistakes and  beat yourself. That is sort of like life to me. You don   t beat yourself.  You don   t become a drunk   you don   t become a drug addict or anything  like that. You straighten up and fly right.  15  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Was it hard going to school and training at the same time?  Not to me it wasn   t.  What was your major?  Physical education.  And your master   s degree? The same?  It was in counseling.  And where did you take some of your classes? What buildings on  campus?  History and physical education.  Did you spend much time in the Library at that time?  No, I didn   t. That was a negligent on my part. I didn   t impress that on  my children. They got that on their own.  Mr. Fowler, what is your favorite football memory?  When we beat Tulsa 44 to 40 because Tulsa at that time   s coach was  Henry Franka. As I mentioned earlier my brother had a scholarship  down there to play for Tulsa. My brother was much larger than I was.  Anyhow, Tulsa, the year before in    43, just womped up   well they  womped up on anybody. And they went to a bowl game every year and  they won every year and they didn   t give us a chance. They thought they  could, this year   s team, they would just run all over us. I have one very  vivid memory. When we were getting ready to go out on the field and I  had to go in to relieve myself at the urinal. I was standing there and they  had a great big tackler. He was about 12 to 14 inches taller than I was  and outweighed me by at least 75 pounds. And he was an All-American  and he kind of patted me on the head and said,    Well I hope you boys do  all right today.    And the name of the guy was Glen Vurgis and I will  never forget that.  When we played Tulsa we had a play   well, we had Fenimore, Hankins,  Armstrong   we had great guys back there. Cecil Hankins was the  greatest athlete I   ve ever known. He is the only athlete I   ve ever known  that played professionally both football and basketball. And he did them  both. He could do anything. Fenimore and Hankins and Armstrong   it  was a battle right down to the bloody end. And then Tulsa couldn   t  believe that they had lost. And that   s when we got the bid to go to the  16  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Cotton Bowl. Of course, Tulsa had gone to bowls every year. Henry  Franka who coached over there had done an outstanding job. But that  was my favorite memory of it all. It was nice to beat OU and all but  when we beat Tulsa after they womped on us the year before, it was just,  they couldn   t believe it.  Tell me about the walkout. When a big game   after we won a big game,  students would have walkout the next day. How did the athletes feel  about walkouts?  I don   t remember any walkouts. Listen, they came by. There wasn   t any  of this business of not making your grades. They would come by at least  once a month to check to see how you were standing in your class. And  there was no such thing as a walkout. The scholarship that you had at  that time was room, board, books and tuition and you got 15 dollars a  month and that was it. But out of season you had to work for it. You  either worked sweeping up the gym, goosing grass and you had to do  that all the time out of season. It was a totally different era than it is     than it has been since. And it was a lot more fun, it really was.  In the    30s the job the players had was to plant trees out here on the  campus. All the trees on the campus were planted by a football player.  Wow.  In the    30s    that was their job. These guys cleaned the restrooms in  Gallagher. Kurland swept the floor. Halbert and me and Jaquet, we  locked the gym up at night so somebody couldn   t go in there and tear it  up. Of course Coach Iba was very protective of the court. You didn   t  walk on there with your shoes on or anything. At the end of the year,  they had a dance in there. But whoever had the dance re-did the floor.  Sanded it and recovered it   or re-varnished it.  And nowadays you see, when somebody wins a big game, the fans rush  the court. Back then I take it that was a big no-no.  When we won the national basketball championship in basketball, I was  on the   what do you call it? The Student Union or the Student Council.  I was representing the School of Education. We asked President Bennett  to let us have a walkout the next day. He did. So that   s the only walkout  I can ever remember.  What other activities were you involved with outside of the Student  Senate?  Student council, I was on that one year I think. I was an SAE  Sigma  17  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Fowler  Williams  Fowler  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Alpha Epsilon  but I was never one for that much partying around.  When I was a pledge, they said,    Pick up cigarette butts.    And I said,    I  don   t even smoke, so I   m not picking up anybody   s cigarette butts.    So I  didn   t. (Laughs)  Mr. Fowler, were you involved in any groups on campus?  No.  What was your major while you were here?  When I was here?  Yes.  It was in commerce.  And when you graduated from the University of Tulsa?  It was business, business management.  Colhouer became a civil engineer later on   sort of the history of this  team. And he built the silos in Washington for those missiles. He was a  civil engineer and he worked in Portland, Oregon. He died in Lake  Oswego Hospital, but anyway. He was a civil engineer and came back  for a reunion one year and a guy said,    I heard you made a lot of  money.    And he said,    If you mean I moved a lot of dirt, you   re right.     (Laughs)  Do you guys keep in touch with everybody from those days?  Yes.  We have.  Yeah we   call him a lot of times, I do anyway.  There aren   t many of us left.  Neill Armstrong, I call him. And I call Colhouer   s wife every once in a  while. I call Fenimore, keep in contact with him. Kurland, I call him  sometimes and check on him. Make sure he   s behaving. (Laughs)  Is that important for you still to do? To keep in touch?  Yes it is, to me anyway.  18  Fowler  Williams  Fowler  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  We started having reunions every five years in   what was it Bob, about     55?  Something like that.  And then we had it every five years. Then we got down to four and then  three and now we   re down to two. We didn   t have one this year   I  mean, not   we   re down to two years so that we can   there   s not very  many of us left. I   ve told Bob before, another year or two and a card  table will take care of everybody. (Laughs) And that   s the truth. That   s  just the way it is. They   ve all faded out.  We are pretty close, no kidding. I can   t describe to you the closeness of  the players as sort of a family.  Well what is it about Oklahoma State that sparks such loyalty in its  students and alumni?  I think it   s the    camaraderie might not be the word. But I think care of  the institution for the student. Dr. Bennett, to me, exemplified this. Dr.  Willham exemplified it. My children came up here. My youngest  daughter, she thought a lot of Dr. Kamm. It   s something that comes  down.  Did all of your children attend Oklahoma State?  Three of them came. Two of them graduated. One of them went to the  University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, graduated and is an English  teacher. One of them  David M. Williams  graduated with a degree in  computer science and as a commissioned officer in ROTC. My youngest  daughter  Abbe Lynn Riggin  graduated from here  with a degree in  physical education  and my grandson  Zachary Robert Riggin  went  here.  Both Abbe and Zachary married OSU grads  My youngest boy   Bobby Ray Williams  went here  and worked as a student manager for  basketball  but he didn   t graduate from here.  Bobby Ray graduated  from Langston University   Mr. Fowler, what is it about Oklahoma State that you think sparks such  loyalty in students and alumni?  I think, you may think this is advice, but things were so different back  then than they are now. There is no comparison with what was there  then and what is here now. I   m not talking just about Oklahoma A M.  I   m talking about any other university or college in this country or what  goes on outside of them. They were just different times. You   ve got to  remember that the    30s was a depression. The    30s was a horrible  19  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  drought. People don   t understand what that was like. This generation  certainly doesn   t have any idea. You no more had a campus rebellion or  anything   you just didn   t have it. And you would no more have  anybody say,    Our people shouldn   t be in Iraq,    than anything. If you  condemned World War II, you would get punched out immediately.  People wouldn   t put up with that. And it   s a totally different society.  I think A M does   Oklahoma A M does a fine job. I think the  University of Tulsa does a fine job. I wouldn   t give you a nickel for  Harvard or any of the California folks out there because I don   t believe  in that type of lifestyle. I wouldn   t send my children to a place like that,  or my grandchildren for any amount of money. I don   t mean to political,  but when you ask,    What makes it different?    You just can   t compare.  There   s just   no compare.  And did your children attend OSU?  No, they went to OU. We lived in Norman at the time, when they  became college aged. I have a son that is a heart surgeon, he went to OU  and on to the med school and that   s what he does. He operates.  Well, as we get ready to end this interview, I   d like you both to share one  of your favorite stories or favorite memories of your time here at  Oklahoma A M. Mr. Williams?  They are all good to me. I have so many good ones, I can   t single out  one.  Well you can say a few if you like.  Really?  Oh, sure, sure.  I guess the greatest memory is when I was accepted by Coach Henry Iba  to be the student trainer. I ended up being the trainer. The memory I  have of that time was the respect with which I was treated. And one of  the fondest memories I have is when my mother came up here one time  and Coach Iba had never seen her but one time in his life. And he called  her by name. He had a tremendous memory   tremendous. That  affiliation with those coaches and their care for their players. Of course,  Coach Lookabaugh, you had to be pretty tough to play because a lot of  times you would have heard him say,       that   s a long way from your  heart. (Laughing) Keep going.    But they were good to me.  What was graduation day like?  20  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Fowler  Oh, I finally got to the end of the road where I could maybe get a job  and take the load off my parents.  Did you attend commencement in the arena?  Yes, we were in Gallagher at the time. They had it in Gallagher. It   s a  wonderful feeling that I   d accomplished something, yes.  Did your parents come and attend?  No, my mother was sick at the time. She had emphysema so it was a  pretty tough time.  And did you meet your wife here?  No, she and I went to high school together. She was my best girl in high  school and I came up here and the grass was greener for a while. I was  busy dancing and all of that so we sort of parted for a while and then got  back together when I went back to Lawton to coach.  And how long have you been married?  Since     Not to put you on the spot.  About 53, 54 years. No, about 53 years.  All right Mr. Fowler. What is your best, favorite story from your OAMC  years?  Well, it goes back (Laughs) to when I first came down here. We came  down and as soon as we came down, because we came down in the  summer, in June, right after school was out and they started practice.  And we practiced all summer and it came time for the All-State game  and a number of us were honored enough to get to go play in the All-  State game. And we played in Taft Stadium (Laughs) and spent the  night, a couple of nights, in Taft Stadium. You have to remember in  those days, nobody had any money. You slept on camp cots in there just  wherever you could put everybody. It was divided up into north versus  south. There were a number of us on the team that made All-State so we  all participated in that game. And after the game   and it rained.  Here we   d been practicing all summer and it had been a hot, terribly hot  summer and it started raining after the game. And Coach Green, you   d  have to appreciate, he wasn   t much bigger than Bob Williams and he  21  was the line coach and tougher than a boot. He came in after that game  and we   re in there cleaning up and getting ready to leave and spend  another night there on those camp cots. And he said,    Practice starts  tomorrow.    Well we   d just been practicing all summer and had just gone  down and practiced for that All-State game for a couple of weeks. And  then we played the game and old Coach Green comes up and says,     Practice starts tomorrow.    (Laughs)  Well, we didn   t have any way of getting   we didn   t have cars and if you  did, there wasn   t any gas at that time. You were limited to five gallons a  week on a car, if you had a car. Well, Jim Patton   a big tall guy that I  was telling you about   he and I were drafted at the same time. We were  hitchhiking our way up here and we had a terrible time getting a ride.  Nobody would pick us up. Bill Walker was with us and nobody would  pick us up. And so we didn   t get in   they   d already, by the time we got  up here, they   d already been practicing. (Laughs) Patton was a runner  and he was a fast runner .The first time I ever saw him was at the state  track meet that year and he won the mile. Of course he was 6-foot-4 and  red-headed. Here we are thumbing our way up here and it takes us   we  make it to Guthrie after a couple of hours. Walker and I were starving to  death and old Patton says,    I know a place where we can eat.    Well we  went   he had to duck his head to get in this place   to get a hamburger.  And in those days, hamburgers were only a nickel and a dime. Anyhow,  we had a hamburger and we go out and started thumbing. And by the  time we get up here, we go up to Gallagher Hall and go to go tell them  we were here and we look out there and they   ve already   everybody has  practiced but we haven   t been there.  We start walking out that east door and Mr. Iba is sitting out there with  his suit on and he looks up and says,    You boys are a little late aren   t  you?    And we said,    Yes, sir,    because it was always,    Yes sir, Mr.  Iba.    And he said,    Well you better go tell coach you   re here.    We  walked out there to tell coach we are there and he is giving everybody a  lecture. And Toby Green comes up and he didn   t ask any questions. He  said,    Get your suits on.    Well here   s the three of us and by the time we  go to get our suits on, everybody else is running in and we had to start  running around the practice field out there. And we ran and we ran and  after about three laps around the practice field, old Patton collapsed in a  pile of vomit and Walker and I had to haul him in because he had just  run his guts out. Now you may ask why I   m telling you this story. But  the story is, the times were different and it was a lot of discipline. When  they told you to do something, they expected you to do it. And there  weren   t three finer folks than the coaches that we had at that time.  And I was just especially fond of Toby Green because he was the line  coach. (Laughs) Another good example   he was trying, before we went  22  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  over to play Tulsa, he had the linemen out. Well, in the first place the  linemen had what they called separators. The separators were four posts  and you   d line up and you   d be on offense and on defense and they   d  snap the ball. And you had to run over that guy, either blocking him or  trying to get through him because they were separators. That separated  the men from the boys. And Toby Green made us do that every day, the  linemen. And the ends and the backs were right there throwing passes  and doing all this other stuff, not getting bumped up at all. So (Laughs)  when we were getting ready to play Tulsa and Toby Green was giving us  a lecture, the linemen   he was also the baseball coach. And I never will  forget this. He was a little old banded legged guy and he was really he  was full of vinegar and venom and he said,    You guys wouldn   t step on  a man   s face if he was on the ground. But I would.    (Laughs) And he  took that old baseball cleat and just dug it in the ground. Well that   s  when I knew that they meant business.  I   m sure you understand this didn   t have anything to do   but the times  were totally different so it   s hard to compare what was going on then  and what is going on now. And those are things I   ll never forget.  Of course, one time I was down there at practice and they were having a  hard time getting somebody to catch the punts. I had a lot of aptitude in  that regard so Coach Lookabaugh said,    Go down there and catch the  punts.    So I went down to catch the punts, whoever was kicking I don   t  remember. But anyway they were short, it hit the ground and bounced  and rolled up there and rolled dead. And I went up there and I just ran up  there and was going to pick it up. A guy named Hutchison from  Sherman, Texas, he was the center. He come a-barreling into me and just  turned me upside down. Knocked me out and I was laying there like a  dead dog. (Laughs) Coach Lookabaugh thought he had killed me. But  that was a memorable time.  Makes you want to be a punt returner.  Yeah, but anyway, it was just interesting for me.  Well is there anything else you guys would like to share that I have not  asked you about today that you want to tell us?  Oh, I   m trying to think but   I worry about today, about the athletes  because what was given to us seems like it   s gone under by boards, gone  by the wayside. I want to win   don   t misunderstand me   but I don   t  want to cheat to win. I don   t want my teams to cheat to win. I want them  to come out there and win and do it right. And when they leave this  school, they   ll be loyal to it and they   ll receive from it what I received  from the coaching staff. I don   t know. It bothers me that the premium is  23  Nykolaiszyn  placed on the winning. And I understand today you have to win, you  have to win or they fire the coach. Well, the coach isn   t playing the  game, it   s the players. They have got to decide   it   s the fight in the dog,  not the dog in the fight.  And of course, we had a reunion and I was sitting up there with  Colhouer, I think it was when Pat Jones was here. He was really upset.  He said,    Look at them fat guys out there. They   re not in shape.    That   s  the way I thought. They   re not, they   re not in shape. They   ll poop out in  the fourth quarter and sure enough they did. (Laughs) But that was  Colhouer. He come up the hard way, he come up the cotton patch from  southwestern Oklahoma and he didn   t go for that loafing around. Don  talking about the separators, you got in the separator with him, you had  better be ready. He loved to hit you with his fists or something else.  Anything he could hit you with, he didn   t like to lose.  It is a close bunch   coaches, players, and the school. The school really  cared, to me. Dr. Willham, I think when he became president, he did not  want the legislature or anybody else to increase the fees or whatever it  is, so much that a kid couldn   t go to school here. We had great  presidents when we were here. I   m not kidding you. Maybe they weren   t  political, but they were good presidents. Dr. Bennett tried to do  something for the nation when he put the Point Four Program in. He  tried to help Ethiopia and those places. But he   s invaluable in our lives,  I   ll tell you. Money can   t buy it. I thank you for this opportunity to  uphold this school.  Well we appreciate it, sharing your stories today. It really means a lot to  us. Thank you again for taking time out.  -------  -------
