 Paustenbaugh  Mackey  It is Saturday, October 21, 2006, and my name is Jennifer Paustenbaugh  from the OSU Library, and I   m meeting with Mr. Ralf Mackey. He is a  member of the Class of 1948, and it   s about noon. We   re here in the  ConocoPhillips Alumni Center on the OSU campus, and Mr. Mackey  has agreed to be interviewed for our O-STATE Stories Project, and  we   re really grateful for his participation in this. We asked you to fill out  a questionnaire when you first came in and so   you currently live in  Midwest City?  Yes.  Okay, and it says that the name of your wife is Helen?  Yes.  And is she still living?  Yes.  Is she here with you today?  Yes.  Okay, but she didn   t want to be interviewed?  Yes, a little reluctant.  Okay. Well, you know what, that   s interesting because we   re finding  that     Really, she doesn   t know I   m here. (Laughs)  5  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Oh, okay. (Laughter) Well, this will be a surprise for her when we send  you the DVD in the mail of the interview. And it indicates on here that  you attend all sporting events at OSU?  Right.  You have season football, basketball     And basketball, wrestling   everything.  That   s great. So you come to Stillwater then multiple times a week?  Since I graduated, I   ve missed very, very few.  That   s really great. So, as a student, I take it that you went to all of those  events     No.  No?  When I was a student, I was working, you know, and we   d get up in the  morning at 4:00am and my friend and I would work at Aggie Halls a  couple of hours and after that we were getting our meals     Okay.     and in the afternoon, I worked over at Cordell Hall. That   s when the  Navy had Cordell Hall tied up, and we did janitorial work there in the  afternoon.  When did you have time to go to class?  (Laughs) Well, it   s a long story. (Laughs) Do you want me to tell you  how I got started?  That would be great.  I graduated in 1942 from Checotah High School. I had a friend, Preston  Kendall. Both of us were just seventeen years old. At that time, we  couldn   t find any kind of employment in that small town, so we decided,  well, we would try to go to the wheat harvest in Kansas and after three  days of hitchhiking, we got nine miles north of Stillwater when a  gentleman came along and picked us up, and we drove toward Wichita.  He started visiting with us, asking us questions   where we were from,  where we were going. And he knew people from Checotah High and we  6  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  talked about them. After about twenty to thirty minutes, he said,    Why  don   t you boys go to college?    We both answered,    Well, we   d love to  but we really don   t have the money   in fact we don   t have probably the  next meal, and he kept talking and after about five minutes he said,    If  you had an opportunity to go to college and I   d get you a place to stay,  get you enrolled, get you a part-time job, would you go to college?     Who was this man?  So, well   I   ll tell you in a minute.  Okay.  (Laughs) We told him,    Yes, we would.    So he immediately just turned  around and headed back toward Stillwater. And he got us a place, a one-room  efficiency which was over the cleaners here on Knoblock   and he  paid the first two months, or first two weeks rent. He took us over to the  administration and got us enrolled. He told the girl there,    These boys  want to go to college. They don   t have money for tuition. They   re going  to get a part-time job. At the end of the semester, they   ll come by and  pay you. Now if they don   t, here   s my phone number. Just send me the  bill.    And he would come by   he got us a part-time job at Aggie Hall     that   s when Clay Potts was there and we, like I said, we   d work two  hours in the morning and for that we would receive our meals, and in the  afternoon, we worked at Cordell Hall doing janitorial work, and the  times that we   d get to watch a football game was just when we   d run  over to the window and look out        out of Cordell Hall    (Laughs)     until we   d get caught (Laughs) and have to go back to work. Well this  gentleman   s name is Dr. Melvin Jones     Oh, my gosh.     who was an Agronomy Professor, 24 years old, who had polio when  he was young, and he wasn   t   but due to that he, you know, couldn   t go  to military service, so this was his way of helping someone get started in  school. He would come by once a week, check and make sure we, you  know, we were doing our school work and if we needed anything. And  that was summer. We started with the August intercession and we stayed  in school. When we both got to our eighteenth birthday, we went to the  draft board here and found out that we were going to be drafted the  minute we turned eighteen, so we decided, well, we   ll volunteer for the  Air Force Cadet Program which you   if you had a year of college at that  time, you could volunteer for it. So we both hitchhiked to Tinker Field.  7  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  We took all the physical and mental tests, but he  Preston  failed because  he was color blind     Oh.     so he  Preston  volunteered and went on to the Marines and I went  into the Air Force.  Was that the Air Force or the Army Air Corps?  Yes, Army Air Corps at that time.  Okay, right.  I went into their cadet program and I graduated from pilot or from  bombardier school in 1943 and I was assigned to a B-17 crew in Europe.  Flew twenty-seven missions in Europe and over Germany and, at the  end of the war, I returned to Oklahoma State. Well, when we got ready  to leave we went over to Dr. Jones    office and told him that we were  fixing to get drafted and we wanted to volunteer. It was a week before  the finals, and he took us over to the Dean   s Office and explained to the  Dean what we wanted to do   we wanted to withdraw and volunteer so  we wouldn   t be drafted. And he and Dr. Jones both told us,    We   ll take  care of your grades with professors, that they   ll grade you over what  you   ve done up to this point, if you both agree that when you return  from the service you   ll come back to Oklahoma State.    So we both  agreed that we would come back to Oklahoma State. In 1946, we both  returned to Oklahoma State and, at that time, I got married to my wife,  Helen, and she worked at the Vocational Agriculture Department and  with the GI Bill, I was able to finish my B.S. degree. And Preston also  finished his B.S. degree     That   s a great story.  In 1951, I got recalled     So you went to Korea?     to the Korean War and, at that time I decided, you know, I wanted to  be a pilot. I went to pilot training and when I graduated from pilot  training I went into the Air Defense Command flying jets. But without  Dr. Jones stopping, heading us in the right direction   if we could have  ever got to wheat harvest, chances are we probably would have never     It changed your whole life.  8  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey     and my wife, like I said, she worked and I finished school. I have a  son that went here. I have two daughters that graduated from here. I have  two son-in-laws that graduated from here. I have two grandsons that  graduated. I have two, a granddaughter and a grandson here now that  will be graduating next year     That is wonderful. What a remarkable story.     but like I say without Dr. Jones stopping and heading us in the right  direction   and I found out later that Dr. Jones did this to several people.  And I don   t know whether you know Dr. Jones and his wife, Mary     Mary, yes.     they are wonderful people.  Yes, they are. Their grandson just graduated from here this past May     Did he?  Yes, a very fine young man. Wow, just like divine intervention. (Laughs)  Well by stopping, like I said, he headed a lot of people toward  Oklahoma State. (Laughs) And Preston, he graduated. His brother  graduated, and his two sons graduated from here.  So for both of you, it really altered the course of things. Now how did  you meet your wife, Helen?  Well, she was from Checotah High   moved there from Texas her senior  year. When I graduated from pilot training, I went home on leave and  my cousin had told me,    I have someone I   d like to take you down to the  drugstore to meet.    She was in there jerking sodas at the drug store.  (Laughs) So that   s how I met my wife and after, you know, getting  acquainted and everything over a period of about a year   we got  married.  Now when you were in Europe, where were you based out of?  I was based in England and we flew out of England into Germany. I flew  twenty-seven missions into Germany. I was on a crew of eleven.  Did all eleven of you come back?  Well, on our twentieth mission I flew with these boys and I went to a  briefing on the twenty-first mission and the target was Munich. And  9  after briefing, this gentleman came up to me that was a captain. He said,     I need a favor.    I said,    Sure.    I knew he was a captain and I said,     How can I help you?    He said,    I got a telegram from the States and  my mother is deathly ill and not expected to live. I   ve flown thirty-four  missions. I have to fly thirty-five to finish my tour. If I can finish my  tour, I won   t have to go to Japan when I get back to the States. Would  you let me fly with your crew and let me finish my mission?    I said,     Sure. Just go check it with the squadron commander and get it okayed.     He went to the squadron commander and he said,    Fine.     I went back to the mess hall and sat there drinking coffee. This was  about 6:00. After about fifteen minutes, here comes an AP in and said,     Grab your parachute.    He said,    One of the bombardiers on the other  crew is sick and we need a replacement.    So he ran me out to the end of  the runway. I climbed aboard with this crew, and my crew was flying in  the upper echelon. We were flying in the lower echelon, and on the way  over I would have conversation back and forth between my old crew  and, you know, flying with the new crew. About ten to fifteen miles  outside of Munich, just as we were getting ready to turn onto the bomb  run. We were at 28,000 feet and all at once I heard the engineer call out,     Two planes going down.    I glanced up just in time to see the airplane  that my old crew was in   the wings severed from the fuselage and a big  ball of fire and it started spinning, and I told the co-pilot, I said,    Count  parachutes.     We counted three parachutes, and I didn   t have any correspondence     Red Cross   everything that I would write home about I had to have  censored because they didn   t know the status of what happened to the  crew so I couldn   t write home and, you know, try to tell anybody  because I didn   t know. I didn   t want to alarm anybody. I didn   t know  until I got back to the States the status of what happened to any of them,  but I went ahead and I got assigned to another crew and that   s when I  flew the rest of my missions until the end of the war. When I got back to  the States, I started calling and found the father of one of the crew  members and found that out of the eleven, four of them were killed,  seven of them was POWs. The boy that took my place survived. He was  a POW. I had no knowledge of where he was from because the records  that were on the airplane were destroyed. Now every year we have a  reunion in this bomb group, and every year when I   d go, I looked for  that name, and after about five times going to this reunion, I looked  down and there was the name of the boy that took my place. So I hunted  him up and I started talking to him and I told him, I said,    You don   t  know who I am, but I   m gonna refresh your memory on something  (Laughs) and you are going (Laughs) to go through the ceiling.    So I  told him, I said,    I am the one that you took my place when you were  shot down.    (Laughs) And he let out a (Laughs) string of cuss words that  10  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  you could   ve heard for   he said,    You   re the one.    (Laughs)  So did he make it home?  He made it home.  But was his Mother already passed away by the time he got home?  Yes, his Mother had passed away. But I have one crew member, the ball  turret gunner that   s still living and myself. We are the only two that   s  still living from the original crew. Now I don   t know whether you know  how on a B-17 the ball turret gunner hangs underneath the airplane     Oh, okay. Right.     and it rotates in a ball with hydraulic pressure. There   s only one way  in it. You   ve got a little trap door. You get in it and you pull the trap  door down and lock it. Now, there   s not enough room for you to have a  parachute. You have to leave a parachute   a chest parachute up in the  airplane with a riser that you can hook on, you know, to your harness.  When they got hit, he said that he saw the ball of fire and he knew  immediately,    I   ve got to get out of here.    But he had no hydraulic  pressure and he couldn   t rotate the ball turret up        to get up        to get out. So with a hand crank, he hand-cranked that ball turret up to  where he could reach up and get that parachute, pulled it down, locked it  on one side of his harness, rotated it back down and fell out backwards,  and he landed on a small building. He said,    When I landed, I landed  sideways because I was coming down sideways,    and he said,    I could  tell immediately, you know, that I broke my back.    And he said,    The  civilians, if they could have got to me, they would have killed me.    But  he said,    After about fifteen minutes, a couple of soldiers came up, run  all the civilians off, got me down, took me to a hospital.    He said,    Had  I not known that I was in a German hospital, I would have thought I was  in an American hospital. Everybody spoke English. You would have not  known that you were in a German hospital.    And he said,    From there, I  was taken to a concentration camp and at the end of the war, I flew and  we picked up prisoners, and the first load of prisoners were Belgian  prisoners which you couldn   t convince them that we weren   t taking  them to another concentration camp. There was no way that you could  convince any of them that we were, you know, liberating them. The  second time we picked up American prisoners and, of course, we could  correspond with them.     11  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Right.  But     You are indeed a lucky man.  (Laughs) Well, without Dr. Jones, like I said, stopping   he changed not  only my life but Preston   s life and everybody hereafter.  That   s right. That   s a really remarkable story. So, when you went to  school here, you couldn   t afford to go to the sporting events, but you   ve  made up for that big time since leaving the University, and I want to talk  to you a little bit more about that, but when you came back here, did you  live in Vet Village?  Well, we had a small apartment. You know where Swim   s is?  Where it was?  Where it was   and about three blocks we had a small   it was a big  duplex there   four apartments and Bob Kurland lived in one, Bob  Rogers, a football player or basketball player   lived in the other.  Weldin Kern lived in one, and we lived in the other, so (Laughs) I had a  lot of fun, you know. It had a little window there, had one restroom for  the four, and my wife and I had a lot of fun. After a basketball game,  they   d come over and, you know, start partying, and we   d open up the  little door and said,    You boys better be quiet.    Said,    Mr. Iba   s  coming.    (Laughs) So we had a lot of fun with them.  So when you came back to school here it was in 1946     1946.     so had they already won the second national championship in  basketball at that point or     Well, now, they were   let   s see   yeah, they had won that, yes, and I  think they had won the Sugar Bowl.  Right.  And I remember going to the game where Bob Fenimore got hurt. I was  at that game, and that   s when all the GIs came back. That   s when they  were playing Arkansas, and I remember (Laughs) I guess they   a little  bit of resentment sometimes between the GIs returning and Bob  Fenimore since he didn   t go to the service, and I remember that he got  12  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  up in the huddle and the story is that he says,    I don   t care whether you  block or not, just get out of my way.    (Laughs) But, no there are very,  very few that I   ve ever missed since then.  That   s great. So did you maintain any kind of contact with Bob Kurland  after he left OSU?  Oh yeah. I have seen him at all the functions and with Bob Rogers, you  know. And every time they have a reunion, I always come and visit with  them.  He still lives in Florida, doesn   t he?  Yes.  That   s what I thought. Now when you were a student here, of course,  they had Homecoming celebrations, but it wasn   t quite like it is today.  What do you remember about Homecoming when you were a student  here?  It wasn   t near what it is today, but they still had a lot of   the fraternities  and sororities had a lot of things going on. And I remember one with  Arkansas when they had one of the Homecomings, I believe they had the  pig out (Laughs) in the lawn and everything, you know. They had a guy  with a microphone hollering,    Sooey pig.    (Laughter) But when I came  back, you know, there weren   t any automobiles     Right.     and there just wasn   t any. I think the first car my wife and I had was  after we got out of school, but most people, like I said, walked or  bicycled. I always told everybody, especially my kids, Oklahoma State  is a school that anybody can go to. You don   t have to have money, and  it   s the friendliest place that you can go to. You can always get a job     part-time job, and you don   t need a lot of money. You just need to make  up your mind that when you get there, you   re gonna make the best of it  and graduate.  So now what did you end up getting your degree in?  Dairy engineering     Okay.     and I worked fifteen years in the dairy industry and I was district  manager over a territory and   how I got into the vending part of it, my  13  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  wife was working for a vending company on Tinker Field. The vending  company sold and John Jarmin   I don   t know whether you remember  that ex-senator   and the gentleman, businessman, got the contract for  vending on Tinker Field, and     That   s a big contract      Big contract. (Laughs) Over 700 machines. So one day I got a call from  John Jarmin who was the senator, and he said,    I   d like to have lunch  with you.    So I couldn   t imagine why John Jarmin would want to have  lunch with me, so we had lunch and he said,    So we   ve got this contract  on Tinker Field, but we need somebody to run it.    I said, (Laughs)    Mr.  Jarmin, I don   t know anything about vending. My experience is in the  dairy industry.    He said,    Well, I   ve talked to several people and they  say that you can organize routes, do the purchasing and are good at  management. Everybody that I   ve talked to says you   re the man.    I said,     Well, (Laughs) I   m gonna have to think about it.    So after a couple of  weeks he called me again, and I had lunch with him and so he said,     You   ve got to take this job.    (Laughs) He said,    I   ve talked to several  people and they   ve said you   re the man for the job.    So I said,    Fine, I   ll  take it, but you   re gonna have to bear with me.     We kept the contract there for fifteen years, and then one day Mr. Jarmin  called me and he said,    We   ve got an opportunity to sell the company to  the government. They want to go into business, you know, themselves  rather than contracting it out.    And I said,    Fine.    So he wanted me to  get all of the information together and he and I would go to Washington  and present the proposal to   there were two generals and two civilians.  So I went over all the stuff with them and everything. They asked  questions. And so about a week later Mr. Jarmin called me and says,     They took up our proposal and will buy the company.    And he says,     We had one route outside of Tinker Field.    He said,    Now on that one  route outside of Tinker Field,      I think we had around 40 machines   he  said,    I want to give that route to you for helping us, you know, with this  sale and your loyalty for fifteen years.    So that   s how I got started in the  vending business and sold my company. At the time I sold it, I had over  around 700 machines on location, and I was doing business with  Oklahoma State, OU   it was hard doing business with OU (Laughs)  but   and so that   s when I sold my company.  Well, that   s an interesting way to get into a business. So when you were  in the dairy industry, were you on the production end of   post  production     Production and sales. I started out in production. Jobs were hard to find  when I got out of school. There just wasn   t any     14  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  And there were so many graduates with the GI Bill     There just weren   t any. So when I got a call from Dr. Olson, who was  the dairy foreman   head of the dairy farm   he said,    I got a call here  and I think you ought to go see about it in Tulsa. They   re looking for  someone.    So I went over and I talked to   the gentleman   s name was  Mr. Ernie Cass and, of course, Mr. Cass had been in the dairy business  and was well known. That   s when they had the horses delivering and the  wagons. And we visited for probably an hour and he told me all about  the company and everything, and I went home and my wife says,    What  happened?    I said,    Well, we discussed everything except salary.     (Laughs) And so I said,    Well, I   ll call him up the next day and, you  know, visit with him and see what he says.    So I called him up and  asked him, I said,    Mr. Cass we discussed everything except salary.    He  said,    Young man, you make up your mind if you   d like to come with  this company and let me take care of the salary.    (Laughs) So that   s how  (Laughs) I started. Anyhow, I got there and at 4:00 in the morning     that   s whenever the production people started and he came through and  he said,    I   ve got a small job for you.    So here I was all dressed up,  sport coat and everything, you know, expecting   I don   t know what I  was expecting, I guess. (Laughs) Like most college students     Right.     they expect to start at the top, I guess. (Laughs) So he said,    The  water line on top of the building is frozen. Here   s a blow torch. I want  you to go up there and thaw it out.    I went up there for about thirty  minutes, froze to death. When I came back down, he said,    Okay,    said,     I   m gonna put you on a training program.    So he took me back to the  cooler where they were stacking milk. That   s when they had nothing but  glass bottles, no paper, and that   s when they were having to ice the  trucks and everything   no   didn   t have        refrigeration?     refrigeration, and I was stacking milk about six to eight high, and they  had a couple of guys in there that were about 6   6    and here I was in  there trying to run up there and stack that milk, you know. So, man, that  was the hardest job I ever got to in my life. So after about six weeks, he  came through one morning and he said,    How are you doing?    I said,     Fine.    He said,    You think you know all there is to know about this  cooler?    I said,    Yes, sir.    (Laughs) And he said,    Okay, well I   m gonna  take you out and give you another job.    So he took me out to the bottle  washer. I went from the bottle washer to the pasteurizer to the laboratory  to the night foreman and up to the management, running the     15  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  So he wanted you to know about that work inside and out     Without going through that training process, I would have been the  laughing stock of all the employees because I had the book knowledge. I  had no practical experience.  That   s pretty important.  Right now when people get out of college they don   t realize that you   ve  got the book knowledge, but you don   t have any practical experience,  and it   s better to get that practical experience and the rest of it will come  natural.  Right. You can kind of get the whole picture. Well, going back to your  days as a student here, are there any other traditions besides  Homecoming that you can remember that you were a part of     Well, I belonged to the ROTC  Reserve Officer Training Corps . The     Now that was mandatory when you were     Yes, and I can remember, man, out at the lake out here, they   d run us out  there, you know, and run us back, and they had an awful good ROTC  department then and it actually was mandatory but a lot of that, I think,  helped me in my life in the military because I already knew what  military life was     Sure.     was a little bit like, you know, when I went into the cadet program.  But the students were the friendliest. The instructors now, the first  semester we were here, I don   t mind telling you my friend and I, man we  got in something   like I said there, we had to go to the instructors and  get extra tutelage after hours because it was all new to us. You know,  things that we didn   t get in high school, like algebra. They didn   t have  algebra when I went, but all the instructors were always welcome to give  you time and help you. I   ve always told everybody that I went to  Oklahoma State because that   s the school that   ll help you and there   s no  reason why you can   t get an education there.  Well, a lot of great people got their start here. (Laughs)  Well, I think if you look back, the military generals and admirals     After the service academy, that OSU has the most    Were there any  places that were popular hangouts?  16  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Oh, of course, Swim   s, you know, and then they had a pool hall.  (Laughs) They had a pool hall there     Now where was the pool hall?  It was across the street from Swim   s and about a half a block back that  way     Okay.     and it was a good meeting place and, of course, when I was in high  school that   s about all the entertainment we had was shooting pool, and  we would always, you know, when we got time Fred and I, we   d always  go up   of course it was always full, and they had a lot of intramural  football     That was pretty popular    Did you have a lot of time for entertainment  when you were at school?  No. We had no time for entertainment. No money period. (Laughter)     so are there any buildings on campus that you particularly remember?  Well, like I said, the old dairy building over there where     Right.     where you used to be able to go over and, for a nickel, you could get a  double-dip (Laughs) ice cream cone. That was a favorite place for  everybody.  You know, that was one of my greatest disappointments when I came  here in 1990 is I thought I am going to an Ag school and they have to  have, like, a fabulous place where you can buy ice cream on campus  and   nope, because there used to be    (Laughs) I   ve even seen the  cartons that the ice cream came in     Used to be you could go over there and for a nickel you could get a  double-dip ice cream cone, and they bottled their own milk. They used  to have an awful good dairy department and, you know, that   s been torn  down     Right.     and the thing I remember, too, is a lot of my friends   of course, like I  said, being in the agricultural field, they would live with the animals in  17  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  the beef barn, horse barn or sheep barn and take care of them. That was  their job     Right.     and then I remember the old hog farm out here     Right.  (Laughs)    as you come into Stillwater. But I remember a football game  when I first got back that you could go to and you could almost select  your seat in the stadium because there   d be that few people there. But, it  just kept growing, growing and growing. I sat through the Ice Bowl. My  friend and I and (Laughs)     I   ve heard about that.  Oh, man. That was a   we couldn   t even get up out of our seats. We  were frozen to the seats.  Was that in the eighties? (Laughter) Who did we play for that game?  OU, wasn   t it?  I don   t know.  I believe it was OU.  I   ve just heard people talk about being at that game and how miserable  it was.  Oh, but people stayed through it. I mean, there wasn   t very few people  that left, but   oh everybody, like I said, was walking or bicycled and of  course, the fraternities and sororities have really grown at Oklahoma  State, and the thing I think that I may have missed is that my daughters  and son-in-laws and grandchildren are enjoying is the fraternities and the  sororities   the place to go back and meet with their friends that we  didn   t have, you know, because we were living in the dorm and things  and away from the campus.  Well, it creates a whole different social experience that you would have  missed. So what do you think about the expansion and renovation of the  football field and the whole athletic complex?  I   m a firm believer that if you   re going to be competitive, you   ve got to  pay the price     18  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey     and have good facilities.     and, like I said, I have been on the short end of many a football bet     (Laughter)  I was going to say, if you   ve been a fan for that long, you sure        but I   m a firm believer if you   re going to   now Oklahoma State has  done     So you thought that we   ve done more with the money     You   ve done more with the money that they had to work with at any  school that I know of, and we have turned out athletes galore, and I  don   t think that there   s any school that can say that they have done more  toward athletics than Oklahoma State has with the money that they had  to work with.  If you look at the number of national championships and our budget, we  probably   you know, the cost for a national championship won has to  be lower than at any other school in the country...  Yeah. We always, like I said, outside of football, we   ve always been  competitive in every sport, and I think we would have been  competitive   we could compete with what their alumni was doing to get  the players     Yeah.     which, you know, I admire the athletic department here. We never  resorted to those things, but I think we   ve got some excellent coaches  and I think that our tradition, and with the help that we   re getting   one  of these days we   re gonna   they   re gonna be second down there, I  guarantee you, in football.  That will be a good feeling, won   t it? (Laughs) How did you feel when  the name changed from OAMC to OSU   I mean, you weren   t a student  there then, but     I wondered why they did it, but on the other hand I could see that the  agricultural part of it was decreasing and the other part was increasing,  and I welcomed the change later and, of course, I   m sure the guys that  were here like me at first didn   t, you know, immediately grab, you  know, and say well it was a good change. But after I thought for awhile,  I thought it was an excellent change.  19  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  If you had advice to give to future, or even current, students here, what  would you tell them?  Well, they   ve got too much time on their hands. (Laughter) I think each  student ought to have   really I   m a firm believer every student ought to  have a little part-time job and earn a little spending money and not  depend on parents to put them through school because whether they  realize it or not, you   ve got extra time and it helps you when you have to  do something on the side. It keeps you busy and you don   t have that time  to maybe get into some trouble or something that some of the students  get into. But I think it would behoove any student to get a part-time job  and earn a little spending money and not depend entirely on parents to  pay the bill to send them to school.  Well, I think that   s excellent advice, especially   I have two kids that are  going to be students (Laughs) soon, in the next couple of years. (Laughs)  Well, it   I think it gets them to, you know, earning their own money  and, you know, take responsibility and you get somebody to boss you  and things like that.  And it sure helps you to be organized and that you don   t have all the  time in the world to     But you   ve got all of that free time   you   re not going to study all the  time. You   ve got plenty of time to study if you go to class and pay  attention, take notes. That   s the main thing for any student.  Is there anything that I haven   t asked you about today that you   re going  to walk away from this interview saying to yourself,    Boy I wish she had  asked me       Can you think of anything you   d like to tell us     Well, I like the way the administration is approaching this ticket deal. I  mean I have people that say,    Well they   ve just raised the ticket.    If  you   re gonna dance, you   re gonna have to pay the fiddler, and if we   re  going to get competitive in the Big Twelve, we   ve got to get the revenue  up, and you can   t depend on somebody else paying the bill for you.  We   ve got to pay our share.  So I   m a firm believer I   d rather spend my money on sporting events at  Oklahoma State than anything that I know of as far as entertainment. I  tell you one thing I like, all the buildings look the same now since they  got rid of all these temporary buildings and everything, for any outsider  coming in now, it looks beautiful.  It does.  20  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  Paustenbaugh  Mackey  And I notice the town population is increasing because Walmart is  building out here     Yeah. The town is growing. Well, thank you so much for coming and  participating in this today     Well, like I said, I don   t know of many people that know what Dr. Jones  has done, but he not only did it for me and my friend, he did it for a lot  of other boys, headed them in the right direction.  Well, he   s a very generous man and he continues on that path.  Probably if you had to pick a person at Oklahoma State that loves  Oklahoma State more than he does, I don   t know who it would be.  It would be hard to find them, wouldn   t it? (Laughter)  I don   t think you could find anybody     Well, thank you so much.  Well, thank you.  -------  -------
