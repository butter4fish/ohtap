 Finchum Today is March 8, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum, and I   m with Oklahoma State University. Today, I am in Norman, Oklahoma, to interview Betty Douglas Bellis, and this is for our Cowboy in Every County Project, so thank you for talking with me today.  Bellis My pleasure.  Finchum Let   s start with learning when and where you were born.  Bellis I was born May 23, 1932. Five-five-five if you are going to shorten it up. (Laughs) I was born at 509 Blakely  Street  at Stillwater, Oklahoma, just north of Sixth  Avenue  and south of somewhat   more south of Fourth  Avenue .  Finchum Payne County girl?  Bellis Payne County girl. From the very beginning. Yeah.  Finchum Were you born at home?  Bellis Yes, we were. It was a family of four. I was the second of four and I was born at home in this cute little two-bedroom house.  Finchum Is it still standing?  Bellis No, I think the last time I saw it, some apartments were there.  Finchum Okay. What did your dad do for a living?  Bellis My father had bought a grocery store there in the 1920s and he had the Douglas, called the   at one time called the Douglas Big Country    No, Douglas, not Big Country Store but Cooksey   s Corner. Its name first was Cooksey, because he had bought it from a Mr. Cooksey in Guthrie, where he got his start at age ten working in the grocery business. I was able to grow 5  big enough that when I was in the eighth grade, I got to start sacking groceries. You better be careful when I sack groceries, because they   re heavy. (Laughs) Later, the store was changed to Douglas Food Mart, and eventually, the store burned down in 1954, July 31, and Daddy had a Chicken Plunking Place, which I thought was clever, out on east Sixth. He opened up immediately as the Douglas Big Country Store. For a long time, it was there, then eventually, they built a different store. They sold that. That   s the Hock Shop right now, right across from the  Fairlawn  Cemetery. I later got to work   I really got to count money back to people, like people purchasing at the counter. I worked on Saturday, almost every Saturday until I got well probably a junior in college.  Finchum Did you get paid?  Bellis Well, I got paid. I wrote and kept a little diary. I   d go home and when I was sacking, sorting or working, and I would write in this little book,    January so- and-so, all day,    and he was going to pay me three dollars a day. (Laughs) Sometimes, we just didn   t get around to that. But when I needed money, if I wanted to go someplace, take a trip, buy something for somebody   s birthday, I could just go to Daddy and say,    Daddy, I need something. Here is my little list. I need some money.    I always had my own little bank account to draw from if I needed something, which was nice.  Finchum Well, did your siblings work too?  Bellis Well, my older sister was extremely clever, but she wasn   t very money oriented. My younger sister, Judy, is a very smart young lady in the money business, and my brother, he basically went into the grocery business there in Stillwater. Now, has the Douglas Building Center out on East Main, East Sixth.  Finchum Okay.  Bellis I thought it was great because I really liked working with the public and getting to know everybody.  Finchum You said, you said Chicken     Bellis Chicken Plucking Place.  Finchum Chicken Plucking Place.  Bellis During the second World War, the University had all these military people all over, and they fed them a lot of food and my father, at the back of his store on Main and Ninth was where he had his first Chicken Plucking Place. I just thought it was such a cute name. They cleaned chickens, and then they 6  sold them to the University, because they had to get their food from some place. He did that all during the war, which was unique. When I was in college, on days I didn   t have class, I ended up driving wash tubs with ice in them and clean plucked chickens, and I   d drive them to Oklahoma City and up to his store in Ralston  Oklahoma  and Fairfax  Oklahoma . Nobody ever, nobody got sick. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, would you have chicken for dinner at your house?  Bellis Oh, yes. We ate chicken. We ate a lot of things that were kind of going   in the vegetable and the fruit business, in the summertime when things started going bad, Mother had the great pleasure of receiving the things that were going down, and so, we would do some canning or preserving of some of the peaches from Colorado and all these places. We all thought that was pretty funny. We still got something out of it, and didn   t lose too much, so.  Finchum I take it she did not work outside of the home.  Bellis No, she had worked until she started having children. I have three siblings.  Finchum Were they from Payne County or did they move here?  Bellis My dad was born in Guthrie, one of six children, and Mother was born in Helena  Oklahoma , I believe, or her family lived in Helena, and then they lived in where Southeastern Oklahoma State is now.  Finchum Weatherford  Oklahoma ?  Bellis Way down by, it   s the town that they only     Finchum Woodward  Oklahoma ?  Bellis No, it   s way southeast.  Finchum Southeast? Ada  Oklahoma ?  Bellis No, past that. Farther on, this is a geography lesson.  Finchum Durant  Oklahoma ?  Bellis Durant, they all say Durant. That   s where. Her dad was a politician as well as a land man and stuff. Not really a land man, and so she was born down there. Then, they moved back to Guthrie. My mother was a basketball player and was a semi-pro basketball player in the    20s. My dad had just gone into the grocery business, he and his cigar. They just were fine. They got married and after four years, or so, they started having children. 7  Finchum What was your mother   s name?  Bellis Her name was Edith Irene Harned. H-A-R-N-E-D. She went to OSU one year. Then, my dad went one semester and that is when his boss, ex-boss from Guthrie came over and called him and said    Glen, I want you to come down to 824 Main and look at this place with me.    Dad finishes a final in engineering, and he said they went and looked the store over. Mr. Cooksey says,    What do you think of this?    He said,    Well, I don   t know. It looks like a good place.    He said,    I want you to manage it for me.    There ended his college era. He became the manager, he was probably nineteen. He was a great grocer. He just really loved it.  Finchum He did it for the rest of his working career?  Bellis Rest of his life. I will tell you that if he ever walked through a grocery store parking lot, he spoke to everybody. I don   t care whether it was his store or somebody else   s store. (Laughs)  Finchum A real people person.  Bellis Yes, he was. A real business person, so     Finchum What else was going on on Main Street there in Stillwater at that time?  Bellis Apparently, that corner had been the First Bank on the second story. I   m not sure it was the second floor, anyway it was the First Bank. At one time on the second story was the first school in Stillwater, and also one of the first churches, which was the Methodist church. Of course, when it burned in    54, we were not able to put another second story on it because it was kind of an old building then in thirty years. We just sold it for, actually we kept the store, but we leased it for several eating places. There were some cafeterias that went in there and some other things. Now, I think it   s an exercise place. No, what is it that   ?  Finchum It   s a karate or something like that. Tai Kwon Do or something.  Bellis Karate. But it   s very clean. I have been inside of it and I   m very amazed at how clean it is. Yeah.  Finchum Were you there when the Katz   was Katz Department Store there?  Bellis Oh, yes. Katz Department Store probably started in the 1917s. That was because Mr. Katz had brought a lot of his Jewish relatives out of Germany before the second World War started. They were just fine people always there and it was the other end of Main Street. 8  Finchum Was there a dairy processing place?  Bellis Yes, it was across the street and to the west. I remember going there as a young girl. When we would go to Saturday afternoon westerns we would go over there and get a walking sundae. A walking sundae is a cup with two dips of ice cream in it. Then, in the war, when we didn   t have enough vanilla ice cream, they would put one vanilla and one orange sherbet. The rest of the time it was two scoops of ice cream. Then they would pour chocolate on it and put a cherry on top. That was ten cents. We thought that was just about the most exciting thing to do. I did. I didn   t care about the westerns. (Laughs) My sister was a horse person so we did. That was Midwest Creamery.  Finchum Why would they call it a walking sundae? You ate it as you walked?  Bellis I guess. Because we did. We got it and walked home. Our house was just due west about a mile-and-a-half.  Finchum Was ten cents hard to come by?  Bellis No, it wasn   t because my father gave   at that time we were beginning to get an allowance. The allowance was one quarter   when I was in high school, it was one quarter for Sunday school, one quarter for stamps, war stamps, and one quarter to spend as you wanted to. For a while we didn   t have the extra quarter, they were already designated. I could save money for   it was ten cents to get into the movie, and ten cents to get my walking sundae. (Laughs) I was very lucky to have had   I could save a nickel a week. If you were careful, you could save a nickel a week, you know.  Finchum And do what with it, when you saved up enough?  Bellis I counted my nickels and dimes every Sunday. (Laughs) I just, after a while, I just liked to count how much I had saved in a week. If I needed money from Daddy, I would get some, but didn   t really need very much.  Finchum Would you keep it in a certain place?  Bellis I had a cute little bank. In high school, I was fortunate enough to get five dollars a week. That was pretty good. We felt very fortunate that we could do that. We had to buy our, by that time, they had started a food cafeteria at Stillwater High School. It cost twenty-five cents a day, I guess. I could do that. I would have a little bit of money there to do other things. By that time, they had a malt shop on Seventh  Avenue  and just west of Main  Street . You could get a really nice malt for ten cents there. Very good. I had to be 9  very careful. Then, I started drinking coffee. I could get coffee for a nickel, which was fine too.  Finchum In high school?  Bellis In high school, yeah. What else did I do in high school? I was a good student. I enjoyed it.  Finchum Where did you go to elementary school?  Bellis Eugene Field. Right down there where the Consumer IGA  grocery store  was built, after they had torn Eugene Field down at Sixth and Washington  Street . It was very nice.  Finchum Grades one through sixth?  Bellis Yes. Seventh grade was, we went to junior high, which at one time what is now the community center was Stillwater High School or part of the time it was also Stillwater Junior High. The school to the south was   during my junior high years we ended up going   I went down there first maybe in the seventh grade. Then, they switched us up to the one up north, not too north, just Duck  Street  and Sixth. No, Ninth  Avenue . Then, the next year they switched us back. I don   t know. I was sort of into that, which was okay. I graduated in 1950, which is always great. It   s a good year to remember.  Finchum What was your favorite subject?  Bellis Uh     Finchum Do you have one?  Bellis Well, I, it was not home ec. (Laughs) I can tell you that. They said you have to. I had taken all these other courses. I had taken everything I could except I didn   t take home ec. Well, in seventh grade, you had to take one half, one semester of home ec. In the eighth grade you took another one. You know, that   s okay. You do that and you learn how to set the table and everything else and you know that you aren   t going to be home ec person. You had to make two garments, which were ghastly. I just wasn   t going to be a home ec person.  They called me in and said,    You   re going to have to take one year of home ec in the tenth or eleventh grade.    I was aghast. I said,    I have taken all these other things.    I said,    I am not going to be a home ec person.    Well, they   d just do some checking. They decided possibly when I enrolled in high school that maybe they had changed their core restrictions, and I probably didn   t have to do that. I had taken chemistry and physics. I took all 10  the maths, but I did not take geometry. I took geometry in tenth grade. What else did I take that was a little different? I took commercial law. I loved that. I did not take home ec and they still let me get out of there. (Laughs) That   s why I value Mary Joyce so much.  Finchum She does like home ec.  Bellis She knows how to fix a meal or something.  Finchum The public library at that time was up     Bellis Across from the courthouse.  Finchum Yeah.  Bellis Yeah.  Finchum Do you remember going in there?  Bellis We went there quite a bit. I liked that very much. I was active in the Methodist church. I sang in the choir in high school and college. So that was fun. Nice. What else did I do? I worked every Saturday. (Laughs)  Finchum What did you do for fun if you spending your weekends working?  Bellis Well, there was always Sunday afternoon. We had, our family had a cabin at Yost Lake. At that time, there was no electricity for cabins at Yost Lake. It was not one of these plush cabin places. We had what we called    across the road,    (laughs) where the two little outhouses were. We would have to pump water next door, from the cabin next door. We had shared water there. They didn   t get electricity in until    52 or     5 3 out there at Yost. Then, they finally were able to put in some air conditioning. That   s just about the time that air conditioning was being evolved and used in homes and other places. Probably what caused the store to burn. There was such a drain on the grid. It happened on a late Saturday night. The power plant couldn   t handle it.  Finchum Was there a train going to Yost at that time?  Bellis We had the doodlebug. It was a two-car thing. It normally came in on Saturday mornings. It came from up by Pawnee  Oklahoma  and Glencoe  Oklahoma . We   d go down and wave it down about nine o   clock in the morning. Then, I   d get on. For nineteen cents I could take it in to   I wasn   t driving all the time at that time. I   d take it in to the train station and just get off and walk up the hill to the store and work. Then, at the evening, Mother would take me back out to the lake, when we were out there for a couple of weeks at a time. That was fun. 11  Finchum Very much fun. Different, too.  Bellis Very different, very different. Yeah. We just thought it was about the best thing you could ever do. It was very calm and very nice. Just kind of a clean type of living. (Laughs) We didn   t have our first television until probably after I started going to college. I still don   t watch it. (Laughs)  Finchum You finished high school in 1950?  Bellis Yes.  Finchum Did you have a choice on where you could go to college?  Bellis I didn   t even think about that. Everybody in Stillwater, if they wanted to go to OSU, A M, we had forty-eight dollars a semester of tuition. Then, you   d have to pay seven dollars, maybe, if you bought an annual and something similar if you wanted to go to all the athletic events. That was pretty good. That was wonderful. I went to college thinking   I didn   t know what I wanted to be so I took everything I wanted to take. (Laughs) Which was kind of fun. My junior year, Mr. White called me in and said,    Miss Douglas, you   re going to have to pick a major.       Why? I   m having a great time taking all these things that I   d like to know something about.    He said,    Well, you   re in college for a purpose. You   ve got to get out.    He suggested I maybe take   he was liberal arts. He said,    Maybe you could do humanities.    Okay. I had two courses in humanities. That was all we had at the time, two four-hour courses in our sophomore year. That would be fine.  Then he said,    As you get into,    this was my third year,    you got to have a major. We   ll have three separate parts, aspects, of humanities that could be developed more. Take fifteen hours in each one of them.    Since I had had one year of French, as a freshman, and obviously didn   t retain too much, the second year I did not take French. He said,    You could do fifteen hours of French, fifteen hours of art history, then fifteen hours of literature.    That was fine with me. I was just eager. Turns out two weeks into my French class, as a junior, the teacher calls me in and says,    Miss Douglas, when are you going to drop this class?    I thought,    I   m obviously not doing too well here.    I went back to see Mr. White. He said,    Okay. We   ll just do the American literature and the English literature.    There were lots and lots of classes. We had some really great teachers. I did that. I ended up taking four semesters of art history, and one of art appreciation. It was fine. I took a lot of English literature and American. I got out with a lot of hours. That   s all I know. (Laughs)  Finchum Do you remember any of your professors in particular?  12  Bellis Name wise?  Finchum Yeah.  Bellis Mr. Bailey was the guy who was the French teacher. I think he came, he had some French background. I liked him because he told us jokes in French, to see if we could figure out what he was saying. He was very good. I had a couple of really, I had one wonderful, I cannot remember her name. Red-headed PhD from Dublin. Fiery young lady. Fierce young lady, and she invited us out our last year of college, our senior year, to study for our final. Some young guy, thinking how smart he was, from New York   we went out to her house and she fixed us a meal. She had some of her  inaudible  over the fireplace. He grabs one, and she grabs the other, and knocks him back and knocks it out. I thought,    Good.    I didn   t like him anyway. (Laughs) She was just one fiery teacher, but she was good. It was one of the English novelists. I cannot for the life of me remember. I would have to go back and look. I   m not sure where I would find it. She was great.  Finchum Did you live at home?  Bellis I pledged a sorority, Chi Omega, because my feeling was if I lived at home, I would only know girls on campus that might be in my class and you don   t get to become very good friends and people that I double-dated with. I didn   t have a steady boyfriend. I went to college. I said,    I want to meet someone. I   m not interested in getting married. I   m too young. I   m nineteen, I   m eighteen, heavens to Betsy. I   m not going to go do that. I just want to meet people.    Pledging Chi Omega, I got to meet some of the girls. I did not live in the house except my junior spring semester. I had been elected treasurer. That way you get to know all the girls because they have to pay their bills and everything. That was good. I enjoyed that. There was just so really fine young ladies that I still keep in touch with. It   s just been a remarkable thing. I just thought it was the thing to do. That was fun.  Finchum Would the house participate in home decorations during Homecoming?  Bellis Oh yes. That was fun. We did, but we didn   t do it all. We would either have the parade   I   m not sure if we did that. We probably decorated for everything. Not to the extent that they do today. You can imagine that.  Finchum It   s grown and grown.  Bellis It has grown, and it   s wonderful. It   s really been a special thing for the OSU people.  Finchum Did you spend much time in the Library on campus?  13  Bellis Yes, because the first year I was there was the year they started. It was a new library. They kept it open until midnight. All the cute little girls who lived in the dorms and the houses, had to go home at ten thirty. Ah  So I could go up to the Library and I could have peace and quiet. (Laughs) And me being sort of a night owl, I could study until eleven thirty and then go home. Of course, it wasn   t any problem because you didn   t have the safety things that we have today. I thoroughly enjoyed that.  Finchum You walk home?  Bellis I would sometimes walk home. Sometimes, at that time, I could have Mother and Daddy   we had two cars. I could drive myself or we could make arrangements or something. I lived oh, probably straight south on Monroe  Street , to Adams  Street , where you just turn west for a block-and-a-half, then our house was right there. It was close enough and safe enough, and I probably knew all the police in town because I sold things in the grocery store to all kinds of people. (Laughs) It was really a good deal.  Finchum You couldn   t be mischievous or they would get back to your parents?  Bellis Oh yes, that is true. Then, when they, if what I did was really naughty, and the Chi Omegas thought I should be grounded, well, that is good because they all had to go back to the house at ten thirty. (Laughs) I could go do something that I wanted to do. I tried not to do that very often. It was fun. We had a great group of young ladies. Really fine, smart people.  Finchum Have dances?  Bellis Yeah, they had dances, and oh I don   t have my eightieth birthday thing, yes, but yes we went to dances. Fancy dances and not so, but it was a typical, nice, pleasant life that college people used to have.  Finchum Well, would your clothes be store bought or did your mother make them?  Bellis No, my mother was a golfer. She was a golfer, and as soon as my brother, who was the youngest in the family, got into the seventh grade and could have food at the school, she took up golfing again. She did golf with Doyne Iba. Which was one in her group, because they had ten or twelve or fifteen, Norman  Oklahoma , Stillwater, ladies    association I think. She just   on Tuesday, it was lady   s golf day. She always just boiled herself up some eggs and then they   d go out to the golf course on the north side of town. Like Lakeside  Golf Course  probably. They just opened that. They didn   t have anything for storage. They may have had bottled things in ice places to keep them cold, but they didn   t have really fancy things there. And the Stillwater Country Club hadn   t been built yet. Just go out there and they   d just have the best time. 14  Finchum Did you get to go some?  Bellis Every semester I was in college, I took a PE Course. My older sister, having been a physical ed major, and I   m four inches taller than she was, everybody thought I was a PE major. I just took everything they had. I just thought it was simple, was easy, another A. (Laughs) So I did that. I had a great time. I did eventually take golf. I made an A in the class, but I wasn   t very good as a golfer.  Finchum Did you have to take swimming? Was it required?  Bellis I did take swimming. I tried to take lifesaving. I was the person who never wanted their head under water. The only way I learned to swim was   because I always wanted to do the side stroke. I just want my head out of the water. I could stay afloat for years. I just was not going to get my head under water. I didn   t like it. When I was in fourth grade, we went down to Crystal Plunge, which was the, close to the railroad tracks. That is where they taught the lessons. I told the teacher,    I   m not going to put my head under water.    She said,    You have to put your head under water and swim over and back. If you can do that, Betty, then I know you can swim. I will give you a   I   ll pass you on the swimming.    I later then, in college, tried to take, we did intramural things, we tried to do some intramural swimming, but I just never did like that at all. Later in my life, I ended up wearing contacts for about forty years. I never put my head under water then, and I thought,    Now I know why I didn   t want to put my head under water.    (Laughs) Very important to me.  Finchum Crystal Plunge? I haven   t heard anyone talk about     Bellis Well, you know where the towers are? Okay, I thought I had a picture of that but I don   t. On the south side of Sixth, where you come down from the, curl down from Main, down between the grain elevators, here is this flat area. That was where Crystal Plunge was. I never liked going to Crystal Plunge. Their water smelled so stinky. It had chlorophyll in it, whatever, chlorine. We swam in Yost Lake, but it might have been dirty, but it was stuff from the ground. It wasn   t anything bad.  Finchum Was it just the swimming pool or did it have other things?  Bellis It probably had a little park outside, and usually you   d go down and take a picnic lunch, which was nice. It was pretty popular for the people in town. We   d go out to Yost Lake. Yost Lake is nine miles, six miles north, and three miles east of Washington or Monroe  Street  or something.  Finchum So, you graduated from OSU in 1950   . 15  Bellis Fifty-four.  Finchum    Fifty-four then. Before it switched names?  Bellis Yes.  Finchum Did you have an opinion on that?  Bellis Actually, they said I could have a   they offered me a chance to have a diploma from the new school. I was very stupid. I said no. If I had gotten it, I would have had two diplomas for the same degree. (Laughs) I thought it was   I understood why they did it. The interesting thing was, when I was getting ready to come, my husband and I, when we were getting ready to come here to work on his master   s in geology, I thought that would be really a nice deal. Then I thought,    Oh boy     One of the things that would be improved is the guys aren   t going to be wearing jeans on campus. Well, that was 1956. He had been two years in the Army, and I get down here, and that   s when all the jean craze came in. (Laughs) I never liked jeans. I thought that was so funny.  Finchum He was in the Army for     Bellis Two years, almost two years     Finchum In the   50s? World War II was over?  Bellis It was the Korean War. It was at the very end of the Korean War. It was, in fact, after he went through basic training, and then we went to Camp Gordon in Georgia, he was sent off to radio school. They were still doing Morse Code. Then he got through with that. Then they did maneuvers and they would find out whether they would be going to Korea or to Germany. Well, one of my all-time quests, and reason I was saving all those nickels and dimes and all that sort of stuff, was I had decided when I was a little girl. First of all, I was saving my money to go to Idaho where Sonja Henie was ice skating. I thought I could go out there and learn. That was the first reason I was saving my money. The second reason was then, I got a little bit older, I was sixteen and I was driving, I was going to buy a car. Then I was going to do something else. Then I went to college and my art history. I thought,    When I get out of college my next goal is to go to Europe.     Very luckily, Bill came home from all of his things, the workout they had and said    Well, I   m really sorry, because we   re going to Germany. We   re going to Europe.    I said,    I   m delighted     I was pregnant by that time.    That   s great. I   ll get me a ticket.    He was a private. He had some eye 16  problems so he hadn   t been able to go in as an officer. I said,    That   s fine with me.    I   m just all thrilled about this. I got myself a ticket. I actually beat him to Europe, because they put him on one of the ships that had to help clean out Camp Dix or something in New Jersey. They held them back so they could keep doing that. I got to Europe before he did, which was fine. I said,    I   ll just go to Paris and I   ll get off there and spent a couple days there.    I knew there was this thing called the Red Cross. The Red Cross could find you anybody in the military, right? Turns out I found out right before he went over, and I went over, that he was going to Germany, so I went ahead and got a ticket to Frankfurt, where I waited.  It turned out that I was very lucky of the opportunity. I landed at ten o   clock at night, wearing my heels and hose, my maternity dress. I waited for my luggage. I had this little book, army book, how to speak German. I   m standing there and waiting for my luggage and this Air Force colonel, major, colonel comes up to me. He said,    Ma   am, I don   t want to bother you. Is your husband going to meet you?    I said,    No. He   s out in the middle of the ocean on some boat.    He said,    Do you have anybody meeting you?    I said,    No.    He said,    Well, Colonel so and so,    maybe he was the major, whichever one,    have a driver here and we   re in       the garden spot in Germany where all the upper rank lived,    we have a driver meeting us and we would be glad to take you down there and set you up in some sort of housing until you can make contact with your husband. Then you   ll be all right.    I don   t know who they were. Have no idea. They were there and very nice.  Finchum And you got in the car with them?  Bellis I got in the car. They drove down there. We rolled into some defense hotel. They go, the lesser of the officers. You can tell I   m not an Army person, went in, and told the people there,    Take care of her. She   s an American dependent. We take care of all of our dependents. Give her the GI money we use over there. Take care of her until she finds her husband.    I thought that was good. I didn   t have any, they had all these busses that were running around, Army and Air Force. You needed a way to get on. They had a driver who would,    Do you have an AGO card?    I didn   t know what it was. I got out my commissary card from Fort Camp in Georgia and showed it to him. Hey, it looked sort of official. I just road all the busses around. (Laughs) I had a great time. Then we were over there, Doug was born there. We were over there for about seventeen months, which was good. We lived on the economy, which was okay. It was kind of like camping out. That was all right. You didn   t have to do it forever, so you could do it a little bit.  Finchum How had you met him, your husband?  17  Bellis Well, because all the geology students got together in the Union, and I would go over. I was dating one geologist. We would meet over there and all the others, everybody else. Bill was one of his friends. Ends up, I married Bill and not the other one. It was just really nice. I just got to know a lot of them. Eventually, going into the geological business, there were a lot of them that I know. That   s how I met him.  Finchum When you got engaged, did they throw either one of you in Theta Pond?  Bellis No, because, they did not. Bill had been a Sigma Nu. But you know what, they wouldn   t let him drink all the milk out of the kitchen that he wanted to. So he quit. (Laughter) Don   t you love people that had these standards? I thought that was about the silliest thing I ever heard of, you know. I thought that was funny. I kidded him awhile about that.  Finchum He was Bill Bellis?  Bellis Bellis, uh-huh. He was from Cushing  Oklahoma .  Finchum Majored in geology?  Bellis Geology, and OSU did not have an advanced degree at that time. They do now. They have a master   s. They also have a master   s in hydrology that OU  University of Oklahoma  does not have. That is kind of what we had.  Finchum When did you get married?  Bellis We got married after he got out of basic in December. We went right down to Camp Gordon, which is now a Fort. That   s why I have to keep thinking about that, in Augusta, Georgia.  Finchum So 1950?  Bellis The end of 1954.  Finchum How did you end up in Norman?  Bellis He couldn   t get his master   s in Stillwater, so he just came down here. He came here and he got his master   s, and then he was going to work on his PhD, and he got a job working in one of the labs, but he never quite finished it. I think he just got tired of it, and eventually we divorced, and by that time, I had not just my child keeping business, but I had started typing. I typed his thesis and somebody else   s. It was so easy for me to type. I just could not believe how simple it was for me to type. I just decided I could start typing, and I had a nice little typing business. Did a lot of books, drafts for a lot of the professors on campus, and for the geology people did a lot of 18  thesis and dissertations, and I did that for probably ten or fifteen years. It was just so simple for me. Then, I started working at the Geological Survey as a computer typist or technical typist. That   s when we were still using typewriters. Then, we used the first word processor. Before it became, it was a GE I believe, the first Mag Card. You know how the  IBM  Mag Card     Finchum I know there were punch cards.  Bellis This was something you put in and typed two or three pages on it. You could go back and correct it. So I did that for a long time and then I just did more and more. That   s why I now have no feeling in my middle fingers, because of carpal tunnel, but other than that, I don   t need it. (Laughs) A lot of fun.  Finchum You retired from?  Bellis OU. From the Oklahoma Geological Survey.  Finchum Roughly when?  Bellis  In  2009.  Finchum Fairly recent?  Bellis Yes.  Finchum Older than 65. You worked past   .  Bellis I was seventy-five.  Finchum You worked past sixty-five?  Bellis That is about the time that Charlie and I got married. He had lost his wife earlier than that. We were talking about getting married. He was an extremely busy guy. He just said one time, he said,    I know we need to get married. I want to. I just don   t have time to plan anything.    I said    Well, if you find a time, let me know.    He   s getting ready to go out to a meeting on Maui. He had been inducted into the Higher Education Hall of Fame. He was going to wear a funny suit. He took it back. I said, you know, we should have gotten married this weekend when everybody was around.  I just sat down and called the place where we were going and asked them what a wedding would cost. Oh,  3500. We   d have a gazebo, somebody to take our pictures, and there   d be a band and all this wonderful stuff. I said,    There   s just two of us.    (Laughs) They called me back. I actually looked online. It was the first time I had every really gone online. I found in Maui, 19  there was something called Dream Weddings. They were  350. They could tell me where to go. We didn   t have to do blood work. And as I was talking to him he said,    I do assume you are over eighteen.    (Laughs)    Oh, three or four times.    (Laughter)  So, when we leave, which is on a Wednesday, we know that on Friday we   re going to meet this guy in the lobby. He already said I   ve an appointment with the lady with the legal stuff. He said,    You just get in the cab here and get this done and come back, and I   ll meet you at one thirty in the afternoon. We   ll just have a nice little wedding.    He said,    If there are too many people on the beach that day, I   ll just put you in my old pickup and we   ll drive down the road.    Which was fun. Turns out there weren   t that many people. We went out there and we found a giant balsamic rock. Of course, nothing is more exciting to a geologist than a big ole rock. We got married there. It was just really nice.  Then, we went back and as Charlie said   well, no, we didn   t have a reception. All these people who had been out there bathing as we walked by, he was in a suit and I was in a long dress, they kind of thought something was going up. They all stood up and clapped for us. I said,    That made us a cheap reception.    (Laughs) It was really nice and good. You don   t need everybody with you when you   re getting married like that.  Finchum When was that?  Bellis That was 2007. Then, I finished working. He got really sick in 2012 and passed away.  Finchum What was his name? Charlie what?  Bellis Charles Mankin, M-A-N-K-I-N.  Finchum Okay.  Bellis He actually was a member of the Boone Pickens School of Geology at Stillwater. He had given some talks up there a lot and everything. We knew most of the people up there too.  Finchum How often did you get back to campus?  Bellis Not very often. Recently, I had some leg problems. The first thing that I did, I had to quite driving. I wasn   t able to get my   putting pressure on my leg to drive, I couldn   t get above fifteen miles an hour. If you   re living in the country and you need to get town, it   s pretty scary. I found a neurosurgeon, had my back surgery, and I   m now doing much better, but I   m not sure if I   m going to try and fight the idiots on the road. I have a driver that I found, 20  a young lady, that   s good. My son lives here, and my daughter lives in Cedar Park, Texas.  Finchum Two children?  Bellis Two children.  Finchum Did either one of them go to OSU?  Bellis No, but Karen   s husband did. Mark Powers, he got his geology degree. I think he was a year behind her. She got hers down here at    83, I believe,    82 or    83. She went to work for Gulf. That   s where she met Mark. She had also met him other places. The geology world, there are so many of them, but they kind of have a lot of connections.  Finchum It   s a busy place right now, isn   t it?  Bellis It is.  Finchum In Oklahoma with all this drilling going on?  Bellis It was very nice. Since my parents still lived in Stillwater, until they died in    96 or    97.  Finchum Well, when I came, you were telling me about some house that was close to the hospital.  Bellis That was our family house.  Finchum That was interesting. Can you tell it again?  Bellis Yes. The house was built in 1941. It was right before the war,    40,    41, and was built by one of the better builders in Stillwater. Mr. Boyd, his name was, and it had a big basement in it. One of the few in Stillwater that never has flooded. It flooded one time when they had a fourteen inch rain. He built a really great house. My younger sister   s oldest boy and his wife   actually, my brother got the house to begin with. He wanted to move it some place in Stillwater, but the people were heavily involved in some sort of a location problem or something. It just didn   t work out. They thought the hospital would take it and they   d eventually tear it down. What somebody had said they wanted to do with it was to make a Ronald McDonald House out of it. It would have been a very nice place to do that.  Anyway, Sherry, my niece-in-law who   s just really good with details, took it upon herself. She and one of my son   s daughters Terri  Ventress , who works on campus, something in the chemical engineering department, I 21  think. They recently had an article about her in the STATE magazine. She   s the one involved in the Scottish games. The picture didn   t quite look like her, because she had straightened her hair out, disgusting. (Laughs) Anyway, they got together and figured out that they could move the house. Ben had found somebody in Stillwater who would move the house, about the time they were doing the Village thing. Then, it didn   t happen.  Sherry and Terri, get together and they decide that they will   Sherry calls the guy who Ben had talked to and asks him how much it would cost to move that house. He said,    It can   t be done.    She said,    How much does it cost?    He said,    It can   t be done.    Okay, so it can   t be done. So, she   s a determined woman. She calls somebody else. They live on the other side of Tulsa. That   s where she wanted to move it, they had the property. They said,    It can   t be done.    She found somebody over here and said,    What can we do, and how can we do it?    They did it. They took certain parts, and they even took our big swing set, which was hysterical. (Laughs) Huge swing set, but they took it over to Jenks, Bixby I guess it is, in parts.  Then what they couldn   t take,  they  put it all in  the basement  and covered up the basement. The basement had been a big rec room, had a playroom in it, and it also had a laundry room in it. It was just what my mother had wanted, forever. She had always kept little articles out of different women   s magazines, and everything she liked. It   s a gorgeous house.  Finchum Have they built it?  Bellis They have put it back together in a different way.  Finchum Did your parents build it?  Bellis Yes, they did build it. They had Mr. Boyd build it. It had this beautiful front door, and you come in and here are these steps. These steps go up and they got a nice little banister that curls down here, and you go up four steps and then there   s little square and then you turn and go up this way about ten steps. I tried to jump them once and I didn   t do very well. They had another square, then four more steps up by the railing. Then, all the way around. You could actually come out from the upstairs, all four of the girls    rooms were upstairs, and look down and see who   s down there. Had a window seat that was just beautiful, and then a bath and two bedrooms. They had to change a few things. Basically, when you walk up to that door, and you see this door, it   s the same opening. It just really gives everybody a thrill. It   s very clever.  Finchum Which lot was it on?  22  Bellis It was on the middle of, on Blakely  Street , which is the block behind Adams. Adams is the little short   Monroe and then the little short thing to Adams. Then, down this way and then it   s Blakely, between Seventh and Eighth. It was on the east side of the street. I don   t know what   s there now. Maybe it   s nothing, maybe it   s trees. We had a circular drive, because it was built on two lots.  Finchum Probably built in the    40s?  Bellis In the early    40s.  Finchum Before the war or during the war?  Bellis Before the war had even started. It was before we had all the talking and everything. Ben said he thought it was    40. I thought it was    41, but I don   t care. It makes no difference, you know.  Finchum Well, do you have any other memories of Stillwater during that time period, during the war years?  Bellis Yes I do, because as I told you, we had a lot of military people in the Old CCC Camps over there between Sixth, between, yeah Sixth and Seventh. That was all empty down to where   what is the big building at the far end? I don   t know what it   s called. It   s changed several times. Anyway, Seventh Street is back, and then here we have Adams and then we have Monroe, and then we have Jefferson. During the war, Mr. Boyd was out there working on part of our house, and GI Jane was a young lady who was in a Cannonball or Thunderbird two-seater plane, and they were doing a promotional stunt there. They come down on Washington, down low. They come up to Jefferson, then they do a barrel roll and crashed right into the ground right in the middle of, between Monroe and Jefferson, between Seventh and Eighth. Right there, luckily, right there.  It was about, I don   t know, noonish or something, and Mr. Boyd was part of the defense system. He   s gone  I mean, we   re out there and we don   t know what   s going on. We see all these sirens and we see the smoke. It killed both the pilot and GI Jane, but it was the strangest thing. It was, it really made a very positive impact. It was just terrible. Here was just   they hit something and caught the wing or something. That was probably, oh,    42,    43. I really don   t know what year that was.  That was a pretty impressive thing. During the war, in school, when I went to school, one of my little monies was for war stamps. We would always take our little money for third and fourth and fifth grade, for the war stamps. Of course, then you   d put them in the little book until you got up to ten dollars, and then you would get some sort of a   I think it was a savings 23  bond, but you could work up to a savings bond. We all did that and that was fine. We learned all the military songs, which was wonderful. (Laughs) It was a combined, everybody was really into the war. That one was the thing that just really stunned everybody. I don   t know who she was, where she was from, but that was probably    42, maybe    43. That was a tough time.  I remember Ronny Bennett. His dad was the policeman, chief of police. He had to get up one day and give a current event. It was a pretty gory one, because it was when they put things in the newspaper, what things had been smuggled out, some of the things the Japanese had done. He gets up and gives this. Of course, little boys like gory things. (Laughter) Well, that was the way   actually Ronny was, later in the    50s, he was one of the football players. He wasn   t very tall, very big. He was one of the runners.  Finchum Well, did you practice bomb drills or     Bellis Umm     Finchum    while you were in school?  Bellis We probably did. Eugene Field was a brick building, like the old kind. We would always get out in the middle. I don   t   we weren   t fearful, I don   t think, at all. We weren   t fearful at all. Then, that   s because we   re right in the middle of the country. I didn   t feel bothered, I did not.  Finchum Well, being in the grocery business, did you have to deal with rationing?  Bellis Oh yes. You not only, you would sometimes, as you were ringing up groceries, you would ring up the little  item  with the price on it. Then, there would be this other little number, and it would have a circle around. That was how many rationing points you had to use. Fruit was particularly high, just awful, because we didn   t have fruit. I don   t know why, because I know when I was in third grade, fourth grade, we had to eat    Franklin  Delano Roosevelt put us on this. He was going to take care of the school children of the world, and for a while, every day at three thirty   or what was it? Temperance, that was another lady   some sort of a club, but where we would be given a little sack. Make a little sack out of this and we   ll give you, for a while, it was an apple or an orange or a something so we would have proper food. I don   t know how that happened, because later they ran out of oranges. Then, one year we went to, probably in the second grade, we went to raisins. So I got some and the teacher said,    No. That   s not enough Betty. You   ve got to have more.    Well, we had them every day. Eventually, that summer, I got to not feeling very well. I ended up really getting sick, really sick. I was not well, and my mother kept saying,    Something is wrong with Betty. We don   t know what is wrong with Betty. We don   t know what it is.    24  Then on Labor Day, they had to take me into Stillwater Hospital. It had just been built in    39. The only thing that was open was the labor room. My appendix had apparently ruptured from all of, I think, we think, from all of the raisins that I had to eat. Then when they got inside   I had been hurting all spring. Mother kept saying,    Something   s wrong with Betty. Her eyes don   t look very good.    My pain was over here. Turns out, what they found out when they got inside and operated on Labor Day   both Dr. Smith and our Dr. Wagner, who was the family doctor, and Mother were in the delivery room. (Laughs) Turns out my appendix had burst and then it had entwined in my intestines, all around, and everything, and they had moved everything over to my left side. Therefore when they kept saying, this was 1941,    She   s sick. What   s wrong with her?       She still has an appendix. It   s over here.       No, it   s not. It   s over here.    Ended up I did survive. I barely didn   t make it, but it was very strange. I believe it all started in that March and April when we had to keep eating all of these raisins. And I don   t even mind them today. It was just so strange, that it really affected me.  Finchum Yeah. They expand.  Bellis Yeah, they do. I do remember having to say,    Why do I have to keep eating these when I really don   t think that I   m feeling very good?    That   s the way it was.  Finchum During that time too, campus had WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service)?  Bellis Uh-huh.  Finchum The WAVES? That would have been in the    40s, wouldn   t it?  Bellis Yeah.  Finchum Have any memories of that?  Bellis Of the WAVES? Yeah. I   d go up there   they didn   t match them up too fast   they just stayed   I think they put mostly the females in Willard Hall, if you know where that is? That is now     Finchum College of Ed?  Bellis Yeah. Is that what it is? Then, Murray was a woman   s dorm, but they put some of the WACs (Women   s Army Corps) there. We had people all over the place, and they had all kinds of military people all over the place. They were well appreciated by the people of Stillwater.  25  My father had a story, some sailor had gotten himself in trouble. He   d gotten himself in jail. He escaped. He and his, he was real good friends with the sheriff at the time. He ended up on the West Coast. So Daddy and the sheriff, Harley Thomas, who was the guy who had the Thomas Group, owned the Ford  car dealership  on Sixth and Main. They were going to go out and bring the sailor back. Daddy says that they get up and they were going to leave on a Saturday night and go out there and pick up this sailor and bring him back. Well, they do. The first night they leave. It   s midnight and Daddy says he   ll drive, because our family is wide awake at night, early night. He   ll drive. They hadn   t decided how to go, so he just decided he   d never been out that way, so they went the north route. (Laughs) They go out there. I don   t know how long he drives and then somebody else takes over. They pick up the sailor and they come back. Well, they hadn   t ever been to the Grand Canyon either.  They came back through, stopped at the Grand Canyon. They were all so excited to get out and see the Grand Canyon they left the keys in the car and the sailor in the car. He   s not in handcuffs or anything. They found out later, he said,    Stillwater   s such a nice place to be. I   m ready to go back.    (Laughs) He could   ve gotten out and taken the car and left them just stranded. He knew he had done wrong and had not led a good life. I always thought that was so funny. (Laughs)  Yeah. People at that time, the sailors and the Army, all of the military would want to go down to Oklahoma City, they   d get out there and just hitchhike. We never had any problem with the hitchhikers. Not that I would have done that. I don   t know, I might have. It depends, but I didn   t. They would pick up the people and take them to the city and bring them home. Then, they would visit with them. Mother said,    Some of these sailors and soldiers, they   re sad. They   re homesick for family and they just enjoy talking to somebody else.    They were well received by the people. They did all kinds of things.  Finchum Do you remember when the war was over?  Bellis Oh yes when the VE Day? Was noisy. My cousin   s husband, she   d married before he went overseas, he was a driver for Patton. I remember she was crying. I thought,    Why should she cry? She should be happy.    I was sort of a strange idiot. Anyway, he finally came back and then they lived in a little house on Jefferson and Eighth. There used to be six houses, three and three. They lived there while he went to school, engineering. My cousin Janice, who turned out to be a really sharp young lady, took a course in sociology and psychology under Dr. O.D. Duncan, who is quite the name in the sociology business. Eventually, she had taken enough courses that they had her teaching courses. I said,    I   m going to take your course.    She said,    You just realize, you   re going to have to do better than anybody else.    (Laughs) 26     Okay, maybe I shouldn   t do that.    Then they went off to California, and he was working for Boeing or somebody. Had a great life. They were very nice. It did them so much good. War helped so many people with family lives and the money they were able to find out they could make and support themselves. It changed, did so much, even by letting women go to work.  Finchum The GI Bill helped with education, too.  Bellis Yes. Yeah, I think it   s been amazing, what it did.  Finchum Well, were you there when the Japanese came to campus?  Bellis Yeah, the Nisei (Japanese-Americans). I was there. I was probably in college. Yes, I was there. I don   t remember seeing very many on campus. If I would have been at home, I   d had to walk up three houses, and then run into them. They were up there, but their children are just so cute, you know. And I don   t think they got into trouble or anything. It   d be pretty demoralizing to be having to live in a situation, when you probably had a much better life. Oklahoma is not a very good place for a garden, for people who eat a lot of veggies, and it would be tough for them to try and make a living out of   well, you look at what that soil was like up there. It wasn   t very good. I don   t know how many of them are very irritated at the world, but we can   t change that, more than anything else.  I don   t know if they ever helped anybody get back on their feet. I don   t know what they did about funding them or anything. My granddaughter was saying she was doing a study of the Nisei being brought back. I said,    Well you ought to check out Stillwater.    She said,    What do you mean?    I said,    We had them up there in 1945.       Oh?    She didn   t know that. Now why in the world doesn   t the world know that? She was going to D.C. on a discussion group. That   s the stupidest thing I ever heard of, I didn   t tell her that. I was like,    Who   s hiding all this information?     Finchum People just don   t think about it.  Bellis Probably. They probably don   t and they   re gone. I don   t know that very many people stayed here.  Finchum Well, you have seen a lot of changes in town.  Bellis I have seen a lot of the changes in town. I really loved it. Stillwater   s just a really good place.  Finchum Do you get into the mix when it   s Bedlam time?  27  Bellis No. No, in fact my son is an avid OU person. That   s fine. I do not normally read the sports page. I do read to see who   s playing. Then I   ll put it over here. This is my     Finchum Recycle pile.  Bellis When I was in college, I went to every game that I could. I went to every basketball, not to the avidness of Mary Joyce (Hurst), and I went to the wrestling matches. One of the things I did in college that was kind of a fun thing. My friend Wilma, her husband changed her name to Jenny, got along real well with Mr. Anderson in the English department. He was probably head of it at one time. He told her,    We need somebody to help be ushers.    We had what we called the A and the B classical series, or B is for pop series. They   d have people that came in every so often with all these wonderful programs. OU did it too. They call them, one   s classical and one   s   after a while nobody went to the classical ones. They kind of dropped that one. Now, they put the pops in some screening rooms, Lloyd Noble or something. You know how bad that stuff is. We were paid a dollar-and-a-half, I believe, to usher for the classics or the other series.  We went to   let me see, I have to think about this. We normally took care of everybody that came in but most of the time they never ever filled them for the classical series. One year they did have, the people who performed   got to think what this giant movie was. There was  James Cagney  as Captain  Morton  who was always knobbing together some metal balls or something. It was Mister Roberts is what I think it was called. Henry Fonda was the commander. I can   t recall who the other person was. Anyway, that was held in the basketball  arena , Gallagher Hall. That place was, you would never believe how quite it could be. It had to do with an event, this Captain  Morton  was this brutal guy, but it was no noise, not at all, at times. You could have heard a pin drop and that place is full of people. It was just kind of eerie. We seated people. We had certain people setting on the floor, and so we would take them to their seats, and then, all the balcony and everything was full. It was a spectacular performance, and it was right after     It was something about the   something happened in the South Pacific. Mr.  Morton  was, Captain  Morton , or whomever he was, it was just an outstanding thing. To get that whole place where nothing was happening and everything. I was very impressed. Then, they had another couple of things that were really good. We used to have dances in Gallagher Hall. We had Tommy Dorsey and Jimmy Dorsey and some of the big bands, which was wonderful. Everybody enjoyed it. The only thing that I didn   t like about it was that that guy from New York had limited them to   he   s out of New York. He   s a guy that runs the music, what is his name? Not Omni,  Owen Miller  anyway, he limited them. They had to play twenty minutes, and then 28  they had to stop for twenty minutes so that the musicians wouldn   t wear out. That   s the guy from New York who ran the   what do we call it?  American Federation of Musicians   Finchum The only thing I can think of is Julliard? That   s not     Bellis No, it   s the legal part of it, you know. They have their own, the musicians have their own, whatever they are. I   m very much against organizations that tell you what you can and cannot do. (Laughs) I got to do that every semester for probably second semester junior, maybe even sooner, just to be able to help people find their seats. Of course, we   d get to sit in on all the performances themselves, which I thought was pretty good. Some of them were not as full, but were pretty good. We got to see both the A and B series.  Finchum So you did have a little fun?  Bellis Had a lot of fun. Got paid a little bit, dollar-and-a-half. (Laughs) I also, in my fourth year spring semester   Doel Reed, who is the gentleman who was in charge of the art department. Of course I had been up there for four semesters, looking at all the different slides of everything. He knew me. His wife worked at the bank. He said,    Betty, would you be interested in modeling for some of our evening classes?    He said,    It   s a class of mostly Stillwaterites,    a couple of doctors, Bob Manning, who had a construction store, some other people, just older people who come in and then they want to draw. I said,    Oh well, a dollar-and-a-half an hour. That might be okay.    I was telling my daughter and she said,    I hope you wore clothes.    (Laughs)  Finchum That   s what I was thinking too.  Bellis Well, I was taking modern dance that semester so I had a leotard. I didn   t ask, and he didn   t say. I thought I better wear the leotard. Nobody said,    Take it off, take it off, take it off.    I really enjoyed it. It was really nice. I did not embarrass the family. It was really a lot of fun. I had never done anything like that. It was   until some guy comes up,    You know your thighs are very much like the night and day    And I thought,    Oh dear  Those are big thighs. Maybe I better go exercise a few more.    (Laughs) That   s funny.  Finchum Doel Reed, I think he did aquatints?  Bellis He did all his work out in   where is it? I would like to go out to his center.  Finchum In Taos.  Bellis Taos, yeah. I would like to do that. 29  Finchum They had a daughter, Martha. Did you know her?  Bellis Yes, I did. She was a Chi Omega. Martha, she had a middle name. We called her Martha Lou. She was my cousin   s age. Martha Lee, it wasn   t that.  Martha Jane  She was the one that invented the broomstick skirt. I think her mother worked in the bank. I think so. I did know them also. They were very, everybody was just small town.  Finchum I think they had a home in College Heights, is that right? College     Bellis College Circle?  Finchum    over there somewhere?  Bellis Called College Circle. It was back up off of what we called, at the time, College Avenue. Now, it   s University Avenue. I can   t remember. Her mother was a little red haired. He didn   t have much hair. I was just thinking that, yeah. She was about six years older than I. I didn   t know she was the inventor of the broomstick skirts. I did cut out her obituary when it was in the paper sometime back. I thought,    That   s intriguing.     Finchum Who was the president of the college when you were there? Do you remember?  Bellis To begin with, it was Dr. Bennett. I was there when Dr. Bennett and his wife were killed in the plane crash in Ethiopia. My mother knew them from Durant. Then, Dr. Willham. I understand Diana calls him Willhum, but we called him Dr. Will-ham, and his son, Richard, was in my high school class. He was one of the smart guys. When I was a junior in high school, I took a physics class, a sixth hour physics class, and there was Richard Willham, Ed Tengly, who was one of the sharpest gentleman I   ve ever, at that time, to know. Then, Jimmy Patterson, who was one of the best goof-offs around, and then another girl and I. It was because sixth hour was the hour when it was football. Richard, later played, end on the football team. I can   t believe his mother let him play, but she did. He played for a couple years, just as an end. Literally, I never saw him catch the ball. He was real good looking.  I was treasurer of the Student Council, and he was secretary of the Student Council, and George Kennedy, who didn   t live too long, was the president. Yeah, Richard and I were good friends, just good friends. He was just one of my very, very best friends. Ed Tengly, this guy that was so smart, I don   t know how he got his smarts. He graduated from Stillwater High School, and went off   he was going to go be an orcom, do a summer job at one of the fire places up in Idaho or some place, then he was going off to the Navy. He had an appointment to the Navy, Naval Academy. They had a big fire up 30  there, and he had been working the fire and he was going back up to his station and collapsed and died before he could get back up to his station. I kept thinking, what an absolute waste. He was such a fine, smart person. He didn   t appear in Stillwater High School until about maybe a sophomore. He just, he was just another one of my really great   we had such a good time in class.  Finchum With less than ten people, you   d have to know     Bellis That   s right, and Mrs. Johnston, her husband was a chemistry professor at OSU, A M, she was a high school. She was a cute little lady, and first day of class she says,    I   m going to call the roll.    She gets down to Edison, and she said    Ed, what does Ed stand for.    He said,    Ed.    Every day for two-and-a-half weeks, she asks him every day, what does Ed stand for.    Ed.    (Edison) We   d just be rolling in the floor and everything. (Laughs) She was so sweet and so determined and everything. He was great. Richard was in there. Martha Bowman, and Jimmy Patterson, and it was a very memorable class.  Then, the day that, that   s when all the people were coming back from the war, the veterans were coming back from the war. So we got an education with teachers who were learning to be teachers. They come in this one time and we were going to have a test. That   s good. I   m going to go study, but my sister had been quite a modern dancer. She was on campus that year, and they were having a performance that evening. Well, that   s fine. I go up and I go up to the college auditorium. I   m sitting there and I   m studying away, and studying away, and this guy sits next to me and says    Oh, I see you   re studying physics.    I said,    Yes I am.    He says,    Well, what are you?    I said,    Well, I   ve got a test tomorrow and I   ve got this teacher.    He said,    Well who do you have?    I said,    Well he   s a student teacher.    I made a few comments. He said,    How   s he doing?    I said,    Well I   m learning a lot because he   s really showing us the equations and he   s really good.     He was probably twenty-six, twenty-eight, obviously married, lived in Veterans Village. He said,    You know, I   m his professor who takes class for these students who are learning to teach. How   s he doing?    I said,    Well he needs better grammar.    (Laughter) I   m thinking,    Oh dear, what have I done for that poor boy?    He needed better grammar. I don   t know if the teacher finally told him, or I just thought that was kind of funny. I didn   t want to ruin his   because he was a great teacher. I just really learned a whole bunch from him. Didn   t want to blackmail him or anything. I did say the next day,    I hope I get a good grade because I talked to your teacher last night.    (Laughs) We had the advantage of having all the good and bad, one of the things that Stillwater High School had. All the good and bad teachers, they were trying to learn to be teachers.  31  Finchum You mentioned when they came back from war, they wore jeans, or not jeans?  Bellis They were all in khakis, when they came back.  Finchum Well, before was it all jeans?  Bellis Well see, one of the guys I dated   I dated three Deans one year, my freshman year. One was a Dean with blue eyes who was a forestry major. One was Dean who was a football player. He was from Woodward and really good looking, really good. Then, there was another Dean I knew through the church who had beautiful blue eyes. He   d sit in the car when I took all the kids back. I had a car, other people didn   t. Take them back to the dorm after Sunday night services. He turned out to be a geology major. Most of them wore either khakis or they wore jeans. The forestry majors were the ones that I noticed wore jeans the most. I didn   t ever date anyone that I know of, that was an agriculture major. I just didn   t. I obviously didn   t have any classes with them. Just certain kind of classes you had with the people.  Finchum You have a great memory.  Bellis Yeah.  Finchum Remember all of this.  Bellis Yeah, I had a wonderful time. I was just there.  Finchum There was a group about that same time led by Alexander? He did things with music.  Bellis Oh yes. From Pawnee?  Finchum Yes, I can   t remember his  first name . His last name was Alexander.  Bellis Oh, it was the Alexander family. Yeah, and he did a lot of performing around the state. Yes, and one of the young ladies who played the marimba or xylophone or something, was a Stillwater girl, and they had an accident. I   m trying to think of her name. A couple years after I had left the university, they had an accident and the   her marimba or xylophone was in the back of the car and when it came forward, it decapitated her. She was a Stillwater girl. I know and I can almost tell you who she is, but I can   t quite remember, but yeah. He, they entertained Rotary clubs and other people. Just really fine people, and the whole family was good. I always thought how sad that was. Who would ever thing about, who would think about having to stabilize it? Yeah.  32  Finchum That was the days before seat belts too, not that that would have made a difference either.  Bellis They didn   t have seat belts. I was living in Norman, and my second university housing. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, speaking of Norman, do you consider Norman home or Stillwater home?  Bellis Well, for my children   s sake, since they are both Norman High graduates, and both of them are OU graduates. Although, my daughter Karen went back to UCO  University of Central Oklahoma  and got a degree in dietetics when she decided that this business with geology is, as we have seen, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, all the time. Her husband is retired now, from Statoil, so she is probably not interested in going back to school. They are very simple, and they have, they followed the   what is Dear Dave Ramsey plan and they paid their house off. For somebody that is fifty-six, I think that is pretty darn     Finchum Very good.  Bellis They   re taking some trips now. I don   t   the problem has been this. I said,    What are we going to do with me?    Karen says she and Mark plan to do just the naturalized in-ground service, where you just deteriorate in the ground.    Fine. That   s a good way.    So I asked Doug. Then I was talking to the lady here that came in one day. She said,    Well now Betty, you said you   re an organ donor.    I said,    Well I don   t have to worry about where I   m going to be buried. Good.    My parents are buried in Stillwater. I love Stillwater. I look at all the people who die in Stillwater and all that information, but they   re not a lot of even my friends that are there. As long as nobody   s upset about something I don   t care, when you get right down to it, you know. It   s not something   I guess some families are very much against it, but I   m okay with it. You can build a mountain out of a mole hill oftentimes. It doesn   t make any difference. We   re not that concerned, I don   t think.  Finchum Well, you   ve spent more of your life here?  Bellis Here, now. Yeah, I was there twenty-five years, twenty-four years.  Finchum Stillwater is still probably home, home?  Bellis It is. Basically, I love the campus and I like just being able to go up there, and my daughter took me up to OSU a couple of years ago. We had a   my Chi Omega class met. There were eighteen of us that were still alive, a couple were a couple classes behind us. That was a lot of fun. It   s changed a 33  lot, but you know, I don   t care. I   m happy with it. Our store has changed, but it   s not exactly. We decorated it up. (Laughs)  Finchum What did you have to do in order to get to do that, the mural  of Cooksey   s Corner on the outside wall of the building ? Fork over the money and that was it?  Bellis Well, they were talking about it. We   d seen that some people had done that. Bob Palmer, from UCO, who is an art professor, he had done some murals in Hominy and Cushing. He   s done some in Norman since then. They   re gorgeous. They   re good. What they do, and we got to put together the things that were sort of important to us, then they kind of set it out. My sister said   (Doris Anne were still alive at the time). He came and brought his students with him. They planned what they were going to do. They came in one Friday night, and they projected on the our south wall, which is pretty big, and they drew on the lines, and the next day, they went back and painted it all, which was just really intriguing. I think it   ll last quite a long time. We were tickled. The only problem the family had, my sister had, for some reason. There were four children in our family, and in the picture, there   s Mother with three children. We don   t know who   s been left out. It   s not worth worrying about. It is kind of an interesting thing.  Finchum I   ll have to drive by on my way home and take another look at it. I mean, I   ve seen it before but just haven   t stopped to look close.  34  Bellis Yeah, but you have to stop and study it and everything. Yeah.  Finchum I wondered what the Cooksey connection was?  Bellis Well, Mr.  Cooksey    Cooksey   s Corner   when Daddy was eight, nine, and ten, he said when he first started out, he was the bottom of six children. He would get up in the morning and go buy a nickel hotdog. He had papers, he was going to sell papers. He was a little dinky, scrawny kid I   m sure. He would go buy and he   d sell one hot dog. He got two hot dogs for a nickel at that time. He would  buy  two. He would eat one, and then he would sell one. Then, he would have enough to go buy some more. He   s six, seven, or eight, I don   t know. Then, as he got older, he figured out that   he said you could always sell something. (Laughs) Then, he would meet people, and he   d sell them another hot dog or something.  Of course, they weren   t worried about anything clean, because everything was just like the world was, (laughs) you know. Then when he was ten or eleven, he   d go into Mr. Cooksey   s store, whose name was Ben something Cooksey. He   d go in and he noticed he needed to straighten up this cabinet. You know how some people needed to empty and move stuff up, he started. He said you can always make a job for yourself. One time when he was separating eggs or something, Mr. Cooksey said,    Hey would you like a job?    He said,    I sure would.    He started working for him. He worked for him all during high school, and all. That was wonderful. That   s probably what saved a lot of people. I just think it   s a hoot. My brother who was a bottom of the three girls, his middle name is C. It   s Cooksey. He   s Ben Cooksey Douglas.  Finchum Wow.  Bellis That   s where he   we all laugh about that. During the war, when bananas were hard to get, some other fruits were hard to get. Hersey bars, they made the little Hersey bars this long, were very hard to get. Daddy would always go over to Guthrie on Sunday afternoons. My brother Ben would come back with a whole box of twenty-four of those nickel Hersey bars and some bananas. My brother Ben likes bananas. He likes Jell-O. He does not like Jell-O with bananas in it. He was a spoiled brat; I   ve told him many a time. (Laughs) He never can mix them, but he   ll eat them individually. We just think that   s sort of funny. (Laughs) My brother Ben is very active in Rotary. My father was a Rotarian for sixty-seven years, perfect attendance and everything. That   s why, on that thing (mural), there   s a giant, huge Rotary symbol on it. I said it looked like the sun and they just laughed. Daddy was a very strong Rotarian. He was always giving out their little card, the rules of Rotary and other things, so he was very adamant.  35  Finchum Well, did your brother share the candy?  Bellis Not very often. You see, I sat next to him at the table, and the Sunday dinner was Mother at the top and Daddy at the wall, and I   m over there. Ben   s to my left, and Judy   s the youngest girl, she   s setting there, Doris over here. If he didn   t sit up straight, my fork would jab him in the back. He needed to learn how to sit up, and he still loves me. (Laughs)  Finchum You all sat in the same spot every time?  Bellis Yeah, that was just our Sunday dinner because Daddy was so busy working that he did not really, most of the time, he   d come home and have lunch before we did. We had different lunch hours for a while. Daddy would want to come home and eat first, and he   d lie down in front of the radio and listen to the news. He wanted to hear the news, and that way he didn   t have to put up with us. (Laughs) He was really a good dad. We laughed about that.  Finchum Who would discipline if you got into trouble?  Bellis Well, most of the time it was Mother did first. If you really were bad, then you had a session with Daddy.  Finchum A session would involve just being talked to or would he spank?  Bellis Depended on how bad you had been. I really pushed him several times. One time, I was in probably seventh or eighth grade, I was going through my Russian period. I was reading Mom Poppanov, Pop Poppanov, Sister Poppanov and all on and on. They put up with me for so long. So this one time   one Sunday dinner we   d had a really nice dessert. Mother always had nice desserts. I said,    Hey Pop Poppanov, would you just toss me another piece of cake?    He reaches out there with his fork, gets it right underneath it, and he goes whoop. It goes bloop, bloop, bloop, plop, right onto my plate. (Laughs) One up for Daddy. He just shut me up real well. Everybody loved it. They thought that was pretty darn crazy.  We did survive, though, which was the only way to do. Then we   d travel with him. He would always tell you things you needed to know. On Saturdays, when I would work with him, he   d say,    I   m going to go home for lunch.    He would say,    Now Bets       (He called me B-E-T-S.)       we got this kind of peaches, that kind of stuff. Kind of talk it up to the client, the people, remind them about some of our specials.    On the way back, it would be,    You need to be nicer to your mother.    (Laughs)    Don   t be so rude to your mother.    Mother knew I was mostly kidding. He was very definitely behind her. We knew who really   he would tell people later on, most of the time he   d say,    Your mama is the one who takes care of the house and you 36  all, and she has a harder job than I have.    Of course, he   d be gone ten hours a day, and everything, but it was just, he had tremendous respect.  He played baseball with his cigar. They accused him of having two bats. (Laughs) He would, we were supposed to be very respectful to Mother. I always thought that was pretty funny, when he would chew on me about,    You need to be nicer to your mother. Quit telling her about being old.    I would buy her books, silly books, about getting older. He thought that was probably not nice. Anyway she loved her golf. He quit playing golf, he hadn   t played golf in a while. He didn   t take it up anymore. He actually just let her do it. He was so thrilled when she did well on the golf. He just supported her. That was, it was just really wonderful. He really enjoyed that.  Finchum Did she get any hole-in-ones?  Bellis Yes, I think she did. Some place.  Finchum That   s always important to a golfer.  Bellis It is. She played later. She played at the Stillwater Country Club. They bought a membership out there after a while. We used to go out there and have dinner quite a bit. It was really nice. It was wonderful. We had a really good time with everybody. The whole family got along real well. I said,    If they would not have this word    siblings,    people would get along a lot better.    We weren   t allowed to be siblings. We don   t do that. We get along.    You all work it out. You get along.    Fine. I said,    If those psychologists would shut up   ,    (laughs)       we   d get along.     Finchum Was it hard leaving Stillwater when you moved away, thinking you   d never come back to live?  Bellis No, because I knew I   d be back enough with, at that time, two sisters were living there.  Finchum Just to visit.  Bellis Yeah. My older sister, I would always go back, and when she moved back to take care of Mother and Daddy, both had lost their eyesight with macular degeneration. She came back to stay with them and take care of them. My job then was to, self-appointed, to pick her up in Stillwater, and take her to events. I go to a lot of events. I go to the Philharmonic in Oklahoma City, and I go to the classics and the pops, and I go to attractions. She, having been a dancer, loves that kind of stuff. I would get her, make sure, my brother would help, my sister would help, bring her down here on the weekends and put somebody else in to help take care of Mother or Daddy in Stillwater so she would have a nice break. She was a smoker, which was not 37  always a good thing but she was and made sure she had enough money for cigarettes, cream for her coffee, and butter for her bread. Those were the things that were so important to her. I said, you know, that   s fine. She should   ve given up smoking, we know that. She didn   t. It   s probably what killed her. She said she knew that. That   s fine, because it was her choice.  Finchum Did the other three go to OSU?  Bellis My brother went for two-and-a-half years. He was a Kappa Sig ma , very active in Kappa Sig alumni group. Judy and   her husband went to become an electrical engineer up there. She did real well. Harv did real well. My older sister had six children. I had two. My other sister, Judy, had five; four boys and one girl. Then, Ben, brother Ben had one girl and three boys. Terri  Ventress  went to OSU. Let   s see   his only daughter went to OSU. His oldest boy eventually went through the fire protection. Ben will tell you, if you want to get a degree where you   ll 99 percent get a job, that   s what you go into. Now, his oldest son, he has three children. All three of them are in the fire protection. He keeps chewing on his other children to go on to school. He didn   t quite finish because by that time, he and his wife were married, and then they kind of quit.  His second son is a nurse. Actually, his degree came from, he has a master   s from UCO, I think, in nursing. He is a nurse in   I think maybe some place in Kansas he got his master   s in that. He is a nurse in Colorado. My older sister eventually got herself a degree. She had left here and gone up to Colorado and did well. She had six children. Then, she got rid of her  husband , so she   then she taught school. She got her degree in Greeley. She taught there and very proud of her for that. She was going to be a phys ed teacher in the ninth grade, but she wasn   t going to college. (Laughs) We think that   s kind of clever, but that   s okay. She found out later she needed to do that but she was a foster care girl for a long time, but she did get her teacher   s degree. Then, she had a foster home up in the mountains for really bad boys.  Finchum Takes a lot of patience.  Bellis Yes. She   s this tall. She   s little. She said one time she had a new boy in from Denver. She had six boys in one room and six in another. She thinks there might be some shenanigans the night when the first guy comes in. She goes in there, and she knows something   s wrong. She sees one of them is crouching down on the ground. She goes over there and cups him under his chin. Hits him so hard that he rolls clear across the floor and of course gets everybody   s attention. She never had problems out of him anymore. (Laughs)    Okay, I won   t worry about you.    She had quite a life. She wouldn   t give up smoking, so that   s what happened.  38  Finchum Okay.  Bellis She was a hard worker, wonderful cook. My sister Judy is a wonderful cook. Somebody asked me,    What kind of food do you like?    I said,    Something that somebody else has fixed.    (Laughter)  Finchum Not home ec?  Bellis Yeah, again. It   s not home ec. See, I was the middle girl. I was working on Saturdays. I knew how to clean. We all learned how to clean. I didn   t need to clean or cook because I   d be off working. I thought it was a pretty good deal.  Finchum Supper was waiting on you when you got home?  Bellis Sometimes or I   d go out for dinner. In college, I went out for dinner a lot. I just thought that was pretty funny.  Finchum A pretty good life.  Bellis Very nice. Very nice. Somebody asked   my daughter-in-law said something to Doug once. She said,    I understand your mom used to be a pretty good cook.    (Laughs) I said,    Yeah I was, so why should I do it now?    Yeah, yeah.  Finchum You have lived in Norman     Bellis    since 1956.  Finchum Since 1956. Has it changed a lot too? I   m not familiar with Norman?  Bellis Norman is a very good place for children to grow up, for people to go to school. They have a good education program. I   ve been really pleased. I   ve enjoyed working with most of the people at the university. My jobs have always been where I didn   t really have to grapple with them. It never really bothered me. I wasn   t too involved in a lot of the politics. Working with the survey, the survey was a different entity from the   it used to be a total different budget than the university. It was much better. Now, it   s kind of part of the university. All kinds of things that go on there, as we know, it   s not good. We have too much regimentation and all sorts of stuff.  Finchum Grant funding, and various different ways of getting funding, it gets complicated, I know.  Bellis Yeah, and all of what you can get done, and who you have to fight, it   s picky. One of the OSU professors had written a story, a novel about forty 39  years ago, thirty years ago. Trying to think what his name was. It was very interesting about politics of the universities. I just try not to   I try not to get involved in that. I   m just glad that I   m not in it. It   s just   got to have some control. When Charlie was working with   Charlie worked with seven governors, as head of the Geological Survey. When you get seven governors, different kinds, different ones, and what they do, but his was a state event. You know, it   s been very interesting. I can say right now that I am pleased for him that he is not alive. It would be a terrible time to fight for the money that the state has to give you. He did a lot of work on a national level. It would be a terrible time to be involved in all that right now.  Finchum Did he have a favorite?  Bellis Actually, he got along real well with David Hall, even though David Hall is the one that went to prison. He would listen to him. You would get some that don   t listen to them. David Walters didn   t.  Finchum What about Henry Bellmon?  Bellis Well, he loved Henry. Henry was good. When Henry Bellmon was going to be signing his autobiography, it was the day I got my hair done. Oh dear. I knew where he was going to be. I called up the bookstore out here in the mall. The guy kind of recognized my voice. I hadn   t bought very much in there, but he recognized my voice. I said,    When is Henry Bellmon going to be there today?    He said,    Well       I said,    I   ve got to get my hair done, and I was hoping to buy a book and I wanted it dedicated.    He said,    Tell me who you want it made to.    I said,    Charles Mankin.    I said,    I   ll be there probably after two thirty.    So he did. It was the nicest thing.    Thank you Charles, I have enjoyed working with you.    What a nice thing. Isn   t it good that you go in and bother somebody and they kind of remember who you are? (Laughs) That was probably, I don   t remember how many years ago, but he really enjoyed Henry because he was so open.  Finchum He   s a good part of Oklahoma history.  Bellis Yeah.  Finchum Bellmon   s contributions.  Bellis Yeah, we are so lucky to have some people that are really good. We just keep hoping. (Laughs)  Finchum I think we   ve covered a lot. Is there anything else?  Bellis Yeah, probably way too much than what you wanted.  40  Finchum No, it   s been great. Is there anything else you want to add before we close?  Bellis All I can say is that I   ve watched OSU grow. My husband said that the reason they changed their name is it was the year after I graduated. (Laughter) He was a University of Texas grad, three times. We thought that was always funny.    Yeah, she went to OSU and then they changed their name     (Laughs)  Finchum Then they booted you out of the county?  Bellis They booted us out of the county. That   s right, that   s right. It   s all this. Actually I have enjoyed the group here. I think they   ve done a really good job. We liked that. There   s a lot of interesting people. I don   t remember them all, but I had some really   . Going to school with good people, very nice.  Finchum The OU fans don   t give you too hard of a time?  Bellis No. In fact the reason we lived out northeast is because I had gone one semester in my junior year, between junior and senior year of college, I had gone to the University of Colorado for some more English literature and a Shakespeare course and something else. My friend Wilma and I, Wilma Beckman who was from Kingfisher. That is pretty darn OSU-ish out there. That   s just fine with me. We go out there and this is the year, it was the Boulder game, the game before OU lost the first time to Notre Dame. The tickets that we had, that Bill and I had, were two rows down from the top of the stadium. I was going. I was trying to be nice, with the mouth shut, but I wasn   t. At the very last, right before   it   s tied up. I guess OU does something to win the game, and right before, it   s all very quiet and I say,    Go Colorado     (Laughs)  That night, we were at a party, one of my good friends, a Chi Omega, from Oklahoma City. Her husband was an engineering student from OU. I always said he was going to learn how to   as an agricultural student, he was going to learn how to electrify all the barns. That   s why he was the engineering guy here. He said to me,    Betty, I   ve just got to tell you. I was ashamed to say I knew you.    (Laughs) I think that   s enough. I guess I shan   t do that every again and I won   t go to anymore ballgames. The only times I went was a couple of times when it was really cold and we had some different seats, and OSU won, beat OU. It was cold. I just sat there quietly. (Laughs) And my son is so avid. He   s just wild. It   s good for him to go and enjoy it. I just think it   s funny. A game   s a game.  Finchum Pretty much, at the end of the day.  41  Bellis Yeah, so I was very proud of them. I   m proud when they do well, and hope they do it all the time, but it doesn   t bother me.  Finchum Maybe just drag you to a few more or at least make you watch it on TV?  Bellis Well, Mary Joyce may put it on there, but sometimes I can   t quite get there in time. (Laughs) She is so cute about being so avid about that.  Finchum You guys have had a long friendship.  Bellis We have, yes. She   s been really good. When I was taking care of Robin, sometimes I needed to get something sewn. I would get it out, four o   clock she would get off at the bank, I   d get out, put it over here. When she   d come pick up Robin, I would sort of be stumbling.    I can   t even   .    (Laughs)    Give me that.    Mary Joyce is an instant person. I   m not. I   m sort of a calm person. She said,    I   ll take that home. I   ll do that.       Oh, well how nice.    (Laughter) She is so cute.  Finchum Give and take.  Bellis Exactly right.  Finchum Well, I appreciate you taking the time.  Bellis It   s fine. It   s a good afternoon. I   d already scared away the lady who came and thought she was going to give me a bath at nine thirty this morning. I don   t want a bath at nine thirty in the morning. I don   t even want to be up. (Laughter) I   m not of that ilk.  -------  -------
