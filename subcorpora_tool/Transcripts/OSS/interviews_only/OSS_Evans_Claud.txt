 Gill, and today is February 16, 2009. I   m visiting with  Dr. Claud Evans in his home here in Okemah, Oklahoma. This interview  is for the O-State Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Dr. Evans, I appreciate you taking time to visit with us today.  Thank you.  I want to start at the beginning, is that okay? Can you tell me a little bit  about where you grew up, a little bit about your family life and your  family?  Okay. I was born and reared at Poteau, Oklahoma, southeast Oklahoma.  The youngest of fifteen children   eleven of us grew up to be adults, four  died as infants. I went to Poteau-Dunbar grade school, which was the  black school at the time there at Poteau, and I went to junior high at  Pansey Kidd Junior High School, which was an integrated school, and  then to Poteau High School. I graduated from Poteau High School in  1961. My mom basically was an at-home mom. My dad did carpentry  work and ministry work, and we always had a parent at home.  Claud, your father, was he a Baptist minister?  Correct, Baptist minister and      A minister   s son.  I   m one of those, what you call PKs   preacher   s kids or something.  That   s right. If you could tell me a little bit about   your family has a  long history, and I was trying to remember from an earlier conversation,  did your grandparents come from Texas on a covered wagon or  something?  6  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Actually in 1903, my dad was twelve years old at the time, he and his  other siblings and his mom and dad and seven other families left  Yoakum, Texas, by wagon train coming to Indian territory. They  actually finally ended up at Tiger Mountain, which is over by Henryetta.  It is about twenty to twenty-five miles from here. I guess they spent their  first nights after they got to this area in a town called Grayson, and my  granddad died there not too long after they got here, and one of my  uncles died there in that area.  Later on, my dad and the family moved to Howe, Oklahoma, where they  worked in the coal mines. And then of course my dad met my mom, and  they later lived at Poteau, and that   s where the majority of us were born  and grew up. Some of my older brothers and sisters were, I think, born  in Howe, Oklahoma. My dad was working in the coal mines there. He  and my Uncle Claud moved their families to Poteau, and that   s where  we ended up settling in, but they started at Yoakum, Texas.  So your father then was a working minister? He worked nights and  preached?  Yes, he was a working minister.  What do you remember about your early days in the church with your  father?  Well, we didn   t have a nursery at our church, but there was still no  foolishness out of the kids. (Laughter) I don   t even remember, but one of  the things that I   m told is that I was, I guess, making more noise than I  needed to make when I was small, and he actually came out of the pulpit  and took care of me and (Laughter) set me back down, and that was it,  and I guess I   ve been quiet in church ever since   and, in fact,  sometimes      Claud, did your father die when you were younger?  He died when I was thirteen years old.  That would be a pretty traumatic experience for you, with all that many  children.  Well I was the youngest, so there weren   t any younger kids, and I was  thirteen, but it was a bad weekend, because the same weekend that my  dad died someone poisoned my dog. I had a little old dog named  Rounder, and someone was going through the neighborhood poisoning  dogs about that time, and both of them died the same weekend. I still  remember both of them quite well.  7  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  You   re here in Poteau, and Oklahoma State   s a long ways away. What  influenced you to come to Oklahoma State University, Claud?  Well when I was probably about seven or eight years old, a black  veterinarian, J. W. Montgomery, who was on the Board of Regents for  Oklahoma State University, moved to our community. He was really the  tallest man I think I had ever seen and had the biggest hands of any man  that I   d ever seen and was just quite impressive. He and Mrs.  Montgomery moved there, and so that was my introduction to veterinary  medicine in knowing Dr. Montgomery. When my dad died, he was  actually just like a father that stepped in because he did a lot of  counseling with me. I still send him a Father   s Day card on Father   s  Day, and when Mrs. Montgomery was living, I sent her a Mother   s Day  card because that   s kind of the relationship. I had tremendous respect for  Dr. and Mrs. Montgomery and what he would say. He would tell me  when I did something wrong, and he would tell me when I did  something right. So he played a huge part in my selecting veterinary  medicine as a career pathway.  So you came to OSU with the intention of being a veterinarian?  That is correct. When I left high school, I came to OSU with the  intentions of being a veterinarian.  Well Claud, you came in the fall of    61. Is that right?  September of    61.  Can you tell me what your first impressions of Oklahoma State were?  It   s a pretty big place.  It   s a big place, but fortunately my mom and I had visited the campus  the summer before. We had gone up, and so I had seen the campus  before coming there as a freshman. But one of my older brothers would  come from Wichita and pick me up, and I had a big old footlocker-type  suitcase. It wasn   t a suitcase   footlockers   put all my stuff in it because  I didn   t have a car, so I was headed off to school for the year, literally.  He would come and pick me up in September, transport me to Stillwater,  and I would ... Of course you get to meet students, and I met students  from Leflore County that had cars and things, and so I was able to come  home for Thanksgiving and get home for Christmas. Then in May, at the  end of school, he would come and pick me up and take me back to  Poteau. But one brother kind of took it as his responsibility to get me to  school at the beginning of the school year and to pick me up in May, and  anything in the middle I was kind of on my own. (Laughter)  8  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  So you were going to be a veterinarian, but did you have a major as an  undergraduate?  I have a degree from Oklahoma State in agricultural biochemistry.  Do you recall some professors there that influenced your development  that were influential to you?  Oh, Fred LeCrone was probably one of the positive influences. He was a  really nice man   a really a nice person. Dr. Jones, Randall Jones, was  the dean of the School of Agriculture at that time. He was a nice person.  The teachers   it   s a little bit harder to remember any specifics unless  you   re remembering something that wasn   t quite as nice, and we won   t  go into those things. But one of the teachers that probably scared me the  most was my freshman Animal Husbandry, Dr. Whiteman   Dr. Joe  Whiteman. He was so big, and boy, he could scare you  (Laughs) He  could scare you to death, and so you would tend to want to study and  you didn   t want him on your bad side. But Dr. LeCrone, Fred Lecrone,  Dr. Randall Jones, the dean, were probably the most influential. Dr.  LeCrone was my advisor, and I think he must have been one of the  better advisors at Oklahoma State University at that time, because I  think he really cared about students and really tried to help them a lot.  Were there any black professors on campus at that time? Did you have  any courses      Oh, no, no, no, no, no   we   re talking 1961. There were no black  professors. I think there was one person that was a graduate student that  maybe helped   the guy from Arkansas   that maybe helped as a  graduate student, but there were no black professors in    61 nor    62 nor     63 nor    64. (Laughs)  Well, and picking up on that, at that time, you were still probably one of  the earlier African-American students on campus. Do you recall how  many students there were? Can you recall?  Oh, mostly   there were quite a few athletes on campus at that time.  There weren   t a lot. Number-wise, I   m thinking maybe fifty or seventy-five  at the most, but I would have to really stretch my imagination, I  think, to reach seventy-five. But I think I could probably, in    61, maybe  come up with fifty, maybe.  Did you feel comfortable on campus? I hope you   ll feel free to answer  this the way you feel. Did you feel welcomed by white students at that  time?  9  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Some, and some not. One of the things that I learned over time is, I  personally have a radar system that just kind of goes off sometimes, and  I think it   s right the majority of the time. I just get a feel for a person  when I meet them, speak to them, look in their eye, and you kind of get a  feel for,    Is this person a good person or a person that maybe you  distance yourself from?    There were excellent students there, but there  were some that   just like today   that were not, by my definition,  genuine excellent people.  Was there much social interaction between black and white students in  your era?  Not a lot. Again, there was some, but not a lot. In    61, probably the big  social event of the week was Sunday night when everybody that had left  campus came back to campus and would all meet on the fourth floor of  the Student Union. A lot of us   I shouldn   t say all, that   s not a good  statement, but many of us would meet on the fourth floor of the Student  Union where, you know, they had the little coffee bar up there where  you could get cokes and coffee and have the jukebox in the room there,  and you had a chance to meet with your friends. In fact, that   s where I  met Elayne, on the fourth floor of the Student Union.  You   re getting ahead of my story. (Laughter) We   ll get back there. You  talked about some of your professors, some were more receptive than  others. Did you have some less than positive interaction with some of the  white students at the time? Was that ever a problem for you?  Not a major problem because, again, you learn how to avoid many  situations. You don   t put yourself into certain situations that can lead to  problems. But sure, there were individuals that weren   t real concerned  about the wording that they used at times, but they were the exception  rather than the rule. And again, as I said, I basically didn   t put myself  into that situation often. But probably from an instructor point of view,  the most negative situations would probably come from the graduate  student helpers that were there. They were the ones back then that did a  lot of grading of your papers, many of them handled the laboratories,  and you were more likely in my case to run into people that you felt  were not genuine among that level of instructor, the graduate student  level, versus the professors.  I think there   s a little difference, sometimes now maybe papers are  graded      I personally know that there was a little bit of difference sometimes in  the way papers were graded. I remember going once to one of my  instructors, Dr. Johnson in the chemistry department, because I felt that I  10  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  hadn   t received a just evaluation. Of course, back in the    60s, students  had no rights. (Laughs) It doesn   t matter if you were black, white,  yellow, green, purple   if you were a student, it   s not like today where  students have many rights and they can express those rights and have  appropriate actions taken. I remember in one of my chemistry courses,  the second one, we would have three exams, hour exams, over the  course of the semester. On two exams I had very strong, good A   s as  grades. On the third exam, I was about a point or two points from an A  with a B, but I got a C out of the course. (Laughs)  No comment.  No comment. And so, yes      You can laugh about it now, but it wasn   t very funny at the time.  It wasn   t funny at all at the time. And of course I went to Dr. Johnson     of course the professor supports their graduate students in whatever the  graduate students say.  Getting back to where you were going earlier, now when you were there  there wasn   t a whole lot of African-American guy students   but now  females were probably even less? Was it a little difficult to get a date?  It was probably a ratio of four to one, about four guys to every female  when I went there in    61-   62. But of course it wasn   t that difficult for  me, worrying about it, because I was there as a student. I wasn   t trying  to be the big guy on campus or see how many dates I could have or any  of those things, but the ratio was about four to one, and so it made for  interesting (Laughs) situations.  What would you do on dates back in the early    60s? Where did you go?  Well, Elayne and I would walk to the movie if she had enough money to  pay her own way. (Laughs) Most of our dates   we were both poor  students going to school. Most of our dates were Dutch treat   not all,  but the majority of them were Dutch. If we went out to eat it was on  Sunday evenings, because all of our meals at that time were in the dorm.  She ate in the dorm, she was over in Murray Hall ,and I was in Cordell  Hall, and both of those dorms had cafeterias back in the early    60s, and  so 20 of the 21 meals were served in your dorm. The only meal that was  not served was Sunday evening, but Sunday breakfasts were served,  usually a big dinner on Sunday noontime, and then Sunday night there  was no meal served at those two dorms. So sometimes we would go  down to El Patio there on Washington Street right off of University there  were several little hamburger type places there, or we would go to    Chat  11  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  and Chew    at the Wesley Foundation. The BSU  Baptist Student Union   had things going on Sunday evening, but the Wesley Foundation had  better food. (Laughs)  That   s when you moved from being a Baptist to Methodist?  That   s when I went from being a Baptist to a Methodist. (Laughter)  Food for the soul, so to speak.  Food for the soul. And Elayne and I had a lot of library dates. We would  go to the library. We were both there as serious students, and so a lot of  our dates were at the library. Most of the time, she would come to the  library or I   d go to the library and then I   d walk her over to Murray Hall  after we left the library and I   d then hot foot it back over to Cordell.  Were there some favorite student hangouts at that time, Claud?  Probably the most favorite hangout at that time was probably the fourth  floor of the Student Union. Most of us at that time didn   t have cars.  There were a few of us that had cars, but the majority of us didn   t have  cars, and most of the athletes were probably in practice or something  during the week and had curfews or whatever athletes had at that time.  So you didn   t see very many of them during the week, but on the  weekends, most times, if there was something going on it would be at  the Student Union.  We were talking about the Student Union, and you said you first met  Elayne there?  Yes.  Is there a story there? I mean, when did you first meet her?  Well I was there one year before she was. I was there in    61, and she  came in    62, and her roommate at that time was a young lady from  McAlester, I think   yes, from McAlester. The first night   back then  school tended to start on Monday, and so people would return to campus  Sunday afternoon and Sunday evening, and that Sunday night almost  everybody of us would be on the fourth floor of the Student Union, just  meeting and seeing who was there, who made it back after the summer.  And so Marilyn brought her roommate, Elayne, with her up to the  Student Union, and she introduced her to everybody, and I was just one  of everybody that she got introduced to, nothing special, nothing fancy. I  think I called her    country    or something, but other than that      12  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Bells didn   t go off      No. No, bells didn   t ring or anything like that, no fireworks.  When did you start dating regularly?  Oh, a couple of years later regularly probably. We had a couple of dates,  but      Did you get married after your senior year?  We got married our senior year. March 19 of senior year as we were  headed out to sell books. (Laughter)  Did you work during your student years?  Yes.  You had a student job?  Yes, I had sometimes two jobs   janitorial, dishwashing. Sometimes I  was dishwashing in the dorms, sometimes janitorial. One job had to do  with one of the labs over in agriculture, checking some tests that a  graduate student had going, checking them, delivering janitorial supplies  in the dorm, working as proctor on the desk. I would work on the desk     probably my junior and senior year there was more of that type of stuff,  working answering the phone there at the desk.  Were you at Cordell Hall all that time?  Cordell Hall until the fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha. I was a member of  Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. We got a house through the university  because we had been unfairly treated with another house we were trying  to get. There was a house owned by the Catholic church that they   d been  trying to sell, and one of our fraternity members found out about it some  kind of way, and we actually met with the priest of the church and had  made arrangements to purchase the house, but sooner or later you have  to show up in the neighborhood (Laughs) if you   re buying a house that  you plan to live in, and there were some things that the house needed. So  part of the agreement was that if we fixed and took care of   there were  some plumbing issues and one of our members    dad was a plumber.  So we started working getting this house ready and fixing plumbing and  doing things that needed to be done, and in the middle of this process the  house sold. It had been on the market forever, and I don   t know for sure,  but we were told that one of the dads of one of the sorority members  13  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  purchased the house. So we told the university that we wanted a  fraternity house like everyone else, but we were working against a  system that wasn   t just, and that   s really how we got the house over on  Washington that was owned by the university, right next to the  Farmhouse. That house that was right there next to the Farmhouse. We  got it because that was the only way the university could figure to try to  make things right that were very wrong.  Who were some of the other members of your fraternity at that time? Do  you recall? Was Ken Kimbrough      Oh, Kenneth Kimbrough, Curtis Triggs, Elaryo Mukes, Bill Hogan,  George Barnes, Wardell Hollis, Sam Ward, Ron Zanders   there were  quite a few.  I recognize some of them. I played football with Wardell   good guy. So  during the summers, you sold Bible books at the Southwestern  Company? Did you start the summer before your senior year?  Yes. The summer before, which was the summer of    65, Kenneth  Kimbrough and I sold books in Tampa, Florida.  Who was your student sales manager?  I remember Spencer Hayes being the general manager. Clyde Irving     good guy.  Great guy.  Great guy.  There would be so many, but are there any particular stories at  Southwestern that you want to share, maybe with people that don   t  understand what selling Bible books door-to-door is all about, that you  might enlighten them a little bit?  Well, first of all, Tampa, Florida, was where I started. I sold for five  summers, and in those five summers we sold in Tampa, Florida;  Columbus, Georgia; then Fort Worth, Texas; then Houston, Texas; then  Maryland, right outside of Washington, D.C. For those five summers, in  terms of really meeting rude people, I didn   t meet probably ten in all  those summers. Probably the most interesting summer was the summer  that we were in Fort Worth, Texas, which was the summer that they had  the riots and fires in Detroit, Michigan, and those areas, and every  weekend the rumor went through Fort Worth and Dallas that they were  going to burn Dallas that weekend. (Laughs) So that made for rough  14  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  selling all the week. And of course I was a student at that time at  Tuskegee Institute in Veterinary Medicine, so I had an Alabama license  on my car, and I remember going into this one neighborhood. We would  park our car in the middle of the block, and then work that entire block  without having to move our car. I had just parked my car there in the  middle of the block and got out and a guy came up and said,    You   re  one of those outside agitators. I see that Alabama license on your car.     (Laughs) And he made some serious threats, and most times nothing  bothered your day too much if you were a Southwestern salesman,  you   re just kind of like a duck in water, you just kind of let it run off, but  that hung on for a day or two.  How many hours would you work in a week?  About eighty a week. That first summer, Kenneth and I both would work  eighty hours a week, real early in the morning until about dark, and then  on Saturdays, all summer long. It was a good thing for me because it  allowed me to be able to go to school. It allowed me to be able to finish  school with a lot less debt than I would have had otherwise. I went the  first summer single. The next summer I went, I was a married, Elayne  and I. She was out on the book field with me for four summers.  Well Claud, moving back to OSU, what were some of the   you said you  were an Alpha Phi. Were there other activities or organizations that you  were engaged in as a student?  Oh, let   s see. One of the things that I remember, living in Cordell Hall,  chairman of the homecoming float committee one year, and we had a  winning float that Cordell Hall produced. That was an interesting  experience, trying to be sure that a vehicle that   s covered completely  doesn   t stop in the middle of the parade route. I didn   t play any official  sports, any university sports. I was involved with the BSU, Baptist  Student Union, and      But you ate at the Wesley Foundation. (Laughter)  Right. (Laughter) But I didn   t spend as much time at the Wesley  Foundation, but I spent particularly Sunday evenings when there was  food.  Looking back at your undergraduate experience at Oklahoma State  University, do you have any favorite memories that stand out in your  mind?  Graduation. (Laughter) A very, very favorite memory as a student would  have to be graduation. But I think the main things are the people that you  15  Gill  Evans  meet as students, friends that you make. Those people are still friends,  and some of us still stay in contact with each other. Recently, a few  years ago   I don   t know, five, six, seven, eight, I   m not sure exactly     but the Black Alumni Association became more active and had a chance  then to see even more people that we had known as students. So I think  the opportunity to meet people and make lasting friends is one of the  strong memories, for me. As I said, I was basically just a student. I  wasn   t involved with university athletics or any of those other things,  and one of the people that I met happened to be Elayne, in terms of  meeting good people.  Well you were working quite a bit so you      And I was working every day to go to school. One of the memories that  wasn   t a fun or favorite memory was when President Kennedy was  assassinated. I was just there, and you know the whole nation was just in  awe that this had occurred, and what do you do when you don   t know  what to do? You call Mama. (Laughs) I remember calling my mom and  talking about it, and she said,    I got your letter,    because I would write  home about once a week or ten days or so. I wrote home pretty  frequently to mama   didn   t do that much calling, but we   d write letters.  I guess in the letter that I had written her, I told her that room and board  was coming due, and at that point room and board in Cordell Hall was  approximately  75. I had written her a letter telling her that (just as a  point of information) our room and board was coming up, and so when  we had finished talking about the assassination, she says,    Oh, by the  way, I   m putting my check in the mail to you to pay your room and  board.    I said,    What are you talking about?     Well my mother received a widow   s check, pension, that was about  seventy-three or seventy-four dollars a month, and she said,    I   m putting  that in the mail for you so you   ll be sure and be able to pay your room  and board.    I said,    Well mom I don   t need it. I   m working two jobs,  and it   s okay.    I said,    I   m nineteen. If I can   t make it now, shame on  me.    But the thing was, she was ready to send me what she had to live  on for a month to be sure that I was able to stay in school. Now that will  make you go back and do a little bit more studying when you have  parents willing to do that. Of course my mom was a housewife, she did  laundry work, she washed people   s clothes and ironed them. I   ve seen  her hang up clothes in the winter time. She didn   t have a dryer and the  first clothes that she hung up on the line would be freezing by the time  she got to the bottom clothes in the basket. I knew about freeze dried  clothes long before I knew about freeze dried coffee, and so there was  no way that I was gonna have my mama sending me money to go to  school when I knew what she had to do to get the money to live.  16  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  I was always very aware of all the sacrifices she made, but all of us  kids   there are a bunch of us kids, but every one of us that ever wanted  to go to college went. Don   t ask me how. I   m not sure how, other than I  know that there   s a God that makes things happen. And she was ready to  make that sacrifice of what she had to live on for a whole month to be  sure that I stayed at Oklahoma State University, in terms of being able to  pay my room and board. But she didn   t send it. I told her I didn   t need it,  that I was working two jobs and if I couldn   t make it, then shame on me.  Well, Claud, when you graduated in the spring of    66, then you applied  for OSU College of Veterinary Medicine      More than once.      more than once, and you did not get accepted.  That   s correct.  How did that make you feel?  Well, you have to know Claud Evans a little bit to realize ... Well first, it  makes you not feel good, just in a sentence, but you have to realize that  my goal was to be a veterinarian, and my goal was not to worry about  why I didn   t get into OSU. I could still be sitting up there worrying  about why I didn   t. My goal was to be a veterinarian, so then after a  couple of times I found alternative pathways.  That was Tuskegee      That was Tuskegee Institute, state of Alabama, and then I interned at the  University of California, Davis. But I never spent a lot of time trying to  figure out all the    whys.    I knew things happened along the way   you  know, like the chemistry I was telling you about a few minutes ago     and at that point in time, there was no need in me trying to fight city  hall.  Claud, were there only maybe one or two black students enrolled in the  total college at that time. Is that right?  At that time, I think there was only one enrolled. A guy named Dr.  McGruder, Deorsey McGruder, was enrolled at that time.  A little bit about your experience at Tuskegee. Was that a good  experience for you there?  It   s probably the best experience   it   s probably the best thing that could  17  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  have ever happened. Now my mom had to be one of the wisest ladies  ever, and she said,    You know, sometimes one door closes because  there   s another one that God wants you to see.    I doubt very seriously  that I would have been on the Board of Regents at Oklahoma State  University had I not gone to Tuskegee, because a lot of things occurred  that helped to prepare me for that responsibility of being a Regent. Had I  gone to Oklahoma State University School of Veterinary Medicine, I  probably would have ended up as a practitioner here in Oklahoma  somewhere and that would have been kind of the end of it. But my  Tuskegee experience led to international experiences, corporate  experiences, many, many experiences that I think benefited me as a  person and also helped to prepare me for some of the things necessary  for being a regent.  Well Claud, you got your internship after you finished at Tuskegee there  at University of California at Davis      That   s correct. That   s correct.  Was that a little bit of a culture shock for you, going from Oklahoma to  Alabama to the West Coast?  California versus Oklahoma and Alabama was a culture shock. That was  the heyday of Berkeley. 1970 was when we did our internship at Davis  and there were war protests everywhere. You know, it was a culture  shock. But again, it was a good experience, and I think it helped a lot in  helping me to realize that this world is made up of many, many, many  types of people.  Well Claud, you mentioned it gave you several different opportunities.  Can you trace just briefly for us a little bit after you finished your  internship, some of your corporate experience, because you were in the  corporate world for several years before you became a practitioner.  Eleven years.  Could you share some of your experiences? Eleven years?  We were out at Davis basically minding our own business   University  of California at Davis   and we received a letter from Ralston Purina  Company inviting us to come in and explore a possible career  opportunity with Ralston Purina. Well at that point I wasn   t that  interested in corporate because I was doing an internship in equine  medicine and surgery and we were doing knees on horses and gut  anastomosis on horses and I had written a couple of papers about some  issues with horses, and I was going to be an equine practitioner. We  18  Gill  really liked northern California. In fact, when we left Davis that   s the  only place that we lived   and we   ve lived coast to coast twice over the  years   that   s the only place that we ever lived that Elayne cried when  we were driving out of town.  So it was not an easy decision, but at the same time as we were midway  through this internship and had received this letter from Purina, we were  trying to decide what we were going to do with our farm and livestock  here in Oklahoma. Elayne   s mom and dad had taken care of our cattle all  of these years. Because of our job at Southwestern, we were able to not  only go to school but we were able to buy our first cows and buy our  first land as well as go to school. The summer job opportunity with  Southwestern was a tremendous opportunity for us. So we were trying to  decide, do we just tell her mother and dad,    Let   s just forget the  livestock industry. We   re going to practice here in California. We  appreciate all the years you all have put into the farm, but we   re not  going to pick it up and go from there.   ? Or do we go back?  Well being interns, students, we didn   t have a lot of money to make trips  from California back to Oklahoma, but we needed to talk to Mother and  Dad. I   m just being totally honest with you as to how I ended up with  Purina. (Laughs) And then I remembered. I told Elayne, I said,    Didn   t  Purina invite us back to St. Louis to talk to them about a job  opportunity?    She said,    Yes.    I said,    Where is that letter?    She said,    I  think we threw it up there on the mantle over the fireplace.    We looked  up there, and sure enough, it was still up there. I said,    Well we could let  Purina pay our way back to St. Louis, and then we can stop through  Oklahoma, talk to Mother and Dad, and as a family we can make a  decision of what we   re going to do with the farm. And we won   t be out  of that much money, just the stop-off part.     So I contacted Purina and told them, yes, we   d come out and take a look,  and they said,    Fine.    I said,    Now I   ll be bringing my wife with me.     They said,    Well we don   t usually bring the wife on the first visit.    I  said,    Well if she doesn   t come, no need for me to come, because if she  doesn   t like it, we wouldn   t be there anyway.    (Laughs) They said,     Okay, bring her.    (Laughs) So we flew out to St. Louis, and then we  routed our ticket back to Oklahoma City. Mother and Dad met us at the  airport, and we came and spent a day at the farm and decided to keep the  farm going. Flew back out to Davis. I contacted Purina that, yes, we  would go with them. When the internship was over, they moved us to St.  Louis, and that   s how we got started with them. We moved there with  the idea,    Oh, we   ll stay a year or two and learn more about preventative  herd health.    Well those one or two years turned into eleven.  Now part of that was with     19  Evans  Well I started out with the Chow Division as a veterinary consultant     poultry pathology in the Chow Division   but I was only in that division  about six months and Purina made the decision to open a professional  marketing area. Chuck Rosso, the veterinarian in Consumer Products,  moved to Marketing, which left a vacancy in Consumer Products, the pet  food area, for a veterinarian. One day Doug Hale, the vice president of  R D, came over to the Veterinary Services Group. There were about  eleven or twelve of us veterinarians in that group at that time,  and he   came over there, and it was   it must have been right around ten or  eleven in the morning or something, and I didn   t know him from Jack  Spratt. I   d been there four or five months or so, and Joyce Messman,  who was one of the secretaries in that area that had been there a long  time, was there.  I had just walked out of the laboratory area where we did necropsies and  things on birds and things. I had just walked out of there into the area of  the offices where there was a little break room where they had a coffee  pot and stuff, and had just gotten me a cup of coffee. Doug Hale comes  in, I   m sitting there sipping my coffee, and he says,    I thought I   d find  you up to your elbows in blood and guts up in the laboratory.    I said,     I   m very good. I   m already through with that.    He said,    Ooh, it   s deep  in here     and kind of catches his pants leg and walks out the door  laughing. Joyce Messman started laughing and I   m thinking,  What   s  wrong?  And she said,    Do you know who that was?    I said,    No.    She  said,    That was only Doug Hale, the vice president of R D.    (Laughter)  I said,    Okay.     He went on back up to his office over in the other building, and a few  days later Dr. Darby, a veterinarian who was over our total area, called  me into his office, and that   s when he told me that Chuck Rosso over in  Consumer Products was moving to Marketing where they were opening  up a new professional marketing group for veterinarians, and Doug Hale  wanted to talk to me about that position. So I went over and talked to  Doug, and when I walked in he started laughing and I started laughing  and, of course, I moved over into that area, and was in Consumer  Products for about five years. Tony Ingram was the Vice President for  Production, Consumer Products. I had a chance to meet him. Also  during this time, I became a member of the Management Advisory  Board, which was a board of sixteen people. Eight people went on each  year. It was a staggered eight-year term, and you were on that board for  two years. This is a board (selected by Hal Dean, the Chairman of the  Board) for in-house management training.  So I was on the Management Advisory Board for two years and had a  chance to meet and learn from all of the corporate officers, had a chance  to learn a lot. This is what I   m saying, a lot of these things would not  20  Gill  Evans  have happened had I not gone to Tuskegee. It was through Tuskegee that  Purina found out that I existed in California. Tony Ingram said,    If  you   re going to stay in industry, you need to learn something about  production.    So he set up a program for me to go to Davenport, Iowa,  and start to learn the production side of industry.  In    77, we moved to Davenport where I was a management trainee for  several months and then became Manager of Quality Assurance for the  production of both human foods and pet foods. We were there about  twenty months, and Tony Ingram was asked by Purina to go to San  Diego and try to get Chicken of the Sea into the black. They had been  into the red several years. Tony selected a team of individuals from  around the Purina organization and I was invited to be a part of that team  to go to San Diego and help put some black ink on the books for  Chicken of the Sea Division. I went out there as Manager of Pet Food  Production (I managed about 45 people). All of the seafood pet foods  were made there and in Mexico. We had a co-packer down in Mexico  that packed the mackerel pet foods. We were there probably two years,  or almost two years. Then Tony, the person that had gotten me started in  production, said,    Now you need more people experience, so we   re  going to move you from pet food to human food where you   ll be  managing about eight hundred people for the production of Chicken of  the Sea human foods. That   s what occurred then for the last two years  that I was at Chicken of the Sea.  Of course by this time we have kids. Greg   s five, six, seven years old  during this period that we   re out there, and in    82 they were looking for  someone to send to American Samoa to manage the Samoan operation.  Well at this point we had kids and really weren   t that interested in the  Samoan school system for the kids. Gregory was seven and Kelly was  two. And that   s when we said,    It   s time to go home.    So we told  Elayne   s mom and dad that we were thinking about moving back home  and to see if they could find a place in and around the Okemah area that  would be a good location for our clinic. Well that was like asking a real  estate agent, so they got busy, and we came home in July for a family  reunion and they brought us up here, showed us this place. The house  was here. The clinic wasn   t. There was just pasture, and we looked at it  and put it into escrow that same day.  My question is, you were obviously on a pretty fast track with Purina.  Was it a tough decision for you?  It was a tough decision, but we wanted our kids to know the  grandparents ,and at that point, we   d been telling Elayne   s mom and dad  for about seventeen years that we were coming back home one of these  days. They   d been taking care of our cows (Laughs) for about seventeen  21  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  years. We wanted the grandkids to know the grandparents, and we  wanted the grandparents to know the grandkids. So we had made up our  minds that we were moving back home to Oklahoma, and we never  looked back. It was one of the better decisions that we   ve made.  Well Claud, at that time, did you open up your own practice or did you  take over another practice that was here?  We came and contracted to have a clinic built, I think in November,  knowing that we were planning to move here, back home, during the  Christmas holidays of December of    82. We drove into town Christmas  night of    82, and they started building my clinic a few days after January  1, but we had already come back in November. We   d come back and put  the plans together and talked about them and had everything in place.  Now at the time, you were probably one of the few practicing black  veterinarians in this part of     In Okfuskee County. (Laughter)  Certainly in Okfuskee County, yeah.  It was different. When we moved here, there was a non-graduate  veterinarian that was practicing in this area and had been here for a lot of  years, and several veterinarians, licensed practiced graduate  veterinarians had tried to make it in Okemah and couldn   t. Well we  came, and we started building our clinic a couple of weeks after we were  here, because we were not planning to leave. The gentleman, he decided  to retire shortly after we moved here, so in fact, he gave me a call and  said he was going to retire and wanted to know if I wanted to buy  anything that he had. So I went down, and everything that he had that he  wanted to sell, I bought. Some of it went straight to the trash. Some of it  we kept for antiques. Some of it we kept because it was good stuff,  (Laughter) but whatever he wanted to sell   if he wanted out of business,  I wanted to help him and, at the same time, leave a good taste in his  mouth.  Sure.  So we went down, and he had medicines   some of that stuff was so old  I   d never heard of it, and some of it was of course modern stuff and in  date. Some of the equipment was antiquated. I   ve got it over there in a  drawer now, still have some of it.  Were there some people that were uncomfortable with a black  veterinarian? I mean, was that a little out of their comfort zone?  22  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  There were some, but if you   ve got a sick animal and you   ve got a  chance to get it helped, sometimes that overrides some of the things. But  Okemah, we moved here on purpose. We kind of knew the history of the  town, and Okemah   s history is not one that the community can be proud  of. They   ve hung people here in Okemah. I was at a funeral today   a  guy from Seattle, Washington, that grew up in the Boley area. I was  introduced to him, and the guy that introduced him said,    Dr. Evans is a  veterinarian at Okemah.    The guy said,    Okemah?    (Laughs) and started  thinking about the time   an older guy   when he lived in Boley, and  I   ve gotten that reaction in many, many places. As you know, I   ve  traveled a lot, and you meet someone that knew the area, and they ask  you what you do and where you   re from, and I say,    I   m a veterinarian  in Okemah,    and you get that same type of reaction. But Okemah has  been good to us, and it didn   t matter much.  I   ve always had the philosophy that there are good people and there are  bad people. It   s kind of like being a student at Oklahoma State. There  are good people, and there are bad people, and you try to serve the good  ones that want your services and don   t worry about those that don   t.  That hasn   t changed a lot. The people that have bad attitudes, they keep  bad attitudes. The people that have good attitudes, they keep good  attitudes. The main thing is that you try and provide a good service, and  most people are mostly interested in the service. You know the lady that  was at the clinic today, she was happy that her dog got sewed up,  because I guess it was gone for a couple of days and got cut up some  kind of way, we   re not sure how, but I don   t think she paid much  attention to the color of the skin holding the suture that would sew up  her dog. But she was concerned I think that the dog be sewn.  Well Claud, did you enjoy the change from the corporate area to being a  practicing veterinarian?  Moving from San Diego, California, to Okemah, America is culture  shock. (Laughter)  Reverse culture shock.  Reverse culture shock (Laughter) by any stretch of the imaginations. We  lived in a little community called Poway. Elayne didn   t cry when we left  that I   m aware of, but we liked Poway and that area. Now we were out  there about four years ago. When we were out there in the late    70s and  early    80s, you could see the hills. There were no houses on them. I  mean, it was just a nice rural environment of southern California. We  were out there about four years ago, and it   s wall to wall houses and  shopping centers, and we just felt that, first of all, that this was a much  better environment for raising kids. We both grew up in Oklahoma, and  23  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  when we came, we knew exactly where we were coming. There were no  surprises. Culture shock, yes. Surprises, no.  How has your practice evolved over the years?  It   s been good. Okemah, this area has been good to us, but we think we  have been good to the community. I work with the school systems. I am  a member of the Chamber of Commerce, I have been president two or  three times over the twenty-six years that we   ve been living here.  Member of the Lions Club, member of the St. Paul   s Methodist Church,  currently the chairman of the administrative council, which is   is this  the third time for that over the years? Second or third time. In a small  rural community, you get      Recycled?      you get recycled. It   s not like the big cities where one and you   re out.  One and done.  One and done. And the majority of the people have been good, but that   s  not to say that there are not still a few people with questionable intents.  Christmas 2000   modern times   I   m in my clinic, and a man comes in  and says,    Doc, I   ve lost eight or nine cows, and I thought I   d better  come in and try to find out what       I said,    Sir, why did you wait till  you lost so many before you come in to get help?       Well I figured I  could maybe do something and they   d get better,    and,    This is the way  they acted.    I said,    Sir, that doesn   t help me. I need to see an animal,  and preferably one that   s still sick that has symptoms, but even if it   s  dead we can do an autopsy and maybe figure out what   s going on.        Yeah, but this is the way they acted.    I said,    Yes, sir. I understand  what you   re saying, but that still doesn   t help me in making a diagnosis.  I really need to see an animal.    Well this goes on for about ten minutes  of me telling him that I really need to see an animal to make a diagnosis  and him telling me,  Well, this is the way they act.'  So finally he says,    Do you know that boy at Bristow?    Well he was  talking about Dr. Mitchell, another black veterinarian at Bristow. I said,     You mean Dr. Mitchell?    He said,    Yeah.    He said,    Now he   s good.     (Laughs)    He   s really good. He can take a horse and turn it inside out  and       and he goes on.    He   s just really good. In fact, he   s much too  good to be colored.    And that was in the year 2000. But do you get mad  at this man? No, I just wished him a Merry Christmas, shook his hand  and showed him the door (Laughs) because it was late in the evening  and I   m ready to come home anyway and eat supper. It   s no good to get  mad at him. Maybe he has to pay a little more when he comes in for  24  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  services (Laughs) but I   m not mad at him.  That   s not mad, that   s getting even. Well Claud, if you don   t mind, go  back to Oklahoma State a little bit. You   ve had a lifelong relationship  with the university, with your alma mater. I know for many years, when  we first met each other, you were on the board of directors of the alumni  association and have been involved for many years. How do you feel  about the importance of alumni staying engaged with the university?  Well it   s critical. I think it   s critical to stay engaged with your alma  mater. Elayne and I have always done that. It   s just crucial. You can  serve the university, and the university can serve you. It   s a two-way  street.  Well Claud, in your mind, how does the alumni association help keep  alumni engaged, and is it important to maintain a strong association to  serve the university?  Well, you say how does the alumni association do this?  And is it important to have a strong alumni association?  Oh, yes, I think it   s important, and I think doing things to help bring  niche populations of the university together, like the Black Alumni  Association ... I think the creation of the Black Alumni Association was  very, very crucial because many black alums have something to offer. I  think it   s just starting to reach the point that the university will benefit  immensely from its black alumni, realizing that the first students were  there in the very early    50s   the very first students   and many of those  that were there when I was there are starting to retire. They are starting  to finally have some extra money that they can do things with. It takes a  generation to create wealth for most people. So we have some alums that  are starting to create incomes and financial affairs that will allow them  to be major contributors. We   re just starting to reach, I think, that point  in the history of blacks attending OSU that some of this will start to be  seen more and more as we go forward.  Well this may seem shameless, but I   m going to ask it anyway. You were  a strong advocate for the alumni center, as an alum and as a regent, and  from your perspective, has the alumni center matched your  expectations? Because you were proponents of it. You   ve financially  supported it. Has it met your expectations?  Well I think the alumni center is a super building, first of all. I think it   s  really a neat building, but I think it provides a really strong rallying  point for alums, and all you have to do is to go through there on game  25  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  day when there   s something and the place is just crawling with people.  Because prior to that, alums really didn   t have a place to go when they  would come to town. Now if they want to, they can come a few hours  early because there   s usually something going on on those days in that  center that they have someplace to go. If the weather   s bad they can, or  if the weather   s good, it doesn   t matter. They have a place to go. So I  think the alumni center was a wise decision on the part of the university  to construct and develop and promote.  Claud, I know you must take some pride in being appointed to the OSU  Board of Regents twice   two eight-year appointments. Is that correct?  That   s correct.  How did that come about? Can you tell us a little bit about how you  first   and which governor appointed you?  Well first of all, I   ve had appointments by   except for the current  governor   the four previous governors. My first appointment was by  Governor Nigh and that was to the Board of Examiners for Veterinary  Medicine for the State of Oklahoma. That, to me, was really, I think,  really significant, getting appointed to that board.  Professionally it was.  Professionally it was good. You know, sometimes to myself I would  laugh and say,    Ha  The state where I had to go to another state to  become a veterinarian, and now I administer the tests to people  graduating and wanting to practice in Oklahoma.    You know, God has a  sense of humor, doesn   t he? (Laughter)  That   s great.  So that was my first appointment, and when that appointment ended  Governor Bellmon, a republican   see the first one was a democrat     Governor Bellmon, a republican, appointed me to the Board of Trustees  for the University Center at Tulsa, and so I was on that board, and while  I was still on that board, Governor Walters, a democrat again, appointed  me to the Board of Regents for Oklahoma State University and the  A M colleges. Then after eight years, Governor Keating, a republican,  reappointed me for another eight-year term. So four different  appointments, two republicans, two democrats. To me, that meant a lot  because it wasn   t one of those situations where you go and try to buy a  position, because I really didn   t know Governor Nigh. I really didn   t  know Governor Bellmon. I had met Governor Walters, and I had met  Governor Keating because, being on the board, I   d met Governor  26  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Keating many times. And then being on the Board of the Trustees for the  University Center of Tulsa gave me a chance to meet Governor Walters.  But I didn   t know Governor Bellmon prior to his appointment, and I  didn   t know Governor Nigh. But Dr. Montgomery, the veterinarian from  Poteau that was on the board, was the person that I think was most  responsible for putting my name into the mix of things because he knew  both of those individuals very well.  John Montgomery was the first African-American OSU regent, but I  guess you were the first OSU graduate African-American regent. Would  that be right? Because weren   t you the second      What about the wheat farmer? Was he an OSU grad? From Hennessey     out near Hennessey, I think.  I can   t remember.  He may have been an agricultural OSU grad. I don   t know what school  he graduated from.  You   re one of very few at the least, either second or third.  Right.  There   s got to be a sense of pride, like I started to say, especially coming  back to Oklahoma from      Well, it was a real sense of pride for my mom. My mom, as I said, was  the one that told me that sometimes one door closes because the Good  Lord has another one that he wants you to see. But she was really, really  sick when I was appointed to the board, and she was living at that time  with my sister there in Tulsa, Valadean. I remember after the reception  that they had for the newly-appointed regent, myself, I went back  through Tulsa, and she was there on her bed. She had a big old smile on  her face. She wasn   t able to come to Stillwater. I had them video the  reception, but she never got a chance to see it. But when I walked in the  room, she had a big old smile on her face, and she said,    We made it,  didn   t we?    I said,    Yes, Mama. We made it.     Jumping back just a minute, I want to ask you. John Montgomery, I  think, was instrumental because he was a mentor to you and a second  father as you indicated earlier, and I meant to ask you, did he in any  way help you when you were setting up your practice? Was his influence  there?  Well his influence is in the things that I do. The design of my clinic  27  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  probably has a little bit to do with the way his was set up, and so just  tremendous influences. A lot of the things that you do as a practitioner  are things that you have seen work and you feel comfortable with. I call  him all the time to ask if we ought to do things   not just veterinary  medicine, I   m talking about just life in general   and get his advice  because he was a tremendous influence. Still is.  I   m not sure if I brought it up earlier, but I think I read somewhere, too,  that after your father died, you said he kind of adopted you as a second  father. You actually worked in his clinic, didn   t you?  All through junior high and high school, yes, and then in    66 I had a  pretty bad car accident   in June of    66   and when I got out of the  hospital there in Atlanta, Georgia, and got released from the doctors, he  told me to come back home to Oklahoma and work for him. So I went  back home to Poteau, and at that point, I was out of the wheelchair, but I  was on crutches and he paid me to be around. I didn   t do much work, but  I was there. (Laughter) After the first year, we would take a crew of  people on the book field with us, and we earned income based on how  well our crews did, a commission on their sales, but we didn   t get that  until January, usually about mid-January or something like that. Because  that accident happened on June 7, the second day out on the field, I  didn   t really earn any direct income that summer, just commission  because I had a crew of men out there.  I was in school in September starting my freshman year of veterinary  school after that accident in June. The tuition second semester came due  probably a month before we were to get our commission checks, and I  remember calling Dr. Montgomery. Mrs. Montgomery was on the other  line. We needed  250. She said,    You know I think I have  250 over in  the back of my purse.    (Laughs) That   s exactly what she said, over in  the back of her purse  And they sent us the  250, we paid all of our next  semester fees on time, and then when we got our commission check, we  sent them their money back. But yes, tremendous influence.  Well Claud, give me a little bit on your  tenure as a  regent. I want to  ask some questions there. During your years on the board, what were  some of the key issues that you struggled with? I know some are the  same, some of them change, but can you highlight some of them?  I think that I made some contributions while I was on the board. One of  the last things that I was involved with before going off the board was  getting more minorities as recipients of contracts of all the construction  that   s going on at OSU. I really pushed that issue hard, and now there   s  a report that comes out every month that states what the minority  involvement is with the construction. We have about  850 million worth  28  Gill  Evans  of construction going on at OSU at this moment. I really got tired of the  old story of    We can   t find any qualified,    I just got tired of hearing that.  I   d heard that just one time too many times one day at one of our board  meetings (Laughs) and was pretty upset. Long story short, with that  answer. I really then started to push hard, because there are qualified  minorities out there and so now, for example, I think at Murray Hall  renovations   25 percent of the construction dollars   are going to  minorities. Now sometimes the term minority gets redefined many  different ways, but that   s okay. We can deal with that too, as long as  some of them are the right minority. (Laughter) And the majority of the  construction   now I just hope that there   s someone on the regents  keeping the pressure there, because if you don   t keep the pressure there,  people soon forget. But there was a department set up to monitor that  through the university, so I think it   ll last now that minorities are to get  some of this first money from this  850 million of construction that   s  going on at OSU. OSU is training many of these engineers. If they   re not  qualified, then OSU didn   t do a good job of training them.  That   s right. Claud, are there any other issues that are some macro-issues  that you struggled with over your sixteen years, those reoccurring  kinds of issues you fought?  Well, another issue that always concerned me was tuition and fees for  students. You know, that comes up year after year after year. You may  call them    fees,    but if you   re paying so much per semester hour, that   s  tuition, and it   s still coming out of somebody   s pocket, same number of  dollars. You know,    a rose by any name smells the same.    (Laughs) So  that was one of the issues that we were continually trying to address  (fees and tuition).  Gary Clark was a regent during my first eight year term. We were  regents together. I think one of the things that he and I really pushed for  was getting the team together. I   ve always made the statement that the  strongest political entity in the state of Oklahoma is the A M system.  What I mean by that, almost all the veterinarians in the state of  Oklahoma are OSU grads; almost all of the extension agents that are in  every county, OSU graduates. I mean, grass roots. Almost all of your  osteopedic physicians, OSU graduates, not to forget about just your  basic alumni base. We have support and people involved at four other  institutions: Langston University, Oklahoma Panhandle State University,  NEO up in Miami, Connors State College down at Warner, Muskogee.  You put all of those together, there   s no reason that the A M system  can   t get the things that they need, and it   s because of the strong system  that I think we have an OSU-Tulsa today. Dr. Halligan is a very strong  man, but a person from out of state going against David Boren, who is  one of the smartest men you   ll ever meet and is as smart a politician as  29  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  you   ll ever meet has a major challenge. And you have a person coming  here from New Mexico that doesn   t know the Oklahoma system, but we  end up with an OSU-Tulsa? I think that   s because of the A M system,  the strength of the A M system. Gary Clark and I really pushed hard at  the beginning to try and get that system working together. We  introduced the director of this group to the director of that group and  tried to get them totally talking to each other and working together. In  fact I think I introduced a few people to you as the alumni director.   Gary Clark and I tried to work with and be visible as regents in all the  groups.   You created our Cowboys for Higher Education at that time.  We felt that there was no reason why all of these groups that are part of  the A M system, should not be talking to each other and folks helping  each other when they needed numbers in Oklahoma City to make things  happen. So that   s one of the things that I feel real good about. I think  I   ve played a part in helping to get some of these systems  communicating with each other so that they could work together on  common issues at the Capitol. So that   s, in my opinion, a huge issue.  One of the things that I would always ask when things were brought  before the board is,  How does it affect the student?  And I would often  make the statement that,    If the student doesn   t benefit, then what   s the  need of it?    I said,    You don   t need a board of regents. You don   t need a  president   s office. You don   t need a faculty council. You don   t need any  of these things if you   re not taking care of students.    And to me, that  was one of the constant questions with any board meeting if it involved  change or something new.    How does it benefit the student?    That was  always the bottom line with me.  Well Claud, you mentioned earlier, one of the roles obviously is to work  with your CEO, with your president of the system, of Oklahoma State in  Stillwater. What presidents did you work with over your sixteen years?  Oh, let   s see.  Was John Campbell there when you started?  When I was first appointed, Dr. Campbell was the President and so I  worked with all of the presidents from Dr. Campbell up through the  current president, Burns Hargis.  So you worked with Dr. Campbell and then with Jim Halligan, then it  was David Schmidly, and I guess      30  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  And then up to Burns Hargis.  Could you share with us a little bit about the presidents you   ve worked  with? I mean, how you perceived their strengths and, not to say  weaknesses, but their leadership styles as president? Could you  comment on that?  Well I didn   t get an opportunity to work with Dr. Campbell very long,  because when I came onto the board he was approaching the end of his  term. But the others, I was involved with the interview processes and the  decision-making for the hiring.  Any comments about their leadership style? How you perceived their  strengths? Different presidents, different personalities?  Well, they were all different. They were definitely different. Dr.  Halligan was probably the most people-to-people person. He got  involved with the student body. He was easily accessible to the students.  He was around the campus. Finals week, you know, when the Student  Union would be open I guess all night and they would cook pancakes,  you know, he would go and help cook pancakes. Ann Halligan was a  breath of fresh air. She was the nicest lady that you would ever want to  meet. And Dr. Halligan, I feel, really helped stop the skid downward at  OSU. At that point, Oklahoma State was kind of on the skid downhill,  and he helped to stop that skid and helped to start the rebuilding process.  And the person that   s responsible for stopping the skid many times gets  a lot of bruises (Laughs) because something the size of OSU has a lot of  momentum when it   s moving any direction, either good or bad. It has a  lot of momentum, and if you   re trying to stop a skid, you have a major  challenge.  I like the fact that he started the policy of    no rookies on rookies.    First-year  faculty could not teach first-year students. That was good, I  thought. He started the emphasis on language. If you   re a first-year  student and you can   t understand the language that your instructor is  speaking, you   re going to have a hard time making it, at the university  level. But those were some of the things that he instituted that I think  was, again, for the benefit of the student.  Dr. Halligan also started the  healing process between some of our alumni donors and OSU. Some  major donor gifts were initiated by Dr. Halligan.   David Schmidly was a different type of manager, different type of CEO,  probably not quite as people-to-people as Dr. Halligan. David Schmidly  was extremely smart, and he probably had a little bit less patience than  some, which gets you into trouble. Sometimes some of the CEOs know  where they want to go and they   re ready to get there now. I don   t know  31  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  of anything that   s slower than a faculty council. (Laughs) I decided that  if you want to slow down about anything, get it into a faculty council  committee (Laughs) and by the time they think it and re-think it and then  re-think it, then the committee changes and the whole process starts over  with the re-thinking. By the time they get back with an answer, it may be  two years if it follows their normal progression, and I think Dr.  Schmidly had a little bit of a problem sometimes with the slowness of  the process. Maybe that caused him to make some decisions sometimes  that seemed to have been abrupt or not thought through and maybe  didn   t leave quite as good of a taste in the mouth of the faculty council,  because they   re two totally different entities, a council versus a CEO. I  think all of our presidents have been strong in their way; all of them  since I was there have brought major accomplishments.  Burns Hargis, I didn   t get a chance to work with him very long as the  president, but I thought that he brought something to the table that could  be very beneficial, and it   s proven to be so. He knows how to raise  funds. I think one of the things that was needed was someone that could  raise the funds necessary to take Oklahoma State University through the  next several levels.  I did have an opportunity to work closely with  Burns when he served OSU as a member of the Board of Regents.   Do you think his experience as a regent will be helpful to him as a  president?  Oh yes, because he   s sat on the other side of the table, and he   s had a  chance to question what the presidents do, so he knows he will be  questioned, (Laughs) and the current board he knows very, very well  because he   s served with most of them. So he knows that this board will  want answers and expect answers and expect productivity.  Well Claud, are you excited about the direction the university   s going  now, the things that are happening, the renovation, new construction?  Oh yes. Oh yes. I think our university is moving in the right direction.  And I like the fact that a lot of the new construction is academic-related.  In fact there are more dollars being spent on academics, and  there  has  always been more money spent on academics than on athletics. One big  gift comes in to athletics and everybody goes    kabonkers    over how  much money is being spent on athletics, but if you recall before any  money was spent on athletics, we had a  250 million    Bringing Dreams  to life    campaign   Jim Halligan led this campaign.  Bringing Dreams to Life Campaign.  Yes, and I think athletics got about 12 percent of that, I believe, that was  32  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  all they got, and all the rest of it went to the university structure and  academic structure, and that was before they started on Gallagher-Iba   Arena . As soon as they started talking about funds for Gallagher-Iba,  people forgot that we had just finished a  250 million campaign for  academics. So people   s memory can be selectively short (Laughs) when  they want it to be. It always kind of bothered me just a little bit that  people don   t see the big picture, but I think the big picture at OSU is  great. It   s good. I think there   s a real balance, and I think the major  emphasis is on students.  Well Claud, you kind of lead me to this question, too, because both sides  to this   with Boone Pickens and his gift, but then we think of his gift and  we think of athletics when he made the huge gift this last spring, nearly a  year ago, for endowed chairs and matching money. What did you think  of that as a former regent? Was that exciting for you?  Well, that was my   as I tell people occasionally, my very last official  act as a regent was being part of the reception when the announcement  was made there in front of the library, the official announcement that  Boone had given  100 million and that it could be used to match other  alums    gifts which then could be used to get a state match which meant  that those individuals that could give a quarter of a million, that they  could have an endowed chair in their name for a million. And he didn   t  want his name associated with the chair other than the fact that the  money was there. You know, it wasn   t Boone   s endowed chair, it was  whomever   s endowed chair. That was my last official duty. It was that  same day that I think the new regent was named and confirmed.  Great story.  So the gifts that Boone gave, I feel, have really helped the university.  Do you have some favorite memories of OSU over your lifelong  relationship with the university?  Oh, a lot of my favorite memories are probably feeling that perhaps I  have helped the student population of the state of Oklahoma by being a  member of the board of regents. I think that   s the thing that makes me  feel most proud is I   ve been part of something good, and the emphasis  has always been on,    How does it affect students?    Those are good  memories. When you go to graduation   and not only at OSU abut some  of the other schools that we govern   you see first generation graduates  and parents with their kids, and you see the smiles on their faces. It just  makes you feel good to know that you   ve been part of something that  produced that much good feeling in people   s hearts.  33  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill  I think of Claud Evans as pioneer black student, black veterinarian,  successful small businessman, engaged alumnus, OSU regent. What   s  given you the most satisfactions in addition to your role as regent?  My family has brought me the most satisfaction   my family. They come  first. Elayne is a tremendous person. Now what comes in second to the  family? I   d have to give that a little thought. (Laughs) I   ve been an  extremely blessed kid growing up in southeast Oklahoma, pretty poor in  terms of dollars and cents, but extremely rich in terms of parents that  told us we could do and be what we wanted to be. My dad, as I said  earlier, he passed away when I was thirteen, but when I was younger I  can remember him telling me to do some chore, and I said,    Well,  Daddy, I can   t do that.    He says,    Son, let me tell you something. I  killed    can   t.    I whipped    couldn   t    until he could, and I   m gonna whip  you until you do if you don   t.    (Laughter) And so I did what I had just  said I couldn   t do.  Positive reinforcement.  Positive reinforcement. And so that was the type of environment I grew  up in.    Can   t    was never the first answer. Now there may be things that  we were not able to do, but we didn   t start out by saying    I can   t do it.     We gave it the big try and went from there. I think that played as big a  part in my life as anything. Having parents that told us you can do and  be what you want to be. This makes you concentrate on your goals  rather than concentrating on why something didn   t happen. So I   ve been  extremely blessed. I   ve been around the world. I   ve seen more things  than most people will ever see. I   ve had an opportunity to meet people  like Jerry Gill, Boone Pickens. I   ve had a chance to meet people like  Spencer Hayes, people that are making a difference in the lives of  people. Most people don   t have that opportunity. Most people go  through their lives and never meet the quality of people that I   ve had the  privilege of meeting. I   ve just been blessed, long story short. I   ve just  been blessed.  Well Claud, let me close by asking this question. How do you hope  people remember Claud Evans?  Well, I hope      I know you   re not gone yet, but     (Laughter)  I was about to say, I hope they remember me for what I   m still doing  (Laughter)      For a few more years.  34  Evans  Gill  Evans  Gill      rather than for what I   ve done. I hope the things that they remember  me for I haven   t even done yet, because we are still involved in the lives  of people. We still are trying to make a difference in the world we live   in , and I suspect that some of the things that I   ve been blessed to do  will be minor compared to what I will do in the future.  Great. Is there anything we haven   t covered, anything you   d like to add?  I don   t know anything we haven   t covered. We haven   t quite   unless  you want to know what I did for Valentine   s Day. I cooked dinner for  Elayne.  Congratulations  (Laughter)  -------  -------
