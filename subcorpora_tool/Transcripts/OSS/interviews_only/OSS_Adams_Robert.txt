 Gill. Today is February 20, 2010. I   m visiting with  Robert    Bob    Adams in his home here in Dallas, Texas. This interview  is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. Bob, you   re a member of a family that   s very special  to Oklahoma State University.  Yes, indeed.  The Adams Family. Your father, James Homer Adams and his brother,  Arthur Wesley Adams were members of the Class of 1896, which was the  first graduating class of Oklahoma State University. I want to visit with  you about your family, but first of all Bob, let   s talk a little bit about you  and a little bit about your life. Can you tell me about your early life,  where you grew up, your family, some of those things?  I was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas. Went through high school in  Fort Worth and from there my father sent me to New Mexico Military  Institute for my first year of college. My second and third year I went to  Stillwater, Oklahoma and enrolled at Oklahoma A M College, which  was one of the biggest thrills of my life, to get to go a big college.  You had a brother. Any other siblings or     My brother, James Adams    Jimmy,    went to Oklahoma A M College  and he graduated with an electrical engineering degree in 1934.  He was a few years older than you, is that right?  Ten years older than I.  Bob, what principles and values did you learn from your family growing  up that influenced you later in your life?  5  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Well, that   s a very interesting question. It could go on and on forever,  but the values are honesty and love and support. Those are the three  main things that I was taught when I was a child.  You spent about all of your early life in Fort Worth. You were born in  Fort Worth?  Yes, sir.  And then went through in the school system in Fort Worth and  graduated from high school here in Fort Worth?  From Paschal High School in Fort Worth, yes, in 1940.  Are there any activities you remember there in school? Organizations,  community activities you were involved in?  My memory   s pretty short. (Laughter)  You graduated in 1940 and you had a strong Oklahoma State University  influence, or at that time, Oklahoma A M. But did you consider any  other schools other than OSU when you were planning on going to  college?  Never once even talked about it. I know that I did not want to go to TCU   Texas Christian University  nor SMU  Southern Methodist University .  I wanted to go to Oklahoma A M where my dad went. My dad took me  up there in September of    41 and we enrolled me. I spent my sophomore  year, which was my first year at Stillwater, and then I completed that  year and then September of    42, I started my junior year and went all  through the junior year and   I was a house boy at the Pi  Beta  Phi  house and I   ll never forget getting a telephone call at the very last part of  the second semester in late May of 1943. I got a telephone call that I was  to report to Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma along with all the other  reserves that were being called up at that time.  This is in your junior year?  I completed my junior year and then in late May, I went, with all of the  reservists, from Stillwater and other colleges and we all were in basic  training in Fort Sill, which was rough.  Was that artillery or what unit were you in?  No, Fort Sill is known for its artillery. This was just basic training for  the army. Then we were assigned different assignments and from there I  6  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  went to Camp Maxey in Mississippi for a very short time and I was in  the infantry. One day, I went to my captain and told him that I knew  shorthand and typing and that I could I be of any assistance. To make a  long story short, I got interviewed by several and shortly thereafter, I  was sent to Memphis, Tennessee to Second Army headquarters where I  was stationed for a little over two years during the war. And that was  fine. It was a great job. I went from private to sergeant and then I moved  up to technician, third grade. I went there and then one day in either late  July or early August, we got our orders to report to Los Angeles to board  ships headed out to Japan. This was to be the final onslaught of Japan.  Well, I was sent to Camp Campbell, which is now Fort Campbell, to  await transportation. The third day I was there, the atom bomb was  dropped on one of the cities in Japan and shortly thereafter, there was a  second one dropped. Japan surrendered. So, all of our orders were  cancelled and I was shipped to the Pentagon building in Washington,  D.C. and I was secretary to two generals, which was a whale of a nice  job. One was General of the Third Army Ground Forces. It worked out  very nice.  So you didn   t have to go into combat, which worked out very nice too,  didn   t it?  I was never in combat.  Could you go back and talk a little bit about your Oklahoma State  University experience the first time through? You enrolled in 1940, is  that right?  No, the fall of 1941. My first year of college was at New Mexico  Military Institute.  That   s right. Spent a year there.  I was there for a year and I did not like any part of it. (Laughter)  Was there a reason why you decided to go a year to New Mexico?  The reason why I went to New Mexico was my father sent me there.  He thought you needed the discipline a little bit maybe?  That   s right. My mother and father were divorced. I was raised by my  mother and my aunt in Fort Worth. My father would visit me every three  or four months for a long weekend and so forth. But he thought I needed  more male companionship so he sent me there, but it didn   t work out.  7  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Bob, let   s back up. I think there   s a story about how you were  discharged?  Yes, that was kind of a humorous story. I was at the Pentagon building  and the war was over in the fall of    45. There I was in late    45 and early     46 and still not discharged. They were trying to discharge everybody  from the army by points. Each year of service was so much and each  order of Foreign Service was so much and so on. Well, it just got too  complicated. So, I wrote The Stars and Stripes newspaper, which was  the army newspaper and I told them that this one was absolutely  ridiculous   all this furor about discharging you, and all the number of  points you had. It was so simple and it could have been done quickly and  methodically and that was to discharge everybody by alphabetical order.  That was the only fair way to do it.  And what   s your last name?  Adams. (Laughter) Walter Winchell picked it up and it was in every  newspaper all over the United States. People called me and it was quite  an experience.  Great story.  Unfortunately, the Army didn   t see fit to do that.  When you were enrolled at Oklahoma State, what was your major?  Insurance. Business Administration, primarily in insurance.  Is there any interesting reason why you picked insurance as a major  focus?  Because it would involve selling. It involved something that I believed  very strongly in and I still do to this day. I  have  very strong opinions of  insurance. I   ve advised my family to do it and they   ve done it and  everybody   s went off because of it.  Where did you stay? Did you live in one of the dorms on campus?  No, I lived at the Beta  Theta Pi  House, 1207 College, which is now  1207 University Avenue. I pledged Beta in September    41. Was  initiated in March    42 and have been a Beta alum ever since and very  devoted to the Beta chapter. The Betas have done a lot of things for the  university and when I was there, we did a lot of things for the university.  Were there other activities or organizations that you were active in as a  8  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  student?  Not really, no.  Do you remember some of your professors at that time? Do any of them  stand out in your mind?  Professor  M. C.    Bill     Kratz. Ten years ago, twelve years ago, I could  have named you eight or nine of them, but their names just escape me  now. I   m eighty-six now.  Bob, going back to when you first enrolled at Oklahoma State, I guess  you   d maybe been there before with your father earlier, but     Several times.     as a student, what were your first impressions of Oklahoma State at  that time? Do you remember? Maybe about the campus, about the  Stillwater community?  I fell in love with the campus the minute I enrolled. I always attended  my classes. I don   t think I ever cut class. Morrill Hall was the primary  Business Administration area and I had classes there. In fact, I had  classes all over the campus.  Did you have any classes in Old Central?  Yes, classes at Old Central.    Money and Banking.    Second floor, and  every day I walked up the stairs   every other day when I walked up the  stairs to class, I couldn   t help but remember my father and my uncle  who graduated from there in 1896. They graduated from Oklahoma  A M at Old Central.  Was that pretty special for you to be taking classes right in that same  building where they   d had most of their classes?  Exactly, so special to me. Same building that my father attended classes.  Very endearing.  What were some of the favorite student hangouts at that time?  Swim   s was a big one, and then across the street was another one.  Campus Corner, maybe?  Campus Corner was one. Then there was a drugstore right across from  9  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  the fire station that was a big hangout. I remember coffee used to be a  nickel a cup. When I got back from the war, it had gone up to a dime,  and I thought,    Oh, this is ridiculous     (Laughter) That drugstore, I think  it   s still there. I   m not sure, but it was a big store and students were all  over it.  Bob, in those first couple of years there at Oklahoma State, before you  went to the military, what are some of your favorite memories that you  have of those two years? Are there some highlights for you during that  period? Maybe some Beta activities or other things that you did?  Well, I can   t think of highlights right now. But, it was a great institution,  it was a friendly institution, and I loved it, the friendliness and the  camaraderie in the student associations. I can   t remember much else.  If I understand correctly, you knew President Henry G. Bennett.  Yes, I did.  He knew your dad. Did you have an opportunity to meet him personally?  Yes, indeed, I did. Yes, I did, two or three different times. The one time  that I remember President Bennett more than any other one time was  upon graduation, in   what   s the hall?  Gallagher Hall?  Gallagher Hall, there was   we had listened to all this and then walked  across the stage and received my diploma. Well, unbeknownst to me,  when I walked up to the stage, my father was sitting in a chair next to  Henry Bennett. (Laughter) Henry Bennett passed him my diploma and  then my father gave me my diploma upon graduation in June of    47.  That was a very memorable experience. I   ll never forget that as long as I  live. I   m sure that it might have been repeated by others somewhere but  I don   t know anybody who received their diploma from their father.  Pretty special. What did you think of President Bennett? As a president,  as a person?  I thought he was a tremendous president. I think, and still think, that  President Bennett was largely responsible for putting OAMC on the big  forty-eight state map of the United States. It became much more known  as a big university under his supervision.  Did you ever visit in the President   s home with him?  10  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  No, I did not.  We talked about your military experience, then when you came back it  was a changed campus, wasn   t it? Can you describe the changes that  had happened with the vets coming back and the new   should I call the  buildings temporary facilities?  When I left the campus in May of    43 to go to the Army, most of the  dormitories were now WAAC  Women   s Auxiliary Army Corps  and  WAVES  Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service   dormitories. We had WAACS and WAVES all over the campus. When I  came back from the war and started my last year, there wasn   t a WAVE  or a WAAC in sight and everything was back to normal.  When you came back, where did you stay? This would have been the fall  of    46, is that right?  Fall of    46. I stayed at the Beta house.  Still back at the Beta house.  In fact, all the fraternity houses were also converted into dormitories for  the WAACS or WAVES. I   ll never forget walking up to the restroom on  the second and third floors. I walked to the restroom and there was the  toilets partitioned off. (Laughter) I had never seen that before. I just got  my enjoyment out of seeing that. Shortly after school started, those  partitions were torn down. (Laughter)  Do you remember the Quonset huts and the Vet Village?  Quonset huts and Vet Village I remember quite well. Vet Village was  getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. It was primarily for  married veterans. Vet Village was pretty good sized. I can   t remember  the numbers that were there, but it was well into the four-figures in Vet  Village there.  Bob, there were a lot of temporary buildings that they had classes in  because of the large number of students that expanded so fast. Did you  have some classes in temporary buildings?  No, I did not.  Most of yours were in Morrill Hall?  Morrill Hall and Old Central and I forgotten the names of some of the  other buildings.  11  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  When you were there, other than President Bennett, did any of the other  staff or the faculty or the students know about your connection, about  your father being in the first graduating class?  No, not to my knowledge.  You didn   t necessarily share that with anyone either?  No, no. I didn   t want them to think I was bragging or seeking popularity  or seeking a name for myself. I intended to make it on my own and I did.  So you went one more year and you graduated in the spring of    47?  Spring of    47.  Now something pretty important happened that year in your life that  changed your life quite a bit. Did you meet somebody special during this  period?  I met the love of my life. (Laughter) In the fall of    46, I met Pat  Headrick. We actually fell in love with each other and we kept going  together. I wanted to get married when I got out of college but one day,  we were in Enid, Oklahoma to see her parents. Her parents asked us if  we would wait until Pat graduated from college before we got married.  We talked about it and we agreed, which wasn   t too hard to agree to,  because I didn   t have any money so I had a year to make some money to  live on.  What year was Pat in school?  She graduated in June of    48. June 2 of 1948. We were married on June  6, 1948. (Laughter) Then, we spent our honeymoon traveling to Detroit  where I was interviewing for a job with the Dodge division of Chrysler  Cooperation. I got the job and it was a district manager for Dodge  Brothers Cooperation, with the Dodge-Plymouth and Dodge truck  dealers. My station was in Amarillo and I had forty-eight counties and  my responsibility was two things. Number one was dealer representation  and number two was dealer sales and things worked out fine.  You were like a factory rep working with the dealerships? You  represented the factory and the company working with the dealers?  Yes, in sales and one or two dealers in eight counties I had to replace  and had to make sure that the new dealer was well financed, certain  amount of equipment was in place. It was a fine job.  12  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  How many years were you in that position?  About four and a half or five years. I got transferred to Oklahoma City to  the regional headquarters and then I was financial manager for the zone I  was in. Then, I got transferred again to Memphis, Tennessee to a very  lush job with Dodge. And then all of a sudden, it occurred to me that it   s  just going on and going on and going on and I decided that I did not  want to live in Detroit  because  I knew Detroit was going to be next. I  resigned and went into business with a friend in sales. I   ve been in sales  all my life.  What kind of sales were you in, you and your partner?  I retired after twenty-three years of being a manufacture representative  for office furniture. I sold to the dealers only. Not to the user, to the  dealers only. I had three partners and we had a four-state area: Texas,  Oklahoma, Arkansas,  and  Louisiana. We had two warehouses, one in  Dallas and one in Houston. We gave the dealers overnight service,  which was a big help and was one of the big reasons for our success, our  service to the dealers. It worked out fine. I really enjoyed sales. Before I  went to the manufacture, I left Dodge and went to school furniture  manufacture and got to be sales manager. One bright day, I discovered  as I was signing checks to my salesmen, they were making three and  four times what I was making. (Laughter) To make a long story short, I  resigned shortly thereafter and took on this job as sales rep for office  furniture. I had no responsibilities other than sales and that suited me  fine.  You didn   t have the management and the budgets and all that?  Management and budget and all that kind of thing, that was for  somebody else. I didn   t want to spend my time  with that , so I spent my  time selling and making money.  Bob, in your family, you had two daughters, is that correct?  Two beautiful daughters. Mary Katherine Adams, born in    50 and Julie  Ann Adams born in    54. Our youngest daughter is now a retired  schoolteacher. Imagine being the parent of a retired teacher. (Laughter)  My oldest daughter is now a grandmother, can you imagine? (Laughter)  Katy, is that her nickname?  Katy.  She went to school at Oklahoma State.  13  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Katy went to Oklahoma State in 1968 to 1972 and she was at Oklahoma  State for four years. She met this boy, John Gates, and John was a pretty  well known Cowboy football player. So, to make a long story short,  upon her and his graduation, they were married in Stillwater in     Let   s see, wouldn   t it have been   72?  That   s right.  What was Katy   s major, do you recall?  Shorthand typing. Business.  Now Julie, who obviously was an intelligent and bright daughter as well,  she somehow made it to Texas Tech, is that right? (Laughs)  Julie said,    Daddy, I   d love to go to your school, but I   ll tell you, I want  to teach in Texas.    And she said,    I can   t teach in Texas if I go to  Oklahoma.    So I said,    Honey, it   s your decision.    She went to Texas  Tech and loved every minute of it up there. Texas Tech is a fine school.  There   s a big correlation between Oklahoma State University and Texas  Tech. They   re both just friendly schools, great schools. Classes are  great, camaraderie is great, the students are friendly; the teachers are all  gung-ho for the students     Bob, from your side, your parents and then going from your father to  you and down, your family    Katy and John are graduates and is there  anyone else in this side of your decedents that are OSU graduates that  we missed?  No.  I want to kind of back up a little and ask a little bit about your dad.   With  the other decedents of the family, have you stayed in touch with  the rest of the family? There   s  your father   s  brother Arthur and then  your dad was James Homer. Now we   ll talk about reunions a little bit  later but just generally, do you know many of the other family members?  Well, the four brothers, one of which is my father   I had three uncles  and I was very familiar with all three of my uncles. My dad took me  around to their houses and we visited for two or three days oh, maybe  once a year. Went out to Evergreen Valley Ranch in New Mexico and to  see Uncle Arthur in Fort Stockton, Texas. Stayed there with Uncle  Arthur and Aunt Olive for three or four days and got well acquainted.  Then, of course, Uncle Walter was the backbone of the family. He was  still on the property that my grandfather came down from Kansas and  14  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  homesteaded, the 160 acres in the Oklahoma Land Run in 1889.  Let me back up and ask you a couple of questions I forgot to ask you  before I get too far. After you graduated, have you stayed in touch with  OSU through the years or do you come back to any reunions or any  occasions, Dallas alumni activities or     We have been to the Homecoming several times   many times.  Sometimes we stayed with Walter Adams and sometimes we stayed at a  hotel and so on. But, yes. We don   t go every year, or every other year,  but every four of five years, but we manage to go back.  Are you pleased about the progress that your alma mater has made  since you graduated?  Oh, very definitely  Very definitely and I believe the enrollment is now  what, 25,000?  Probably 22,000 or 23,000.  When I was a student, it was 12,000 until 1943 and then it dropped  down to 7,000. Everybody went to war. (Laughs)  Right, absolutely. You talked about the Run. Your grandfather William  H. H. Adams grew up in Kentucky, moving his family to Kansas. Then,  he participated in the Land Run into the Unassigned Lands in Indian  Territory and secured a patent on a quarter-section of land that was  actually located in present-day Stillwater, Oklahoma.  Yes.  He surveyed the original town site for the city of Stillwater, right?  Correct.  What do you remember from family history about the Run? Did any  other family members make the Run with William H. H. into Indian  Territory?  My father was right with him at the time, but the other three brothers  were not because they were in school in Kansas. When my grandfather  took my dad with him to Stillwater to make the Run, my dad was there  every step of the way.  How old was he at that time?  15  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  He was eleven years old.  He made the Run with his dad   this is James Homer, your dad   when  he was eleven years old     Yes. And my dad, one of his memories, the very happiest time of his  whole life was the four day trek from Kansas down to Stillwater when   they  moved all the furniture and all the family. Four days down and  three days back and he was eleven years old; one of his happiest  memories.  Did he ever share any stories with you about the Run? They were  literally running; they were riding in to claim a section, stake the land.  Did he ever share any stories with you about the actual Run experience  with his dad?  No.  Do you remember about  them  putting a stake in the ground or where  they stayed? Is that kind of special to you that your dad was an original  Eighty-Niner? It was actually your grandfather, but your dad was with  him and made that Run. Is that a pretty special feeling for you?  Very special  Very special. It makes Oklahoma A M, OSU, very  special to me even more so than just being a graduate of the school. The  fact that my father was involved in all that Stillwater business.  William H. H. was a pretty special guy, your grandfather. What do you  remember from family stories about him? Do you have sort of an image  in your mind about him from the stories you   ve heard from your dad and  from other family members?  I don   t recall any of those stories, no sir.  As a kind of patriarch of the family, I thought there might be some  stories that were handed down to     One would think so, and I   m sure there were, but I don   t know any.  You were talking about earlier, out of the four brothers one, of course, is  your father James Homer and then Arthur, those two enrolled in  Oklahoma State University in December of 1891, enrolled and I guess  because Arthur was sick or something, your dad was officially the first  person who enrolled at Oklahoma State University, is that right?  He was the first person; my father was the first student to enroll in the  16  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Oklahoma A M College.  Wow.  It was done alphabetically and the only reason that Arthur wasn   t there,  he was sick that day and couldn   t be there, but he graduated   my dad  and Uncle Arthur graduated together in the class of 1896 and my uncle  got the first diploma because they graduated in alphabetical order. Now,  their graduation was different, quite different than today   s graduation.  Each of those six graduates had to give a ten to twelve to fifteen minute  dissertation on a certain subject that was assigned to them. Each of them.  At the graduation ceremony, each of the six in turn gave a ten minute  lecture on a subject that was assigned to them.  Do you remember what your father   s subject was?  I do not know.  You can go look at it in the College Mirror, they would have it written  down.  It   s written down, but I don   t remember.  Now, your father was fairly young. How old was he when he graduated?  Seventeen or eighteen.  He would   ve actually enrolled in 1891 when he would have been  thirteen years old, which is a little young for enrolling in college isn   t it?  Very young, very young. But now, one must try to analyze all that. The  situation was a lot different then than it is now. When my father  graduated, he became a teacher in Stillwater and became principal of  one of the schools there and then shortly thereafter, he was with the  Oklahoma A M faculty.  This is your father?  My father. Teaching in the college there. I do not know the subject he  taught, but it had to do with farming.  Now, the original 160 acres that was homesteaded by my grandfather  was in south Stillwater and on seventy or so acres, they had pecan trees  and then a few years after they planted pecan trees, they planted several  acres of walnut trees. It was known as the Adams Nut Farm. (Laughter)  Pecans and walnuts made a living for the Adams Family for years and  17  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  years and years and years. My cousin, Walter Adams and his wife  Diane, still live on the property and they still pick up pecans every year.  We   ve enjoyed many of the pecans the last few years that they   ve seen  fit to give us.  There were some chuckles in the family about the Adams Nut Farm?  (Laughs) Someone had a good sense of humor to come up with that one.  That   s right. Well, it   s all a sense of humor.  Bob, going back, did you have a chance to talk to your dad about his  OSU experiences? Did he ever talk about what it was like to be a student  at that time when it was just a raw university on the Plains? Did he ever  share any of his memories of OAMC with you?  No, he did not. He did not.  My understanding is  your father  maintained pretty close ties with his  alma mater, didn   t he?  Very close.  He was president of the Alumni Association, right?  He and Uncle Arthur both had a term as president of the Alumni  Association.  Did he go back fairly regularly to reunions? You know, five year  reunions, to Homecoming, those kinds of things?  Yes, he did.  It remained important to him throughout his life?  Exactly.  Did he ever take you back with him on some of those trips to Stillwater?  Were you on campus with your father some back when you were young?  Yes, yes.  What do you remember from some of your early trips when you were in  grade school?  I remember what a great school and how big it was and it was many  blocks of brick building and so on. I could hardly wait to grow up and  18  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  go there and be a part of it.  Was Dr. Bennett president during the time when you were going with  your dad? Had he become president yet?  Yes.  Did you go to the Alumni Association, or I guess it was called the  Former Student Association in those days. Did you go to any of those  banquets or the reunion activities?  No, I did not.  As I   ve talked to other family members, your father and his brother  Arthur   I guess because of being brothers certainly, but because of  being in school together at OSU, they seemed to be pretty close and had  a relationship throughout life. Is that true?  They were very close. Yes, very close. But, my dad was very close to  each of the three brothers. Uncle Walter and Uncle Arthur and Oscar. He  loved them all very dearly. He kept in touch with them. Not weekly, but  monthly they would write each other and so on.  Taking your father   s career a little bit, could you share with us after he  graduated from Oklahoma State (and of course I say Oklahoma State, it  was then Oklahoma A M) and so he taught there for a while, was  principal in Stillwater. Could you kind of get the highlights of his career  then after that?  Yes, I will. From Stillwater, he took a job and moved to Ardmore   I  can   t name the exact date, years and so on. But anyway, he was there  when it was Indian Territory. My mother graduated from what is now  Wayne  State  University in Michigan. It was Detroit Normal School at  the time and she was offered a teaching position in five different  locations around the country and she chose Ardmore, I.T.  Indian  territory . She wanted to see things and do things, so she thought that  would be great. Upon her graduation, she took her mother and the two of  them came down to Ardmore, I.T. and lived there and was a teacher  there for several years. That   s where my mother and my dad met. A few  years after they met, she went to Ada, Oklahoma to be a teacher in the  college there  East Central  and so she was there. My father kept going  over to Ada dating her and so on. Finally, he convinced her and brought  her back to Ardmore and they were married in 1911 and my brother,  James    Jimmy    was born in 1913.  Just briefly about your mother   s background, was she originally, did you  19  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  say earlier, from Wisconsin?  She was a native of a little town called West Salem, Wisconsin, which is  ten miles from La Crosse and she grew up there on a farm and then she  went to school at the university that is now Wayne  State  University. I  think it was at the time she was there, it was called Detroit Normal  School. Both my mother and father were teachers, and that   s how they  met.  Your father was teaching in Ardmore? Is that what he was doing?  He was teaching and he was superintendent of the schools.  He was superintendent of the school system for the Ardmore school  system.  By the same token, Arthur also lived there and my dad and Uncle Arthur  were in the oil and gas business in Ardmore.  He was doing that on the side while he was superintendent?  Yes. It became more and more a major part of his life. He resigned from  the teaching and was strictly with the oil and gas there in Ardmore with  his brother. Then in 1918, they decided that there was a big bright future  for them in Texas so each of them moved their family to Fort Worth, and  that   s where I was born.  I   m going to back up and ask you a question   what was  your uncle and  your dad   s  interest in oil and gas? What did they know about oil and  gas? How did they get in the oil and gas business?  Well, they both studied and knew the drilling aspect of the oil and gas  business quite well and around Ardmore. At the time, Ardmore was big  in the oil world. In fact, I   ve learned since that there were more  millionaires per capita in Ardmore, Oklahoma than in any other city in  the United States. My dad wanted to take advantage of that opportunity.  Maybe he was kind of self-taught? He just learned and learned about it?  It was all self-taught.  It was just there was some money to be made in the oil business so he  decided it looked like something he ought to get into.  And lots of money was to be made.  20  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Were they buying and leasing royalty-owned land and putting together  packages for drilling, is that what they were engaged in?  Yes. When they moved to Fort Worth, they were still in the oil and  business. Then along came the Depression in   29,    30,    31. Things just  fell apart and my uncle moved to Fort Stockton, Texas. My dad got very  interested in the Ranger, Cisco, Eastland oil field in west Texas, and  very much involved in that particular area, Ranger, Eastland and Cisco.  As luck would have it, he didn   t do well and life for my dad has been a  struggle ever since. Financially, it   s been a struggle ever since.  In Fort Stockton, did he then move to east Texas from there or where  you were growing up? You were in Fort Worth all that time, so had you  already left for college when he went on out to Fort Stockton?  No, my dad didn   t go to Fort Stockton; my uncle went to Fort Stockton.  My dad went out to the Ranger, Eastland, Cisco oil area.  What year was that? How old were you at the time?  Oh, preschooler. And thirteen   I   ve forgotten.  You had mentioned earlier, at that point when he left, you and your  mother then stayed in Fort Worth?  Yes. And they were divorced.  So, you were raised by your mom and     My mom and then my aunt came down from Wisconsin to live with my  mother so the two ladies raised me from the time I was five until I got  through high school.  Did you ever have an opportunity to hear Arthur and your dad talk when  they got together about their times at Stillwater? About OSU? Do you  remember any of those stories or conversations?  My dad took me out to Fort Stockton a couple of times and we spent the  night with Uncle Arthur and Aunt Olive   oh, maybe two or three nights.  My dad and Uncle Arthur would end up buddy-buddy and talking but  not with me or anything. So no, I was not in on any of those  conversations.  What do you remember about your father in terms of his personality, his  personal traits?  21  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Well, he liked people. He wanted to be around people and he was  constantly trying to figure out how to make more money doing this or  doing that or what have you.  He was a pretty entrepreneurial kind of person then?  Yes.  Is this maybe where you got some of your sales background from, with  people?  It could be; it could be. Probably is.  He was a teacher earlier in his career   was he pretty sharp?  My dad was primarily a very quiet man. He attended to all the basic  qualities of life and so forth, but he didn   t go out of his way to exude and  so on.  I want to ask you a question then about your Uncle Arthur. If someone  knew he was one of the first few graduates and someone historically a  hundred years now was wanting to know about him, what would you say  about Uncle Arthur?  He was one of the greatest men I ever knew in my life. I loved Uncle  Arthur. He was always full of vim and vigor and love and helped me in  my aims and goals and he took time to be with me and took time to talk  to me. He was just the kind of person that everybody loved. Uncle  Arthur did okay in the oil business out in west Texas in Fort Stockton,  but it was not any big stakes.  Didn   t make the big deal, but just made pretty good money?  Yes.  I want to back up. I forgot to ask  about  your brother James. Can you  tell me a little bit about James?  Jimmy? He was ten years older than I. I was four or five years old before  I realized I had a brother and so forth. About that time, he went off to  college. Then, he graduated and I went up to Stillwater in 1934 to his  graduation. It was a very big ceremony and a wonderful time. Jimmy  was just full of vigor, and vim and vigor and was thrilled to death that  he   d made it through school as an electrical engineer. Jimmy was always  smart and he was very musically talented. He played the clarinet in the  OSU or OAMC band. He went to the Chicago World   s Fair with the  22  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Oklahoma A M band. When he graduated in 1934 as an electrical  engineer, he could not get a job. Finally, he accepted and took a job with  Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company in Oklahoma City at the station  there and his job was to mow the grass and to trim the hedges.  With an electrical engineering degree?  With an electrical engineering degree. He did that for five or six months.  One day, they called him in and there was an opening in Ponca City for  an electrical engineer. He accepted and moved to Ponca City, and that   s  where he met his wife.  Bob, we were talking about your dad and then I asked about your Uncle  Arthur, but a question that I forgot to ask in there was about your career  and when you were with Dodge and I think your last stop was in  Memphis and then you said you really didn   t want to go to Detroit.  Correct.  Can you kind of pick up a little bit there? I should have asked you some  follow-up questions there.  From there, I took a job with Verco Manufacturing Company which was  a manufacturer of school furniture. I moved to Conway, Arkansas where  they were located. They were located in Los Angeles and also Conway,  Arkansas. I was going to come to the eastern part of the United States,  so I was in Conway, Arkansas for quite a while and hired salesmen from  different parts of the country and that   s when I got tired of mailing them  their checks and them making more than I did. Then that   s when I  resigned and moved to Dallas and became a manufacturer representative  for office furniture.  Did you have a partner in that that you mentioned?  Three partners. Three partners and we had two warehouses, one in  Houston and one in Dallas. I think I mentioned them. And we covered  Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.  And that kept you closer to your mother, I guess? She was still in Fort  Worth at that time?  Yes, yes.  I appreciate you filling that in for me. We were asking about your  brother, Jimmy, just a minute ago before we interrupted our train of  thought, but Jimmy had how many children?  23  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Five children.  Five children and how many of those went to Oklahoma State  University?  Four.  Four of them, wow   Four of them went, yes. All of them have been very successful in their  lives. The one that did not go to Oklahoma State instead went to  Princeton. He is a Presbyterian minister, retired in a suburb of  Washington, D.C. called Rockville. Then, there   s Steve Adams, which is  the youngest and he is a professor of  communications  in Lawton,  Oklahoma.  In Lawton at Cameron?  At Cameron College, yes. He has two sons, each of which has attended.  Great. So Steve, his other brothers and sisters that went to Oklahoma  State, what were their names? What were the names of the four kids  of  Jimmy   s  that went to OSU?  Toni; her name was Antoinette (we called her Toni), Tom Adams and  Steve Adams and Jerry Adams. Jerry Adams was a very talented young  man. He got his Master   s degree in Princeton and got a doctorate.  A good lineage of OSU there through you and your kids and Jimmy and  his kids.  Yes, oh yes. Exactly.  Pretty exciting. I wanted to ask you a little bit about Arthur again. You  talked a little about Arthur, his strengths and his characteristics. You  said he was very outgoing. What are some of the other things you  remember about your Uncle Arthur?  What I remember about Uncle Arthur, he was very personality outward.  And he liked me and he liked helping me and talking with me. We just  had a great camaraderie. Now, mind you, all of this is when I was  relatively young, so I don   t know any great stories about him, but he was  in the oil business in Fort Stockton.  Did he ever visit with you about any of his OSU experiences?  24  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  No.  You understand that your father and Uncle Arthur both maintained  pretty close ties to OSU as we were talking about earlier. Both got back  fairly regularly and stayed in touch with the university.  Now, my dad had two sons (one was me) that went to Oklahoma State.  Uncle Arthur had two sons and a daughter and the three of them went to  Oklahoma State. One graduated in 1929, one graduated in 1930 and then  one graduated in 1935. So, all of Uncle Arthur   s children went to  Oklahoma State.  Then somewhere, some of them started going to Texas then, didn   t they?  Oh, well yes.  We won   t talk about that. (Laughter) Did your dad have any special  hobbies or interests that he had? You talked about that he liked to think  about making money and was sort of entrepreneurial. Were there any  hobbies or special interests that he had?  None that I recall.  So we might want to back up and ask also about your mother, Verna.  Verna Van Wormer, yes.  She must have been a pretty special lady. You talked about her a little bit  earlier about coming down from Wisconsin and Detroit, Michigan to  Indian Territory. What do you remember about your mom?  She was a great lady. She had a host of friends. She was very talented in  her ability to make and keep close friends. My mother was a contralto  and she sang at the First Methodist Church in Fort Worth for years.  Times were tough then when I was growing up, but Mother was always  full of vim and vigor.  Did she ever remarry?  Yes, she remarried. When I was in Stillwater in the early forties,    41,    42  and    43, she remarried a man named Charlie Brown. His wife Pearl and  my mother were very dear friends in Fort Worth. Charlie Brown moved  to Skiatook, Oklahoma, which is ten miles north of Tulsa.  He  had a  ranch there and raised cattle and had a big dairy. His wife Pearl died.  Charlie Brown came down several times to see Mother, and the next  thing I knew, they were married. I spent a few months with my mother  25  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  in Skiatook there during summer college break. But, Charlie Brown then  became bedfast and so my mother moved back to Fort Worth to where  my Aunt Jessie lived and the three of them lived. Charlie Brown died.  I appreciate it, thank you. There have been many descendents of the four  Adams brothers, William H. H.   s kids.  It   s  quite a story. Is that special  to you and your family that there   s been this lineage of Oklahoma State  University people through the family?  Very, very special. It had become very special and it had become so  special that I wanted to make more of it than I knew. In 1989, Oklahoma  State was having a one hundredth anniversary affair and I received a  phone call from the president   s office in OSU to be representative of my  father   s era: 1890 to 1900. And so, fine. The day of the big ceremony,  we drove up there and I got my place and they called out the time and     this was in Gallagher Hall, and I had three escorts. They took me down  to the stage and then the 1900 to 1910, they came and so on. During that  time, one of my escorts gave me a slip of paper and I read it and it said,     Whatever you do, don   t leave the stage when it   s over. We want to  come down and meet you. We   re your cousins and we want to come  down and meet you.    Signed, Walter. After the ceremony was over, I  stayed around and the next thing I know, up comes this guy and his  beautiful wife; it   s Walter. We introduced ourselves and went on and on.  We talked forever and to make a long story short, the extent of that  particular conversation was I took it upon myself to organize an Adams  brothers    family reunion and I did that. I was retired by then and we had  a place in Angel Fire, New Mexico, which is in northeast New Mexico.  A big ski area. I organized it and had everybody come out there.  What year was that first reunion?  1991 and every brother   s heirs and children were there.  Wow.  There were fifty-one or fifty-two people there. It was highly successful.  It was a four-day affair and I organized things. Pat organized things and  she did more than her share. Pat did; she cooked the meals and so on.  Breakfast was on their own and lunch and dinner   for instance, on one  of the days, I took them on a hike and at 9:30, they met at our house and  those that wanted to go on the hike had fixed their own lunch in our  kitchen and there were about thirty-one or thirty-two of us on this hike.  Then the other twelve or fourteen or fifteen people, whatever it was,  went to Taos shopping and they had a great time.  Bob, out of the about fifty-one or so that you   re talking about, how many  26  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  did you know out of that fifty-one? A lot of these were people you   d  never met, I assume?  Oh no, I knew probably ten to fifteen percent of them.  You really didn   t know very many of them. This is the first of the four  brothers   W. H. H. sons   the first reunion or get-together those families  had ever had?  That   s right, and I never knew there was such a person as Jane Doe or  John Doe or what have you. We got together and we just all came. I had  it all organized so that one evening after dinner, each of us was required  to stand up and give a five-minute talk about themselves and about how  they fit into the family. It was well done. That little thing got everybody  well acquainted and cemented the family relationship right there because  everybody knew everybody else and they knew of what the person was  talking about even though they didn   t know the person. It worked out  fine.  Some of the OSU people will find each other, talk about some of their  OSU experiences?  Oh, yes. And we got photo albums of the   every once in a while, we  browse through them and stroll down memory lane and it just tears us up  what a great time we had.  So,  that was  in    91 then you   ve had two or three since then?  Then five years later, Bud and Diane, that   s Walter and Diane Adams  who still live on the 160-acres in Stillwater, organized the second  Adams brothers    family reunion. We all went to Stillwater in August of  1996. Yes. It was a great time and it was well received. They did just as  much as we did. Then in 2001, Pat and I had them out to Angel Fire  again and instead of fifty, I think there were about fifty-four that time.  About the same. They were on their own at the hotel. They were on their  own for breakfast. The rest of the time, we were in charge of whatever it  involved.  That   s great. How special is OSU to you and your family? Can you  share some of your thoughts about the family legacy, how you feel about  that, what it means to you?  I feel that we are very fortunate to have this legacy of OSU. It   s a very  deep honor to be related to the first two students that graduated and it   s  just a feeling of great comfort to know that our families did so well and  have done so well over the years through the basic training and so forth  27  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  of Oklahoma State University.  Bob, how many are there? Are there four generations now or has there  been a fifth generation yet of Adams family from Arthur on down? Are  there four generations or five?  Four. Well, if you consider my father would be the first generation? Is  that what you   re talking about?  Yes, and then Arthur.  Then there   s myself and then there   s Katy   four generations.  Has OSU sufficiently acknowledged the Adams Family, its contributions  and its unique place in the university   s history?  Oh yes, indeed   In what ways?  I   ve received two or three letters from different presidents of the  university regarding the Adams Family. I   ve got them on file somewhere  and it   s been very rewarding to know that the university thinks so highly  of our family and has such regard for our family and it is reciprocated.  Our family has such a high regard for Oklahoma State.  What do you think about your exhibit in the Alumni Center? Is that  pretty special to have the     Shocked. I was shocked at the Alumni Center. There was the Adams  Family     Their panel, a big exhibit there     1896, yes. My dad and mother and myself and my wife and my children  and several others   it just was a shock and a great, unexpected accolade.  That panel in the Alumni Center was just one of the biggest thrills of my  life  To see it there and the Conoco-Phillips Alumni Center is just a  great asset to the university. To bring this to a close, I want to mention  something else that was just as big a thrill; I just can   t get over what a  thrill it was. And that   s when I took my family up to Stillwater to the  dedication and naming of the dining hall for the new dormitories and the  name of the     The Adams Market?  28  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  The Adams Market. Named after Uncle Arthur and my dad, Homer.  Wonderful.  That   s quite a thrill. It was a thrill for all of us and it was quite a thrill for  all of Arthur Adams    family.  Bob, is there anything else that we haven   t covered? I know we   ve talked  a lot, but is there anything that you   d like to mention about your  relationship with Oklahoma State University or about the Adams Family  we maybe haven   t covered?  No.  I appreciate very much you taking time to share that with us. It   s very  special that your father was in the very first graduating class at  Oklahoma State University in 1896.  That   s right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
