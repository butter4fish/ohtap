 Neurohr  Creager  Today is Thursday, October 4, 2007 and I   m at the home of Marge  Creager in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Mrs. Creager, would you tell us a little  about when you were at OSU  Oklahoma State University ?  I would be happy to  Of course, I have nothing but fond memories and  I   m still an avid alum because every Sunday if we   ve won a game, I  wear orange and black and my big orange earrings and my watch and it  all has OSU on it. But if we lose, I wear all black. This is in my Sunday  school class at Asbury Methodist Church. I   m the only one that has the  nerve to do that. We   ve got alumni in there from TU  University of  Tulsa  and OU  University of Oklahoma  so it   s a lot of fun.  Well you are an avid OSU fan.  That   s right.  What year did you graduate from OSU?  1947. I was so glad because you know why? I got married just as soon  as I got out of school.  Oh you did?  Yes, June 1, 1947. And came right to Tulsa because my husband was  from Tulsa and I was really a farm girl. And he always used to remind  me every once in a while,    I   m going to take the country out of you if  it   s the last thing I do.    (Laughter)  So where did you grow up?  I grew up in northwest Oklahoma on the farm that my grandparents got  in the Oklahoma Run. And then when I started high school, my daddy  5  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  moved us to eastern Oklahoma and he helped build Grand River Dam.  And there I graduated from Ketchum High School in 1942.  Oh you did?  Then somebody said,    You need to go to college.    And I said,    How?  My parents don   t have the money.    So what I did, I stayed out a whole  year and worked at the Oklahoma Ordinance Works and I lived in  Pryor   made more money then I   d ever made in my life. I was a  secretary in the chemistry lab. So when I went to college, they thought I  knew so much in chemistry because I   d been around it. I really didn   t.  Oh, it was so hard for me. But anyway, one day I was riding to work and  the boy that I rode to work with said,    You really need to go to college.     And he had just finished from OSU. He went over and talked to the dean  of arts and sciences, Dean Scroggs, and I want you to know he got me a  job sight unseen and I went right over there and started college the next  year working in Dean Scroggs    office as his secretary.  Oh that   s wonderful.  And I worked there for about three years. I really did   made fifty  dollars a month. So I worked four hours a day and went to school the  other times. So when kids say to me,    I just can   t go to college, I don   t  have the money.    I say,    Don   t tell me that. If you want to bad enough,  you can.    Of course, things have changed a lot but now there are a lot  more scholarships available. So it was the beginning of a fun time.  You said that your parents didn   t go to OSU, did you have any other  family members that went to OSU or that are at OSU now?  Yeah, I do now. I had a sister that went there one year and that   s all she  made it. I was the first one of the family that ever went to college. Now I  have a granddaughter there and of course, my three children went there.  They didn   t all finish, but my oldest daughter did. She became a teacher.  What were your first impressions of the campus at OSU? Had you been  there before you actually were ready to move in and start school?  No, I was so excited when I moved over there. You know what? I lived  in the Kappa Sig  Kappa Sigma  house, the boy   s fraternity house. Later  I lived in the Beta  Beta Theta Pi  house. That was where I met my  husband. But you know what they called them during the war?  No.  Victory Halls. So all the girls moved into the boy   s fraternity houses.  6  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  And that was so much fun and my room was very tiny. It was so little,  but you know I didn   t even care because I   d never been to college  before. I   d been to a small high school so everything was exciting. It just  didn   t matter to me. I didn   t have many clothes anyway, so I didn   t need  a large closet.  Did you share your room or did you have it all to yourself?  No, I had it all to myself. And the Air Corps was there and the WAVES   Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service , so I didn   t have  any trouble for dates. (Laughs)  Well did you know anyone that was at OSU when you first went?  No I didn   t. I really didn   t. So it was a whole beginning for me.  Do you have any memories of particular buildings on campus?  Oh yes, I do. Especially Murray Hall because I did stay there for a while.  After I started dating my husband, we really decided that we were going  to be engaged. He   d come over there after the hours were over and he   d  come around to my room. I was on the first floor and he would kiss me  goodnight through the screen. (Laughter) That was a pretty funny thing  to do.  Well yes. How did you meet your husband?  Oh, I was living in the Beta house and I was social chairman and we had  a big Christmas dance and, of course, then we just invited boys to our  house to dance. So we just invited the football team. We thought that  was a good start. We didn   t know if they   d come or not but here they  came. We were dancing the    glow worm    and that   s a good mixer, you  know. So here I get my husband-to-be and he was being funny and he  says,    How about a date New Year   s Eve?       because the football team  was going to the Cotton Bowl. And I said,    Fine.    Because you know I  was a little older than some of the other girls because I   d stayed out a  year and so boys didn   t scare me at all. The band, which I played in   I  played the snare drums   they were supposed to go. Well we didn   t get  to go because OSU didn   t have the money. So when he came back, I get  this call and I thought it was a boy I   d been dating in my church. And all  of a sudden, he said,    I don   t know if I should ask you for a date or not.  You stood me up New Year   s Eve.    So then I knew who it was. I kind of  gave him a hard time. And I said,    Okay   ,    and he   s paid for it ever  since.  That   s a good story. Did you date anyone else after you started dating?  7  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  No, I didn   t. You know how boys are, if they think somebody else has  you they more or less leave you alone.  So what were some of your favorite hang outs on campus and around  town?  Swim   s. We   d go there between classes. And what did they call the one  on the corner? I   ve already forgotten the name of it, up there across from  the fire place  station . Swim   s was the other one and that was down  there closer to my class.  I   ve heard stories about the Y-Hut     No, it wasn   t the Y-Hut. It was a corner drugstore and we met there a  lot. But I cannot remember the name of it. After all it   s been over fifty  years  (Laughs)  Okay, well what were some of the activities that you were involved in at  OSU? I know you have quite a long list of things you did there.  Well, you know, that was something that meant a lot to me because  being in a small high school they didn   t have very many organizations.  Basketball was the main thing and I started playing basketball in the  fourth grade and we had a really good team in Ketchum, Oklahoma. We  almost went to state once, didn   t quite make it. But anyway, there  weren   t any other organizations so when I got to Oklahoma A M,  everything they asked me to join, I joined. And it was really, really fun.  I got into YWCA and I   gosh, it   s even hard to remember all of the  things I was in. I was majoring in health and physical education, I got  into terpsichorean which was a modern dance club, and I played all of  the sports because I was majoring in health and physical education. Golf  was the hardest because I had never played golf in my life. Who plays  golf on the farm? And my husband was a really good golfer but I just  joined other things too.  I didn   t join a sorority till my junior year. And you know, I   m glad I  didn   t because by then I knew all about them and I knew which one I  wanted. So it was really wonderful. The sorority taught me so many  things. It taught me my manners   I never had been taught any manners.  I mean, I guess my folks would slap my hand if I did something really  wrong. The sorority taught you which fork to use and which spoon and  when to use it and all those things. And we had prayer time in our  sorority and I thought that was nice and I just learned a lot. To this day, I  play bridge with my college friends once a month.  8  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  That   s nice and what sorority was it?  Alpha Delta Pi. I don   t need to tell you what my husband called it.  (Laughs)  Okay. What other traditions were really fun and important to you?  Well, of course playing in the band. I had to decide if I wanted to be in  the pep club or in the band. I said to myself,    I can play in the band for a  long time, maybe.    And the only reason I chose to play the drums was  because the drums were free and I didn   t have the money to play the  horn. So that   s why I played the snare drums. Would you guess that I   m  playing in a Dixieland band right now and I have to play tonight? And  we go to all of the nursing homes and retirement homes and I   m playing  the trap drums. And I never had a lesson on the trap drum in my life and  I love it.  Anyway, when we play a ballgame, of course, my boyfriend played  football, he was the place kicker. They called him,    The Man with the  Educated Toe.    And every time he   d make a goal, the band would play  and I   d get to beat the drum really loud and everybody would look at  me. (Laughs) So when I went back twenty-five years later, they asked  the band alumni to play in the band and you know I did. I couldn   t  hardly carry that snare drum and those young boys were throwing those  sticks up in the air and I did well to keep the rhythm, and all the people  in the stands were laughing at me. (Laughter)  Oh, they probably weren   t. Well have the songs changed?  Yeah, they had to change the words a little bit when they became OSU  you know? So you kind of have to say O-S-U instead of O-A-M-C. And  you did have to change a few things. Of course, our band is much larger  now and very good. I just love to watch them play.  What kind of uniform did you have?  We had to wear black skirts. Our dean wouldn   t let us wear trousers. Oh  it made us so mad   black skirts and a black top. And we didn   t have the  artificial turf. We   d go out there every morning at seven in the morning  and practice and hit those holes that were in the ground of the football  field. It was awful.  Well what kind of shoes would you wear? Did you have on heels?  No, no, I   d wear tennis shoes. It was so hard. To this day I do not like to  get up early. When I retired, I said I   d never set that alarm clock again.  9  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Well, I   ve had to set it a few times when I   d go on a Red Cross trip. But  people have learned   my friends know not to call me before nine or ten  o   clock in the morning. So I was in the band all four years I was there.  Well how were women treated at OSU then?  Well, as I say, when I first started, we were pretty much in demand  because the WAVES were there and the Air Corps. The Air Corps boys  didn   t pay much attention to the WAVES. And of course, they had a lot  of regulations to abide by so they kind of liked the girls on the campus.  We didn   t have any trouble getting a date at all and they treated us very  nice, very nice. In fact, all through school we were treated nice. We  really were.  Were the rules different for the girls?  Some of them, yes. They really were. They were a lot more strict, a lot  more strict. Now when my granddaughter went over there last year, she  had a boy living in the room next to her in the dorm. Oh my gosh, we  wouldn   t have thought of that one. No way.  Did you have to be in at a certain time?  At a certain time, absolutely.  And what happened if you weren   t? What would they do?  Let me see, what happened? You know, I can   t even remember. I must  have been in   I know one time I was in late. And we didn   t have a car  but Mack would borrow one from the guy that was the head of one of  the departments where they keep the records. He   d loan him his car on  the weekend for his dates. (Laughs) But I tell you what, we did a lot of  walking which I know now is good for us.  And you said that you majored in physical education?  Mm-hmm because when I went to college, I had no idea what I wanted  to major in. I was a big, strong farm girl and I thought that was right  down my alley, and it was.  Would you have majored in something different, you think, if you had  known more?  Probably, probably would. But like I say, I found my niche when I went  back to get my master   s.  10  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  And what was that?  Well, about twenty years later and four kids and working full time, I got  it in guidance and counseling and I   ve been using that ever since. I still  work part time.  Where do you work?  I   m working at a youth center and DHS  Department of Human  Services  sends the boys and girls there from ten to eighteen. They   ve  been put in there because their parents have mistreated them. I   m the  therapist and I get to meet them one-on-one and talk to them and they  just spill their guts to me. I love them. They just have had, some of them,  the most horrible lives. Some of the mothers now-a-days start their  children at the age of three on alcohol and drugs. You can   t imagine.  And I read a letter   a little girl wanted me to hear it one morning that  she   d written. It says,    Dear Mom, why did you burn the bottom of my  feet when I was a baby? I just wanted a mother to love me   ,    and on  and on and on. So you know, it   s pretty heart-breaking, some of their  stories.  What do they call you?  Miss Marge.  Miss Marge?  Mm-hmm. They were going to call me Grandma but the staff wouldn   t  let them. They wouldn   t. Creager is kind of hard for them to remember  so they all call me Miss Marge.  Well that   s wonderful.  I love it. It   s a really neat job. My only paying job, they pay me by the  hour. And they let me go with the Red Cross when I need to. But see, I  don   t cost them any money when I   m gone because I don   t get any kind  of extra   just paid by the hour.  Well I   d like to know a little bit about your experiences with the Red  Cross. Now did you start with that while you were in college?  Yes I did. While I was in college I started going to camps every year but  where I got in with the Red Cross   when I learned how to swim, I lived  at Langley and the lake formed from Grand River to Grand Lake. I   d go  out in a boat with kids and jump in that lake. I didn   t know how to swim  but I was a strong kicker. And I learned how to swim and when I went to  11  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  OSU in P.E. I found out I   d learned a lot of things wrong. So I had to  take my swimming all over again and I ended up teaching swimming  thirty years after that. And so   what was that first question you asked?  When you started volunteering for the Red Cross     Yeah, so I went to a lot of Girl Scout camps and taught swimming and  horse back riding. I taught square dancing on horses. I taught modern  dance. I taught tennis and I loved it. And then     And that was mostly in the summer time?  Oh yes. That is what I   d do in the summer.  Were you paid to do that? Was it a job for you?  I don   t think I was ever paid to do that. (Laughs)  Just volunteer?  Volunteer, yeah, but it   s quite an experience. I went to Lake Cayuga in  New York once for ten weeks, it was in the summer. And when I got  back, they let my then-boyfriend, Mack, come to the house and help  serve and then they had all the girls step-out of the kitchen so he could  kiss me. (Laughs)  Oh, well then after you graduated from OSU, did you have a career?  Definitely. I got one of the life certificates in teaching kindergarten  through twelfth. And so I got married June the first and came right to  Tulsa and had a job teaching. I taught first in an elementary for only six  months because the teacher came back. She just left for some reason.  And I was glad, I was ready to quit the teaching profession. They didn   t  have a gymnasium. I had to have those kids in a cafeteria. It was awful.  I   d go home so tired. I   d go to sleep on the bus. Then they sent me to  Horace Mann, which is torn down now, which was a junior high then.  And that was a lot better. And they sent me to Webster High School and  I was there for three years and I loved it. I love high school kids. And  there I taught all kinds of P.E. We even had the boys gym classes come  over and we taught them how to dance (Laughs) the Waltz, the Two-  Step and I went to a place just last week and our band played out close  to where I taught at Webster. And there were five ladies there that were  in my class. And they had them stand. Of course, I was only five years  older than them and believe it or not, some of them looked older than I  did. (Laughs)  12  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  I believe it, you are young looking.  So I taught for three years and then I had my first child, Connie you just  met. And then I stayed out for fifteen years and had four children. Then I  started substituting for five years and when my youngest one got in  kindergarten, I went back full time in high school and ended up teaching  thirty years, retired in 1986.  Were there any professors when you were at OSU that really influenced  you with your academics and your studies?  Yes, and there   s one that I couldn   t stand.  Oh really?  Yes, you know what he said to me?  What?  I was having a hard time in humanities because I didn   t read much when  I was growing up, even though I was a good reader. He looked at me and  he said,    You shouldn   t even go to college.    And you know that that just  made me more determined than ever and I just showed that man. I would  never say that to a student. Never.  No, I hope you didn   t have to take him for any more classes.  I didn   t. And yes my physical education teacher was Valerie Colvin. Oh,  everybody loved that woman and I tell you she was still going strong  when she died. She was the best physical education teacher they   ll ever  have over there. She could do anything. Never married, but she knew  how to teach and all the kids loved her. I ended up working for her the  last two years in college. Helping set out the things and going with the  kids that were bowling and lot of things in her office I helped her with.  But she was definitely my best. I really loved her.  Do you have any stories to share about her? Any specific stories or  anything that was just so memorable?  Well, she was so limber that   you know, I never have been one that  could do a lot of acrobatics. It just seems my body wasn   t made for that.  But she could just twist her legs and do anything. Our mouths just flew  open when we watched her. But she had   and I never will forget this     she was the kind of woman that could discipline you and you would  never get mad at her. One day a bunch of us in P.E. were on a float at  Homecoming and I was chewing gum. She just ate me out good for  13  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  chewing gum. And boy, I never did it again. But I didn   t get mad at her.  She   s just that kind.  Did you keep in touch with her after you graduated?  No, but I   d go see her every time I   d go back, yeah I sure did. She   s just  somebody I   ll never forget.  And the Colvin Center is named for her.  Yes, isn   t that wonderful? It should have been. My modern dance  teacher was Miss Lavine who was very different but she knew her  modern dance. And of course, I   d never had a dance lesson in my life  but I loved modern dance because a lot of it you can do what you want  to. And I did have pretty good rhythm, so I did like it.  What kind of clothes did you wear to your classes?  Like I told you I didn   t have many. When it was cold I had a one-piece  suit like I   ve seen some in the Army wear now and several of us had  those. And we would wear those to class. Usually we wore slacks all the  time. Never put on a dress or skirt until we went to church.  Did you go straight from band practice to class in the mornings?  Yes, usually we did because it was for seven to eight and I usually had a  class right after that. Never had a chance to go back and sleep. You  know what? That era most of the girls smoked to be cool. I never did  because I didn   t have the money. (Laughs) And I was sure glad. But the  girls would be playing bridge late at night and I   d be doing something. I  was a night person and I   d end up studying sometimes all night long  because I couldn   t go to bed till all the fun was over. So I   d stay up a lot  of times   that   s where I learned how to drink coffee to stay awake. And  just, especially when I was going to have a test in something, I   d stay up  all night long studying for it instead of doing it early and going to bed  early.  What were some of the other classes that you took? You told me about  humanities and of course you would have taken a lot of P.E. courses.  I had to take French and I had to drop it. I loved it but I did not have any  foreign language in high school, none. I loved it but I just didn   t have  enough background in it. I just couldn   t get it. And also, since then, I   ve  taken several classes of Spanish because I   ve been to so many Spanish-speaking  countries.  14  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  When I was teaching high school, I used to take high school kids  overseas. Every year I   d take them on spring break and in the summer.  I   ve seen almost every country in Europe plus Japan and China and  Jerusalem and Russia and the Scandinavian countries. Oh it was fun. I  say I   ve done more counseling over the ocean than I ever did in school.  Kids loved it and before the oil went out of Tulsa   you know we used to  be the oil capital of the world   parents would send their kids overseas in  a minute because I would tell them, I said,    That   s the best way you can  spend your money because you can give them a car and it will break  down. You can give them jewelry and they   ll lose it. But you   ll never  take a trip overseas and       All of my seniors would make A   s on their  English things because they   d write about what they saw.  That   s wonderful.  So educational.  Let   s go back to when you were at OAMC and do you remember any  significant events or experiences that happened while you were there?  Yes, Bob Fenimore  actually referring to Bob Kurland  came and he  made national history in basketball because he was the tallest one that  had ever played then on a college team and they even had to move the  goals up. They were so easy for him to make. He was wonderful. In fact,  those years that I was there we would win in football, and basketball,  and wrestling   every sport OAMC won in. We were proud to be from  there. We   ve had a few bad years since then (Laughs) but I want to say,  I   m very proud of that coach  OSU Head Football Coach Mike Gundy   the way he did the other day on television. We   re all proud of him. If  more coaches had that kind of nerve, they   d probably get more out of  their team because that not only said something to that boy, that said  something to the whole team. They know now they   ve got a coach who  will always take up for them.  You are talking about Coach Gundy and the     Yes and the boy  referring to OSU football player Bobby Reid .  Yeah, the news interview that he did.  Yes, yes. Everybody watched that. And the writer, she got what she  deserved. Besides that, she writes for the OU paper so she shouldn   t  even have said anything.  I probably could guess that you   ve been to a lot of football games over  the years.  15  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Oh my, yes. And my husband broadcast baseball for the Tulsa Oilers for  twenty-six years. I remember sitting on the roof out there when Connie  was three months old on a pillow. All my kids have gone to ball games.  Sometimes I   d see three because my two boys when they got old  enough, they played. So now I don   t go to many baseball games. I don   t  like them unless they   re really having a fight or something. (Laughs) But  I used to know all of the players. See, that made a difference.  One of the things I wanted to ask you about was the Women   s Athletic  Association. I noticed that you were involved in that and it looked like  there was a large group of women.  A large group. We had a lot of good athletes over there. In fact, the girls  basketball team I was on before I pledged ADPi, and then after I pledged  we were the first ones to play in Iba Arena on the basketball court  because we won all of our games. We had Bob Kurland   s sister on our  team and she was like six foot. (Laughs) Then when I moved into the  ADPi   s we still won a lot but not as many as we did when we had Mary  Ellen on our team.  Did you play other colleges? Did you play games against other  colleges?  No, it hadn   t started yet   playing other colleges. But we played all the  dorms and the sorority houses, is what we did. And oh we were so proud  of that.  Well did a lot of people come and watch your games?  Yeah because it was just beginning to be really popular for girls. And if  you had somebody tall like Mary Ellen and we played fast, then they  like to watch that. Oh we had fun, lots of fun. And then, of course, I was  the president of the WAA and we played softball and golf. We had to do  all of that in our class. And let   s see, bowling, those were the main P.E.  games that we played.  So what position did you play in softball?  Softball   I was first base.  And what was your favorite sport out of everything? Was it swimming     Basketball.  Oh basketball was?  16  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Yeah, because I started it so early and I really knew it and I   in fact,  when I married and moved to Tulsa I still wanted to play basketball and  there was a team here for women but my husband didn   t want me to play  on it. (Laughs) So I didn   t.  So did women play   was it half court?  It was half court, right. And we played all of the half with guards and  forwards.  So were you a guard     Forwards at one end   I was a guard. Oh, and I loved that game. I used  to dream about it. And then swimming was second. But see, that kind of  came later because I taught it so long that I   oh, I taught little kids. I  would even go to private homes here and teach women who really  wanted to learn but who wouldn   t go out in a class.  Well I read in the paper of course, that you won a number of awards  over the years. So I think that I   d like to hear a little bit about some of  the ones that mean the most to you. What is, maybe the one, the top three  that just really mean a lot to you personally?  Well, I   d have to say that when they put me in the Hall of Fame at the  Red Cross, that meant an awful lot to me.  And how many years have you been a volunteer with the Red Cross?  Going on sixty-one now. That   s the longest of anybody in the state   and  I don   t know about nationally but it   s probably close to that. There may  be   the fact is, there might have been somebody that long but they   re  dead now. (Laughter)  What was the last trip that you took for the Red Cross?  My last one was Miami, Oklahoma at the flood. But I went to Katrina  twice, went to Houston, and I went to Lafayette and stayed in that big  dome down there where they play basketball and there were 7,000  people there. We fed that many three meals a day and they did a good  job. And of course, I go in mental health. It   s my job to try to give those  hope that have lost everything and you have to have a license to do that.  I   m a licensed professional counselor and I kept that active ever since I  retired from school. It   s most interesting, it really is. Here again, you  talk to people one-on-one and you learn a lot about them. I   m only  supposed to   I can   t think of the word   when people leave to go to  home, they send them into me  to debrief . They tell me everything.  17  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  What they didn   t like about the job, how long they   d been there and who  they were with and I get some very interesting stories. It   s interesting.  Some men will tell me they   ve fallen in love with somebody they work  with and they say,    I   m going home and I   m married and she says she   s  going to call me.    And oh, it   s just   when you work with somebody a  long time under those conditions, you just learn to like people or hate  them, one or the other. But people are so wonderful. They just tell you  upfront. And I say,    Tell me if there   s anything you don   t like about it or  you want me to say to the upper echelon to make it better.    I say,    The  only way I do that is if you ask me to.    So they do. They tell me what  they think could be improved. I just love my job   it   s very interesting.  And I   ve been from the east coast to the west coast to St. Thomas.  So that   s probably the award that means the very most to you.  Well, that was quite an honor. And then I also won the   oh, the man  that was CEO here for so long. They made an award in his name. But it  was, it   s the most prestigious award you can win in this chapter and I  won that one. I was really surprised because I just made a statement,     They   ll never give that to a woman.    And that very year they gave it to  me.  Let me see if I can find the name of that in here. William Prost?  Yes, William Prost Award, that   s it.  Social citation for exceptional volunteer service. So you were the first  woman to receive that award?  Yes, I was. So I was very happy with that.  Yes.  And I was going to tell you about another one. Well those two national  awards, I want to tell you, the first one was the volunteer   the hero,  Ageless Hero award. Blue Cross Blue Shield started that here. And a lot  of people get that mixed up with the Red Cross. Blue Cross Blue  Shield   and then they made it national, all states did it. I was chosen  nationally to win that one. That   s when they sent me to Chicago and I  got to see the elderly president Bush, Sr. President Bush. That was so  much fun and they were so nice to me, they even sent me the next year.  And I got to see him again with his wife. I got a picture and so   and  then they   d invite me every year to come back to the banquet so that was  a real honor.  18  The other one I want to tell about, I was the national Grandparent of the  Year. How this happened, nobody from here sent my name in. Nobody  from here celebrates grandparents. So I get this call from California and  this lady says,    You   ve been nominated for Grandparent of the Year.     And I said,    You must be mistaken.    She said,    No, and I   ll let you  know in three days.    And so in three days she called back and said,     You have got it.     Well, what she did was read in our paper here about this other award that  I won and it told how many entries   like 1,000 entries were in that. And  she said,    You were chosen.    And I said,    Are you kidding?    She said,     No, ma   am.    So she and her husband came here and asked the Red  Cross if they could have, I don   t know what they call it  press  conference , they invited the television and the radio and they all took  pictures and stuff. And the Red Cross served food and they had my  grandchildren come. You know, it was just such a shock to everybody.  One of my friends said,    Well I   m a good grandmother. I should have  gotten that.    They were giving me a hard time.  But that   s how I got that and so this picture you saw in the paper this  year, I was the only one that knew the history on that and this dear lady  in Kentucky had fifteen kids. Her husband was a coal miner and she just  kept thinking that grandparents should be honored. And kids should  know more what they do and everything. So she goes to President Carter  and gets him to sign a national thing. And that woman that called me  was one of her daughters. They came out here and did everything and  gave me that big picture up there, see, with the thing underneath it? And  I got a letter from   what   s the man? I   ve got it some place. The man  that writes such good books about children and youth. I can   t think of it  right now, that   s what happens when you get old, honey. You can   t  remember half of what you did. But anyway, that was a real, real honor.  My things that I won through the Red Cross have just been wonderful  and then this last thing here in my city. Where   s that thing of the year,  Pinnacle Award. That   s quite an honor to get. And then several years  later they had another award from that. Can   t even think what the name  of that was. And they gave me something too. But it   s a real honor to get  that. I can   t think of the name of it. (Laughs) So anyway, I just have  been very, very fortunate. God gave me the health to do all of this and I  think the reason I have the health was because of my physical education  and swimming.  And this back problem that   s hit me and is very unusual. I started out  with a herniated disk in my lower back and that was in    93. And I asked  the doctor, I said,    I   ve always taken exercise and everything. What   s  wrong?    And he says,    Lady, it   s just from the wear and tear of life.     19  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  And I said,    I   ve given a lot of that.    (Laughs) Then in 2000, I had  another herniated disk that went up a little farther and they put six  screws in the first time, four screws the next time, then I went to a pain  doctor and he put a thing in me the size of a pacemaker that has a thing  that goes to your brain that tells your brain you   re not having pain. Well,  I could only feel it from the knee down, and he cut me open and moved  it up and I can only feel it from here down. And it never did touch my  back. So I said,    Take all the metal out.    So I don   t have any of it in me  anymore. I still have a little pain. I took physical therapy and it helped  me a little but not completely. Then I fell on my back a week ago and  now it   s my tail bone. But I just kept going through it all. I even went on  Red Cross disasters. As long as I   m able, I   ll keep going.  Well when someone mentions OSU, what are your thoughts?  My thoughts are, you   d better not say anything against it. (Laughs) I was  playing bridge the other night with some couples that were strictly OU  and I was just sitting there eating, just waiting. And you know, they  talked about every team and finally somebody mentioned OSU and they  made some silly remark about them. It made me so mad, I could hardly  finish eating. And I bit my tongue not to say anything because I just met  some of those people that night. (Laughs) It was a real good girlfriend of  mine who invited me to play, so I was good. (Laughs) But it   s nothing  but good memories for me. I always have good memories. Mack and I  went back to every game when he was alive. I lost him six years ago. I  sure miss him. I tell all the men,    You men are so important.    And they  just stick their chest out. Most of them will say,    Well you women are  too.    I   m waiting to hear that.  Yes. Well are there any directions you would like to see the university go  in? You mentioned earlier, I think before we started recording, you  expressed some appreciation for some of the donors that the university  has had recently.  Oh, yes. And when you give scholarships, that   s just wonderful because  so many kids can   t afford college. They really can   t now. Young people,  even my daughters don   t even have insurance. It just bothers me because  boy, I have three insurance policies. I couldn   t do with out it. It   s just  getting really bad in the whole state. Young people just can   t afford  insurance. So I think we   re going to have some changes. But I think a lot  of changes are coming. It may be near the end, who knows?  What other activities are you involved in? You   re involved with your  church.  Mm-hmm, a lot. I teach safe driving for AARP. I just taught a class last  20  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Friday. That   s a non-pay job. And I hate the paperwork in it. I don   t like  paperwork at all, after school business. And you, an English teacher, I  know you   ve had it. But I love the people. When I get there they are just  wonderful and so appreciative. Most of them are senior citizens. It says  you   re supposed to be fifty and over but it   s not true. I can take any age  as long as they drive a car. And you get your insurance deducted. So it   s  worth it. And it   s supposed to last from 9 till 5   I usually let them out  about 4:30. And I take goodies to eat in the morning and goodies to eat  in the afternoon because those people get tired. (Laughs)  How often do you teach this class?  Well, I used to teach it every month but this year I   m teaching it in  September and October. This next one is my last one. And then I got  smart and I said,    I   m not going to teach in November or December.  They   re too busy months.    Then I said,    I   m not going to teach in the  summer because I may want to go some place.    So then I taught  September   I start out September and October and I   m not going to  teach in November or December.  One of the things that I want to ask you about are some of the rivalries  that OSU had when you were a student there and some of the traditions.  It   s still the same one and that   s OU. And talk about Bedlam, when we  play them it   s exactly what it is. Of course, when I was playing in the  band, we would always associate with their band members and they  were really nice to us but one thing we did when they came to OSU they  loved to steal the bell out of Old Central if they won the game. And a lot  of times they won the game, but not always. Then when we   d go over to  their school, we   d steal it back. That bell went back and forth, back and  forth. That was the big thing of our time. And the kids, of course, the  kids in the band, they would usually come over and meet us at half time  and maybe they   d give us some pop to drink or something. We really  were nice to each other but stealing that bell was absolutely the biggest  thing and the most fun. I understand the building Old Central still stands  but haven   t they renovated it?  They are in the process of renovating it.  Oh yes.  They are working on the foundation right now. And in another year or  two, they will move the Honors College out there. Right now it   s located  on the fifth floor of the library.  Oh.  21  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  And so that   s going to be the home of the Honors College.  Now what exactly is that? Honors College?  The Honors College is a special group of students that qualify for that  coming out of high school based on the grade point averages. And so  very, very bright academic students who qualify for the Honors College  and they take honors classes each year. And then they can graduate, see,  with honors.  Do they have classes in that building?  No, not right now they don   t. I think right now the building is closed.  They have not had any classes there for awhile. There was a museum  there for a while, higher education museum.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, I love that building. Did you have classes in that building?  No, no we didn   t. No. It was just kind of hands-off. It was just   we  knew that   ll be there forever. It   s just a special building.  And it   s across from the new Alumni Center. I   m sure you   ve been there.  I   ve been there. It   s nice.  They have nice exhibits     Lots of good pictures there.  Well where were your classes when you were in school?  The names of the buildings I   m afraid have changed. Let   s see, I had     I   m trying to think. I had a French class   there were mainly the  buildings in the center. What   s the building called that   s right across the  street from Swim   s? Do they still call it Swim   s?  No, I don   t think     It   s that place right there across the street from  Eskimo  Joe   s. What do  you call it?  We have the Seretean Center and we have     I know where the Seretean Center is. It   s     22  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Morrill Hall?  Morrill Hall, yeah. In the basement of Morrill Hall is where I had my  modern dance terpsichorean and then the building south of that, and I  don   t even know what they call it, it was just right before you get to the  fire station was where we met with Miss Colvin and a lot of the P.E.  classes. And of course the swimming pool is in that old gym there. Do  you remember that building there?  I don   t remember the old gym. They   ve renovated the Colvin Center, I  don   t know if you   ve had a chance to see it.  I haven   t been in it at all. But the old gym was clear over there on the  next street and that   s where the swimming pool was so that   s where I  took swimming. I   m trying to think, seems like in Morrill Hall  someplace I took that humanities class. And then I had to take a history  class and I forget where it was. But mainly they were all in the center of  the campus there, didn   t have to go off of the campus for anything.  Were the instructors strict?  Yes, most of them were. My, like I say, my P.E. teachers were even  strict but they knew how to handle kids better than a lot of teachers. Did  you read in the paper where the girl P.E. major won Teacher of the Year  this year for Oklahoma?  I didn   t see that.  She   s from down south. I think Shawnee is where she teaches. And she  did. I   m so happy for her. Gosh, she gets a new car and lots of things.  That   s wonderful.  That   s nice, yes.  Yeah, uh-huh. And okay, that   s mainly about the classes is where I was.  But I know the one, like the modern dance class I had to walk the  farthest for because it was always clear across from where I lived.  What kind of music did you all listen to and dance to in your modern  dance class?  We had the most wonderful band leader, Jimmy  Baker    he died. Oh,  he   s in yearbook after yearbook, why can I not think of his name? He  was the one that could strut, almost falling over backwards.  That was the director of the band?  23  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  No, he was     Oh he was the student band leader?  Yeah, and oh everybody would just clap when he would start out on the  field. He was so good. And he moved to California and he just died  about two years ago. I cannot think of his name tonight. Jimmy  something. Anyway, we had, I   m trying to think of the bands that were  so good, like Jimmy Dorsey. That was one of our main ones and we  danced the Jitterbug all the time, all the time. Everything with good  rhythm, we would dance. But nearly all of it was with the Jitterbug  music, the rhythm. And I loved to dance. Oh, I just loved it. We had two  people that everybody loved to watch dance. One was called Pee-Wee   Bob Williams . He took care of the football team. He was a little short  man and everybody loved him and could he dance. And Melba Osborne  was the twirler in the band and they danced together. And they got a  good hand every time they danced. They can really dance. But Jimmy  Dorsey and another one of that era, there were several, but we had a  good campus band. We were always tickled when we went to the old  gym to have our dances. And everybody loved to dance.  Did you have dances after the ball games?  No, not planned dances. We would have   before a ball game, we would  have bonfires and all that kind of stuff. But usually after a ball game,  everybody was pooped (Laughs) and they didn   t have a dance. Unless it  was a big one and we won it. That usually would call for some kind of  big celebration.  Oh, okay. Well what was Homecoming like when you were there?  Well it was wonderful. All of us went out to make a float. We   d work  for days on those floats, and all night the night before. And then we   d  decide who was going to ride on it and what the theme was and  everything. So we all looked forward to Homecoming. The boy you just  saw coming down the stairs is my oldest son. I have three of my kids  living with me.  Oh you do?  And I love it, because you know what I told them? I said,    I don   t want  to fall and lie there for a week and stink.    And I did fall the other night  and I was glad they were here.  So you had big floats that you worked on?  24  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Oh, yes and a lot of times we won. We really did. And the kids, you  know, we were all so happy because we all had good themes and  everybody went out for the floats, they really did. Those things take a lot  of work. And, well that   s the main thing on floats.  Now the house decs  decorations  are probably the same amount of  effort goes into those house decs that they do at Walk Around at  Homecoming.  Oh yeah. And we   d also make a house decoration in front, in the yard.  So we worked hard for things like that.  Well you told me that you joined the sorority after you had already been  at OSU. Was that unusual for someone instead of going as a freshman?  Oh, very unusual because you see, when I first went over there, first of  all, I didn   t have the money to join a sorority. I really knew nothing  about them because we didn   t have them in my little, small high school.  And then, of course, I started becoming known a little bit by being in the  different organizations. I started finding out all about them. It was really  kind of a hard decision there at the last because I liked a lot of Pi Phi   s.  But you know what won my heart? I said to the ADPi   s before I joined,     You know, I only have one formal  dress  and my brother bought it for  me.    And they said,    Don   t worry. We   ve got a whole closet full. You  can wear any of them you want to any time.    And I thought,    My gosh,  if they are that good, that really meant a lot to me.    So that helped me  make my final decision. They really made me feel wanted.  Good. Who was your House Mom?  I can   t remember her name. And everybody loved her too. They always  do, and if they don   t they get rid of them. (Laughs)  Did you stay connected with the sorority after you graduated?  Oh definitely. I was the state president for a while. I was the president  here in Tulsa and held every office there ever was. And now we   ve got  at least four tables of bridge that plays once a month and nearly all of us  are from Oklahoma A M. So we have a really good time. Then we have  our normal meetings on Saturday and that   s where more of the younger  girls come in, for the meetings. We have a good group here.  It sounds like it.  Yes we do.  25  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Did you learn to play bridge in college?  Yes, I did. I never knew how before. And now it   s going out of style     the kids just don   t know how. It   s kind of going out of popularity. But it  won   t go out with us. (Laughs)  Who was the band director when you were in band?  Well, Hiram Henry. And he was the sweetest man, he really was. And  then Max Mitchell was before him. I was there with him and I remember  one time, the great   oh, he wrote several band songs. He came to visit  us. Oh, he was well known but I can   t think of his name right now. But  they were very good leaders and Hiram Henry was there for a long time.  In fact, I got to see him last year. We celebrated our hundredth  anniversary with the band last year, because I   ve got a t-shirt. And he  was there.  I think he still lives in Stillwater, doesn   t he?  I bet he does.  I think I heard that. I haven   t met him.  Haven   t met him, okay.  Well you told me that they provided the drums for you. Did they provide  your uniform or did you have to buy that on your own   your skirt and  your blouse?  They didn   t provide anything. I think I had my own skirt and blouse and  that was it.  Did the ladies dress up to go to class?  No, they did not.  Just casual?  Yeah, very casual, very casual. I guess a lot of the boys had gone to war  and if it hadn   t been for the Air Force being there, there wouldn   t have  been many boys around, see. And they lived in barracks so that   s why  we had the fraternity houses to live in. So, no we were very casual.  Well, tell me   there was a picture in one of the yearbooks of you and  Mack.  26  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Yes?  And he was kissing you   looked like it was taken at night. Tell me about  that picture.  Well, we were dating then. (Laughs) We were having something at the  sorority, I don   t know what. And anyway, the guy at that time who was  on the O   Colly   do you still have the O   Colly?  We still have the O   Colly.  Good. And he just happened to be there and I think Mack was getting  ready to kiss me goodnight. And he said,    How about you all standing  over here in front of the window?    That   s when he did it. I think the  window said Merry Christmas, so it must have been at Christmas time.  And do you know what? I   ve had to live that down after I started  teaching school. My high school kids, boy they let me know about that  really fast. Because I was a dean in the high school after I quit teaching  P.E. and I had to walk down the halls and I   d say,    No PDA.    Because  they   d be hugging each other in the halls, you know. And that meant, no  public, it meant no public display of affection. And you know, I caught a  lot of them doing that. So those kids, it didn   t take them long to find  things like that out. And they really gave me a hard time.    Miss Creager,  you used to kiss.    (Laughter) So we dated all that senior year and then  got married after I graduated that summer.  I remember he lost his billfold the day of the wedding   left it in a  restaurant. He wasn   t hardly nervous. And our dear minister let us use  his cottage up in the mountains in Colorado for our honeymoon. Oh, we  thought that was really special. Of course, you had to build a wood fire  to keep warm and that wasn   t much fun for Mack. (Laughter) And I  remember I burned the toast the first morning   I fixed breakfast and I  wasn   t a very good cook. (Laughs) But we made it for fifty-four years.  That is something.  So you know we did have a great marriage, a lot of fun, a lot of  memories. And since I was in the school business and he was in the  radio and TV business, we had entirely different friends. And that was  interesting too. In fact, I had a picture   my son has taken it now   of  him interviewing Mickey Mantle. It was his first interview. He went up  there to his home, up in Joplin and he wasn   t the easiest to interview  because he wasn   t a very good talker. But he didn   t have to be, he was a  wonderful baseball player. (Laughs)  He could sure play baseball.  27  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Yes he could.  Well your husband played in bowl games when he was on the football  team.  Uh-huh, Cotton Bowl and the Sugar Bowl and he wrote for the O   Colly.  It   s the funniest thing. His degree was in   get this   agricultural  journalism. Very few have that degree, but he wanted to be a rancher.  Well, he to Oklahoma A M and he got over there with all those farm  boys from out where I lived, and he found out he didn   t know anything  about a farm or ranch. And he ended up in journalism anyway. His first  job was in Oklahoma City writing for a magazine, interviewing coaches  and then he came right back to Tulsa. He just never did want to leave  Tulsa. And that   s where he really did a lot of interviewing. It was  interesting. He met a lot of interesting people and we had a lot of fun.  How old were you when your family moved for your dad   s job? When  they moved from northwestern Oklahoma.  Okay, I was just starting to high school and I graduated in    42. So go  back four years and I was   I graduated when I was eighteen, I believe.  So you were out in that area during the dust bowl days?  About   oh yes, I was about fifteen. I can remember because my first  school was a country school a mile from home. And a lot of times, we   d  have a dust storm going and they   d have to close school. I   d get home  and dirt would be collecting underneath the doors, just bad you know?  And you couldn   t hardly see a car in front of you, it was so bad, so bad.  It was awful. There   s still a lot of wind out in northwestern Oklahoma  and then there   s so many wheat fields and then it got to where every  year when it came time for Daddy to harvest his wheat, there would  come a hail storm the night before and ruin the whole crop. So he was  just going broke because that   s what they lived on for a whole year. So  that   s when he moved us to eastern Oklahoma and he was a carpenter on  the dam.  The farm land that you lived on when you were younger, was that part of  an allotment, part of the land run?  Yes, it was 150 acres and that   s exactly   that   s what my grandparents  got.  Your grandparents did. Where were they from?  Well I only knew they were from Oklahoma. I don   t know where my  28  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  dad was born. My granddad would leave home and be gone for months  at a time and my grandmother would never know where he was. She had  five boys and my daddy was the youngest. So they didn   t get much  attention from their dad at all. But nearly every one of them were  farmers. And I was glad I lived on the farm when I was a little girl. I  learned a lot, but I never want to go back, never.  Why is that?  Oh, to me, farms look so lonely now. I don   t want to live away from the  city. I want to be where the action is. (Laughs) I can remember one time  my daddy took my brother to the show and I never got to a show, but I  had a girlfriend there that day and he didn   t take me. And it made me so  mad that I ran away from home. I ran into my grandmother   s house. By  the time I got there, she was gone and my daddy drove up. And he said,     Get in this car.    Scared to death, I never did even get to see my  grandmother because she was gone. He took me home. But it made me  mad that he took my brother to the show and left me. He probably didn   t  have the money to take both of us.  Oh, I want to tell you one thing while it   s on my mind. When I went to  college and I didn   t have the money and I wanted to join the sorority  finally. No money. So I called my grandmother and asked her if I could  borrow some money from her. So she called her sister who was an old  maid, lived in Kansas, asked her if she could borrow some money from  her. And so her sister hid money behind pictures in her house. So she  reaches up behind a picture and pulls out  300 and sent it to my  grandmother and my grandmother sent it to me, and that   s how I joined  a sorority. (Laughs)  Oh how nice.  Wasn   t that something?  Oh yes, wow.  I   ll never forget it. You know life has been pretty good to me, pretty  good. I just got back this summer from a mission trip to South  America   Quito, Ecuador. And my Sunday school class in five minutes  took up a collection and had enough to send me and it was over  2,000.  How nice.  So see, I have a lot to be thankful for.  Well what advice would you have for students at OSU now?  29  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Neurohr  Creager  Well I would say to really finish and also to remember what they are  there for and try very hard to graduate because nowadays I   m begging  school kids to finish high school even. Because I have to tell them,    If  you want to just work in a fast food store the rest of your life, that   s  about what it   s going to be. If you don   t at least get a high school  education.    And for kids in college, I   d say,    You know, enjoy it. It   s  one of the happiest times in my life. But remember why you   re there and  do your very, very best and it will pay off in the long run.    I   ve never  wanted for a job, ever.  How would you like to be remembered someday?  That   s a good question. I think one thing would be   I was happy in spite  of my adversities. That I feel very lucky that I was able to have children  because I feel sorry for people now who get old and don   t have a family.  And I just like to be remembered as one who loved life and loved seeing  the world. And thank God that he helped me to see it. (Laughs)  Well you have a wonderful, amazing life that is just rich and full of so  many different experiences, it   s just been a real pleasure to be able to  interview you today.  Well, thank you. You have done a good job. I just didn   t have any idea  they were doing anything like this over there and I   m proud of you.  Well thank you, thank you.  It   s been fun and interesting just to talk to you.  -------  -------
