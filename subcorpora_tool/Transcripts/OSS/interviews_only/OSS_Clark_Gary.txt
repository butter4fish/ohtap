 Finchum Today is April 19, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum and along with me is Dr. Charles Abramson. We are in the board room, I suppose?  Clark Yeah, conference room.  Finchum Conference room of the president of Oklahoma State University to speak with Gary Clark, who is the senior vice president and general counsel. Did I get that right?  Clark That   s right.  Finchum All right, thank you for having us today.  Clark It   s a pleasure to have you.  Finchum Let   s learn a little bit about you, beginning with when and where you were born.  Clark Okay. I was born March 4, 1947, in a little shotgun house on the banks of Cricket Creek in Marion County, Arkansas.  Finchum Cricket Creek?  Clark I claim Flippin, it was the closest town of about four hundred, as my birthplace, I guess. It actually was out in the rural part of the state. I was delivered at home by a doctor who charged, I think it was ten dollars for the delivery. So things have changed a little over the years.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  5  Clark Kind of farming, and a little bit of fishing, and whatnot. That sort of thing. My parents were divorced when I was only a year and a half old. My mom moved out here to Oklahoma at that time and raised me by herself for a while. Then, she remarried when I was in the second grade. We moved to a little town called Morris, in Oklahoma. That   s where I really spent the rest of my grade school and high school years before coming to OSU.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Clark I did. I have a sister and two brothers.  Finchum You   re the oldest?  Clark Yes, my sister is eight years younger, ten and then twelve years younger. I   m quite a bit older. (Laughs)  Finchum Quite a bit.  Clark They didn   t like me as a babysitter too much. Little too strict for them. I don   t think I ever beat them or anything like that, but I was pretty,    You sit in that chair and be quiet     (Laughs) Oh yeah, they probably could talk to you about that quite a bit.  Finchum Where did you go to elementary school?  Clark I guess I started out at a little grade school, Emerson, in Okmulgee, and then went to Franklin in second grade. And then in third grade I went  to  Morris Elementary School.  Finchum And then high school?  Clark High school at Morris High School.  Finchum And graduated in what year?  Clark Graduated in 1965.  Finchum Okay.  Clark You know the book and the movie, Whatever Happened to the Class of 1965? That was, I   m one of them. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  Clark You know, I liked pretty much, I liked school. Probably the class that made the most difference for me was what was then called vocational agriculture, 6  now agricultural education. I liked English. I liked math, so I really did like school.  Finchum Were you in FFA or 4-H?  Clark I was in FFA. I had the good fortune to be elected state FFA reporter, and served in that capacity, which was a great experience for me.  Finchum Favorite teacher?  Clark Well, Mr. Bearden, the ag teacher. I felt like he changed my life in a very significant way, so I decided to be an ag teacher myself. When I came, that   s how I came to OSU, to study agricultural education. Got my bachelor   s degree and taught school for one year in Laverne, Oklahoma. Then I got drafted   I   m just telling you my life story here, if that   s okay?  Finchum That   s okay, you   re doing good.  Clark I got drafted into the Army and spent some time in the Army. It was during the Vietnam era but I was, I guess you might say, one of the lucky people who instead of going to Vietnam, I went to Germany. Other than being in the Army, we had a good time. My wife   I was married by then, and we got to travel throughout Europe while I was there. We did Europe on five dollars a day, literally, and really did enjoy that. My job in the Army was law-related, so I decided I might want to go to law school when I got out and used the GI Bill to do that. But to get out of the Army early, they had a program that you could get out up to six months early if you were going to school or had seasonal employment. So I came back to get my master   s degree in the spring of    72 and summer of    72. I got my master   s degree just before starting law school.  Finchum From here?  Clark From here at OSU, absolutely. Yeah. I thought,    You know, it might not work out. I might as well be prepared to go back.    I really enjoyed teaching the kids in that ag ed class and the FFA deal, but my wife was a city girl. The long nights and going to the show, showing livestock, and spending a lot of time doing those things was a huge   she wasn   t quite ready for that, and especially in a really small town. So, kind of, we jointly decided that    well, this was before I went into the army, that well, maybe it   s time to be thinking about another career. I wasn   t sure what, I didn   t have any idea about law school at that point. It just was my job in the Army that was law related.  Finchum Well, Morris is where? Close to     7  Clark Okmulgee. It   s about seven miles east of Okmulgee.  Finchum When you came to OSU, did you come by yourself? Did your mother bring you and drop you, or what?  Clark (Laughs) No, I had a car that I had paid a hundred and twenty dollars for. There was another fellow from Morris that came to study agricultural education also. We roomed together, as freshmen, a little cottage in the middle of a block. I don   t know, forgot what the address was, but it was about, uh, maybe a little more than half the size of this maybe, but it wasn   t very big. We lived there our freshman year, and then we both pledged a fraternity here on campus. We moved into it and lived there for the rest of our college career.  Finchum Do you want to name the fraternity?  Clark I   m very proud to, Alpha Gamma Rho. It was another wonderful     Finchum Ag related.  Clark    very great experience. The people there really took me under their wings. The difference between my freshman year here   I worked for the football team, by the way. That was a great experience, but other than the guys on the football team, who I didn   t really spend time after practices and all that, it was my friend from Morris and me. He would go home almost every weekend. I   d spend a lot of weekends in the Reading Room or the Browsing Room of the Library, reading books and such. I didn   t have much of a social life. (Laughs) Then, moving into the fraternity that just changed dramatically. You had probably sixty-five people that you knew really well, and that you had somebody, I played a lot basketball and that sort of thing with. Obviously, I didn   t necessarily study as much as I should have. (Laughs) But I   d say it was a great time. Got me active on campus doing things, and that made a big difference for me from a leadership skill development and all.  Finchum You met your wife here on campus?  Clark I did. Another story with that   I don   t know how much film you got here and how much time you want to take, but we first met in a committee meeting of what was then called Campus Chest. It was, it   s what   s now called United Way. Community Chest has become United Way, and they called it Campus Chest for the college campus. The meeting, my recollection is it was about sixty thirty in the morning, six thirty, seven. It was an early morning meeting. I guess I was wearing blue jeans and had an old, rodeo medallion buckle and maybe a white shirt or something. I walked in, and Jane was there. I didn   t particularly even notice her, but she said she 8  looked around the room and said,    Well, there   s nobody in here I   m interested in.    (Laughs) So, I didn   t get off to, I didn   t make the best first impression apparently.  And we actually didn   t date for a while. If you don   t show this to my wife, I   ll tell an embarrassing story. (Laughter) We were both at some party on campus. I don   t remember what it was, but she was with another guy. She just didn   t look like she was having   by then, I knew her from working on this committee. I thought,    Oh goodness  She doesn   t seem to be having fun.    I felt a little sorry for her. There was a girl I wanted to ask to another AGR Christmas party, and she wasn   t available to come. So I thought,    Well, you know, Jane... I   ll just invite her.    So I invited her, and really, I don   t think I ever dated the other girl again. I think we just went on, went on from there. You never know about those things.  Finchum Did you get married before you finished your four years?  Clark No, we married after I got my draft notice. I was in Laverne teaching. When I got my draft notice   we had become engaged, but really we were planning on waiting until the end of the year, after she   d finished. She was a year behind me. We were planning on waiting until she graduated, but when I got my draft notice and I was going to be going into the Army, she said,    Well why don   t we move up the wedding day to January 30?    And so we did that. She came out to Laverne and was there for that four or five months before I   they let me defer my actual entry until the end of the school year, so I could finish up the school year. That   s what we did.  Finchum Was she in a sorority?  Clark Yeah, she was a Tri Delt. In fact, she   s been the president of their alum, or I guess they call it House Corporation for several years now. So she   s stayed pretty involved with them.  Finchum Well, when you got engaged, did they do any kind of traditional recognition of that?  Clark Yeah, they   some of this is more based on her memories than mine, probably. (Laughs) But we didn   t get pinned. Back then you get dropped, pinned   levels of seriousness: dropped, pinned, engaged. So we didn   t get dropped or pinned. They give the announcement,    Okay. Somebody   s been engaged.    She was president of the Tri Delta house at the time. If there   s somebody who   s been engaged, they pass something around. When she takes it there, everybody was shocked and surprised.    You? You   re not even pinned     (Laughs) Anyway, so I think she enjoyed surprising everybody.  Finchum Sure. Do you remember anything about Homecoming during, in your days? 9  Clark Yeah, the AGRs had not, I don   t know, they may have participated in Homecoming in the past. I can   t tell you for sure what year this was, but the first time we participated in Homecoming, and I can   t remember if it was my junior or senior year, but we did what we called    the cow.    We had, we basically   one of our member   s moms was an artist and she would go to fairs around the country and paint dairy cattle, winning dairy cattle. She gave us the plan for a scaled-up cow, and we built it out of wood, just two by fours and chicken wire and all that and sat Pistol Pete under and milking, just like this. (Gestures)  We didn   t win any of the official awards, but we got the people   s choice. We had a lot of people who came by and said,    You guys should have won  You guys should have won.    We took up and we enjoyed that. We had a lot of fun. Really, kind of started logistics, the AGR is now tough to beat in Homecoming, in engineering especially. We got a lot of guys who can weld, and grew up on the farm, and piece things together and make them work. Yeah, that was all a great experience.  Finchum Well, did you have to work your way through college?  Clark I did. Well, I was very fortunate to get scholarships. My parents, like I said, had three kids at home. They really couldn   t help at all, so I worked at a variety of jobs. I worked at the Library part of the time. Different, like I say, just different things along the way. Certainly summer jobs, and instead of spending a great spring break going anywhere, I   d go back home and work and find me some kind of job to do.  Finchum What did you do in the Library?  Clark Basically reshelf books and such. I was in the, kind of the technical area, science and all that. And then also back, I remember, back   some of the first copy machines that actually had paper instead of the old, whatever that fax stuff. Rolls of paper. So I would clean the platen, and put a new roll of paper in, and all that sort of thing. Got pretty good at that before I was through.  Finchum Well, when you graduated, did your parents come out for the ceremony?  Clark Sure.  Finchum And where was it, do you remember?  Clark In my case, it was on Lewis Field, in Lewis Stadium, I guess they called it at that time. We were outside, sitting there, and they just said,    Would the members of the College of Agriculture stand up?    You know,    Sit down, 10  you   re graduated.    So it wasn   t, we didn   t go marching across the stage like they do now.  Finchum When you came back for your master   s, where did you live?  Clark Five and a half South West Street, I remember that. It   s still there, and it looks about the same even forty years or so later. Maybe there was like, I think there were about four apartments in that building. We just stayed in that. Then, we did also, I guess, then moved to the married student housing, the block, like the cinder block deals. That was the nicest place we   d lived since she   d been married. I don   t know if people can say that now, but that   s, she felt like we made a big step up.  Finchum Did you bowl in the bowling alley in the Student Union any?  Clark (Laughs) I did. Yeah, I remember that well and played pool in the basement. Things are a little different now.  Finchum A little. Do you have a favorite spot?  Clark My favorite spot on campus is the balcony there on the west side of the Student Union, overlooking the formal gardens and looking at the Library. It   s just a beautiful place. It   d be called a balcony porch, but that area where that   s rounded, that looks out over the formal gardens. That   s clearly my favorite spot.  Finchum Okay. So once you finish with your master   s, take us through your career until you came back to OSU.  Clark Well, after I finished up my master   s, I went to the University of Texas law school for three years. After my second year there, I clerked for a firm in Tulsa called Connor   Winters, which was at that time, the largest firm in Tulsa. I think they had about twenty-four lawyers. When I finished the summer, they said,    We really like you, but we   re not sure we   ll be making any offers. We   re going to be looking at some other people, interviewing some other people, and we   ll get back to you.    I was like,    Okay. I can   t count on this deal. I better be looking.     I interviewed with Crowe and Dunlevy, I interviewed over the phone. I sent them some stuff, and I got a call and really quite a bit of encouragement from them about a job with in their Oklahoma City office, but I really preferred Tulsa. Then I also did end up getting a job offer from a firm, Doerner Saunders, Stewart, Anderson, and I can   t think of the rest. Connor   Winters had more names too. But I did finally get the offer from Connor   Winters, and since I knew all those people, it was   I mean, I really liked both firms very well, but I ended up going with Connor   Winters. I started 11  the job there at fourteen thousand four hundred a month. Now, starting salaries are probably in the excess of a hundred thousand dollars for associates, so tells you how long it   s been.  I started out as an associate. You kind of do whatever research projects, and drafting projects, and everything that you need to do. As you go along, you get more responsibility. I made partner after six years, which was the, kind of the, standard time. Then, about a year later, there were five of us young whippersnappers that said,    You know, maybe we might like to go out on our own. Take our chances.    Not having really any clients to count on or anything else, really. Because most of the work you did in a large firm, you got partners who bring in the clients, and give work to associates, so I was a little nervous. I even said to my new partners,    Well, look. If it gets bad enough, will it embarrass you if I take a night job welding or something?    (Laughs) They all said    No, that   d be fine.    It never got that bad.  We had our firm. It was a great deal, called Baker, Hoster, McSpadden, Clark, and Rasure, and we built that   the firm kept growing, very successful, and really just a jewel of a group of people: lawyers, associates, all the staff. We had a great office manager, who made sure we hired or, she would often say   if we were hiring someone, primarily probably women, that she   d be interviewing for secretarial positons and that sort of thing. She   d say,    No, she just wasn   t Baker   Hoster material.    She had the highest standards that she insisted upon, and as a consequence, we had just fabulous assistants.  After a period of time   we decided that after sixteen years, I guess I should say, we decided that there wasn   t probably a good future   most of the, we did a lot of the banking work, and most of the banks were merging. They were just getting fewer and fewer, bigger and bigger, and associated with banks out of Oklahoma. We decided,    Well, we need to really be thinking about this because this doesn   t look good for us.    We were approached, had just been coincidentally approached by another firm to merge with them. It was an Oklahoma City-oriented firm that wanted to get a Tulsa office that actually had a few people in it. We thought about it and talked about it and everything. We said,    We think merger makes a great deal of sense, but this particular firm, we don   t really add to them.    We stack on their strengths. We   re not really, it doesn   t give us   there   s not any hybridization or any really additive effect that we think there ought to be.    And it wouldn   t be really that good for them or us.     We started thinking about it and said   well really, Crowe   Dunlevy, which had started an office in Tulsa by then, was really, what seemed to us, to be the perfect match. We were kind of surprised that they hadn   t even, at least, made a pass at us because they knew us fairly well and everything. We dispatched one of our partners to meet with one of their partners for lunch. 12  Basically, this was in December of 1996, I guess. The conversation basically ended up, the guy says,    Gah   we never even thought that you guys would consider us. We would love to have you     By the first of February, we were in their firm, and it happened that quickly. From 1997 until 2004, I was with them. I primarily did business things, estate planning primarily, probate trust work, and that sort of thing. I   ve done oil and gas and other things over the course of my career.  Then in 2004, I was contacted to say,    Would you be interested in the general counsel position at the Oklahoma State University Foundation?    I said,    Well yeah, I would be actually.    Because I, by then, I haven   t even mentioned this, I guess. But in 1993, I was appointed to the Board of Regents. I really had kind of reconnected to OSU and felt like that this was something I was passionate about, I guess. Eventually in June, I started June 1 of 2004, at the OSU Foundation as the vice president general counsel. Did that for several years until my current jewel, the president said    Well, Burns Hargis is going to call you to ask if you will come over and work with him.    He was selected to be president of OSU in December, and he couldn   t start until the legislature made a, changed the law to allow him to come early.  It was a law. The law was that you had to be at least a year out of being a regent. He had resigned from the board, I think, in July of 2007, yeah. Anyway, he asked if I would. Burns called and said,    Would you consider that?    I said,    Well, let me talk to you about it.    I know in my own mind, I was actually thinking,    Well, I don   t see myself as being a bureaucrat.    I   m really,    I enjoy what I   m doing.    I mean, I really like my job and the people there at the foundation, what they were doing and all. So I said I   d meet with Burns, but actually, I think at the time I was thinking,    I   m going to probably say    well gee, this is nice,    but   .       Part of it, I had seen how President Schmidly had used General Goodbary. It was primarily that he was just always with him, and carrying his briefcase, and driving him and all that. I just didn   t feel like I could be additive by doing that. I just   there   s a lot of people can do that job.  But Burns, we talked two times, for probably two and half hours a piece. And by the end of that time, I was as excited about what I thought he was going to do at OSU. And that he thought I could help him. And how, he at least expressed to me was he needed to be out on the road and raising money. Being out, he needed somebody here to help keep things moving and that he could assign jobs,    Here, do this or do that,    and get it done. In effect, be, be separate and so    Like I say, by then, I was absolutely ready to say yes. Actually, if anything, it   s been better than I would have expected.  Finchum Had your all   s paths crossed before then?  13  Clark You know, just very little. I knew of him for probably two reasons. Two of my, well actually three of my partners were very active in, when the Penn Square Bank failure occurred in 1982. We had three lawyers who spent most of the time in Oklahoma City working on different problems there. Burns was also in, very heavily involved representing the complainants and Feds, I guess. Anyway, basically closing banks and dealing with problems of banks. And they talked about him, and what a good lawyer he was, and that sort of thing. Then, of course, he had the program on TV, Flashpoint, that I watched. Every day as I   d drive to work, well, not every day, but I think it was on Thursdays, there was a segment with Turpin and Hargis and their banter back and forth.  I felt like in a way I knew him, but he didn   t really know me, personally. I think really, probably one of the things that may have led him to call me was my involvement with the acquisition of the properties in the Athletic Village area. I did all the negotiations to acquire those properties. I think he felt like,    Okay, here   s somebody who can   .    Well, for one, there were a lot of problems, initially. When we had a firm, an easement firm, and they were just running rough shot over people and it was not going well. So we took them out of the equation, and I took over. Then, things calmed down and we got it done. I think he thought,    Okay, well, here   s someone who can be diplomatic and be a problem solver.    That   s just my interpretation. I don   t know what his interpretation is. That   s mine.  Finchum Sounds reasonable.  Clark Yeah. Well, it makes me feel good anyway. (Laughs)  Finchum I was trying to think   he was on campus the same time, or roughly the same time, you were as an undergrad.  Clark Yes, almost, but he was a little bit ahead of me.  Finchum But you didn   t know each other then?  Clark No, we didn   t know each other then. I   ve thought about it. I thought   well I don   t know if we ever   obviously, AGR   s and Sigma Nu   s houses are right by one another. I probably might have seen him around campus and such, but I really don   t remember that. We may have been in Blue Key together. I just don   t   honestly, he doesn   t have any recollection of me either, so I don   t feel too bad.  Finchum Well, at that time, the campus didn   t have Phi Beta Kappa, when you were here.  Clark That   s right. No. No, it didn   t. 14  Finchum Do you recall when you first got involved with that initiative?  Clark With Phi Beta Kappa?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Clark Yes. I was telling Burns   when we first came to campus that was one of his goals was to make the effort to get a Phi Beta Kappa chapter on campus. Efforts had been unsuccessful in the past. He may have mentioned him when you interviewed him, but we even had a professor who would apparently write and say,    OSU doesn   t deserve a chapter,    which is hard to imagine. For me, I don   t know why I would be teaching at a university that wasn   t good enough to have a Phi Beta Kappa chapter. We both knew better. We had some tremendous students who, in my opinion, were robbed of the opportunity to be in Phi Beta Kappa. And even though I was an ag major, and I wasn   t eligible or anything for Phi Beta Kappa, but I had a very high opinion of Phi Beta Kappa and still do. It   s a tremendous organization. I   m just tickled to death that we finally got what I think OSU deserved and what these students deserved.  Finchum Well, how early on had you been aware that that even existed, the society itself, Phi Beta Kappa? I mean, you wouldn   t have known about it probably when you were here as an undergrad.  Clark No. Well, I think I did. You   d, you know, see movies talk about Phi Beta Kappa and that sort of thing. I realized that was   and it   s a very significant accomplishment to be selected for Phi Beta Kappa.  Finchum What was your role in particular?  Clark Well, I acted somewhat as an intermediary, I guess, of sorts in trying to help facilitate making the progress. Obviously we had a number of people who were involved in different ways. Perry Gethner was involved in getting the application and all that, huge effort. Charles  Abramson  played a role there and Bob Graalman. There were a number of people who were engaged in trying to tell OSU   s story in a way that is meaningful, and I think that did a good job. Of course, we had a group of, a committee that came then and visited OSU.  That   s really when I was probably most involved was trying to help work with, with helping to get some of the arrangements made through   especially my assistant, Melissa Meredith, who did really the leg work. I tried to help make sure that we were getting all those things done and getting some of the things printed. Make sure we had all the arrangements in a way that put us in our best light, I guess. We wanted to be successful. You don   t 15  get a chance very often. We were one of three, I think, in the year we were, and I think they say that roughly about a third of those who apply are accepted. We felt like we   d been denied long enough, and that it   s time to be successful.  Finchum I think President Hargis had mentioned that the air conditioning was out in the hotel.  Clark It was  (Laughs) I was calling over there to say,    We   ve got to do something     They managed to get window units for those, I think, those five rooms. (Laughs) We were willing to pull out all the stops. It was a real tense moment there for a bit.  Finchum If they had been turned down this time, do you think we would have gone again?  Clark Oh, I   m sure. Well, I don   t think, I remember now what they say about, you have to wait a while before you get another opportunity. I think really, I don   t know. It probably goes back thirty years that OSU had been applying. It was quite a lengthy time, but I   m an optimist at heart and persistent too, and that I think we had a good story. We deserved, I mean, we should have had a chapter a long time before. We just hadn   t done a good job of telling our story, in my opinion. When we told the story, we were, the visiting committee was very complimentary of OSU. It wasn   t like,    Well, you guys barely scraped by.    They were very complimentary of OSU, and the visit, and everything else. They didn   t tell us what the   it has to be voted on at the National Triennial, so they can   t tell you that you   re in, but they were beaming from ear to ear when they left. We, that certainly sent a good message.  Finchum That was the first time that they made it that far too, wasn   t it?  Clark It was. It was, like I said, it was all the marbles on the line. We wanted to make sure we managed to bring it home.  Finchum Were you in Florida when they met to decide?  Clark No, I didn   t go down. Bob Graalman was there I know, along with Perry, and certainly the president was there. That was a big moment. Like I say, generally speaking, with the president on the road, I try to be around here so that if something comes up, I can be here. If know in my mind, this is what Burns would do or what he   d want to do, I can have the authority to say,    Let   s do this.    But if it   s something I   m not real sure of, then I try to condense the information,    Here   s what you need to know, and what do you want to do?    So I can, with a phone call, we can get there.  16  Finchum Well, who called and told you the news?  Clark I think it was Burns actually that sent an email that, kind of letting us know that it was good news. Like I say, it wasn   t a surprise, really. I mean, I expected us to be successful, but it was nice to know. (Laughs) There was some whooping and hollering I   m sure.  Finchum Did you do your happy dance?  Clark Yeah  If I could dance, I probably would have right then. (Laughs) I did the equivalent, anyway. That was a big moment. We   re, at least from my   like I said, it was something we owed the students of OSU. I regret we can   t do anything about the students who   ve come before, and should have been in Phi Beta Kappa, and didn   t get that opportunity. Like I say, I think they were robbed of something that they shouldn   t have been. But at least now, we have it. Now, what we try to make sure is that every   because we don   t have that history of Phi Beta Kappa here on campus, a lot of students don   t understand what its significance is, like we did. Right now, we   re in the midst of working to help recruit students who   ve been selected for membership, to make sure they don   t pass up the opportunity. We   re at, I think we have twenty-six out of thirty-three who have registered. We   ve got seven more that we want to get signed up.  Finchum Between now and when? The end     Clark Between now and the twenty-second is when they get in the program. But we got some of   their advisers are working. We had one student who   s in China. We had to kind of get an email across. Actually, when I say twenty-six, that was actually as of last Friday, so I   m sure we   re above that now.  Finchum Is that about average, twenty-five to thirty?  Abramson I think it   s the largest class we   ve had.  Clark Yeah. Last year, we didn   t have a very good turnout. I said,    Okay, well I   m, we   re going to get after them.    Kind of make sure   one of the things that we   ve done differently this year is that the chapter is paying their initiation fee. There are no annual dues. So if we say,    Look, there   s no downside to this. I mean, you may not have ever heard of Phi Beta Kappa, but I promise you a lot of people out there who you   re going to be talking to, interviewing at my age, know very well what Phi Beta Kappa means. So this is something that is meaningful.    They get inundated with a lot of other offers to join this fraternity or that sorority or whatever, that don   t really mean anything, so they tend to lump them all together.  17  What we   re trying to do is get people   the president hosted a reception at his house to invite all of them to come, to talk about how important it was. I quizzed every one of them, and every one of those guys was already registered. We were already good on those. We were just, like I say, we   re trying to finish up and make sure so that   I think with a little bit of time, people are going to understand that this like Mortar Board, Blue Key, or this is something,    Wow  If you get there, that   s an accomplishment      Finchum It   s like the third year, maybe?  Clark Third year. Yeah, this is our third class. We did have   now, and again this is because one of our regent   s daughter came, attended OSU. I kind of encouraged her to go in the honors program. Every time he talked to me, he   d say,    Oh that was the greatest thing, Gary  I just really can   t thank you enough for getting her involved. She just flowered in that program.    We got the news that we   d gotten a Phi Beta Kappa chapter. We didn   t get, we were installed in February of    13, and she was going to graduate in December. She decided not to graduate so she could stay and be part of the first class of Phi Beta Kappa. Isn   t that interesting? I mean that was how   her dad was from Duke University and knew very well what Phi Beta Kappa was. She was already primed and ready and actually changed her plans so that she could be a Phi Beta Kappa.  Finchum So maybe it   s the parents that need to be educated about Phi Beta Kappa.  Clark Well, it is. The problem is that I think a lot of these kids, they get this information here at school, and their parents never know about that. It   s tempting to write a letter to the parents that says,    You need to call your child and tell them to sign up     (Laughs) Like I said, what we want to do is get the reputation established so that everybody on campus understands how significant this is. I think we   re making good headway on that.  Finchum Did they make you an honorary member?  Clark They did, what they call a foundation member. I don   t really know too many ag majors that are    but there were six. When a new chapter is installed, up to six people can be named as foundation members. I was thrilled to be included among those. President Hargis was. We have Dean Stringer, who was on the Board of Regents and been wanting a Phi Beta Kappa Chapter here for fifty plus years. He would have been a member. He went to Harvard Law School, very bright guy. We had the associate dean for Arts and Sciences. And Trish Houston, who donated some money to create an English scholarship that, or professorship that was helpful in our application, show an interest in the humanities and all. It was a great group of people. Like I say, I was flattered. Probably, like I say, don   t necessarily deserve it, 18  but I was very pleased. And the certificate and the key are hanging in my office right now.  Finchum That was going to be my next question.  Clark Absolutely. I   d say I   m very proud of it even though I didn   t earn it the usual way. I am very proud to have the opportunity.  Finchum Well, did you have a foreign language in your undergrad?  Clark No, I didn   t. I had a foreign language, French, in high school. It wasn   t a requirement in ag, as you might expect. We had to talk barnyard, I guess, but not any of the accepted languages. (Laughs) I graduated in the top percentages of the class here and all. Academically, I would have been qualified. I didn   t have the arts and sciences. It was kind of funny. I had a humanities professor back then. I was just thinking about him a few days ago, and wondering where he is now and what he is doing. He kept saying,    You are an ag major?    because I really enjoyed reading, as I mentioned earlier.  We were lucky   he, at that time, they were doing selected readings from about fifteen books over a semester for that introductory humanities class. In our case, he says,    Well, instead of doing that, if you guys agree, I   d rather just read Dostoyevsky   s Crime and Punishment. We do the whole class on that one book.    And I, it was a fascinating book, I thought. Really getting into that psychology of it all, and kind of a detective story, and how a person   s guilt can enter into it. I remember it still very well.  Finchum Do you have children?  Clark I do. I got two children.  Finchum Did they come to OSU?  Clark Well, one did and one went to the University of Texas and stayed in Austin. He   s been there. One came to OSU and is now an intensive care nurse in Tulsa.  Finchum They   re not necessarily in a program where they can get in Phi Beta Kappa?  Clark No. My son was, he   d actually, I guess, he would have been an arts and letters type of graduate. He was a geography, but it was really for city planning type things. He works for the City of Austin now. Yeah, so they were, like I say, my daughter was a biological sciences major here at OSU. So could   ve been, I guess. I don   t know that she had the language 19  requirement. I don   t remember that. It was kind of fun. I   d ask her,    How are you doing in your class?       Well, we haven   t gotten any grades back on tests.    I   d say,    Well, you know, it   s past Thanksgiving. You   d think you would have some back.       No. No, we don   t have any.       Okay, yeah sure.    (Laughs) She didn   t share much information, I guess, is the best way to put it.  Finchum That happens a lot, I think.  Clark Yeah. I think so, nowadays. They like to be independent.  Finchum Did you participate in the first, the induction ceremony?  Clark Yes.  Finchum That they had in Old Central?  Clark Yes. That was very nicely done. It was nice to have the national leadership here. John Churchill was here, a very nice gentleman. I guess he   s just now retiring from the, forgot what the position is called, but it   s like general secretary or something. It   s kind of an unusual title. He   s been, it seems, like a very fabulous personality, very warm and dignified also.  Finchum Well going forward, where do you see this going, Phi Beta Kappa?  Clark Like I say, my hope and goal is that we get it to a point that people are clamoring to get in. When they   re told,    You   ve been selected,    that they are tickled pink and signing up immediately. I think we   ll get there. It may not be within a year or two, but I think as word trickles out   one of the problems that we have is that they   re are seniors, mostly. There are juniors that do get invited on occasion, but there the qualifications are higher than they are for a senior. When your seniors get notified, and then they leave the campus immediately, there   s really not much of a residual of a people here to talk about it.  Finchum True.  Clark We have to find a way, through the advisers and others, to really stoke up the understanding of what Phi Beta Kappa is. We are only three, we are still in our infancy. I feel confident that we   ll get there.  Finchum Mostly males or is there a mix of females and males?  Clark Oh my gosh, yeah  I   d say, at least half females, I would think. It   s interesting to me that at the president   s reception, there were five math students and of those, two or three were women. It wasn   t, but I was just 20  surprised   like I say, so many in one area. Several of them were   one was like math and political science. (Laughs) How did that happen? Several double majors and all. Really, a really good group of people. They were very comfortable talking. They were just nice, young people.  Finchum Well, the reason I ask: the application process has been mostly males working toward pushing it forward. I mean, there   s been a few females, but mostly     Clark Yeah, we had     Finchum Mostly males.  Clark Yeah, that   s true. As far as the selection, there are a group of people that are eligible, and it   s based strictly on objective criteria. Like I say, I hadn   t really stopped to count, but I would think that it   s probably roughly fifty-fifty, if I were guessing just from looking at it. Like some areas, vet med, we got something like 80-some percent are women now. You really can   t tell anymore what people are going to be, and again, what their interests are. Yeah, I don   t see that as being really an issue at all.  Finchum Did they show you the secret handshake?  Clark They probably did. I don   t remember it.  Abramson It   s actually on the website. (Laughter)  Finchum It   s not so secret, huh?  Abramson It   s not the one that I was taught at Boston University.  Clark Is that right?  Abramson I give the speech at the commencement ceremonies, but I won   t this year. I won   t be here. In that speech, it actually is mentioned: the secret handshake. But it   s not the secret handshake that I learned at Boston University.  Clark So it   s changed.  Abramson It   s changed, yeah. Maybe we should have our own secret handshake. (Laughter)  Clark Yeah, that   s right. Add some extra things in it, or something. Well, I haven   t had to give the secret handshake, so I guess I   m okay so far.  Finchum Anything you want to ask? 21  Abramson I just wanted to comment that I think it   s rare that upper administration is really helping in this effort. I don   t if you   d see that in most colleges and universities, so I want to personally thank you, because I believe you made phone calls.  Clark Oh yeah. I   ve written emails, and phone calls, I even ran one guy down who was at the Arts and Sciences banquet the other night. One of the students who hadn   t signed up yet was being honored, had been honored. I saw him, and I   d tried to call him unsuccessfully. I went over to his table and caught him and said,    Hey  I   ve been trying to get ahold of you. We need to get you signed up.    He did sign up before the next morning. He sent me an email. Actually, I sent him   I said,    Just in case you can   t find the other emails, I   ll send you one.    Then, he called the next morning, not called but responded by email saying that he had registered.  Like I say, we   ll track them down wherever we can. Like I say, right now, I   m working through Amy Martindale who, I guess she sort of supervises the advisers in the Arts and Sciences. I enlisted her help to get the advisers for each of the seven people who hadn   t signed up, well, actually six. I had talked to   I knew Lisa Mantini in Math. I called her about the student   that   s the one who   s in   the reason we hadn   t gotten ahold of him was he was in China. She said,    But I   ll get in touch with him, and I   ll make sure he gets signed up.    And so there are six others. Amy was getting in touch with all those advisers so they could call, contact them and say,    This is for real. You need to sign up      Finchum Personal touch.  Clark Yeah. We   re going, we   ll track them down.  Finchum Is there a minimum that you have to have in order to keep the chapter?  Clark I don   t think that   s true. I gather from the   I can   t remember now. Perry, Perry Gethner, who   s the president of our chapter, says that nationally there   s not a hundred percent acceptance and that   s not unusual. He didn   t talk about what the percentage is. Again, I think it   s a   people don   t have the same values, don   t value the same as my generation. That   s probably part of it.  Finchum Well, is it just one semester a year? Do you look at those who graduated in the summer or in the fall or is it just the ones that are graduating in  the spring ?  Clark Yeah. Well, I guess if they   re a senior   so if they   re going to be graduating, say next December, they could be considered this time I think. The 22  eligibility criteria, I think, they run that by computer. Say,    Give us all the people who fit these criteria.    Those, I think, would be and then, I   d say even there are a handful of juniors. One of the guys who was selected again this year as a senior, was selected last year as a junior and didn   t accept. (Laughs) He was apologetic because he was at this reception the other night. I thought,    Oh, well.    Anyway, so that was kind of interesting. We at least got him on the second pass.  Finchum At least he had a second try.  Clark Yeah, he did. Not very many juniors are eligible though     Abramson I believe we have that rule that if you declined, you can still accept later, so that can help also.  Clark Yeah.  Finchum So somewhere you all keep a running list of those who have been asked?  Clark Well, it   s one of those things like I say, it   s   they   ve earned it. You want to see them get it. It   s not all about,    Okay. We   re so exclusive that we   you have thirty minutes to decide,    or something. (Laughs)  Finchum A couple more years, maybe you won   t have to     Clark That   s right.  Finchum    do that.  Clark That   s certainly the hope is that we get to a point, that students are at least saying,    What does it take to be Phi Beta Kappa? What can I do to earn that?     Finchum Well, when you were back at Morris, did you ever think that you would be sitting here, doing this?  Clark No, not really. I thought I would be an ag teacher somewhere so   .  Finchum Driving a tractor on the weekends?  Clark Probably, yup. Yup, it certainly would   ve been fine with me. As I said, my ag teacher changed my life and changed the lives of a number of other people. There   s no amount of money that can take place of that. I will never be able to fully express how strongly I feel about my ag teacher. He was terrific. He took us all over the countryside. Did everything he could to help us be successful. That was, like I say, I thought    Gee, he didn   t do for just 23  one person,    and I don   t know that I did. I had some good students. One of guys when I did my student teaching is now in charge of the FFA program for the state. Another one was an ag teacher here in Stillwater for a number of years, Billy Foote. Bryan Ashbaugh, another student, was an ag teacher. You never know, I guess, where you figure into all the equation.  Finchum You left an impression with at least a few then   Clark Well, yeah, that or somebody else. (Laughs) Who knows   Finchum You have been a cowboy for a long time   Clark I have been  I will always be a Cowboy. I grew up a Sooner fan because of my stepfather, but when I came to OSU, it was, I went a hundred and eighty degrees. Fortunately, the two years that I worked for the football team, we beat OU. The first time, I just got an index card and I did it in as big of letters as I could, wrote seventeen dash sixteen and sent it to him. (Laughs) The next year we beat them again. It was fifteen to fourteen, and so I sent that to him. Unfortunately, the next year was like forty-two to seven or something, and I got one. (Laughs) That was a little awkward, but yeah.  Since the moment I came to OSU, actually, probably before. Because I listened in 1965   the    64/   65 basketball season, OSU won the Big Eight championship, regular season. I don   t think they had a tournament back then. I would listen to their, after I   d kind of decided to come to OSU, I   d listen to their games and follow them on the radio. That was probably, I guess, that   s when I   was probably my first time of being an OSU fan anyway.  Finchum Did you go to games when you got here?  Clark I did.  Finchum Football and basketball?  Clark Pretty much everything, even wrestling, yeah. In fact, I   d never   I didn   t know what college-style wrestling was until coming to OSU. I don   t know, you   re too young to remember Gorgeous George. Charles may remember him. Anyway, he was a professional wrestler. All that fake stuff, and so I wasn   t really all that interested in wrestling but     Abramson Gorgeous George?  Clark Yeah   Abramson He was Gorgeous George. He   d be very flamboyant in his costumes. 24  Clark Oh yeah. Very Flamboyant   Abramson Got the cape   (Laughter)  Clark Yeah, you   d have to, you   d have to see it to believe it. Anyway, wrestling. I don   t know, I guess, I didn   t really see track, or tennis, or some of those things, or golf. Those sports and baseball, and so those four sports and I     Finchum Then you were on the intramural teams for your     Clark Oh yeah  That was always fun   Finchum Basketball?  Clark Like I say, it   s a little embarrassing to admit, but I   d probably spend on Saturdays, probably eight hours a Saturday playing basketball. (Laughs) Most Saturdays     Finchum And your homework was done by then.  Clark (Laughs) Yeah. Like I say, I was a good student, and so I didn   t have to work at it really too hard. I played a lot of basketball. I was president of the TV club. Those were things that my fraternity brothers still kid me about.  Finchum Were you in ROTC?  Clark No, I was   . When I became, when I was here as a freshman, that was the first year that ROTC was not required of freshman men. I was, in my mind at least, I didn   t see the military as a career, and     Finchum Was PE (physical education) required?  Clark PE was required, but as a football   the practice time counted as PE for me. I got an A for one hour of PE for that. (Laughs) Yeah, if you didn   t take ROTC, you had to take PE.  Finchum Swimming and such?  Clark Yeah, swimming, bowling, they had a number of different things. Archery, I did that. Then I did a wrestling class. I can   t remember now, but I think maybe only your first two years or something that you had to do it. Anyway, I was able to get through the PE stuff okay.  Finchum Do you have a favorite memory from that time period?  25  Clark Well, let   s see.  Finchum Besides meeting your wife.  Clark I was going to say, that   s always got to go first. See that first time we met, I didn   t even see her. I didn   t notice her. I guess, from our first date. I guess, really the experience in the fraternity. It   s hard to pick one thing out, it   s really more of the complex web of it all. The friends, I have friends that I had, that I do things with today. We had one of the guys in my class for dinner at the Chef Series last week. It   s just like seeing somebody five minutes ago. It   s all just so close. There   s guys I go to the NCAA wrestling tournament with from back then. We   re, you really do connect for life. That   s all very positive.  You just, picking one moment, I guess it   d probably be, one little short period of time was when we did a goal line stand against OU here in 1966,    67. In 1967, let me think about that   yeah, no. It would   ve been 1966. In the fall of    66 we beat OU fifteen to fourteen, and we had a four-play goal line stand to keep them from scoring. They were on the goal line. It was like, just, what? One or two yards, and four times in a row we stopped their running back and won the game. I was down there because I worked for the team. And I could go, and I went all the way down to the goal line, and was standing there, cheering and everything. Jumping up and down and all that. Yeah, that was a pretty exciting moment.  Finchum You remembered that pretty clearly?  Clark I do, I do. Very clearly. Yeah, so in terms of just a single memory, that might be it. It would probably, like I say, but the whole experience was probably   the best memory, I guess I had, was just having such good friends and people who supported you, that you could have fun with, that you respect and admire. All of those things.  Finchum All of those things came in handy for the application too?  Clark Right   Finchum Bringing it back around to Phi Beta Kappa.  Abramson Do you think you happen to have the email from President Hargis?  Clark On?  Abramson When you found out that we were approved as a chapter?  26  Clark I may not have it, but let me look and see. I think it, I think that   s, I think it was an email, I won   t swear to that, but let me   there was an email, and I think it was from him. Let me look back and see. About when that was, it was in August of 2012, wasn   t it?  Abramson I think so.  Clark Yeah, so. I might have things that far back.  Finchum The historian is asking.  Clark I understand. Let me look and see. I   ll check, Charles.  Finchum Anything else?  Abramson I think that   s it. Thank you very much.  Clark I   ve kind of talked your guys    ears off, I   m sorry.  Finchum No, you   ve been great  Thank you.  Clark Well, it   s kind of nice to go tripping down memory lane. (Laughs)  Finchum Sure, and go pokes   Clark Go pokes is right   -------  -------
