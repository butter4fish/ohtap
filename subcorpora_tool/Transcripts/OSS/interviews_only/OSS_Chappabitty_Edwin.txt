 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Saturday, November 7,  2015. I   m interviewing Edwin Chappabitty, Dr. Chappabitty, the 2015 OSU  Honored Alumnus for the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. Dr. Chappabitty, you   re a Comanche and Fort  Sill Apache. You graduated from OSU with a BS in Zoology, served in  Vietnam, and went on to this amazing medical career, some of it with Indian  Health Service, some as the first Medical Director of Comanche Nation. You  were the OSU Distinguished Alumnus in 2008 and you were inducted into  the OSU College of Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame this year. I look forward  to hearing more about your experiences at OSU, some of the highlights of  your career as a Native physician and touching base with you about how  you stayed involved with OSU over the years. Where were you born and  where did you grow up?  Chappabitty I was born in the Kiowa Indian Hospital in Lawton, Oklahoma. I grew up in  Apache, Oklahoma, a little town in southern Grady County. Lived in  Medicine Park  Oklahoma  for a few years and lived north of Indiahoma   Oklahoma  until we moved into Lawton when I was going into grade  school. I enjoyed school. People said,    What did you like about it?    I said,     We got to eat.    School was easy. It was easy to learn how read and write,  to do arithmetic. To spell twenty-five words, to diagram sentences. It was  easy. By the ninth grade at Thomason Junior High, I was elected most  intelligent in my class by my classmates, so I guess I was doing something  right.  Little Thunder That was a sign. What did your mother and father do for a living?  Chappabitty My dad worked at Fort Sill, and my mother was a housewife. We had five  children. Certainly were humble people, but they pushed education. They  pushed work, hard work, and things like that.  Little Thunder Were you the youngest?  5  Chappabitty I was the second of the five. My older brother was a year-and-half older than  me. We all excelled in school. My older brother is passed on now, but he  was an anthropologist. My younger two sisters, one lives here in Stillwater.  If she ever does her dissertation, she   ll have a PhD because she has a   bachelor   s  degree and a master   s degree from OSU. My other sister is a  master   s candidate. She   s retired from the Bureau of Indian Affairs  BIA  as  a teacher in the BIA. My younger brother, who is an OSU graduate, he   s  sixty-six, I guess, tomorrow. Next week. But he   s a lawyer. We were, I  guess, pushed into education by our family. Both my parents really told us  to do well, to achieve, and all that.  Little Thunder Did you have a relationship with your grandparents on either side?  Chappabitty Oh yeah. Yeah, both sides. My Comanche grandparents lived by Indiahoma  on Indian Trust Land. That was later a part of Fort Sill. That was why we  had to move into Lawton because Fort Sill, in the mid    50s, bought that land  and moved Fort Sill out to Indiahoma. My other grandmother was a Fort Sill  Apache woman who was with Geronimo   s captive group of Chiricahuas.  She was born to that group at Fort Sill. She was a few days old and she was  already an official prisoner of war of the United States. She grew up there  and married a local. Is buried out there at Fort Sill in Geronimo   s Cemetery.  So, from both sides, competitive people, aggressive people     Little Thunder Was there one cultural influence? Do you think the Comanche was more  dominant than the Fort Sill  Apache ?  Chappabitty I would say so because the Comanches are aggressive and competitive. They  make good soldiers. They make good workers. It   s an individualistic  society, but competitive. Good sportsmen. I would say, too, really good  soldiers.  Little Thunder How about growing up around the language?  Chappabitty We spoke English because my mother was Apache and my dad was  Comanche. Except for my grandparents. My grandmother never spoke  English until late, late in life. She refused to speak English, so we talked to  her in Comanche. When we got into school, everything was in English.  Nobody spoke anything, any Indian language. But my parents took us to  powwows every weekend and we grew up with the culture. We knew who  we were, certainly.  Little Thunder As a child, you   re excelling in school. Do you find you   re particularly  interested in science, or is it     6  Chappabitty I was interested in science. It came easy to me. It came easy. I mean, math,  and all that came easy. It interested me a great deal. I enjoyed sciences. We  subscribed to National Geographic and my mother had Book-of-the-Month  club. I was reading Darwin and stuff like that when I was in grade school  because I found it interesting. You could get a book on that and then just  read it. Sit there for hours and read. We were humble people. We didn   t  have a nice house. We didn   t have all this stuff. It was a different time, too.  The economy was not good, but our parents pushed education.    Do well in  school. Don   t create problems. Do your homework.    I think that was really  what made the difference to all of us.  Little Thunder Was there any other experience you had that kind of pointed to the path you  would take in medicine?  Chappabitty In my senior year, I was called out of chemistry class to the principal   s  office. I thought    What did I do this time?    I went down to the principal   s  office, and he was standing down there and he looked like the Cheshire cat.  He had a grin from ear to ear. I thought,    What is going on?    He said,    Ed,  this is Mr. Irigill Cutler, the Director of Admission and Scholarship of  Harvard College, and he has come here to see you.    I spent the next hour  talking to this gentleman. He was wearing a tweed coat that had the leather  elbow reinforcing. I thought,    Gosh, this guy   s from Harvard and he   s got  this beat up old coat on.    (Laughter) Anyway, it was kind of funny. It went  well. He asked questions. I answered them. I asked him questions and he  answered. We had a good meeting.  Several weeks later, I received a certified letter which my mother still has  that admitted me with a full academic scholarship to Harvard College. They  were watching me. It was easy, as I said, to perform and do well. My family  with five kids and my dad making a 125 bucks a month. My family could  not afford the clothing, the spending money, or even a bus ticket to get me  to Cambridge. And I didn   t go. I was disappointed, but I understood there  were four other kids that needed as much. My mother still has the letter.  People ask me, they said,    Well, where did you go to school?    I said,    I  went to UCLA. They said,    Oh, you went to college in California?    I said,     No, no, not that UCLA. I   m talking about University of Cameron, Lawton  area,    which is what we call Cameron State Junior College. I went out there  and did well. Was ROTC Corps Commander. Student Senate. Spent two  years there and went to Oklahoma State.  Little Thunder How did you choose OSU?  Chappabitty The ROTC program. It was the largest ROTC in Oklahoma. They recruited  Cameron students very, very   and we all came to OSU. I did that. Lived  here for two years and enjoyed myself. I enjoyed zoology, but I enjoyed  ROTC as well. Also, I got paid a  110 a month in my senior year.  7  Little Thunder Oh, that   s great. Did you know coming in that you were going to major in  zoology?  Chappabitty Yeah. That was     Little Thunder You had taken some classes at Cameron?  Chappabitty It was pre-med. We didn   t have a pre-med curriculum. It was just zoology.  That was as close as I could get to it. That was my goal was pre-med. I did  that.  Little Thunder Were there some other campus groups that you were involved with?  Chappabitty Scabbard and Blade, ROTC drill team. Stuff like that. Really wasn   t  involved in other organizations. There was an Indian club here, but I didn   t  have time to meet with them. I was a junior and senior as well. I was  planning on a ROTC commitment as a distinguished medical graduate. I  took a regular army commission in field artillery. I was going to spend at  least three years in. Vietnam was going on but I received a degree in  zoology and planned to get back into medicine at some point in the future.  Little Thunder Well, you did tell me a great story about a young Native American woman. I  don   t know if you told me her tribe, but she was a sorority member. Do you  mind telling me that story again? She was in a sorority?  Chappabitty Oh, oh yeah. There was a year ahead of me, there was a beautiful, intelligent  girl from up around Tulsa, I think. All the Indians, all the Skins, I call them,  the Indians, the Redskins, we were all just in love with her. She was a  sorority girl. I told somebody that when she walked across campus, the  clouds would part and the sun would come down and shine on her. Birds  would start singing. I don   t think her feet ever touched the ground. I don   t  know how she walked, but everybody was in love with her. Don   t know  whatever happened to her, wherever she is at, I   m sure she   s still    She was  a Redskin beauty and a sorority queen and all that. Yeah, there were Indians  here.  Little Thunder Even though you weren   t involved with the Native American club or  anything at that time, do you remember what the general attitude was  toward students?  Chappabitty A lot of students came and a lot of them left. They were here, and six  months later, they were gone. It   s interesting because there was a student in  my dorm, the Kerr Drummond Complex. I would have lunch with him  sometimes. I was a Senior and he was a Freshman. He   d be sitting by  himself and I   d go over and eat with him. Not often, but maybe once a week  or something. The next semester he didn   t show up. They were talking about  8  him one day, I heard them at lunch, and they said,    You know that guy, that  Indian   s guy   s name?    they said.    He didn   t come back. He flunked out. Just  quit. He went home.    He had room, board, books, fees, tuition and spending  money. He just quit. Didn   t go to class and all that. His roommate wouldn   t  talk to him. He had no friends. He was away from his family over in the  eastern part of the state. I was talking to somebody many years later, and I  mentioned his name, and they said,    Oh yeah, he   s over around Muskogee  or somewhere. He powwows and he sings at the drum.     I said,    How   s he doing?    He said,    He   s doing well.    But he wasn   t going  to achieve anything here. His own roommate wouldn   t talk to him. He had  no friends. You go to class, and you   re just an outsider. Nineteen ninety-two  was the year of that Strangers in Their Own Land, KFOR TV, Linda  Cavanagh. They talk about that. I did the part as an Indian physician, taking  care of Indians. I still have the eight track on it. It   s so old. She sent me an  eight track, and I still have it. I   m going to make copies of it as a CD  because it   s historical. That was my introduction to talking about where  things are and adding my part to where I have been I think it   s hard for a lot  of Indians to come. First of all, economically they don   t have the money.  Families don   t have the money, and oftentimes, in the Indian schools, the  students are coming out with ninth-grade level educations. How are they  going to succeed in college when they have to go back and take remedial, or  if they go into advanced courses, they can   t keep up with it?  As a result, they either quit or they leave. I think by the time the education  monies came out and the Bureau of Indian Affairs was really paying for a lot  of stuff that the families could not afford, even then people just didn   t have  the attitude that they had to go. In school, people would come by my room,  and they   d say,    We got a keg of beer. We   re going to go out and get drunk  and fall down.    I would say,    I got a biology test tomorrow or a zo ology   test.    They would say,    Oh you think you   re too good because you   re taking  those hard courses.    I said,    No, I would like to go to medical school  someday. I can   t do that, drinking all night and missing class and all this.        You think you   re too good.    I said,    No, I don   t, but I   m not going out with  you guys.    If you   re away from your family and you don   t have the internal  drive or whatever it is, to sit down and do your homework and go to class,  you   re going to go out and party and have a good time. When the grades  come out, you aren   t going to be around.    Then, you do something else.  Like get drafted.  Little Thunder Did you get to go home very much?  Chappabitty Yeah, we lived in Lawton. It was just a few blocks home from Cameron,  actually.  Little Thunder Would you catch a ride with somebody or     9  Chappabitty No, walk.  Little Thunder Okay. I mean when you were here at OSU.  Chappabitty Oh yeah, caught rides with my friends. A lot of the Lawton people came to  Oklahoma State. We   d go home, I   d say, once or twice a month. Family is  important. You get your head patted and all that, but you, also, you  remember where you came from. My dad wanted to be an engineer. But  World War II came along. He worked in the shipyards at Portland. He  wanted to be an engineer, but he was never able to because he had a family.  He started raising kids and he had to feed them. He always wanted to be an  engineer and he never did make it. He did pretty well, but his kids did even  better. They pushed us and helped us, I guess.  Little Thunder What were the steps that got you   you   re in ROTC, and then you end up  serving in Vietnam?  Chappabitty I graduated from Oklahoma State in    67. I accepted a regular army  commission in field artillery as I was a distinguished medical graduate. I  picked the Hundred and First Airborne Division at Fort Campbell as my first  assignment. Within a matter of days, I reported to Fort Campbell. I was sent  off to the Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. I completed airborne  training and became a paratrooper and artillery officer. I was at Fort Sill in  the Officer Basic course when the division deployed to Vietnam in  November of    67. The Hundred and First went to Vietnam. They left me and  several other people in the school. We were very angry about it, but a good  percentage of the FO, the Forward Observer teams, were killed or wounded  in Hu   , A Shau Valley and the Tet Offensive of    67. I would   ve been right  there. I went back to  Fort  Campbell to spend a year as an Executive  Officer in the training company, the training command. Went to Vietnam in  May of    69.  I was a First Lieutenant and became an Artillery Forward Observer with an  armored cavalry squadron in the Twenty-Fifth Division. Twenty-six days  out in the field, four days back. Basically, in the field and the jungle,  fighting. It was a hard job because you could get killed real quick. For every  seven troops in Vietnam, there was six of them in the rear, in supply and  finance and medical. There was only one out in the field, actually doing the  fighting. That was the ratio. But that   s where the causalities were.  In August of    69, I was promoted to captain. After one day back in the base  camp, I went to Tainan City, Tainan Province and became the liaison officer  to the Second Battalion Thirty-Fourth Armor. I stayed with them for the  remainder of my tour and spent the whole year in the field. It was dangerous  work. When I was in my base camp one day, an enlisted man came and they  said,    There   s a spook here to see you from Tainan West,    which was the  10  intelligence people and the green berets and all those guys. This captain  came up to me and said to me,    Are you '     i u  y' Chappabitty?    meaning  Captain Chappabitty? I said    Yes.    He said,    I   m so and so. I need to talk to  you.    He said,    When you came up here and took over the liaison position  for this artillery group, for this armor unit,    he said,    they identified you as a  Hawaiian Artillery Officer.    He said,    A month later, they said you were not  Hawaiian      (this is the NVA, the North Vietnamese Army)      they said  you were Spanish American. Then, they said, no, he   s not Spanish  American. About a week ago, they identified you as an American Indian,  and more specifically, a Comanche. We   re here to tell you that John Wayne  beat you here. Hollywood beat you here.  The idea that an Indian captain would be out here directing artillery, flying,  getting off, and fighting from the back of tanks and all this, impressed them  and they   ve doubled the price on your head. We   re just letting you know  that if you get caught, you   re not coming back. I said,    I understand that. I  appreciate it. If I get caught, I   m not coming back, anyway.    I said,    They  know where I   m at. Let them come get me and we   ll go across the river  together.    I mean, I   m not afraid of dying. The Comanches will still  remember me. The War Mothers will still sing their praises and the veterans  will still honor me because that   s what we do. We   re soldiers and warriors.  Frederic Remington did a painting. It   s called Ridden Down. It   s not a  famous painting, but to me, it just speaks volumes. It   s the picture of a  warrior standing on a bluff and he   s standing beside his horse. Horse is  down. Mane is down, tail is down, and it   s covered in salt. It   s not going to  run anymore. It   s ridden down. The warrior is standing there; he   s stripped  to the waist. He   s painted green up to his head. He   s got his war club in one  hand and a medicine bundle in his right hand. He   s looking up like this and  he   s praying. He   s making his last statements on this world because behind  him, in the draw, there   s a war party coming up.  The war party shields and lances, and they   re going to be on him in thirty  seconds. It   s not a question of if he lives and dies. That   s already been  decided. It   s only a matter of how. If he runs away, they   ll catch him and  they   ll kill him. If he begs for mercy, he   ll get none. They   ll catch him and  they   ll kill him. His only choice is to fight and maybe take one or two of  them with him, across the creek or river. It   s called Ridden Down and it   s  one of my favorite pictures because it really talks what it   s like. If I   m going  to die, then, you know, I   m a soldier. That goes with the territory. But it   s a  matter of how it happens. Indians made good soldiers like that because  getting killed is not the worst thing that could happen to you. Failing in  battle is. Comanches in the old time would take a knife or an arrow from  their sash on their waist. They   d put it on the ground and they   d stick an  arrow in it. It meant,    I   m here. If you want me, you come get me, because  I   m not going to run. If you want me, come get me and we   ll decide this  11  issue.    To me, that was a part of it. When I went  to Vietnam , my  grandfather prayed and my grandmother prayed.  They, my grandfather Otis Chappabitty, January    68, National Geographic,  can tell you what it means, our name. He gave me a little metal can with a  peyote button in it. He said,    This will protect you,    and prayed to it and all  that. I carried that with me in Vietnam. Spent a year there and still decided  that I wanted to do something else besides be an artillery officer. Turned the  career course down at Fort Sill when I came back. Had three Bronze Stars:  two for valor, one for service. Air medal, Army Commendation Medal for  Valor, Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, Air Crew badge. Was awarded.  When I decided not to stay in the army, I caught heck from my commanding  general. He wanted to know why I was getting out, why I was not taking the  career course. But I took that time, working in the post headquarters for two  years, to go back to Cameron at night. I did three hours of night school,  Tuesday and Thursday night. I got almost forty hours and had almost a  straight A  average  and was talking to Dartmouth. Got out of the service in     72 and headed for New Hampshire. That opened doors and wound up in  Minnesota. That opened doors and got into three or four medical schools  and chose Colorado. Wanted to learn how to ski. (Laughter)  Little Thunder That was like a double cultural adjustment. I mean, first of all, coming out  of the service, and then going back east.  Chappabitty I don   t think I fit in.    You mean you were in Vietnam? How could you kill  somebody? How could you       I said,    It   s easy when it   s you or them.  You   re not thinking about it.    But I had to defend it a lot. The GI bill didn   t  last very long and all that. But by the time I got to medical school, nobody  cared. You worry about yourself. You don   t worry about the other people.  Nobody cared.    Oh, you were in Vietnam?    Yeah.       Okay, sorry about  that.    It didn   t mean a whole lot there. What meant there was,    Did you pass  your courses? Are you progressing?    It was a whole different game. Nobody  cared. I got out of medical school. Graduated in 1980. Went to Albuquerque,  University of New Mexico. Family practice. One of the best family practice  programs. They had like 200 applications for ten slots. I got one of them. I  felt very lucky to get that. Spent three years there and came back to the  Indian Health Service.  Was asked to go into civil service or active duty with the Commission Corps  and I chose the Commission Corps. Had five years active duty, so military  played a big role. I was living in Lawton. Fort Sill was three miles away.  Had all the benefits, PX, Commissary. We didn   t wear uniforms until the  last five years of my career. I spent twenty-five years and retired as a Naval  0-6, over thirty years    service. Seventy-five percent of my base salary for  life. Tricare for life. House was paid for; kid was out of college. Things  worked out well. It was easy to be rewarded. The fact that I was a physician,  12  the first Comanche physician, gives me honor in the tribe. The fact that I  was a combat decorated soldier probably meant more to the Comanches than  I was a doctor. It gives you credibility. You   ve been there. To me, it was  easy. Jumping out of airplanes was hard. (Laughter)  Little Thunder When you became the first   whenever a new program starts, that   s kind of  hard. When you became the first medical director for Comanche Nation,  what were some of the challenges?  Chappabitty Basically, health care. So few people, our people, have insurance. The  Indian Health Service, as a treaty obligation, gives health care. The people  use the Indian Health Service for everything from flu shots to having babies.  We   re limited only by our facilities, our staff and not having enough money.  To sit there and talk to the people about their concerns about health care and  then to talk to the tribal leaders about health care. I   m going to a meeting in  Washington in January to a meeting with the National Institute of Health,  and I   m representing the Southwest Oklahoma Indian Health Board about  the research that is going on. I   m going to go up there for a few days to  represent the seven tribes. We are behind in health care. We   re behind in  education.  We   re behind in all kind of things except diabetes, and abuse, and  alcoholism, and all the other kind of things that affect us. Health care is  important. If you don   t have it, you   re not going to survive as long and  you   re not going to be as healthy. Right now, the Indian Health Service is  simply overwhelmed. I worked for twenty-five years underfunded,  understaffed, and overwhelmed. I don   t know of any other thing to do. I  never was in private practice, but I got a good pay and I enjoyed that. If I  was in the Public Health Service Commission Corps, assigned to a  reservation, and the nearest military base was 200 miles away, it would not  be that much of an advantage. To me, it offered me a career, active duty,  with all the benefits and a really good retirement.  Little Thunder Can you think of a couple, maybe, memorable moments? Either in  Albuquerque in family practice or some memorable moment that had to do  with being a doctor and taking care of somebody?  Chappabitty Well, I think, doing five deliveries in one night at Gallup  New Mexico .  Little Thunder Wow.  Chappabitty The second and third years, the residents spent one month each in OBGYN  at Gallup. This huge Indian medical center on the western part of New  Mexico on the reservation. We learned OB. You deliver babies by  delivering babies. They teach you how and they back you up. Then, second  and third years, you go out and spent a month there. You   re working nights.  13  Go on at five and get off at eight in the morning. Weekends were hard  because you would get a call from Zuni  New Mexico  and a call from Fort  Defiance. We   re closing down the OB this weekend and we got three  ambulances coming. Two ladies in each one and they   ll be there within an  hour. You know you are going to be up all night. You   re the resident that   s  on the floor and you go there. And if you need it, they   ll give you backup.  Otherwise, you do it. That   s how you learned OB and that   s what I did.  When I was at Gallup as a second-year resident. I   d already done, probably  over 200 deliveries by that time. I was pretty knowledgeable or at least  thought I was. The OB department had little windows on the door and  people were peeking in the window, little heads. I   m sitting there in the OB  department in my scrubs and the Navajo nurses were with me. Of course,  they were telling me what to do and how to do it, and you better listen to  them. I said,    What   s going on?    I said,    All these people, they   re looking in  here. What   s the deal?    The head nurse, she said,    The word is out that  there   s a Comanche doctor here and that he   s delivering babies. They   re  looking in here to see if you have horns on your head.    I looked around at  the door and I went    Huh,     indicates buffalo horns . Like that. They all  ducked. (Laughter) That was kind of funny.  Little Thunder That   s a great story.  Chappabitty But you learn OB by doing OB. You bring life, help bring life into the  world. You   re tired the next morning. You   re going back to the apartment  and you   re going back to bed because you got to go back at five and do it  again, if you   re working nights. But you feel good about it. I get on an  airplane.    Is there a pregnant woman in here?    I look around because I know  what I   m doing. Now, they don   t teach OB to family practice because of  litigation. The only one that does it is OBGYN. I think it   s wrong. I think  every doctor ought to know how to assess a pregnant woman and what to  do, if you have no choice. I felt guilty for six months that I wasn   t at work,  taking care of people. Now, I don   t feel guilty. I   ve been retired seven years.  I   m into other things. You work nights, weekends, holidays. My daughter  wanted nothing to do with medicine.  Little Thunder I was going to say, you had a family. How did you balance?  Chappabitty It was hard. I wanted her to go into medicine, of course. She was smart and  beautiful and everything. She said,    Are you crazy. I watched you. You  came in after you worked all night. Then you   d eat breakfast and go to bed.  I   d go to school and by the time I got out of school, you were back at work.     She said,    I   m not going to do that. No way.    It was hard. It   s a stern master.  Twenty-five years I practiced. I was never sued. Never involved in any  litigation and I   m proud of that. I thought that I knew what I was doing.  14  There   s also a little thing in the back of your head that says,    Be careful.  Watch this. Do this.    I   ve listened to that. I listened to it in war and I  listened to it in medicine. It never lead me wrong. There are other issues  than that. Spirituality and religion and all the other kind of things that are  part of it. That   s a part of being in medicine. You listen to what the patient  tells you. They   ll tell you what   s wrong with them and why they   re there,  but you got to listen.  I took care of people for twenty-five years. I think I   d do it again. Somebody  said,    Would you go back to medical school?    I said,    I don   t know.    The  thing is that I don   t have to and I   m not going to. I enjoyed what I was  doing. There comes a time   I   m seventy-one in two months. There comes a  time to quit and let somebody else do it. I   m hoping that there   s people here  who would replace me and nobody came along. That   s why when you do  find an Indian student who wants to do this, you   ve got to help them. Doctor  Smith said,    Rather than just give us donations, why don   t you start a  scholarship?    So I do that. We   ve got two students, a 1,000 bucks a year to  help them because a lot of their families don   t have the resources and  they   re going to graduate with enormous debt. If I can help them, I   ll do  that. I want them to do well, to get good grades. I want them to succeed and  become professionals, become parents, husbands and wives. I want them to  succeed and get the foundation to go on and become a professional if they  choose.  Little Thunder When did you start that again?  Chappabitty Twelve. Yeah.  Little Thunder Two thousand and twelve.  Chappabitty I increased it and I hoped to continue to do this. To try to get students  interested. Believe it or not, if you   ve got a good student here, I could show  them the finest schools in the country that are looking for Indian students.  They also want them to be prepared before they get there and able to do the  work. I thought,    Rather than just give the zoology department money, I   ll  start a scholarship,    and I   ve done that. We gave away one per year and now  we   re up to two. It will be my objective to continue to do that. If I can do it,  I   ll bring a little bit more into it. I can   t sit there and take their courses for  them or write their reports or whatever. But I can help them pay their bills  and that   s what I want to do. I can also say,    I was there and I know what  you   re going through. I did it and you can do it, too.     Nobody   s going to give you anything. You   re going to have to work for it.  You   re going to have to pass those courses, stay in the classes and do well. I  went to an outstanding medical school in Colorado. I didn   t realize how well  I was trained until I left. New Mexico honed on that. I was close to the  15  Indian Health Service all the time, working at reservations and also working  for the Navajo  Area Indian  Health Service. It let me do that, and as soon as  I got out, back to Lawton, I wasn   t going downtown. I wasn   t going into  private practice. I was going to the Indian Health Service. I made that a  point when I was applying to medical schools. I want to go back home. And  I did.  Little Thunder Are there some ways in which, even though it was undergrad and it was a  zoology degree, are there some connections between your success in  medicine and your early years at OSU?  Chappabitty I think you   ve got to take the courses, you   ve got to pass the exams, you   ve  got do the work. That   s really what you   ve got to do to get your degree. Pass  this course so you can go on before that. It was just a stepping stone. You   ve  got to get the credits. You   ve got to do so many credits to graduate. The  courses got more interesting as you became a junior and a senior because  they were more histology, physiology and things like that. They were more  towards what I   m interested in. Of course, I was in ROTC, too, and that was  another thing. But zo oology  was always there. I always knew that I wanted  to go back. I had to keep that in mind. Five years in the Army, that may have  been too long. Thinking back on it, maybe three would have been all right,  then get out. Because I was trying to talk medical schools to letting me in  when I was twenty-seven, twenty-eight years old. I wasn   t that twenty-two  year old kid right off the block. But I also carried five more or plus years of  experience, knowledge.  I interviewed at one medical school and the lady was really giving me flack.     I see here you were in the Army and you were in Vietnam. How did that  affect you?    I said,    Well, I did my job.    She said,    War must be horrible.    I  said,    It   s not horrible. It is terror, but you learn to overcome that.    She was  really getting on me about Vietnam. This, of course, was different times.  She said,    How do we know that you can stand the stress of being in  medical school?    This is with thirteen people in a U-shaped table with me in  the middle. I said,    I don   t think you understand. I   ve been in situations  where I didn   t know if I   d be alive to see the sun go down. There were days  when I didn   t know if I   d see it come up and I   d be breathing. But I did my  job and I took care of my people.    She kept hitting at me.    I see here that  you made a C in solid geometry in the tenth grade. How do we know you   re  still not that kind of student?     I said,    I was sixteen years old. I was playing football. I discovered girls.    I  said,    I   m not the same person I was when I was sixteen.    I was like,    Oh  gosh, I   m not going to get in.    She finally just kept pushing me and I said,     Look, you don   t have to let me in your school. I got into two already.    I  wouldn   t have had said that if I hadn   t had that. If you get into one school,  it   s the best school in the world. If you get into two, you take your pick. I  16  said,    You don   t have to let me in your school. Number two, if you let me  in, you can throw me out. You can make me repeat courses, or you can talk  bad about me. But until you can take me out in the alley behind this building  and shoot me, you   re not going to put pressure on me. I   ve been there. Let   s  move on to something else.     Little Thunder Good for you.  Chappabitty I got in. I was unanimously accepted to that medical school. (phone  interruption)  Little Thunder I understand that you   ve been doing a lot of photography?  Chappabitty I have enjoyed photography my whole life. All of my Vietnam pictures are  turning yellow and green. I need to re-stabilize them and put them on digital.  About six years ago, I discovered digital. I   m completely digital now. I love  photography. I have a wonderful picture that I took at Fort Sill in June of     09, 2009. This photo, I took it from the north side of Medicine Bluff at Fort  Sill. It shows Medicine Bluff with Comanche Indians on top of it at the  edge. The Medicine Bluff Creek below it, the trees and this beautiful sky  above. I call this picture Comanches Offer Prayer atop Sacred Medicine  Bluff, Fort Sill, Oklahoma, June the 19, 2009. That picture is hanging in the  Smithsonian Museum of Indians right now because it was so beautiful.  Medicine Bluff   s at Fort Sill. I went to the wrong side. They let the tribal  people go up there once a year and climb on top of Medicine Bluff. But  that   s a sacred site to Indians for hundreds and thousands of years. I went to  the wrong side and I took a picture, two pictures.  The guy that was working over at the animal farm over there for the army  said,    You   re on the wrong side. You need to go back around and climb up.  You   ll see them over there if you go over here about 200, 300 yards. So I  walked over through the woods and took the shot which came out so  wonderful. Dr. Smith has a copy of it in his office. I gave him that years ago.  You go up on top of that huge bluff up there, 200, 300 foot bluff, sheer cliff.  It   s a fault line. I took my Konica Minolta digital camera up there and was  taking pictures and this old man said,    You shouldn   t be taking pictures up  here,    he said.    This is sacred.    I said,    I   m not being disrespectful. They   re  not for sale. They   re for my use and I prayed before I came up here.    I was  walking around taking pictures and all of a sudden my camera just quits. I  mean, it just goes dead. I turned it off and on and it won   t come on. I take  the battery out. Turn it upside down. Flipped to put it back in.  The camera is gone. I had to send it back to Sony who had the copyright for  Minolta. They told me that I had burned a sensor out in it. They said,    Were  you charging the battery when this happened or what?    I said,    No, I was up  on top of this bluff.       Well, whatever it is, you burned a sensor out. You  17  overloaded it and we repaired it. You owe us a  120.    I got my camera back,  but I got to talking to   he   s now the former director of the museum at Fort  Sill. I said,    I was up there and I was doing this and this is what happened.     He asked me where I was at, and I told him. He said,    There   s about four or  five sites up there on top of the bluff that are high in energy. You were at the  biggest one. We don   t take our equipment in there because it affects our  cameras and our sensors.    I told him where I was at and he told me,    You  were at the worst thing.     He said,    They used to put sweat lodges up there. People would go up there  and pray and sweat and fast for four days. People that were sick went up  there to pray to be healed. Some went up there to die. There are things up  there that we avoid because we respect them. They   re not marked, but we  know where they are at because they are high in energy.    I thought,    Okay.  All right. It   s there and I   m not going to bother it. I   m going to be respectful  of my electronic equipment.    But I do love photography. I go back once a  year. Same place, take that picture which shows this bluff with the Indians  on top of it. Little tiny figures up on top from about a half-a-mile away with  a digital camera. Then, I climb up on top and I avoid the areas that he told  me to stay away from. You have to respect those things. They   re things that  are there. I carry a camera wherever I go. I need to get out to the vo-tech and  take the camera and photography courses, the digital camera and  photography courses. I   ll do that in the future. Right now, I just enjoy  photography. You go to a powwow, or you go around people, you see  people, and a year later, they   re gone. But you   ve got a photo of them. You  make it and you give it to their family. I do like photography.  Little Thunder What   s been one of your most important awards or honors in your mind that  you have gotten over the years?  Chappabitty I really enjoyed the Association of American Indian Physician of the Year. I  was picked by my contemporaries and my peers. They only take one person  a year. To get recognized by your peers is really an achievement. We were  in Albuquerque, actually at Ruidoso  New Mexico , the Inn of the Mountain  Gods, and I was picked as Physician of the Year. About six months ago, I  received all of my military awards. I wrote to the National Records Center  and gave them the information and they sent me my records. I received three  Bronze Stars in Vietnam. Two for valor, one for service. When you get a  valor award, on the back of the medal, there is your name engraved in real  tiny little gold letters. There   s your grade (captain) and then there   s the date  of the medal. I got these in the mail. A big box came, said    Here you are.    I  looked at the back of them and the ones that had Vs hanging on them for  valor were awarded in combat. They had my name on the back of them. I  don   t know where the ones I got, but they weren   t engraved.  18  They also sent me the citations of what I did when I got these. I think that  was a pat on the back, too. I don   t know what happened to the ones I had,  but I have them back now. My parachute wings. I   m proud to be a  paratrooper. My medical degree is hanging on the wall. I   m the first  Comanche physician. There are a bunch of them that were kind of  memorable things in my life. Beautiful picture of my beautiful daughter. I  took a picture of her at TCU. I said,    Stand over there with the university  stadium behind you.    She said,    You   re not going take a picture of me. I   m  not going to smile.    I said,    One picture.    She smiled. I took one picture of  her and she saw the picture later. She said,    Can you get me copies of that?     I said,    Yeah.    It   s one of my favorites. Things like that that the camera  allows you   you as the photographer see the picture and there it is. I was  driving down the road, coming up from Fort Worth where she went to  school. I had this funny sensation that there was something behind me. I  looked in the rearview mirror coming up toward Lawton on the Interstate  44.  There was this wall cloud about five miles behind me. There was a big bump  coming down like that, halfway to the ground. It was a tornado that was  coming out of the sky over the Walters turn off, there. I pulled off the road. I  got my camera out and I took one picture. Then it went back up and was  gone. But I have this photograph of this thing. I felt it before I knew it was  there. I stopped and I looked in the mirror and there it was. I got out of the  car. People were driving past me. They didn   t even see it. It was only there  for forty-five seconds. Then it was gone. You see these pictures and if you  don   t record them, they   re going to be gone. I enjoy that. I carry a little  digital camera with me all the time. Really enjoy photography. Cameras are  moving so fast. It hurt my feelings badly when Minolta bankrupted because  I carried a Minolta camera since Vietnam and now they   re gone. They   re  Sony now. I do enjoy photography.  Little Thunder What changes would you say have happened then for Native students in  medicine since you went to medical school?  Chappabitty Well, it   s a different era. I went to Dartmouth to interview for the post-graduate  program I was trying to get into to get into medical school. I rode  an Air Force Shuttle out of Altus Air Force Base to Dover, Delaware. I got  there early in the morning. Took a shuttle from Dover to Gratin and stayed  in the submarine base there that night. Rented a car and drove to Hanover. I  guess I was one of the first to come in there. There were Indian students in  the medical school, but there weren   t a whole lot. My interview went well.  I   d been talking to Dartmouth. They were following me, advising me. The  Dean gave me a good interview and a tour and everything. I felt good about  it. At the end, he had this really funny grin on his face. He said,    Do you  mind if I ask you a personal question?    I said,    If you don   t mind if I don   t  answer.    He said,    Have you ever lived in tipi?    He had this big grin. I said,  19     No, but if it   ll help me get in, I   ll go find one.    It was different times then. I  mean, that was back in the    70s,    74. Things are different now. You see  students that are coming out with As and they   ve got good test scores and  everything. They do well. It   s a different world now. We were the  trailblazers, I think. But once you get in, it   s up to you.  Nobody   s going to stand there, and    I would tell you not to be one of the  bottom four of the class because you   re not going to survive. They take such  a broad range. There are so many people. We had a lady quit the first day at  Colorado. They said,    We   re going to break for lunch now. Come back in an  hour. We   ll start the teaching labs and we   ll begin class. Any questions?     This lady put her hand up and he said,    Yes, ma   am.    She walked down,  gave him a letter and walked out the door. He opened it up and he said,     You   ve had your first resignation in your class.    There was a lady the next  day who was the first alternate and she took over and graduated with us. It   s  not for everybody. I think that if you are not keyed for it, you may get  frightened away from it. You   ve certainly got to have the academics.  You   ve got to pass the classes. You   ve got to pass the courses. You   ve got  to get the grades. You   ve got to have the scores. Because they   re not going  to let you in because you are a nice person or you   re going to go home and  take care of them. You   ve got to get that MD. When I walked across the  stage, it was the culmination of a long, long hard drive. You   re proud, but  you   re grateful, too, that you survived it.  Little Thunder Did your folks get to be there?  Chappabitty Oh yeah, my parents were there. It was amazing. They were going to be  there. They were there. My dad was retired. He was there. My mom was  there. They   re the ones that got us there and we paid them back. Right now,  students are a different group. I think that anybody that   s interested in  medicine understands that they   ve got to have the scores, the grades.  They   ve got to do well. My scholarship, I decided that I wanted a three point  grade point minimum. I caught flack because the Indian people said,    That   s  too high. Our kids can   t make three points  grade point averages .    I said,     They   ve got to have a three five to be considered successfully. But I   m  going to go with a three, with the understanding that if they can give me a  three, I think they   re going to still make it. If I made it a three-five, I don   t  know if I could get anybody. I   d find one or two, but you   ve got to have the  scores. It   s a different world right now. The idea,    Have I ever lived in a  tipi?    I said,    No. I can find one and I   ll go live in it if it   ll get me in.    I  thought that was funny. But I don   t know how many Indians he   d ever met  and here I was.  Little Thunder Well, is there anything else you would like to talk about?  20  Chappabitty No, I   m just at southwest Oklahoma and Comanche County. The Kiowa,  Comanche, and Apaches have been there for over a hundred years. They  were brought there. Indians have been there for hundreds of years. The  Caddoans have been there for thousands of years. If you go back to places  like the Dumbo Mammoth site, which is calendared at 11,000 years,  arrowheads between the ribs of mammoths. If you go back to the Cooperton  site, north of Altus, that site is 18,000 years old. Tools and broken bones.  Our connection with the Southwest is there. When I took that photo of  Medicine Bluff, the author that did Dances with Wolves was there. I forgot  his name now. He was friends with the museum director who   s now retired.  Towana Spivey. There   s a character named Spivey in that movie. He   s a real  crazy guy. But anyway, this author was there. He saw the picture I   d given  Mr. Spivey. He said,    I have to have a copy of that picture. I want a copy of  that picture and he won   t give me his.    I said,    I   ll go home and get you one.  I have an eight by ten. I   m going home and I   ll be right back.    The Indians  were playing the soldiers in the 1880 baseball game at Fort Sill. He was  there and he was signing books. Got a really good picture of Mr. Spivey.  He and myself were all like this, but he signed his book for me. I forgot his  name. He wrote Dances with Wolves. I went home and got him a picture of  it. He had that. He said,    Every Indian west of the Mississippi knows of  sacred Medicine Bluff. The tribes know about it. They came here to pray  and some to die.    He said,    I   m taking this home and I   m putting it in my  house.    I wrote on the back, Comanches Offer Prayer atop Sacred Medicine  Bluff, Fort Sill, Oklahoma, 6-19-09. I gave it to him. It   s somewhere out in  California. You remember things like that. College was a part of my life.  Before I was a physician, I was a soldier. All those things sort of put  together   not that you finish everything or not that you complete everything  because that   s just not the way life is. You   re going to fall down and you   re  going to fail. The difference is getting up. The Indian people have been a  part of southwest Oklahoma in Comanche County, certainly, Fort Sill, for  years and years. I   ve got relatives buried out there with Geronimo, Apache  side. There   s Comanches buried all over the place out there. We   ve been  there, not just for hundreds of years, but thousands of years. We   re still  there. We   re proud of who we are. I enjoy being retired and living there. It   s  an honor for me to represent Comanche county for this anniversary. It   s an  important thing. I   m very privileged to be here today, too.  Little Thunder Well, it   s an honor to interview you. Thank you so much, Dr. Chappabitty.  Chappabitty Very good.  -------  -------
