 Ahrberg and I want to welcome you to the O-STATE Stories  Project. We   re glad to have you here. I   m interviewing Robin Duncan  Robertson. Is that correct?  Real name is Roberta, but I go by Robin.  Okay. Can you tell us the years you attended Oklahoma A M?  I was here in 1947 to 1951 for my bachelor   s and then from 1957 to  1958 for my master   s.  Wonderful. I   m just gonna kind of start off here with some general  questions and then we can move on more toward OSU. Can you tell me  a little bit about yourself   where you were born, how many brothers and  sisters, if you had any, and that kind of thing?  I have no brothers and sisters. I was born in Beaumont, Texas in 1929.  That was the Depression years, and my daddy got a job in Beaumont.  My mama was just barely 18 and he was 20, and they moved away from  home for the first time in their lives. They didn   t stay long. (Laughs)  They came back to Oklahoma.  So you   re originally from Texas. That   s where you were born?  Briefly.  Briefly, okay. Can you tell us a little bit about why you decided to attend  Oklahoma A M?  Yes. My mother came up here in 1941 and enrolled in college, and back  5  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  in that time there were not very many older people that decided to come  to college. So we moved to Stillwater, right across the street from the  Catholic church north, second house from the corner. The house is still  there. She went to school here and worked in Dean Talbert   s office. She  worked for Nina Laughlin who had a little shop on the campus, Nina   s.  She worked for her and did her windows. She was in dress design and  interior decorating and she graduated in 1946. I went back to Temple,  Oklahoma my senior year and graduated there and came back the next  year to school. When you go to high school in Stillwater, college is the  13th year   I mean, there   s no question. (Laughter) You just go to school.  It   s just destiny, right?  Yeah.  Did your parents go to college?  My dad went to business school and Mama got her bachelors here and  then she did one year of post-graduate work at Washington University in  St. Louis.  Wow, that   s neat. Now tell me about your major. What was it in?  In education. I started in business and I had a shorthand teacher that  talked to herself and I couldn   t decide whether she was doing  transcription (Laughs) or she was talking to herself, and I was a basket  case when I   d get out of that class. I decided I needed a change, so I got  in education. I had a double major actually. I did have a major in  business and in education. When it was time to graduate   Dr. Ida T.  Smith was my counselor in English   it wasn   t in elementary, it was in  English that I did my practice teaching. She set it up. She forgot to call  the business guy and tell him I was doing my practice teaching in  English, and when I got my grade I had an    I    in my business practice  teaching. Okay. So we had to call him, and she got it set up and I had to  go down to Stillwater High School and teach all day everyday   I think  it was for two weeks   while he sat there and watched me and taught  short hand and typing. But he did finally give me a grade.  Oh, my gosh. Can you tell me a little bit about some of the classes you  took here on campus that you remember?  Oh yes. I remember Dr. Reynolds    history class where we got an    A    if  we enrolled. I took photography from Dr. Perkins   yes   no, Scott  Perkins was Glee Club. What was the photography? Gene Bartmus was  my lab teacher, he was a graduate assistant. I was a charter member of  Rodeo Club, a female charter member. He said,    If you take pictures of  6  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  horses and cowboys, I   m giving you an    F.    (Laughs) So I got the girls  all lined up for girly pictures, took their pictures. We had to take the  pictures, develop the film, print them and all, and make our album. I got  an    A    because he liked the girly pictures.  Was it Dr. Pruitt?  Dr. Pruitt.  Dr. Pruitt was the photographer, yes.  With the top hat.  Yes. Oh, my gosh.  And Ida T. Smith, like I said, she was my advisor and I think she was  my inspiration to teach. She was one of the few female doctors on  campus, and she was a very independent person. She wouldn   t let men  carry her briefcase or open the doors or any of that. She looked like  Bette Davis to me and she   d sit on the corner of the table in class and  give her lectures, and I just thought she was great. Then Dr. Schwartz I  had for art, and that was when I was doing my master   s. That was a  wonderful experience because she just let us do anything. She was an  oasis in the master   s program. Dr. Smith told us one time,    If you can   t  get ready and go to work in 15 minutes, you   re not organized.    Dr.  Schwartz said yes, she   d have someone come in and iron all of her  clothes and sew the buttons on (laughs) and all that. Dr. Smith said  whatever she wore that day to class, she hung in the back of her closet  and then the next day whatever was hanging first, that   s what she put on.  Oh, that   s a cute story. So can you tell us about some of the buildings  that you had these classes in? Where were most of your classes?  Williams, and I was so upset when I came back up here   Williams Hall  was gone. It was such a pretty building. I had class in Old Central, and  my freshman first semester I had a class at Life Science and I had a class  at Williams, then I had a class in Morrill or someplace back over here,  then I had another class in Old Central. I was back and forth across the  campus that whole semester and I had class in the auditorium. We had a  political science class, I think, that had about 150 kids in it. We all had it  together in the auditorium. My business classes were in Morrill, and I  think some of my English classes were there, too.  That sounds about right. That   s what Morrill is for     And then they built the Classroom Building sometime   I guess when I  7  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  was getting my master   s and we had the classes there. I remember the  first research paper that we handed in when I got my master   s, and the  professor said,    Well I can tell all the elementary teachers in here. They  are the ones that have three-word sentences.    (Laughter)  Why did you decide to pursue your master   s? That   s kind of unusual at  that time, wouldn   t you say, for women at that time to go ahead and  pursue their master   s?  Well I liked to go to school. Every fall I just liked to go to school. I think  I could still go to school  (Laughs)  Oh, that   s great. Did you have a lot of friends that were pursuing  masters at that time also?  When I did my master   s, we had just begun to get foreign students and  we had a wing at Willard   the whole wing, first floor, for masters     candidates. There were only four of us from the United States in that  wing. Okay. I was going to get each one of those girls to write for me  their favorite childhood story from their country and then I was going to  put it all together in a book. I never did do it, but that was a good idea.  You bet. That is a wonderful idea. Tell us a little bit about   you lived in  Willard? Did you live there in your undergraduate years?  I lived there undergraduate on the fourth floor, and then when we did the  master   s we had that wing.  What was that like, and did you have a roommate the whole time in      Yes. My roommate at undergraduate  was  my very best friend, I  roomed with her that year. I roomed with my cousin first and she went  home, she didn   t stay. Then I had Rosemary for a roommate and then     she went to New Mexico to school, she and her sister   and they came  back and by that time I   d moved to Stout and I roomed with her sister  during that time.  So tell us a little bit about what dorm life was like.  Well, dorm life was like we had to be in at 8:00 (Laughs)    til we got to  be juniors, and then we got to stay out till 10:00 and on weekends we got  to stay out sometimes till 12:00. I think it was 12:00 we got to stay out  and that house mother at Willard certainly did not like for us to be late  and have to come and unlock the door. They locked the doors and we  had to ring the bell to get in. On Sundays   and I don   t know how often  it was   everyone had to have a black crepe dress. We had to dress up in  8  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  our dress and wear gloves and go to tea. We could not cover our hair if  we had hair on rollers when we went to meals. They wouldn   t let us  wear a    rag    on our head. We had to dress to go downstairs to eat,  except it seems like Sunday night, they let us wear blue jeans.  The women, you wore dresses probably to classes      We wore skirts. They were just about this wide, and we had to walk like  this. Our skirts were eight inches from the ground, and they were just  pencil thin, and white anklets and saddle oxfords or penny loafers. When  we were freshman, we had to buy two things   a beanie and a cow bell.  And we had to say every time the upperclassmen saw us with your  beanie,    What do you say freshman?    We had to say,    Beat OU.     (Laughter)  And what happened if you didn   t say that?  I don   t know. I never did not say it. (Laughter)  Oh, that   s cute. What happened to your beanie? Do you still have it?  No, and I don   t even have my cow bell. I don   t know what I did with  them  (Laughter)  So you had house mothers?  Yes.  And were those mostly widowed women?  Older women   they were probably 45. (Laughter)  And you said you all ate together, and that means breakfast, lunch and  dinner?  We all ate in the cafeteria and we learned to eat all kinds of food because  there were not going to be any more  meals  in between.  What was the food service like?  I think it was good food. One thing that I really did like were the corn  fritters.  So let   s say a typical breakfast   you got down there probably by 6:30-  7:00 and they had a full breakfast for you?  9  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Yes.  Really?  Yes, they did   a hot breakfast, a hot lunch, a hot supper.  What about the weekends?  It was cooked food. It wasn   t microwave, instant.  Yeah. What were the weekends like? Did they cook on the weekends  also?  Well, they did. Now I don   t think we had three meals on weekends. I  don   t remember. Sundays were always so dead. I always wondered  where everybody was. I don   t know what happened to people on  Sunday.  So what did you do to eat on Sundays or during the weekend?  Okay, Sunday   I don   t remember eating on Sunday  (Laughs)  You didn   t eat?  Yes I did.  Did you go to your room and eat?  Yes, I do remember eating on Sunday. Since I was in Rodeo Club, the  boys went to the arena and practiced their roping and we all went out  there. The girls   what we did was goat tying and wild cow milking.  Somebody brought us Angora goats   and if you   ve ever smelled an  angora goat (Laughter)     and we wrestled around with those. We   d ride  the horse down there and jump off and flank that goat down and tie him  up. Then after we got through doing that, we   d go to Louie   s Club 40. It  was out on the road to Boomer. He did barbeque, and we ate a barbeque  sandwich and went downtown to the Leachman to the show. When we  went in, people would get up and move. They wouldn   t sit by us because  of the goat smell. (Laughter) We did that every Sunday.  I interviewed some of the Rodeo Club   or participated in an interview  with some of the Rodeo Club men and they were just some of the funnest  guys, to hear their stories, and I think what was sad was the university  didn   t sponsor that, that everything they paid for was pretty much out of  their own pockets     10  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Yes. Yes, it was.     and they had to haul their horses behind their cars.  Yes.  I mean, it was incredible what they went through just to      And they had a woman in Duncan that made them little vests one time  so they could tell they all belonged to one club. But that Rodeo Club was  just like a family. It was just really a close-knit bunch.  You could tell that by interviewing the men that we did. Well they never  mentioned the women. (Laughs) I don   t remember them mentioning you  all.  Clem McSpadden was our president when we joined, and there were two  girls that got to join, and then there were more girls that came in. If we  wanted to visit with the cowboys, we went to Brooks. Brooks was across  from where the Hideaway is now, upstairs, and they had a dance floor.  My cowboy and I, we danced every night. It was like    Dancing with the  Stars.    They   d get off of the dance floor and just let us do our routine.  (Laughs)  Oh, that   s marvelous. Well, so you didn   t have a horse though up here?  No, I didn   t have a horse. The guys let us ride theirs. I had a friend  whose daddy was an old calf roper, and he   d bring a horse up for us to  ride when we had Block and Bridle Rodeo and this sort of thing. I blew  out of the saddle carrying the flag. Broke my tail bone, separated my  ribs, but I stayed on my horse.  Oh, my gosh. Now that is interesting   Rodeo Club. That is wonderful.  So did you ever travel out of town like the men did to go to some of these  rodeos out of town that they had to go to?  My roommate whom I told you I had at Willard made friends with these  two cowboys and we were so nice to them all year so they   d take us to  Guthrie to the rodeo. We were coming across Washington going back to  Willard, and there they rode by   just went on to Guthrie and didn   t take  us  (Laughs) But we did go to Tulsa to the rodeo one time, I don   t know  how we got over there. Everybody didn   t have a car then, but we rode  back with John Zink. Do you know who John Zink is?  We also went to  the Hardin-Simmons Rodeo and Canyon, Texas as well as Cameron.   Yes ma   am, I do.  11  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Race car driver.  Yes. How did you hook up with John Zink? (Laughs)  I don   t know. (Laughter) I don   t know.  Oh, my gosh, yes. Oh, wow.  And then every month Leon McAuliffe came to the Armory for a dance.  It didn   t make any difference if you went to everything for that whole  month, if you didn   t go to the Leon dance, you were out of it  (Laughs)  Now tell us a little bit more about that.  Well, he had that western swing band     Okay. His name again was     Leon McAuliffe. He played for Bob Wills first and then he had his own  band. The Cain   s Ballroom in Tulsa was where he did his regular  playing, but he came over here once a month. They always played  something and we did square dancing with those wild Osage boys.  The Drummonds   did you hang out with the Drummonds? Oh, wow.  What was your room like in the dorm? Did you have bunk beds?  Oh, the first year we had steel bunk beds   four   two bunk beds, four  girls in one corner room, one lavatory, and I don   t remember if we had  two desks   we probably had two desks   and the bathroom was down  the hall. One closet, and every one of us had cancan petticoats. But I  don   t know how we ever got those clothes in our closet. We probably  never did hang them up  (Laughter) That was the corner room at  Murray, and that was the room that the boys always picked to crawl in  the window for panty raids. (Laughter)  So what about laundry? Did they have laundry facilities there?  They did, but you know my little grandmother went down when I came  to college and she bought one of these little bags, these little suitcases  that you mail your laundry in, and she said,    Now you just mail me your  clothes when you need clean clothes.    I mailed my clothes to her all the  way to Temple, Oklahoma and she mailed them back to me.  Oh, my gosh.  And I never did know why I did that except she told me to. (Laughs)  12  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  I   ve never heard of such a thing. Well you didn   t have air conditioning  back then. How did you all manage? You had fans? Or did you have air  conditioning back then?  Oh golly, I don   t even remember, but I   m sure we just opened the  windows.  Now Willard was right on campus when you lived there. Was that really  convenient for you to     Well, it was more convenient than Stout.  What dorms do you remember at that time? There was Willard and  Stout     We had Murray, Stout and Willard and North Murray.  And there was a designated dorm just for the women and for the men?  Oh, the men   all of the football players lived in Hanner and that was  right by Q-20, and when we went over to do our political science  reading we got to see the football players. (Laughs) They weren   t at the  library.  You   ve told me some good stories, but is there one particular memory  about living in the dorm that you can tell me that really stands out? You  talked about panty raids. What were those? And what were they like?  Well, I don   t know. Those boys just come screaming through there and  the girls screaming, tickled to death that they were in there. (Laughs)  The thing I remember most about dorm life was our one telephone in the  hall, and somebody hollering all the time when you got a telephone call.  And then, of course no men were allowed up above the bottom floor, the  living room, and then if you brought your dad up or anybody, you had to  stand there and scream    man on the floor    so everybody could run.  (Laughter)  Did anyone ever sneak out? I   m just curious.  If they did, I didn   t know it.  That probably wasn   t the thing to do. So what did you do for a social  life? I mean, it sounds like you were pretty busy with the dorm and     where was the place to go? You mentioned the one     Okay. We went to Brooks to dance and see the cowboys. We went to  13  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Swim   s to drink coffee and cokes and see the football players. We went  to the Frat Shop when we wanted to fraternize, and then I said we went  to Louie   s Club 40 on Sunday and then on Saturday night we went to the  Rock Castle Inn. The Rock was someplace down by the fairgrounds, and  I   m sure it   s not still there.  Was it a building or a   okay, and that   s where they   d have a band?  It was a nightclub, I guess.  Now I   ve heard of the White Barn. Do you ever remember anything  called the White Barn?  No. No, I don   t remember the White Barn. I wasn   t even here when  George   s Bar or Stables   George   s Stable   my son came up here in  1980. He said,    George   s Stable wasn   t there when you        (Laughter)  Well that   s another question I forgot to ask you. Let   s back up here.  And we went to the movies a lot, but see we didn   t have cars. Every  place we went, we walked.  You walked? What was Washington Street like?  Oh, all the way through.  All the way through.  Of course, the Union wasn   t here in the middle of it.  But you could go down there and get a hot dog or a      Yeah.  Okay. So it was frequented quite a bit by the students, Washington Street  was?  Yeah.  Did you have any other family members   I   m backing up here   you  mentioned your son. Do you have any other family members that have  attended OSU besides     My son was up here 1980 to 1984, graduated in 1984, and my  granddaughter came last year, but she didn   t come back this year. She   s  home working for her dad and getting him organized. (Laughs) She   s  14  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  taking classes at Cameron, but she didn   t come back up. She had a bad  experience. Her sorority sisters partied too much for her and she didn   t.  She   d come home every weekend. They   d call her to come get them  when they couldn   t make it, and she just didn   t want to put up with it.  I understand. Well I   m sorry she had a bad experience, but your son     does he come back?  Yeah, he comes back for the ballgames and     For the ballgames and things? Well wonderful.  He was in Farmhouse  Fraternity  and I was so glad.  Oh, it   s a wonderful fraternity really.  I know.  Nice young men, believe me. So you weren   t involved in a sorority or  that was     No, I was not in a sorority. I went to high school in Stillwater, and my  two best friends and I were in sororities from the seventh grade all the  way through high school, and we made a pact not to join a sorority when  we got to college. I went through rush, but I didn   t pledge.  And your friends, they came to OSU too? Or Oklahoma A M?  They were Stillwater girls, too.  And they came here? Did they live in the same dorm with you?  No, they lived at home.  They lived at home.  Yeah, they lived at home   home schooled. (Laughter)  Did you have contact with some of the fraternity boys and sorority      Oh yeah, all the time   but I said of all those Sig Alph   s  Sigma Alpha  Epsilon or SAE  I went with, why didn   t I ever know T. Boone Pickens?  He graduated the same year I did. (Laughter) The year that we were  freshman, Sig Alph   s pledged 80 boys and they were just a lot of fun.  The Sigma Chi   s were a lot of fun, too, and the Sigma Nu   s just played  ping pong all the time. Yeah, you were not an outcast if you were not  15  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Greek.  Did you consider your   what they called GDI   s   did you flaunt it and  that kind of thing?  No.  No. So it wasn   t that big a deal?  It was just an all-inclusive   this was an all-inclusive place.  Oh, that   s wonderful. That   s good to hear. So when you did eat on  campus, you said you ate mostly in your dorm. Where did you like to eat  on campus? Was there the Student Union or     We had a place downtown, Smith   s.  Oh, okay. Yes.  Smith   s Caf  , and that   s about the only place I remember. Oh, I will tell  you one thing. In 1957, I was in my room and these girls came by and  they said,    Do you want to go with us to get pizza?    and I said,    What   s  pizza?    and that   s when they started the Hideaway over there on that  little off street in that little funny house. So we ate pizza at the Hideaway  in 1957 when they started.  Is it still the same?  It   s just as good as it ever was.  It was just like it was then, back then?  I think that   s what his wife said to him when he told her he was gonna  start a pizza place.    What   s pizza?    (Laughter)  Oh, that   s cute. Did you have many friends that lived off campus? You  said you had your two friends from Stillwater, but what about off  campus? Did a lot of people that lived in Stillwater live on      I don   t remember any of the people living in Stillwater. Now some of  them that pledged might have lived in the sorority houses, but I don   t  think any of them ever lived in the dorm.  Tell us a little bit about Homecoming back then, about the parades  and     16  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Oh, sitting on the front of a big old GMC truck with a saddle on the front  hollering, and the boys were on the back and they made a fire, a real  fire   I don   t know what they put it in   and had a little calf in there and  they   d throw him down and play like they were branding him, and they  had a horse up there. That was our Rodeo Club float and it was really a  neat one.  Well, were the floats elaborate back then like they are today?  They were not as commercial as they are today, but they had pretty  floats and they had pretty girls.  Did the dorms participate? Did Willard and Stout participate in these  Homecoming events?  I don   t remember the dorms having them. I   m sure they did, but I don   t  remember. We didn   t stay up all night for two weeks making house  decorations and all that.  What about the game itself? Did they have a big bonfire to prepare for it  or anything?  No.  No?  No, and I remember one time that we met the wrestlers when they came  back from the national tournament, and Coach Griffith said he didn   t  ever remember anyone else meeting them when they came back from  anything, but he said,    We have won      I forgot how many national  championships      and this is the first time the student body has ever met  us when we came back from the tournament.     Oh, that   s awesome.  So we didn   t get as fired up before the games as we did during the  games and rang our cow bells. I remember one time at the OU game and  Mr. Iba was coaching and Bruce Drake was coaching OU, and we were  ringing our cow bells and Bruce Drake went over and took the  microphone and he said,    Would you people quit ringing those cow  bells? It   s bothering my players.    Well, my goodness. That was the  wrong thing to say  (Laughter)  Ring them harder  Well speaking of Mr. Iba, were you able to meet Mr.  Iba while you were here on campus or did you have a class with him or  under him?  17  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  No, never did personally meet him, but I know that he made those boys  run those stairs all the time. I knew a lot of the basketball players. See  they were in education, and we would have these little kid classes  together and they would do the folk dances and all that stuff, these big  old tall six foot three, four boys doing these little folk dances and  everything. But he was a good man.  Is there a particular professor that you remember that sticks out in your  mind that perhaps had the most influence on you as a person?  Well, Ida T. Smith and Dr. Schwartz and   let   s see, who else? You  know I really don   t remember very many of my professors. Dr.  Reynolds, I remember him. I don   t remember anything he ever taught  us, but I remember we got an    A.    (Laughs) I can   t think of any, but I  told you that when I got my master   s what he said about the elementary  teachers   but I can   t remember his name. I remember one teacher in  that class that was a basket case during that time, and he stood at the  podium and he put his foot and there wasn   t a thing across the bottom  and he kept putting his foot   he was wiggling all the time   and I  remember one thing he told us. We had gotten into some mode of  education, and he said,    Here we go again. If the kids in lower Slobovia  can do more one-arm push-ups than we do, then we legislate one-arm  push-ups for the next 10 years.    I was up here when Sputnik happened,  getting a master   s.  Tell us a little bit about that.  I remember going in the Union and they were talking about the Russians  had blasted off into space, and that changed so many things in our  country   that one event.  What was the mood on campus when that happened? Was it in awe or  were they kind of scared?  Oh yes.  That was the time when the Cold War was     We   d been scared of the Russians forever, and they were such a big help  we couldn   t have won World War II without them. I don   t know how we  got on the other side of them, but anyway that was really a defining  moment in our national history     You remember that        and I remember that year. All the boys that I knew that year were  18  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  majoring in geology. I don   t know why we had so many geology majors.  T. Boone. (Laughs)  Well, that was after T. Boone.  Oh, it was?  This was in 1957. I don   t know where T. Boone was all that time. He  was sitting around trying to figure out how to make a billion dollars, and  I was over at the Frat Shop drinking coffee. (Laughter)  What other campus organizations were you involved in?  Other organizations   Rodeo Club was about the only thing that I really  was   I was a Varsity Review girl. I was a chorus girl. They had  representatives from each sorority and each dormitory to be the chorus  girls, and I was a chorus girl. I look at that picture and I think, how could  that be me? (Laughs)  Well what was Varsity Review? Tell us a little bit about Varsity Review.  Varsity Review   we had a fellow named Jimmy Baker who was our  director, and he must have been a music major or a drama major or  something, and he was a fun guy. He had a little bitty kid he brought  with him, and we just adored that little boy, and it was not any kind of a  production like it is now, but they did have the little skits and then the  Varsity Review girls. Jimmy Baker was killed I think in the Korean  War.  Now were you on campus when they changed the name from OAMC to  OSU?  Well, no. See they changed it   I don   t know what year they changed it,  but I got my master   s from OSU. I got my bachelor   s from A M and  my master   s from OSU, and I don   t remember what year they changed  it. I really think that it was the year after I graduated. I think it was in  1952 when they changed it.  So you don   t remember much about it or how the campus was feeling at  that time?  I just got a letter and asking if I wanted to change my diploma to OSU.  What activities did you do for fun with your friends   like let   s say you  came back from the dorm   you came back from classes and you got to  19  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  the dorms, what did you all like to do in the evenings? Did you watch  TV?  We didn   t have TV.  Did you have radio in your rooms?  I   m sure we did because I would stay up all night listening to the  election returns when   was it Jimmy Carter? No.  Truman?  Truman   when Truman won his election  in 1952  and they   d already  given it to the other guy.  Dewey? They thought Dewey was going to win and it was Truman?  Yeah. I don   t remember whether I was old enough to vote. See you had  to be 21. I don   t remember that I was old enough to vote then or not, but  I do remember   so I must have had a radio. Oh, we had record players.  So you would sit around and listen to records? Who did you like to listen  to?  Of course, Bob Wills and   no, I tell you, I liked Jimmy Dorsey and  Artie Shaw and that bunch. And we went out to Yost Lake. They had a  pavilion, a dance floor out over the lake.  Really?  And we danced miles and miles to    String of Pearls    and    One O   clock  Jump,    and then we went through all those war songs. Of course in 1947  the war hadn   t been over but two years.  So were there a lot of men on campus that were on the GI Bill at that  time when you were here?  Oh my, yes, and those guys were tough to compete with when you grade  on a curve. They were serious. So when the war in Germany was over, I  was in high school, and we en masse walked down to the Methodist  church and went to church that day. When Japan was over, it was in the  summertime and I don   t know how we got there, but we all went to  Perry. Why did we go to Perry? (Laughter) And had a rally on the  square.  Yes.  20  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Because they have a courthouse square there, and so anyway I remember  doing that.  Can you tell me a little bit about dating? What was dating like back  then? It was a more formal affair? Girls didn   t call boys? You received  an invitation   you only had one phone, so that was a little tough. If you  only had one phone in the hall, how did they get through?  I don   t know how we ever got our dates. We must have made them in  advance or something because that one phone in the hall      Was pretty tied up I would imagine?  Yes, but I guess   it seems like every organization and fraternity had  those special dances, Frontier Ball   we all went, and it really didn   t  make any difference whether we were with a date or not. We were  always with somebody. Everybody saw that everybody got there. It was  just   we were just that kind of a group.  You didn   t have a car. Did you own a car while you were here?  I did when I had my master   s.  What was the student body like? Did you have many international  students that we talked about?  There were numerous students from India.  But that was when your master   s? What about Native Americans? Did  you have any Native Americans in your classes or Afro-Americans?  I   m sure we did. Now we   ve had no African-American athletes. Even  when I got my master   s, we didn   t have   and this is a bad story about  breaking Johnny Bright   s jaw. I was an undergraduate then. Wilbanks   Smith  hit him, and I saw him hit him  October 21, 1951 OAMC vs.  Drake , but he went to school at Drake, and he was the only black one  we ever saw on our football field.  And you were there at the game when that happened?  I was there at the game when that happened.  What was the crowd   s reaction?  I don   t remember that, but it was really   Wilbanks was a big old boy  and we didn   t have very many big old boys. I remember Bill Grimes  21  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  came up here to school. He was 6   1, I think, and he weighed 195 pounds  and we thought we had the living monster. (Laughter)  What are your memories of   and I want to give you four places, so you  can visit each one of them   the Library, let   s start with the Library.  What are your memories of the Library?  I remember when they dug the hole for the Library, and I remember that  we had to go to Quonset 20 for our readings. I don   t remember where  the old Library was, but it was somewhere around here. We had to go to  Q-20 for our political science reading, and then I remember when I got  my master   s   that they had cubicles on the fourth floor for the master   s  candidates and all of our books that we were doing research were on  reserve so we couldn   t take them out of the Library, but we could take  them up to our little cubicle and go back and we studied up there. So that  was a long way from Q-20 to a cubicle.  My dad was so impressed with  the library that he asked me if I wanted to get my Ph.D.    So did you go up there very often? I mean does Q-20      Oh yes, we had to go   we   d have how many   we had to have all these  readings for political science and I can   t remember   we just went over  there. Now where was that Q-20? Over there behind the old gym. The  old gym which is not there anymore. Over that way someplace.  What about the Student Union? Can you tell me what you remember  about the Student Union?  I saw them dig the hole for the Student Union, too, and then when I  came back for my master   s the Student Union was there. That   s where  we went between classes all the time and drank coffee. We had one  fellow in there from Duncan, and he said,    I can   t make any friends  because every time I sit down in here everybody from Duncan comes  and sits down with me.    (Laughs)  Well wasn   t there a place called the Sugar Shack? The Sugar Hut?  Now there was the Y-Hut.  The Y-Hut.  Yes. Ralph had the Y-Hut and Ralph was blind.  Yes. Yes.  It was right in the middle of the campus. He had the Y-Hut and he had  22  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  snacks and cokes.  Did you frequent there?  Yes, we went there. My momma went there, too.  Tell me about Theta Pond. Memories about Theta Pond?  They dug Theta Pond   it has a rubber bottom. (Laughs)  It   s not rock?  It   s what everybody said.  It was rubber?  I remember one time we had a motorcycle cop we called    Cycling Sam     and he wore these mirror glasses. I think he gave everybody on campus  a ticket  Anyway they had little ducks on the pond. Someone had  evidently been to Florida or Louisiana and brought back an alligator, a  baby alligator, and they passed that up and down University from  sorority to fraternity to sorority to fraternity    til it got too big to live in  the bathtub, and they put it in Theta Pond. Well when spring came, they  put the little ducks in there and the alligator ate the legs off the little  ducks. (Laughter) We named that alligator    Cycling Sam    after that cop.  They named it what again?  Named it    Cycling Sam.    And then of course they threw the boys in  when they got pinned or   now they didn   t throw the girls in, but they  threw the boys in     When they got pinned? I remember that. What about Old Central?  Old Central?  Did you have classes in Old Central?  Yes, and I had a speech class in there. It was supposed to be an  impromptu speech, and I was standing up there with it memorized and  just going on like this and all of a sudden this    bang    and I thought Old  Central had fallen down around me. The professor had gotten up and  picked up a chair and threw it in the floor to get me out of my trance,  and I never did remember another word of that speech   Of all the places on campus, is there one in particular that is special to  23  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  you?  I don   t know that   you know every place up here is special to me. This  is just a special place. Those were the best years ever of my life when I  was on this campus, and the things that I did, it was just   I must have  had some time to study because I graduated. (Laughter) I graduated in  the four prescribed years and got my master   s in one year. So evidently I  went to class.  Well speaking about this train of thought that you   re on, what is it about  Oklahoma State that sparks such loyalty in students and their alumni?  What is it?  The people.  The people? And what is it about the people?  The people are so all-inclusive. They   re just different people and I don   t  know, it   s just that   they just bleed orange.  Do you come back for Homecoming every year or most of the time?  No. The first year I came back for Homecoming, the boys that played  football when I was up here had their fifth anniversary   it was either  fifth or tenth   and I was so sad when I saw that they were bald-headed,  fat, big bellies (laughs) and I thought,    I don   t want them to look like  that.    (Laughter) No, I haven   t been up for Homecoming, but oh, maybe  a dozen times since I got out of school.  Have you kept in touch with your friends that you made here, any of the  women that you went to school with?  Do you know that my friends that I had up here are almost all gone?  But during your lifetime, did you keep in touch?  Oh yeah.  That   s neat. Do you think part of that bond is because of what you had  here at OSU?  Yes. Yes.  That   s really neat. What advice would you give to students today as far  as coming to OSU or being a student on campus?  24  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Well the same thing I gave my son when he came up here. I said,    It   s  threefold. It   s social, it   s academic      and I don   t remember what the  third one was now   but it was forming friends and you just form friends  for life. You are required to do some academics, and you do get some  social graces, and I think those are three ultimate things that kids need.  Is there anything that you would like to add that we have not covered  today?  Let me see if I   ve got down here anything. I think we   ve just got this  split right down my list. Back to the athletics, our athletic tickets were  odd and even and we never did all get to go to the basketball games at  the same time. Let   s see, the Pistol Petes   you   ve just done everything.  So when the games were out of town, were you able to attend any of the  games?  Well, we didn   t have any way to get there. They hadn   t manufactured  any cars up until just before we started to college, and the gasoline had  been rationed. Tires had been rationed. They had to revamp the world  when they got through with that war.  Now I   m kind of curious about this Rodeo Club. Let   s revisit that with  you again.  Okay.  How did you get involved with the Rodeo Club? Was that because it  wasn   t a campus organization, so you knew somebody in there     Well and if you have a background with animals and country life, you  are attracted.  Did you have a background?  Yes. My dad was a rancher and we raised horses and cows.  Here in Stillwater, around this area?  No, in Cotton County, before I came up here to school and so I guess  that was the reason. And then of course the year after I joined, I got a  boyfriend in there so that was a better reason, and so that is   I guess  that   s why we decided. I don   t even know how they decided that we  were going to  have  two girls, we didn   t have a march or anything. We  didn   t boycott them or we didn   t go to the attorney general and holler     unfair.     25  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Were the cowboys on campus different from   I should say the Ag boys     were they different than the boys that were GIs?  Well, I don   t even know that all those boys were in Ag because we had  it all figured out before Sam Bratcher and the Patton boys came because,  like I said, if you wanted to go with the cowboys you went to Brooks. If  you wanted the football players, you went to Swim   s. Well Sam  Bratcher played football and he was a cowboy, too, and so were the  Patton brothers. So they just fouled us up. (Laughter) No, they were  mostly ranch-related people and the thing about it was a lot of those  guys came from very wealthy families but you never knew it. One of  them had a Dynaflo Buick and that should have let us know something  (Laughs) and the boy that I dated that were in Rodeo Club had a little  old Pontiac Coupe, and I don   t think we ever went any place by  ourselves. There were always about 10 people stuffed in that little car  because we couldn   t go any place but we went to an out-of-town rodeo  one time with the team, went to Abilene, Texas and my daddy hardly  ever went to the picture show. He went this time and they showed the  news reel and there I was sitting up on the chute gate. (Laughter) But  you know I never did do anything that he didn   t find out about.  Did your parents visit you on campus while you were here?  Oh, yeah. Like I said, Daddy was so impressed with the library. He said,     Don   t you want to stay and get your doctorate?     And you   ve taught school with your degrees?  Thirty-nine and a half years.  In what?  All elementary. See I had an English major, and I didn   t know you were  supposed to get a job when you got out of college. (Laughter) What did  they expect of me? So Mother said,    You have got to quit telling people  you don   t know what you want to do. They   re gonna think you   re  stupid.    So I called the placement office and they told me that they  needed an English teacher at Pryor. This was the week before school  started. So I called Pryor and he said,    I hired an English teacher  yesterday,    and he said,    but Dr. Martin at Nowata needs a fifth-grade  teacher,    and I said,    Oh, I can   t teach fifth grade.       Anybody can teach  fifth grade.    (Laughs) So that was the Saturday before school started on  Tuesday, and we went to Nowata and I fell in love with those little fifth-grade  kids and I never did get out of elementary and never did get any  smarter than fifth grade. There are four boys that were in that class that  e-mail me all the time and they invited me back to their 35th high school  26  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  Ahrberg  Robertson  reunion, and 12 of them were there, and I recognized every one of those  kids   that was an ego trip. Oh that was a good trip.  Now they are  having their 50th high school reunion in October 2009 and I am invited    That   s wonderful. So when you come up to OSU for Homecoming, what  do you like to do now? Do you visit any of the old places that you      I always drive around, and I try to find the old places. I brought my little  granddaughter who   s 12 now, I brought her for Grandparent University  three years, and that was a lot of fun and my oldest granddaughter was in  Spring Sing and something else last year   we came twice   we came up  for those performances. Last time I was at Homecoming I had to stay in  Perry. Couldn   t get a room in Stillwater.  We   ve built some more hotels since then.  I saw those coming in.  Do you have anything else to add then?  I don   t have anything else to add.  Well I want to thank you very much for coming. I certainly have enjoyed  visiting with you and hearing your O-STATE Stories. It   s just been  marvelous, really enjoyed it. And I   m so glad to meet you.  I think I   m supposed to get another 50-year pin. I think they   re gonna  give me one for my master   s. Now that I have two 50 year pins, does  that mean I went to school here 100 years?   Well thank you for coming.  It was a lot of fun.  -------  -------
