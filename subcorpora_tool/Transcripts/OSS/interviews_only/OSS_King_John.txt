 Paustenbaugh and it is Friday, October 31, 2008. We  are here in the Dean   s Conference Room in the OSU Library. I am with  Dr. John King, who is a distinguished alumnus of the College of  Veterinary Medicine. I am also joined today by Dr. Sidney Ewing, an  emeritus faculty member in the College of Veterinary Medicine, and  Heather Moberly, the Veterinary Medicine librarian, who are here to  assist me with this interview.  Dr. King, thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule  at this conference to join us today for this interview. I know that you  were a graduate in 1955, and while most of our interview is going to  focus on your time as a student here at OAMC and then your subsequent  career, could you tell us a little bit about your family background, where  you grew up, and any other information you   d like to share about your  pre-OAMC days?  I am honored that you are taking this information and that you think I   m  worthy of it. Thank you very much. I was raised in Massachusetts and I  don   t remember much of my really young life. But when I was seven, I  was sent to a boy   s school because my folks had split up and I had no  place to go. I had three older sisters, they went with the three aunts that  we had, but I had to go someplace. So I went to this school for ten years.  I saw my mother twice a year. And to this day, I thought it was  wonderful and I had a good time there. I   ve had a good time most  everywhere in my life. At that boys school, it was a farm school, you did  all the jobs that you   d do at a farm, all the crops, all the harvesting,  everything like this. And it was very worthwhile.  Then I had four years of the Army and those four years were a blessing  because I got in the paratroopers. I made 50 bucks extra a month, that  was fine. But the 48 months that I had in the Army, in the Service, the  four years gave me 48 months of education under the G.I. Bill. And  5  Paustenbaugh  King  that   s what I used primarily for the vet school. The pre-vet work I did in  Delaware a little bit and I worked, and my wife was working. I got  married in 1947 while I was still in the Service, and she kind of put me  through the University of Delaware because I didn   t want to use the G.I.  Bill until I got into vet school.  Your kind Dean McElroy out here at the Veterinary School, he was a  classmate of the Dean of Professional Students, those who wanted to go  on to professional schools, he was a classmate of that Dean. And so I  wrote to Oklahoma to get into vet school because Cornell wouldn   t take  me. They had just one from Delaware and Pennsylvania a year to go to  Cornell. So he wrote to the Dean and to me, and said that,    If you want  to come to Oklahoma, why don   t you keep up your good grades, even  come to Oklahoma, and possibly apply from Oklahoma?    I did that. I  had a wonderful time doing it. I met the best man at my wedding, his  family lived here in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma and it made a very good  place for me to go on weekends to their little ranch. I incidentally picked  up lots of Indian arrowheads on their property. That was nice.  When I got out here and met Dr. McElroy I had an interview here at the  veterinary school and I made it. I think I made it mostly because I was a  paratrooper in the Army and one of the faculty here was a paratrooper in  the war. I was in the Army before the atom bomb went off, but I didn   t  get into any fighting. I had a good time in the Army too because I knew  they couldn   t shoot me, I was too fast, I was too young. So you can   t  shoot young men. Maybe the guy next to me, but not me. But anyhow I  didn   t have any problem with that, getting into vet school. Well I had a  little problem   physics was a son of a gun. We had to take physics to  get in in those days, and that was   I was not that smart. I had a good  memory, but I was not that smart as a student. I had to work   every  grade I got, I had to work for. I didn   t get anything easily.  When I finished after five years here at Oklahoma A M College, I think  it   s nice that it   s changed in a way, but either way I was very proud. Our  son was born here at the hospital, the older hospital in Stillwater. All in  all a wonderful time in the vet school. Of course there was a little  animosity somewhere along the line because every damn Yankee they  accepted into the veterinary school kept out an Okie. And that wasn   t  looked at too nicely. But it happened and I was just so proud to get in.  So were there any specific incidences along those lines that you recall?  Yeah. I wasn   t the best cowboy in the class, but close to it because I  would run horses around in the paddock that were all the ponies that the  university bought for use, and I would get out there with the ponies and  ride them bareback. But the only way I could get on was to get them  6  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  running, then I could swing up on them, hang in their mane. But doing  that, and there   s eight, ten, fifteen ponies, I would swing sometimes too  far and fall over on the other side between all these horse   s legs. But it   s  interesting, the horses will not step on you if you   re soft because they  think it   s a hole and they might break their leg. At least that   s what I was  told, and it worked out that way. So that was one of my better thoughts.  The football games were wonderful. I was disappointed that Oklahoma  A M didn   t beat OU, but that was part of life.  When you lived here, did you live in Vet Village?  Oh, yes. I think they had a Vet Village, or they just, no it had to be there,  because there were Army barracks. But the one we lived in was the  south one, at least the one that was between the veterinary school and  the main campus. Not the one up at the end of Knoblock. I didn   t get to  live up there. We were in the Army barracks between the vet school and  the regular campus.  So I take it your quarters at that time were pretty spartan?  They were wonderful. They were Army barracks, but they were  wonderful. I have no complaint on that kind of stuff. Actually it was  better because the buildings were being demolished slowly and I think  after we left they didn   t last very long, at least the ones down here, not  up on vet village. We were able to do what we wanted in those buildings  pretty much. I had a dog and I had a hole in the wall. I could let the dog  out without going downstairs to let her out. She went out on her own and  came back. So things like that. We had a good time.  So you came to Oklahoma from Massachusetts via Delaware. What was  your impression when you first got to Stillwater?  Oh my goodness, we   re a long way from civilization  When we got out  here, driving from wherever we drove, we went to Broken Arrow quite a  few weekends, because that family had a lot of eggs and vegetables and  things like that that they gave us. And the G.I. Bill of  105, I think it  might have been  10 more than that when I was married, but we  welcomed that kind of aid.  Sure.  And also I was welcomed by the fellow who was in charge of the large  animal clinic,  Dr. Woolf . He gave me a job in the library in the  veterinary school. It didn   t pay very much, but every nickel counted in  those days. He did it I think to help me, I   m not sure he needed it. But I  thought it was wonderful of them to do that.  7  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  Ewing  King  Paustenbaugh  King  What did this student job entail?  One or two hours a day I would go down to the library and either put the  books away or work with papers or file them. It wasn   t very much work.  Of course, as a veterinary student, we worked in cleaning the stables and  things like that  as part of the education . But I was an eager little beaver  and I think I learned a lot in veterinary medicine, but also in getting  along with people, I learned a lot.  Do you recall how many people were in your entering class?  Thirty-two.  Thirty-two. And that was about typical for that time, wasn   t it?  Yes, but we lost a lot of the students. I think we lost eight from our  class; maybe there were 40 that started. But we lost eight, now that was  an awful lot. But it made us prouder that we stayed in, the fewer that  stayed and...  These eight who were lost were academic casualties?  Yes. Some of it was intimidation in the sense that when you get in vet  school,    Oh boy, I finally made it into vet school     But you can   t be too  proud or you can   t be too happy with that because you haven   t passed  any exams. When you pass the first exam, well you can   t be too cocky  because you have to get through another course. And then you still can   t  feel free, that you have made it. And I think it   s four years of that that  many of us worried about. And we actually thought about it. But some  of the young people who are there, it scared them that they knew they  were going to have to work. It was very hard. And a couple of them I  actually know, they said,    We can   t keep doing this anymore, it   s just  too much    and they left the school. And they hadn   t even taken exams,  well maybe one or two, but it was just too much studying. But most of  us liked it. So it was just a few people.  You mentioned that to get into the vet school you had to take physics and  how difficult that was for you. Your first year, what was your most  difficult class?  It was well organized. We knew what we had to do. I don   t remember  anything really that bugged me. When I went on for an advanced degree,  you had to pass German and it took me four or so years to study that just  a little bit each year until I finally passed. That was even worse. It was  worse than anything, worse than in Oklahoma.  8  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  Now I understand that June Iben was the first female veterinary  medicine student here and that she was a member of your class. Do you  recall her?  I recall her very well. Especially one day when we, this is a little bit  risqu  , but you have to do rectals on cows to see if they   re pregnant,  otherwise a cow without a calf, a dairy cow, you lose a couple months  money in milk production. So we would be doing a rectal on a cow or  something and one of the wise guys, maybe me, I don   t know, would  say,    Hey Iben, I got you by the ovaries     when we   re in there seeing if  they   re pregnant. She finally got tired of that and she lowered the boom  on the whole class. And most of us kind of smiled, but we respected her  for that. That was great. We   ve been friends ever since because she   s in  western Pennsylvania and I   m not too far above the border in New York.  We   ve helped her out a couple of times when she needed help. She had a  fabulous practice until she had a wreck on her motorcycle. But she   s still  practicing and working with big cats. That   s what she most has worked  with, big cats, lions, tigers, bobcats, you name it.  Interesting. Were there some professors that you especially remember  having very positive interactions with or who really influenced your  career?  Dr. Peterson was remarkable, even on the way out here for this trip, as I  drove across the fields, I remember the whole class going out on some  days with Peterson looking at and identifying poisonous plants. He was  wonderful like that. Dr. Friend helped him, but Dr. Friend was always  low-key. He helped Peterson, but he was low-key. Guys like   oh  I had  a big run in with Dr.  Newton  Tennille, because I was always doing  something a little bit different than most of my classmates   I don   t  know why. When I did that one time I took some radiopaque material  and I injected it into the aorta of a dog who had lost its leg. I wanted to  see where the vessel, the main vessel that I might have to work on when  I took the leg off surgically, I guess it was hurt somehow, and I wanted  to see where the vessel stopped so that I knew that if I could give it this  radiopaque material, take a radiograph every second or two, I could see  that. It worked fine, I was able to see it, it all worked fine.  But Dr. Tennille was out of town at the time, so I asked one of his  assistants if I could do all that. Yes, but Dr. Tennille gave me holy heck   on his return . And then at the end of the semester he gave me the  lowest grade you could give anybody without flunking them, because if  you flunked in those days, one class, you   re out. So he didn   t flunk me,  but I went in to ask him, I asked,    Why did you do that?    and he says,     Because your attitude needed a little bit of come-uppance.    Something  like that. I hated that at the moment  But ever since I wished I had  9  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  Ewing  King  listened to him a little bit more and paid attention. And even on the way  out here, of all the people, he made almost the biggest impression on me  for my life. Not for the education   well for the education. He was smart,  he was capable, he was a great big heavy man, but the best hands you  can imagine. If my bone was broken, I   d like him to fix it. But as it  turned out, even on this trip, 2008, I thought how wonderful he was to  try and help me. I wish I had kept my mouth shut.  The folly of youth, huh?  Yeah.  Early on in the college   s history, there weren   t really a lot of  opportunities for research, and yet there were some faculty who had an  appreciation for research. Can you talk about any of those people?  I had no interest, I   ve had no interest, except on the practical application  doing a necropsy   that   s an autopsy on an animal. I would rather do that  than worry about little nitty gritty things in research. Dr. Panciera, he  said he worked for 50 years doing what I   ve done all my life, and I still  like it, but he   s now into research himself with hepatozoa, a parasite in  dogs, and he   s absolutely on cloud nine doing that research, finding out  that it   s coyote fleas that are involved or it   s the egrets   I   m impressed  with his interest. I didn   t have that interest, I never had it. I liked to do  another autopsy and see why, or go to the farm. And that was the best  opportunity was to go to the farm at the end of the week or something,  whenever I had opportunity, to find out why that farmer had those  diseases that we autopsied during the week. I did the same in Australia, I  did the same in South Africa. They gave me the car, they gave me the  permission, they gave me the gas. It was wonderful to do these things.  But that   s an applied basis. I didn   t want to do research. And I didn   t  know anybody who really did anything in those days, they probably  were, but that   s my ignorance, not their fault.  You did know about Dr. Krull working at Cornell in the summer time     Well he was probably the most renowned individual I knew at the  veterinary school, but I didn   t know what he did. He came back one year  after he had discovered the dicocoeleum, the liver fluke, and he talked  about it but   you know I already said that Peterson was one of the best  practical teachers, but I think Krull would be the best scientific teacher  that I had. He was fantastic. He was nice about it. He was the one who  gave us most pop quizzes. At the top of the paper it might say    Pop      It   s a pop quiz. I misspelled    scissors    on one of those darn things  He  was wonderful. I knew him a little, I knew where he worked at Cornell  and in the creek behind my house when working on that. I went to a  10  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  farm subsequent to that where he did his original research with the liver  flukes. Very good. Probably I wouldn   t know of a better researcher in  veterinary medicine than Krull and I   m glad I knew him when he was  here.  So given the fact that you said you weren   t really all that interested in  research, what was it that lead you to Cornell to pursue a Ph.D.?  In order to get a Ph.D. you have to have  a research project  at Cornell  you don   t have to have residence credits for classes you take, you have  to have a finished thesis signed by your major and minor professors.  When I got to Cornell there was a whole bunch of dogs that were dying  with Hepatitis X. Nobody knew what it was, but it turned out to be  aflotoxin in peanut meal, spoiled peanut meal. I had six bags of ground  raw ingredients that I could use with dogs and it was a nice research  project, I learned more in that research project than   I learned one heck  of a lot. But it wasn   t something I was going to do the rest of my life,  just work on research projects.  I would go to farms where they lost an animal or had a foal that   s got a  broken leg. They said the mare kicked the foal   well sure, mares might  kick the foal, but most of the cases over 50 years I   ve found that the  animals had soft bones. That   s why they broke, the mare might have  kicked it, and then I   d do the autopsy, I   d find a rachitic rosary, that   s  the enlarged ribs junction, and I would say, well I made the diagnosis.  This is rickets, but it   s not due to a vitamin D deficiency, it   s the vitamin  A that   s really at fault, because vitamin A is anti-vitamin D. I don   t  know if the rest of the world knows that now, but it honestly is to my  mind, and I did it on each  different  case as it came into the post-mortem  room.  That   s a kind of applied research. I   d try to reproduce it by giving them  this diet. I did a little bit in pigs   oh  Incidentally I forgot, I worked  with rats for six years at Carnegie Mellon University and I did have time  to do some of these research projects and I enjoyed that too. But I   ve  enjoyed everything I   ve done. I would rather do autopsies and not basic  research.  And I understand that you have a website that is utilized very heavily by  veterinary medicine     Thank you for your librarian here.  Yeah she   s great.  Over the years I probably would spend two hours a day taking,  11  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  sometimes longer, but average, no at least an hour a day taking  Kodachromes of every  good  specimen that I autopsied. I would do it  on the whole carcass or I would do it when it was partially opened or the  individual lesion. And the slides were all marked in a very specific  fashion so I could find almost any slide, or Kodachrome 2x2, in ten,  fifteen seconds from the whole collection. And there   s 50,000 of them in  the collection. Now they   re not 50,000 diseases that I   ve worked on, but  one time I would do this heart lesion and    gee it   s a great lesion,    I   d  take a picture of it, but it   s only on the inside of the heart. Then the next  time, the next case, well most of it would be on the outside of the heart, I  could see the muscle lesion so I   d take a picture of that. Many of the  students wanted pictures for their senior seminars that every one of them  had to give. So I took a lot of pictures.  When I went to the farms for any problem, pigs, horses, or cows, I   d  usually take a picture to show all these calves, they   re not gaining any  weight, we don   t know why, what   s the problem. You go there and in  New York, it   s cold and the barn walls are wet. They   re lying on wet  bedding. And if you want to get cold, just get wet and let it evaporate  and you   ll get cold. These calves didn   t get enough to eat and they   d all  be starving. But the farmer didn   t want to believe it. The clinicians  didn   t know about it really. That was my job as a little applied research  to this necropsy case. So I would do those things.  You almost sound like a veterinary CSI type of person.  Well I did enough of them that it was very interesting. And it helped the  veterinarian, it helped the owner and I would take pictures of all these,  so here they are.  And what is the website called?  Well, it   s necropsy, it   s got a big long thing,  http://W3.vet.cornell.edu/hst. I don   t use it very often,  like my own  phone number   (Laughs)  I heard it was called Dr. King   s Necropsy Show and Tell.  Yeah, at Cornell when I got there, at the end of every week we would  have show and tell. Sometimes we   d have it twice a week we   d have so  many specimens. And I would just stand there and discuss what I found   for only an hour . Another good thing about that, from Cornell I would  carry once a year for a week, I would take four, five, or six graduate  students, foreigners or vet students, usually graduate students in  pathology, and we   d go down to all the veterinary schools on the East  coast. And not only vet schools, the Animal Medical Center in New  12  Paustenbaugh  King  York where Dr. Krull was for awhile, and then Pennsylvania, then  Virgina, North Carolina, Georgia, Georgia Veterinary School in  Tifton ,Georgia  and Gainesville, Florida. We   d take a week to do that.  And I would take hundreds of specimens in Klotz solutions that kept the  color, kept them soft, and I would show them at each one of these places  for two or three hours in the morning and then drive like heck to the next  place. It worked out pretty good. All these lesions I would discuss, but  every now and then they would save specimens for me, trying to test me  because I would bring out my specimens and I would have a couple  hundred of them, and they would bring out 25 or 30 to show me, to quiz  me. And that worked, it was very nice for both of us.  Actually I   m going to do that in Baton Rouge in December this year, the  same thing. They say,    Well you know we   re saving a lot of specimens  for you.    And they   re going to see if I know them, because I don   t use  histories usually. If I get a carcass I open it up, make the diagnosis if  possible, and everything I find should fit the history because that   s  where it came from. But I don   t want to know the history first because  I   d be prejudiced. And sometimes you might take a shortcut knowing  what they found, I don   t want to know that. I   ve done that all my life,  I   ve enjoyed that. Roger Panciera does that a little bit here also. I don   t  know how much he does, but I   m sure he does it too.  Anyhow, we started at Cornell with a wheelbarrow. I   d go to Fox   s and  Roberts    and Kirk   s class with a wheelbarrow of stuff. Then after awhile  I got to a stainless steel push cart, and then after awhile we get to this  Necropsy Show and Tell on Friday afternoons at 4:30 every day, well  sometimes every day, but almost always on a Friday, save all the stuff.  So it seems like doing an autopsy or a necropsy, I mean there   s a lot of  art involved in that. How did you learn that art?  Well, Dr. Peter Olafson was a grand old man in pathology and he used  to do something like that. And then Roger  Panciera  did it because he  got his Ph.D. there. When I got there a couple years later, I learned from  Roger and Olafson and then I developed my own way in some of the  techniques. Because you don   t have time to waste in trying to open  something. So you open a gall bladder. It doesn   t take me long to do the  gall bladder. But I open it onto the white surface and if there   s any,  flukes floating in the bile, I   m going to see the flukes in that bile with a  white background. And so you do that just automatically in every  autopsy. In every animal  with a gall bladder  you break the rib against  the curvature, that   s easy. When it   s once broken, you can cut the  costochondral junction to hunt for a very specific lesion that   s not well  described anywhere because people don   t do it.  13  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  So I try to teach a single technique, it  sometimes  takes me four hours  to do a   no, I can do a horse in an hour. That means taking out the brain  also, if there   s nothing wrong with it. Or a cow. And a dog about 20  minutes. I can finish that dog and I   ll tell ya, if there   s a lesion, I bet you  I won   t miss a lesion very often. Or I shouldn   t. But I do the whole thing  and at the end of it you can ask me,    Well, what did you think of the  adrenals?    Hardly anybody looks at adrenals. That even came up here in  the last couple of days   pigs have a nice disease called PSS. The cause  of that disease, everybody says they get muscle lesions. Well, some do,  they all don   t. But what they all have, almost 99  of them have small  adrenals. But if you don   t look at adrenals in every animal you won   t  know that. So I push that kind of stuff. And I   ve got a lot of pictures for  it. That   s part of show and tell  and takes a lot of time .  So was that Dr. Olafson   s approach? That you didn   t read the case first,  that you went ahead and did the necropsy?  No, I don   t think so, because a lot of people fault me for this. They fault  me in the sense that    Well, why didn   t you read the history?    But I  should tell you, I never throw the carcass out unless I   ve read the  history, even afterwards. But I would have seen if there was a brain  tumor, I would have seen a prolapse of the hindbrain, if there was  whatever, I would have seen that. And it will fit the history that I get  with the animal. I have a cocky attitude   if it doesn   t then they   re  wrong, not me. And that has caused some problems personally or  whatever. I   m not that easy of a guy to get along with. It   s like I don   t  ask students their names very often because I expect the student to know  their name, whereas I will ask them,    Well, how did this tumor get from  here to there? Through what vessel circulation-wise?    So I   ll ask them  things they have to think  to answer .  So after you got your Ph.D. at Cornell, what did you do from there?  I went to Washington State to teach for a couple of years. I had a little  bit of a hard time there because the expression is    You can always tell a  Cornellian, but you cannot tell him much.    I heard it several times out  there, because I was a typical Cornellian. And then I went to work for  industry doing rats and mice and monkeys and stuff like that. But that all  got to be very routine, because you keep the rat for two years and you do  the autopsy, and it doesn   t take long to do them, with a sharp knife. I  should say something nice about knives: if you don   t have a sharp knife,  don   t do the autopsy. It   s work, you can   t push the dull knife through the  meat. You can   t open up the ureter on every horse and every cow, every  dog with one knife. I don   t use scissors. I can open up a cat   s ureter with  my knife because it   s sharp. So there   s different ways of doing these  things. Some people would just be appalled that I didn   t read that history  14  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  first. But I   m not gonna miss nothing. And that   s important to me.  You mentioned that you had been in Australia and South Africa. Tell me  a little bit about that. What led you there?  I did the same thing in those locations. I went to South Africa. If you  have to study something for the whole country, you   re going to be a  pathologist. Well in America, if you want to study pigs, you don   t go to  Cornell. If you want to study beef cattle, you don   t really go to Cornell.  You   re not going to see many as a pathologist. So in order to see these  animals in the United States, you kind of have to go where the pigs are,  where the cows are. But in Australia and South Africa, everything comes  in to a central lab. Certainly in South Africa. But I just came back from  Peru a few weeks ago, and the same thing, they bring the animals in and  I don   t really want to know the history first. When it gets to be a nervous  case I have to know the history but I   ve already got the brain, I   ve  already looked at it. If it   s not obvious. Now saving some specimens, if  there   s any hint that you want urine, well you   d take it as you do the  autopsy, it only takes ten seconds.  So when I   m down in South Africa, the animals would come in and I   d  do a complete autopsy. In Australia, a complete autopsy of an aborted  calf. You do all of it because you will find that you will find everything  that   s wrong, darn near everything. But I   ve been everywhere doing this.  I had a year in Argentina doing it, a year in Brazil. I was in Korea in  April this year for the month, so that   s what I do. I do autopsies without  a history. And most of the time, by doing these autopsies, necropsies,  even while I was in Korea, I find things they   ve never recognized  before, only because I   m looking at them, at the little things. You do a  complete autopsy, you   ll find them all.  So are you working with students, teaching them your techniques? Or  are you working with professionals or both when you do this?  Surprisingly, when I go to these places   if I   m there for a year, I   m  usually on the faculty or the staff of the veterinary school and I serve my  time like they serve their time. But then I show my Kodachromes to the  students and to the residents, all are different, nice Kodachromes and  then there are students there. But I don   t interfere with their method of  doing things, because it upsets some people. It shouldn   t, but it does and  it would upset me, because they just do it a little bit different. But they  do a good job. Let   s see, what was more to that question, there was  something else?  I was just interested in if you were going there in the role of a faculty  member or working with professionals in industry     15  King  Paustenbaugh  King  I usually worked with the pathologists and the resident students. I didn   t  work with the undergraduate students unless I was going to be part of  their faculty for a year, and then I   d have to show each student that. But  I would show the techniques to all the residents, and some of them did  exceptionally well with it. Many of them came to the United States     actually that   s one of the reasons I got to go to these places, because  many of the students had come to Cornell, and then they   d go home and  they invite me there. So I go, I usually don   t get paid, because Cornell   sabbatical  pays you half salary for a whole year or full salary for six  months if you go. I usually tried to go for a year because it   s easier for  my wife and my son and all. I   d do the autopsies with the residents and  graduate students and I   d have show and tells at most places for them  also. They all liked that because I had enough experience to ad lib that  this is something a little bit different how often you see it, and it   s just a  different way of doing things.  But I did it as unknown and when I went down   I was in Georgia and I  did the autopsy, and it should have had a certain lesion in the reticulum,  it should   ve had a piece of wire going through the reticulum to kill the  cow with what   s called hardware disease. I did the autopsy, I couldn   t  find anything. I found a hole. But what did it? And they had already  found it. It   s usually a piece of wire about four or five inches long with a  curve in the middle of it and that   s what allows it to go through the wall  easy. But they had already taken it out and they wanted me to find out  that I couldn   t find it so,    Hey King, you goofed up.    Well, I didn   t. But  it was a fun thing and I accept that. I want them   because if I put you on  the spot to ask you questions, everybody else around that table, the only  reason I   m asking you is because all the others don   t know the answer  either. Then I pick on you. And other people find that,    Well, we   re  worried about King.    But as soon as they learn this is the technique that  I   m using, it works.  It sounds like you travel very extensively and in doing so, do you see  unusual things that you haven   t seen here in the states?  Well right now I have a publication being printed. It   s true stories of a  different kind. It   s 104 stories there, and I   ll bet you, 90  of the  pathologists in the United States haven   t seen those lesions or  understand the pathogenesis, the mechanism for its development,  because they   re different. If you open up a cow and you see its abdomen  has got peritonitis and fibrin and some ingested, it   s leaked out, then you  know it   s got a ruptured intestine. But why do cows get ruptured  intestines? Especially five hours after calving. Well then you do the  autopsy and you find out that you don   t have to ask the farmer, you  don   t have to have the history   or I don   t have to. I   d look at it and say,     Hey, you put a couple chains on that calf to help the cow deliver and in  16  Paustenbaugh  King  Ewing  King  doing that you had a loop of intestine in the pelvis and the calf coming  out, it compressed the intestine, and the loop that   s in the pelvic canal  ruptured.    Hardly anybody to my knowledge has ever seen that and put  the two of them together, that it was due to owner-assisted parturition  problems. It happens, nobody sees that, I don   t know why not. And  yesterday Roger says,    That was the best thing you could have said,     when I gave a talk here, he says,    That   s the best thing to teach these  guys, they   ve gotta look at everything when you do an autopsy or  necropsy.    Thanks, Roger.  The title of the book that you just mentioned is     Well actually it   s King   s Necropsy Book. I could   ve said Olafson   s  Necropsy Book, but he didn   t teach it all this way. He had his own way  of doing things. Every animal I do has to lie on its left side, right side up.  And then as soon as I get to something   and if you don   t, if you do it  another way, then you don   t recognize what   s instantly not right,  whereas I do everyone the same way. Now there are other ways of doing  it than King   s, than my way, and that   s in my necropsy book. I   ve  written all of this down in a necropsy book. And I   ve got the smells of  pathology. You can make different diagnoses just by the smell. If you  open the abdomen up of a horse and he   s got kidney disease but you  smell a strong urine odor and then you look at the colon and it   s purple,  then you say,    Well he   s got uremic colitis.    Not many people have ever  seen or really heard of that. It   s one of my true stories, because I   ve got  dozens of these cases, I   m not talking about one.  Would you like to say anything about the conversion of your  Kodachromes to an electronic medium?  Very good. Over the years, the last five or ten years, I had a gal who I  paid part-time and the school paid a little bit. She took all my  Kodachromes and she digitalized them and she did a good job. I had two  secretaries I paid on the side, one was free but another secretary in  Wisconsin, she was a veterinarian, actually a nurse and a veterinarian. I  wrote up the 23,000 Kodachromes that I put down. I went through the  whole file and I chose 23,000 and they were all good cases. I wrote a  history for each one of them. The animal, the tissue, the description, a  brief description: white spots, connective tissue, whatever. Then I gave  an etiological diagnosis, the cause if I knew it, I gave a morphological  diagnosis just to fit the description, and named the cause if I knew it.  Then I gave, what I like on the whole thing, my personal    comment,  note.    What it amounts to, it   s what I think about that case, no matter  what you think, this is what I   m thinking. Then I can pull up any one of  those by any of those titles, I can push    cow, liver, parasites bile ducts     17  Ewing  King  because somebody looked there and found them, little red ones or  something like this, Dicrocoelium, or lung worms. I can pull that up  within 20 seconds or so out of my Kodachromes.  Now, when I retire, what am I going to do with all my Kodachromes? I  got 27,000 that aren   t on the webpage. What am I going to do? I   m at  Cornell, Cornell didn   t want them. They already had a copy of every one  of them that I took, or almost every one, and nobody was going to work  on it. So I said well, if they don   t want to, I will. But now you also  said   when my wife and I got married, we   ve been married 63 years or  something, and we just moved to a smaller house. Now what do you do  with a married collection of stuff of 62 years when you go from nine  rooms down to three? That   s been the hardest work we   ve done in ten  years  Because which picture do we want, which whatever do we want?  But how do you get rid of all 50,000 Kodachromes?  So I called up many people everywhere. I said,    Do you have any  interest in any of these?    I got about 20, yeah we   ll take them. But they  didn   t want all of them and they wanted a history for every one of them  and whatever, but they were very nice. And I got rid of   oh, of course I  have extras. You know, I   ve got Dr. Bob Garman   s rat tumors. I mean  and that   s eight carousels of 80, that   s what, 640 Kodachromes of just  rat tumors. So I   ve got to give these to somebody. I finally worked it out  when I went down to the AFIP, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology,  and those people have access to the library   Library of Congress, I  don   t know, but the National Library of Pathology, and they took it.  They said they   d gladly have it, they   re going to digitalize the other  27,000 and I didn   t have to throw them out. Because a lot of people have  thrown out their collections because they   re   and it   s not easy to make a  good collection. That   s why they ignore them, throw them out. I  couldn   t do that to mine, at least I hoped I didn   t have to. And thank  goodness they helped  as each picture was labeled with case ID, animal,  tissue and diagnosis .  You recently gave Oklahoma State University your parasitology notes  and included your own personal notes as well as those that Dr. Krull  handed out, and even included some of the old examinations. And this, I  was interested to see, was professionally bound. Did you have anything  to say about how you came to do that and how you chose to pass it on to  Oklahoma State?  I have been proud since I left Oklahoma State that, maybe excepting  some well-trained veterinary parasitolgists, I am as good with  parasitology in the autopsy room as anybody. Maybe not Roger Panciera  and maybe some other people, but I don   t take second seat for anybody  in parasitology in the necropsy room doing autopsies. And most of that I  18  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  learned from Krull. He gave us these handout notes and my own  comments to help, and I put it all together. But it was the most valuable,  single collection of any information I   ve ever had, from anybody. You  know, not a published book like Jubb   Kennedy or things like that, but  Krull   s was all practical, more in my line of thinking. It wasn   t all the  stuff that came from the literature where somebody who   s not a  pathologist, for instance, who did the autopsy and he thought this bloody  gut was a lesion; he didn   t recognize it because he   s not a pathologist, he  didn   t recognize that it wasn   t a lesion. So that   s written down for the  disease he was talking about, or he thought he was talking about, he  made that diagnostic a lesion. That   s bologna  Krull didn   t do that, it  was all his own work and his notes that we added to the side. My notes,  the test that Wally Carter took from Krull, a couple that I took that I  didn   t get good grades on. But I didn   t sit back for anybody on that.  Let   s see, yeah that   s where those notes came from. And it   s like when  you read Olafson   s textbook of pathology, he didn   t write it, but he had a  textbook of pathology that he used for teaching and he wrote his little  notes on the side. That book is more valuable to me than almost  anything else. Rickard   s notes that he put on the side of the books that I  got from him, they   re wonderful and there are comments on the side. I  didn   t know you were going to treat my book as well as you are, or my  collection. I think it   s wonderful that you did and I think it   s worthwhile.  It   s still got the most veterinary parasitology information than any book I  know. Much of the stuff that   s written today is by Ph.D.   s. They   re okay,  it   s fine, but if they   re just a Ph.D. and not a veterinarian, they can   t  speak the veterinary language. They can   t serve as role model for a  veterinarian. So I don   t put the guys down, because I don   t do their  research, I don   t even know what they   re talking about anymore. But in  the post-mortem room they wouldn   t dare walk in and say,    Well I don   t  believe you, John.    I   d tell them,    Well okay, yeah.    You know.  I understand that you are being honored this evening as a distinguished  graduate of the College of Veterinary Medicine. Can you talk a little bit  about that?  I   m humbled by it and there   s nothing I can say except that there are  more people I think who deserve it than I do. Because I   ve done what I  wanted for 50 years, the way I wanted, and they allowed me to do that.  I   m just so pleased at that. And should I be proud of it, being such a  whatever? I don   t know.  Well it is a very nice honor.  It absolutely is. And I   m not sure I deserve it. But thank-you very much.  19  Ewing  King  I know that many veterinarians who already had Ph.D.   s, who wanted to  become members of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists,  came to you when they were preparing to take the examination for the  ACVP. Can you talk about your role in helping young pathologists get  ready for that hurdle?  Only through Cornell and the graduate students who came there. Now  there   s an organization called C.L. Davis Foundation. Sam Thompson  started that because C.L. Davis was a government pathologist in meat  inspection, one of the best. He did a fabulous job. Well, there   s a lot of  old-time veterinarians like Olafson, or Rickard and McEntee, who are  fantastic people, smart, capable and everything. Sam Thompson, he was  in the Army for a number of years, he and Charlie C.L. Davis, were  good friends. I had started the Olafson short course at Cornell. And that  meant that every year we had a week   s meeting of Kodachrome  presentation. Olafson was still alive actually. But then Sam Thompson  said,    John, why don   t you come down to New Jersey and give the  Kodachrome presentations?     I went down there and gave four hours of Kodachromes on a Saturday  morning. I   d take half a dozen Cornell residents or whatever in  pathology down with me and we   d come back that evening. I did that  every month for the first year or two, but then Sam Thompson started  getting new people other than John King because I was just running out  of good Kodachromes. So he started getting other people and from that,  I did mine for 30 years  at Cornell  until I was getting ready to retire at  Cornell. But he had done the same thing with Kodachromes and he had  started doing it a little more often, he started doing it at the Armed  Forces Institute of Pathology whereas I just went down from different  schools. He had big classes.  My Olafson short course, the people would come from all over the world  for a week and they got, what, 40-some hours of Kodachromes. But then  I had to stop because my information was only on necropsies. But then  we had DeLahunta for the brain, he   s probably the world   s best  veterinary neuropathologist. And then we had Danny Scott on the skin.  And they started giving their specialties. So I got out of it a little   I still  give general stuff in the post-mortem room. But they started doing their  specialties.  If anybody asked me what they should do, should they be a generalist  like John King or Roger Panciera, I   d probably say no. And the reason is  I don   t know, and probably Roger doesn   t know, all the basics that we  should know about any one disease. Sure, you know the Rabies virus,  but you don   t know how to culture it, you don   t know what   s new and  different. I think everybody almost   I think I   m going to get arrested for  20  heresy or shot, but I think being a specialist you can give more. But you  need a generalist like King, you need a generalist like Panciera. So  there   s room for all of us, but I would think I might go into specialty.  Eyeballs. I mean, how many veterinarians know anything about  eyeballs? Well, a lot of them go to ophthalmology. But when you   ve got  six species to look at their eyeballs, it   s like the human, the MD guys,  they only work 24 hours a day. And the veterinary pathologist, if he does  it all, and he only works 24 hours a day. I hope I got the numbers right.  And therefore I think you can learn more   if I have a brain lesion I  don   t understand, I go to DeLahunta, if I have a skin lesion, I go to  Miller or Scott, if I have eyeballs, I go to Reese. Because I am a general  pathologist, and I work at it. But I have to go to those experts  for the  final in-depth info on these subjects .  Parasitologists. Now there   s a problem. Many parasitologists don   t have  a clue about the average veterinary problems with parasites. One best  example I had there was one of the young parasitologists came into the  post-mortem room and said,    Can I borrow some knives and instruments  to do some autopsies in the field?    and I said,    Sure. Why some?       Well  I   m going to take some students with me to do the autopsies on the  sheep to show them the parasites that are killing them.    He did take  them, he took the company car or the van, he took out everything, and  they killed five of the guy   s sheep. And that was okay, but didn   t make a  diagnosis. And when he didn   t make a diagnosis that was embarrassing  to him enough so that he came back and he said,    John you   re right, I  should   ve been a veterinarian.     I had another clinician in a seminar, they did a lot of work on the  woodchuck. I used to do a lot of woodchucks and they still do them at  Cornell, they got a five million dollar grant to work on the woodchucks  and stuff like that associated with hepatitis and hepatitis in humans. I  just did the autopsies and the histo   you know, an autopsy means histo  gross and histo pathology, you just don   t do the carcass and then quit.  Then the senior student who was giving a seminar finished his seminar  and I asked,    Well, was the dog autopsied?    Many times they   re not. But  he spoke up and said,    Yes, it was autopsied.    But it didn   t sound right,  the autopsy results, to me. So I asked, in the seminar, all the veterinary  students are there, a few faculty and whatever, and I says,    Was the  animal autopsied?       Yes.    And I asked,    Well was it done by the  Pathology Department? By a pathologist?    He didn   t know how to  answer that. But all of a sudden some guy in the back, who was in  charge  of the woodchucks , he says,    Yes it was autopsied, and I did  the autopsy.    Oops. That   s good. I didn   t say that. Now I   m thinking,     Uh-oh.    But anyhow I spoke up, I said,    I beg your pardon? You  cannot do an autopsy.    He said,    What do you mean I can   t?    I says,     An autopsy can only be performed by a trained observer of pathological  21  Moberly  King  Moberly  King  Moberly  King  detail and you don   t have that training. Otherwise you   re like a  slaughterhouse guy who does 400 cows a day, he   s not a pathologist  either. But, will you call me a surgeon because I   ve done six spays on  dogs?    And it was quiet.  I was wondering, with your website, is it to be a virtual show and tell or  as a review tool? Because we use that feature a lot.  People do that. So we wanted to make it as well-rounded a webpage. I  didn   t know how to do any of this. I didn   t know how to put it on there.  So a guy named   whoops  Gee I forgot his name. The guru in the  computer, he did all that. There   s also a big webpage from Georgia.  They have a quiz section in there and I don   t use that, I haven   t used that  very much, but I think they copied the technique. They didn   t copy it,  they just used it. And if you find it valuable, that   s wonderful. But I  really didn   t have much to do with that part of it.  When you were designing the page, did you ask the programmers to do  the quiz part? Or did they ask you if they could do the quiz part?  I think I   m surprised it   s on there. Because I don   t think I said,    Hey,  let   s do that too.    I just didn   t think that far along. I don   t think I had  anything to do with it really.  Before we began the taping, you were telling me about how you  organized your Kodachromes. Would you tell us that for the camera,  because I thought it sounded like one of the best visual classifications  I   ve ever heard of.  The first thing you must understand when you   re making a collection of  Kodachromes is that the Kodachromes have to be marked in a certain  standard way. So my Kodachromes, they have the post-mortem number  or the accession number from outside, nothing to do with the webpage,  but some identification number, autopsy number or necropsy number.  And over in the top right it   s the species: cow, dog, horse, and if you  want to make it a little bit better you would make it bovine or canine or  cat. But I wasn   t that fussy at the moment, so I accepted, when I say,     Oh it   s a cow,    well it   s a cow. It doesn   t mean it   s a milking cow, it  just means it   s a cow   bovine.  Underneath that it has the tissue: liver, kidney, lung, adrenal, whatever.  That   s in the top right and on the bottom you have the diagnosis. If you  have any room for anything else, you can put something else. But those  things are on every slide and every time you look at Kodachromes you  pick it up and you turn it right-side up and you face it down, that   s  where you put the number: top left. If you don   t, you get a lot of exercise  22  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  moving the pages around, hunting for which is the right end up. Don   t  do that, it   s too much time and effort. Then we, from there, my 15th big  collection on the wall about three-quarters of this wall of notebooks, you  know, standard three-ring binders,  color coded pages,  and I would  have liver, liver, eight books of liver. One of them on a horse, maybe  two of them on a cow, one of them on a dog, one on a cat, pig, sheep,  goat. Now I can also go to the wall and pick out adrenals. And I   d just  pull out the book on adrenals and that   ll be probably one book. I pick  that out and it   s got all the species in there because I didn   t have more  than that number of pictures to put in the file.  As I pull it out, the notebook, it   s in front of me, I look at the top of the  page holding 20 Kodachromes: if that   s color coded orange I know it   s a  horse; if it   s yellow I know it   s a cat; if it   s white I know it   s a sheep     because sheep are so anemic, so white tissues, just for that reason. So  that   s color-coded. Now I   m down, aren   t I? I   m down from the kidney,  I   m down to the species. Then I   ve got the color, when I go inside the  adrenals I can just flip the page and up at the top of the page of  Kodachromes I have nutrition, viral disease, bacterial diseases, trauma,  whatever the classification of the lesions are. And then I can pull out all  the trauma cases that affected the adrenal glands   there aren   t that  many, but I can do that in just what, 20 seconds, 30 seconds. It   s a good  way of doing it.  Also I have a miscellaneous group which has many that  are not easily categorized.   That   s a system that sounds like a librarian would have been proud of to  have devised.  Well there   s a woman at Cornell who   s done a lot for me, Susan  Whitaker, she   s a librarian par excellence and she helps everybody. She  helped me a lot because I needed a lot of help. But she   s fantastic help,  to have these kinds of people. But it   s good to have good technicians  because every case that you   ve heard me talk about, if it needed histo-pathology,  I had to give it to the technician. And then I got the slide and  every glass slide has been saved at Cornell. Now they   re throwing some  of the stuff out, but that   s their business not mine. I had my 50 years to  do what I could.  Is there anything that we didn   t ask you that you wish we had?  How did my wife help me? How did my wife help me and how did all  the other pathologists  and students help me ? We couldn   t have done it  without their forbearance in all the time we spent in the necropsy room.  Cornell was lucky. We were able to do the autopsies 24/7. And we did  them 24/7. Some schools aren   t that lucky. We were lucky because I  didn   t mind coming in any time. My wife allowed that. Some schools, if  23  Paustenbaugh  King  Paustenbaugh  King  Ewing  King  Paustenbaugh  you don   t have the pathologists who are around who aren   t that  interested because they have research projects they   re busting their  hump trying to do, I didn   t have research projects. All I had to do was  another autopsy. That was wonderful for me, and my wife allowed it.  She didn   t appreciate the smell when I came home. Even though I had  taken a shower and changed clothes. I might not have showered. Then  I   d have this odor, this aura, around me and it just drove her up a wall.  But my coveralls and all that I could just leave at school and that was  nice. So I do appreciate that. And my son. They had to put up with it. I   d  take him to a football game maybe, but if I had three horses to do in that  afternoon I   d take him to the football game with a buddy and then I   d go  back and do the horses. Not that I was dedicated because there were  other pathologists around, but some of them were researchers and they  didn   t have their heart into it even though they might have done the  work. Their heart wasn   t into it. And if they didn   t save the specimens, I  wouldn   t have any for show and tell. And therefore, if I did the autopsy,  I had the specimens for show and tell every week. But there   s a lot of  people I owe everything to, but I have to mention my wife, Marie. She  made it all possible.  We appreciate you taking the time, again, to meet with us today. That  was very generous of you.  Thank you very much, ma   am. I hope I didn   t talk too much.  Oh no.  Everybody says I do.  You can   t get an oral history if they won   t speak up and we appreciate it.  Thank you very much.  Thank you and again congratulations on your award tonight.  -------  -------
