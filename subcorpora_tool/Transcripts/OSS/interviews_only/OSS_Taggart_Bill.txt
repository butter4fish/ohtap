 Gill. Today is September 18, 2009. I   m visiting with  Dr. Bill Taggart at First United Methodist Church in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project, which is  part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Bill, thanks for  taking time this morning to be with us.  I   m honored.  We   re looking forward to it. I know it   s going to be an interesting  interview because we   ve shared some stories before. I just want to first  of all start at the beginning. Can you tell me a little bit about where you  grew up, a little bit about your family, your early life, some things you  remember early in your life?  I was born in Missouri as you noted on that document, but my parents  moved to western Oklahoma and homesteaded before I was a year old.  So I   ve been called a native Oklahoman quite a few years of my life.  Whereabouts was that, Bill?  Way out in Cimarron County in western Oklahoma. And we lived  through the drought and the Dust Bowl and all that out there. I think the  thing that cured most of that was World War II because of demand for  agriculture and we had rain. And both of those things put together  helped the country in spite of the fact that it was a war.  Where did you go to high school?  A little rural country school called Plainview, north of Texoma, between  there and Boise City, Oklahoma.  What   s the old expression, it   s not the end of the world but you can see it  5  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  from there? (Laughter)  Almost. I lettered on the basketball team all four years, but there was  only seven of us went out to play.  You had to be careful about fouling out, didn   t you? You didn   t have  enough guys to finish the game.  Outdoor court, we didn   t have any indoor.  Bill, tell a little bit about your family in the Depression. I guess there  were some pretty tough times out there. What are some of your early  memories about that, since you grew up basically in the    20s and    30s?  Actually, the worst thing was the Dust Storm years. We weren   t a big  farm area like a lot of the people were, but we had a real good crop in  1929 and the price dropped to oh, just a little of nothing, 25 cents a  bushel for wheat crop, and cattle prices were extremely low. And then  also in 1930 we had a good crop, still cheap, but it all hailed out. We  went into that Dust Bowl year after my dad had bought farm machinery  and got away from horse farming. So we had some tough years  financially, but we never went hungry. We survived those Dust Storm  years. I went through three different ones where it   s so black you  couldn   t see your hand in front of you. Those were pretty tough years.  How many acres was your farm or your ranch?  It was four sections counting the pasture land for cattle. My dad bought  another quarter section at three percent interest and we never could pay  the interest on it so we finally lost that. So he said to all of his children,     Don   t ever go in debt.     Wow. Is there a story or two in particular you can remember about the  Dust Bowl? You hear a lot of stories about dust up above the windows  and covering the crops, surely it must   ve made a pretty strong  impression on you. Were some certain events that you remember  particularly about the Dust Bowl?  Oh, of course there was fences covered over with tumbleweeds and sand  and cattle could walk right up over them. But you talked about one  event; there was a funeral of a little, I think three or four-year old girl in  Boise City and my parents and I and an uncle of mine went to that  funeral. As we left the funeral, one of those great big clouds of dust  came in as the procession was going to the cemetery in our local  community and the people thought it was the end of the world. But we  drove into a place that was called a roadhouse (that wasn   t a very good  6  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  place in those times) and we stayed there for about three hours before it  got light enough that we could see to drive. I was old enough to drive,  and my uncle told us where the end of the road was so we didn   t get off  in it. We finally got home after that. But that was just black as night for  about two hours in the middle of the afternoon.  Wow. Bill, what year did you graduate from high school?  1938.     38. Did you go to Oklahoma State right after high school?  No, I went to Panhandle A M College for two years and then went into  the service. I was then afterwards on the G.I. Bill went to school here at  OSU and graduated. It was Oklahoma A M then in 1947. I went  immediately to work then in Stephens County as a 4-H agent down  there, assistant county agent.  Could you share a little bit about your experience in World War II?  What theatre you were in?  I was in the Army Air Force. And that   s about all I care to say about it.  Bill, so you then got out of the Army right after the war in    44?  1945, October 31. Then I worked for a year and then came back over,  that   s when I came to Oklahoma State, in the fall of 1946 and then went  a full year and graduated, summer and all.  And you used the G.I. Bill. That helped as you said     Yeah, and turned back a lot of it that I never   I already had a master   s  degree program laid out for the whole thing and then the district director  for the extension service said,    You   ll never need a master   s degree  working for the Cooperative Extension Service.    So I went to work. And  later I wish I   d have got that master   s degree. But it would   ve been a  research degree then and I wanted to work with people.  Kind of jumping back, what influenced you to enroll at Oklahoma State  University? Did you have a background, had you come up with 4-H or  FFA to the University before?  I was in 4-H most of my early years in life, but it was I think mainly I  wanted to be in extension service and I think I felt like that degree would  carry more weight than one from Panhandle A M College out there.  7  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Why did you want to be an extension director? Did you know that when  you first went to college that   s what you wanted to be?  Probably, I think so. I thought first about trying to be a veterinarian. But  we had a county agent named Uncle Bill Baker and we just all thought  he was the greatest fellow in the world. He sat me down and talked to  me one time about that was a good thing to be involved in. I think that  kind of started me along that route and I thought I   d better do that.  That   s what I wanted to do because it was working with people.  So you enrolled in    47, who was the dean of the college at that time?  Al Darlow. Dr. Darlow.  One of the famous deans, really.  Yes, sir.  What do you remember about Dean Darlow?  Oh, I remember him teaching some courtesy courses still back in Animal  Science where my undergraduate degree is. He also remained judging  livestock a time or two and I remember that. But that   s probably all I  remember about him. I remember more about him after he retired than  before.  You talked about livestock judging. Were you on the livestock judging  team when you were a student?  No, I was not. I didn   t have time, I thought, after the war and tried to get  on through because I was married then and our oldest daughter had been  born. I thought I better get to work.  What about your undergraduate experience, Bill? Can you talk a little  bit about where most of your classes were? What buildings were your  classes in?  Gee, I hadn   t thought of that in years. (Laughter) No, I really hadn   t  thought of it in years. There was the old Animal Husbandry Building  and that   s quite a few of them. And then I think   no, that was later on  that there was a chemistry building. I recall that I thought I had to get  out in a year and the summer I took   well I took 18 hours both  semesters and 10 hours in summer in order to be able to graduate in a  year.  So you got out really in three semesters.  8  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  So I didn   t really have time to do anything much. Just lived in Veteran   s  Village and that was an experience.  The old Vet Village?  Yeah. Went home for Christmas one time and it turned extremely cold  and froze everything in that building including the bathroom stool and  everything that had water in it. So it took quite a while for all that to be  repaired so we could get back and live in it. But we were glad to go on  and get to work. (Laughter) And I worked with a great fellow name Fred  Huffine. He was the main county agent down at Stephens County at  Duncan. I learned a lot from working with him. I learned a lot about  people and how to approach and if you don   t know the answer to  something just admit and say,    I   ll find out for you.    In fact that   s  something that all of us should do, whatever we   re doing.  At OSU, were there some professors at OSU you had that were  influential to you and that you remember made an impression on you?  Yes, one   s named Glen Bratcher. He was the head of the Animal  Science department. And then Dr. Jim Whatley, he taught animal  breeding and he was a great teacher. And Joe Whiteman was another one  that taught, actually he taught statistics but I didn   t take that, it was in a  master   s degree program.  Who was your advisor when you were here?  He was later President of the college at South Dakota,  Dr. Hilton  Briggs .  So your first assignment then, Bill, as you said earlier, you were at  Stephens County as assistant county agent.  Yes.  Under, you mentioned an individual.  Fred Huffine.  So did you have some surprises when you got there that you didn   t think  about being in the county extension work?  Fred was a great teacher. County agents back at that time were called  upon to do minor veterinary work for people and to go out and castrate  calves or whatever needed to be done. But the phone rang one morning,  we were both in the office, he answered the phone, and he turned to me  9  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  and said,    Have you ever de-horned a cow?    And I said,    Oh yes, grew  up doing that.       Come on, we   re going to go out and do it.    So he had a  saw and everything to use and we got out there and we put the rope  around the animal to make it lay down like you   re supposed to do. He  grabbed the saw and cut it off and on the way back in he said,    That   s  the first one I ever de-horned. Did I do it alright?    (Laughs) He asked  me how to do it going out there. So he said,    Sometimes you need to do  things you need to learn how.     Absolutely. After Stephens County, can you share your career track,  some of the places you were at?  Yes, I went then to Taloga, Dewey County, which is south of Woodward  between there and Clinton and was there three years. It   s a strange place  to work because the little old town of Taloga is in the middle, but there  were four towns, Vici and Aledo, and Seiling, and then even down in the  south part of the county over at Fay. All of those communities were  separate within themselves and had different types of people in  agriculture, mainly the kind of crops they grew and all that. But that was  quite an experience, working in that setting. And I just thought if I ever  made over  1,000 a month I   d do awful well.  That brings up a question. When you were assistant county agent there  in Stephens County what was your salary?  I started out at  2,700 a year.   2,700 a year? Not a month?  No, no. (Laughter) No, no.  What are the major responsibilities of a county agent? What were you  expected to do as county agent or county extension director, I guess they  call it now?  You were an advisor regarding I think primarily pest control in both  crops and animals, and then in the larger towns there was also a lot of  calls from city people for trees and plants and gardening. And of course  the 4-H club work, that spanned a lot of different activities and involved  working with volunteer leaders and people. And again, the whole  success was working with people. Serving people, working for the  taxpayer, for people.  So you really got to know the people, the county, really well as agent,  most of the families, particularly farm families.  10  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Yes. And one of the great things about it I think, and I   ve talked to other  people that   s been in extension service, once you have been there for  several months or a year or so or longer and you   ve really served and  helped people, you were kind of an adopted member of their family. It  was a great privilege and an honor to be included in so many different  families. And if you were there at lunch time, you   d offend them if you  didn   t eat lunch with them.  That   s great. Were you in charge of helping recruit volunteer workers  say for 4-H, with students?  Oh yes, we had training all the time for that. And I think really the secret  of   of course you tried to get parents or relatives of those that were in  the club work at that time, but the success of the program depended  largely on how well those volunteers worked. Because one person  cannot be at all those clubs at one time or in any farm or bunches of  farms at one time.  Were there some strong family traditions that     That   s true. And particularly in showing of animals and showing crops  at fairs and things of that sort.  Did you work pretty closely with the county fair each year?  Oh my, yeah. You were secretary of the fair in a lot of those places. And  I worked pretty close, in my case, with Ag teachers. I   ve had some  awfully good ones that I   ve shared work with. And we both kind of  agreed that there wasn   t any point in trying to fuss over who had which  children as members but there were so many of them that weren   t  members of either one of the clubs that we were after. So in general I  think back at that time, most of them stayed in 4-H until they were  eligible and old enough to be in high school for the FFA program. And  they could work as a local community much more intensively than I  could across the county. It was better for the kids.  And I guess too the county extension office was sort of an OSU office, as  well.  Oh yes, it was a Cooperative Extension Service of Oklahoma State  University. We had the back-up of a lot of specialists here in various  subject matter fields who supported us as background information. We  could call them on the phone and get help when we needed it,  particularly in the insect world and that sort of thing. We   d hold  meetings and training sessions of producers and for people of all kinds.  We had one person in Woodward, I remember that he was a specialist in  11  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  roses. I learned more from him or if I had something I could not answer,  varieties or something, I could refer them to him and he   d help out. He   d  come to short courses that we   d hold and talk about it. You used all  those kind of people you could locally.  Tom Thedford, I was visiting with him recently and your name came up  saying he worked with you. Of course he was out in Veterinary Medicine  extension work.  Yes.  So you had all these different fields and specialists in different areas that  worked with you when you needed help.  Oh my, yes. Great back-up program.  Bill, you were trained and then you had a year as assistant, but what  was different when you actually got out there doing the work than what  you thought it   d be like? Were there some surprises for you, some aha  experiences, things you didn   t expect?  I   m sure there were a lot of them, but you try to erase those things out of  your mind. (Laughter)  Forgotten them now.  I don   t recall any particular one because we always had that back-up  program and our district director at the time I worked was Mr. J.M.     Curly    Ives. And he impressed on us very much,    If you don   t know  the answer, don   t be afraid to say    No, but I will find out for you.       I had  a lot of those circumstances because you couldn   t know all there was to  know about everything. No way.  And his name was? Spell his last name.  Curly Ives. I-V-E-S. He was a top-notch person. He was our district  director in northwest Oklahoma.  So you had different district directors around that the county agents  report directly to the state offices.  There was four districts in the state then.  Can you share some highlights of your professional career? You said  you went from Stephens County as assistant agent to Dewey County.  Then did you go from Woodward County from there?  12  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Yes. I was in Dewey County three years and then in Woodward it was  almost seven years. Oh I don   t know, when you talk about highlights,  President Dwight Eisenhower made a drought tour all across the United  States and one of the stops was Woodward County. And to be involved  with all of the preparation, working with Secret Service people and the  preparation of everybody. The Republican party at that time (President  Eisenhower was a republican) was a lawyer, Rueben Sparks from  Woodward. So he and I worked very closely together and we had to be  sure every person on that route was checked out on the Secret Service  and all of this. It was a great experience, but I   ll remember the morning  that President Eisenhower arrived in the old Columbine   that was Air  Force One then.  It was a cold January morning, January 10th I think it was, as I  remember. And there was probably 3,000 people lined up outside the  fence in that cold morning wrapped in blankets and all the clothing they  got, they stood there for quite awhile. And as soon as we got in the limo  and the Secret Service man was sitting, I was in the middle and he was  on my right, the driver. And President Eisenhower said,    How long have  people been here?    I told him and he said,    Let   s go greet them.    And  that Secret Service man, I could just hear him feel like he was  scrunching up like,    Oh no, let   s don   t do this.    President Eisenhower  was in the backseat on the side that he had drove around, he rolled the  window down and waved at that crowd all the way around that. When he  got through he said,    This is an inspiration for me. When I reviewed the  troops in Europe, same feeling. How great it is to have great people.    So  I always thought a lot of him.  Now did you have barbeque for lunch?  (Laughs) They had a private lunch for him. He went on somewhere else.  You thought it was going to be     I thought maybe we brought our   what was our barbeque specialist   s  name?  (Laughs) Yeah, what was his name?  Usually when we had a special event is when he always had the  barbeque.  No, but he was there early in the morning. And the farm family by the  way that were interviewed on his visit there, they went out in the wheat  field and all that. But they insisted that he go inside their home and visit  with the farmer   s wife and the children. So all that had to be secret ahead  of time. They couldn   t even tell their kids until that morning, the kids  13  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  stayed out of school. But one of the funny things that happened was the  cousin of this fellow, the farm they visited, he went over before the  President came and there was Carl Peoples out on top of the barn nailing  down some tin that had been loose for years. And he went home and told  his wife, he said,    I saw a crazy person today and his name was Carl.     On a cold morning, to do that. (Laughter) But these people, they were so  glad that the President of the United States had come into their home,  just common people.  After the Woodward job, did you then go into an administrative  position?  No, my children   s mother died out there with cancer and about, I don   t  know, a year after that, Luther Brandon was the extension director and  he called me and asked if I would come in and be a state livestock  specialist. That   s the time when you became an instant one. (Laughs)  But he said,    Now you   ll have to get an advanced degree in that field.     I   d already finished a master   s by hit and miss, you know,  correspondence, a lot of that, short courses. But anyway, he said,    I can   t  pay you any more money, but when you get it done hopefully the budget  will be better.    And he said,    We want you to take off a full year and go  to school.    So I came in and I served seven years in that field.  So what year did you take off, do you remember?  1958.  So you finished your PhD in one year?  No, I finished that master   s degree that next summer and then got the  doctor   s degree in 1964 so I took it over a period of time.  So you were seven years then as livestock specialist extension.  Yeah, travelling the whole state. Went to a lot of state and county fairs.  (Laughter) Saw a lot of pigs and all that, you know.  Have you got some favorite stories of your time as livestock  specialist ?  Surely there   s some good stories there.  Well, as a state   s educator or specialist, you never knew quite how to  approach an audience in their background training and understanding.  And I recall we were separate from the black folks at that time, the1890  people were called, and I was called to go over to eastern Oklahoma  with Harold Berry, who was the county agent there and he was a good  one, and visit with Mr. Luther Scales. He had a problem in his  14  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  ventilation barn, his hogs. Well I had no idea and Harold said,    You  come early, cause we   re going out to Hurley.    So I was out there on time  and Mr. Scales had a modern hog barn. I didn   t know that he had bought  hogs from Jim Whatley who did swine research here and oh he had a  great herd of swine. And the problem was so simple in that barn that  even I could understand it.  He said,    Come on down here in the well house and I   ve got some  protein supplements for my cows. I want you tell me which is the best.     Well I got down there and he had cottonseed cake and soybean cake and  a protein block. Well I misunderstood how much he might know. I  should   ve known with his progressive hog farm, but I made a mistake  and didn   t realize it. So I went through all of those step-by-step very  simply and explained the need for one cow and the cost. And we got to  that protein block and it   s twice, two and a-half times as expensive as  some of the others. And he kind of grinned at me and he said,    Yes sir, I  understand. But would it be alright with you if I use that protein block  on quail days?    (Laughter) So he suckered me. Then he said,    Come on  in the house and Ms. Scales will have some cookies and coffee and  milk.    It was a spotless kitchen and they were delicious.  That   s great.  Great experiences. I could tell those kinds of things all day long.  Have you got some more good ones?  One of them is real funny. I   ll tell the other one. When I was at  Woodward, I took some 4-H club boys down to Oklahoma City to  livestock judging one spring and we didn   t have any animals down there  that year and we were in the judging contest. I explained to these boys  the night before, two in one room, two in another, and me in a third one  in the old Lee-Huckins Hotel that we   re going to get up early and get out  there. So that morning came and I called one room and they answered  quickly,    Yep, we   re getting ready.    Called the other room, no answer. I  kept calling so I dressed quickly and went up there. Jerry Wells came to  the door, I   ll never forget it, and I said,    Jerry, didn   t you hear that  phone ring?       Yes sir, but it wasn   t our phone number.    That   s when  there was two longs and a short, you know, and all that. (Laughter)  Party lines.  Party lines, yeah. I could tell those kinds of things all day long.  Well Bill, so after your seven years as a livestock specialist     15  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Jim Whatley had me come into his (he was Dean of Agriculture then)  and be a program leader for Agriculture. I served in that capacity for oh,  let   s see, about five years I guess, and then Frank Baker became dean  and I was associate director then through the process of application and  employment. And I served as an associate director for about almost  seven years.  Who was the director at that time, Bill? Who was your director that you  reported to?  Charlie Browning, primarily. Frank Baker at first, more years and then  Charlie later.  Could you share a little bit of your thoughts and your memories about  some of those deans? We talked about Dean Darlow. Could we go  through Darlow and maybe through the deans you worked with and tell  me a little about each one and what you remember about them?  Yes, I remember working over in Whitehurst for a year or two when  Dr.  Darlow  was the dean over there. Then I worked with Jim Whatley.  There was also Burr Ross  who  was dean for quite a long time and he  was one of the instructors when I got the undergraduate degree. Dr.  Hilton Briggs was my undergraduate advisor and I worked some with  him, of course, as a student then a teacher. And then after Jim Whatley  was Frank Baker and then Charles Browning. And I retired then while  Charlie was still dean here.  I   ve heard a lot of stories about Al Darlow. What do you remember  about Dean Darlow?  He was a very good teacher. I had one course under him a long time ago.  I remember him mainly, though, I think as being one that worked with  animal people. I don   t remember any specific instance except when I  was over in Whitehurst Hall I recall a time or two that I   d visit with him  and he   d give advice. And then there was an experiment station director  that I worked with over in Ag Hall that I learned quite a bit from, Louis  Hawkins. Lewis was a hard task master, but he kind of took me under  his wing and taught me a lot of things about administration. He said,     You   ve got to be tough. Sometimes tougher than you want to be.     (Laughs) But we had lost a daughter to a drunk driver out in Arizona  then and they had lost a daughter also in a car wreck. And I think maybe  he wanted to take me under his wing kind of as a second son. He never  had a son. So I learned a lot from Dr. Hawkins. But he was pretty tough  on a lot of research people if they hadn   t done their homework right.  And you mentioned earlier Luther Brannon, when you first got into  16  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  extension work, was Head of Extension. What do you remember about  Dr. Brannon?  Oh I remember a lot about him being a real   Shawnee Brown was the  first director we had and he was a very fine director. So was Luther  Brannon. Luther, as I recall, well he brought me in and I always  appreciated that. And why he did that I   m not real sure but I guess he  thought he wasn   t making a mistake and I didn   t want to disappoint him.  But anyway, he went into the Ethiopian project and worked over there  for a long time. I guess I knew him that way, too. I don   t remember any  particular instance about it.  And then after Darlow was Baker, the next dean, or is there one in there  I   m missing?  Jim Whatley was dean. He had been, of course, an instructor over at  Animal Science and I   d known him. And he selected me to be in a  special position, it was called the Ag Leadership Program for their Ag  Director for the Extension Service.  Could you say a little bit more about that, about the Ag Leadership  Program?  Well, you were supposed to kind of be working with all the departments  in the College of Agriculture in terms of programs that might fit in short  courses and agricultural work out in the counties. I did a lot of working  with the department heads on insect control programs and special  livestock training and that sort of thing. And it was a very interesting,  challenging kind of thing because it was a new position and there  weren   t any blueprints to go by.  Was that the beginning of the program that continues today, the Ag  Leadership Program?  No, it had nothing to do with that. It was different entirely. I did serve in  that one after I retired.  Are there some farm families that you worked with in your time as a  county extension director that stand out in your mind? Are there some  individuals or families you recall you had some special times with?  Yes. Quite a few of them, more than we   d have time to talk about,  really. But a lot of them were people that worked as 4-H leaders. There  was quite a few of those that stand out in my mind because they were  there helping and you worked with them intensively. Then there were  some, particularly on the cattle side, that had   most of the county agents  17  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  back at that time also served as secretary of the Hereford Breeders  Association or whatever livestock groups they had, it was over all  breeds. And I worked quite a bit with some of those kind, both as a  county director and later, but mainly as county director   county agent  then.  As you think back on your lengthy career, how had the College of  Agriculture changed from  your time  as a student through your career  to today? How has the college changed over the years?  Oh, I don   t know that I know exactly how to answer that. I   m not an  expert, but I think with the access or the introduction of computers  would be one of the main things that changed the whole picture a lot.  And it   s certainly important today in county extension work. You can  get the information over the computer in a print-out in a hurry by simply  knowing the access code and all that. But we had literacy training  courses when Dean Whatley was there for our department heads in  computer literacy. I think the hardest thing was to get even some of our  full professor department heads to come take that course because they  didn   t want to be looked at as though they were dumb. There was kind  of a dread of something that new and complex, particularly if you didn   t  have much background in math. So that   s one of the things that sure has  changed.  Then I think when Dr. Jean Evans was director here, the introduction to  the Fact Sheet program where you had the answer to a specific question  in one or two sheets of paper. It lowered the printing cost and made them  available in every county. Then another thing that I think was extremely  important, Raymond Kay was head of the horticulture department and he  and I went down and met with the people at OETA and he started out as  the first director of the gardening program, Oklahoma Gardening. He did  a tremendous job. I   ll never forget one of the fellows after that, it   d been  going a couple of years, a fellow out in the county listened to that all the  time and he came to me at some meeting and he said,    What a great  program. It   s sure a good thing you all did that.    He said,    Do you  know, God doesn   t charge the time against you that you spend in the  garden?    (Laughter) Of course, I   d never heard that before. Or since.  That   s a great story. How has agriculture in Oklahoma changed since  you started in the business years ago?  Well, from small farms to much, much larger farms, much more  complex and difficult, I think, with trying to compete with the market  and the weather. Of course, that is constant through the years but ups  and downs. And then if you   re talking about it today, that farmer   s got to  be an expert almost in computer science, in the farm markets for futures.  18  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  He   s got to have his eggs in several baskets so to speak because you  never know what prices are going to be. And there   s a lot of experts that  are out there as consultants helping the great big farmers. But I think the  biggest change probably is from small to large or much larger farms.  Very complex.  Particularly in the Panhandle where you grew up, that really has  changed.  Well, everywhere, I think. Yeah, mainly there but here in this county  too. It   s not a big agricultural production of crops and all that, always  had a lot of cattle. But up in the Osage or the country around Enid and  Alva and Woodward and up in there, all western Oklahoma. Quite a  difference in the western side of the state than the eastern side of the  state in agriculture.  How has it changed in terms of crops versus cattle and hogs, what have  been the changes?  Well there were lots of small hog operations then that no longer exist  with the big hog farms. I don   t know the cattle numbers. For quite a long  time I think we were about the second or third largest cow population of  any state in the country, maybe Texas and Kansas were ahead of us, I   ve  forgotten. But there   s always been cattle, I think, on the farms. There   s  always been grassland that was too rough to farm and had to be utilized  with cattle, harvested the cattle.  Looking back on your career, were there some highlights in your career,  some milestones that you particularly remember?  Yes, I started out in the PhD program in Animal Science and went into  that a full year and had 60-some hours. Had a lot of the ag biochem  courses and statistics, math stat, and all that. And I really didn   t want a  research degree. I went to Dr. Hillier who was my advisor at that time  and  it was a  great disappointment to him, but I said,    I   ve got to  change where I can work with people more.    So I went over into the  College of Education and took courses that were working with people  primarily. But I did that move on purpose and it was a disappointment to  most of my colleagues in animal science, but that   s just where I felt like  I was led in what I wanted to do and I did it.  Was your doctorate in the College of Education then?  Yes.  Okay, so you got the EdD.  19  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Yes.  Who are some of the people you remember taking classes under over  there?  Dr. Richard Jungers, who taught school finance, and I didn   t particularly  want to take that course but it was required. And then, oh let   s see, my  major advisor there,  Dr. Helmer Sorensen  was a great person and I  enjoyed working under him. We became great friends after he retired  and I did, too.  In addition to starting your career as assistant county extension director  and then director, then you were a livestock specialist for seven years,  and then you were associate dean in charge of all extension for the state  then.  Yes, sir.  What years was that, Bill?  From about, let   s see, Frank Baker came in 1978, I finished in 1984.  Yes, because I was almost seven years there. But I guess one of the  highlights then in addition to being the functional director of sorts in the  state because Jim Whatley said,    I don   t know anything about extension,  you run it.    And Charlie Browning essentially said the same thing but  Charlie wanted to be kept informed in a lot more detail than Jim  Whatley did. But I had the privilege of working at the national level with  what was called the Extension Committee on Organization and Policy,  which essentially was the organization for all extension directors in the  country. And serving on that committee and working with the people in  Washington and legislation and a lot of the big organizations and that  sort of thing was a great learning experience. It was a great learning  experience because I suppose like an Army general or something you  have to have a lot of good help or it couldn   t be done. We fought for  funds all the time at the federal level and I had some real good people  that served in different capacities. That was a real pleasure.  Were you in D.C.? Did you visit with congressmen?  I did some of that, yes, but primarily the Department of Agriculture.  Do you remember some of the people you worked with at the time that  were close friends of yours?  Well, yes, there was an extension director in Michigan named Gordon  Guyer that I worked with pretty closely and he followed me in that  20  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  position. And then when Ronald Reagan was elected president, there  was a fellow who was in the interim program, they called it, from one  administration to the other who came from California and he was a big  Ag guy. I needed to meet him because that   s when I was National  President. I got through the door to see him and to lay out what we  hoped we could do that year and when I sat down in front of him he said,     Do you know there   s a Bill Taggart up here as a lobbyist?    And I said,     No,    and he said,    I   ll tell you, the only reason you got through my  door, I wanted to see what you looked like.    He said,    He   d make two or  three of you,    he said,    He weighs about 350.    (Laughter) That   s the  only reason I got to talk to him. But when we had a later meeting he  agreed to come and talk to us because he was kind of the interim guy for  the Reagan administration.  Part of the transition team coming in?  Yeah.  You mentioned being president of that national association, but are  there some other special recognitions or awards that you received? I  know you   re a modest individual but could you share some of the  awards that you   ve received?  I worked with Livestock Conservation, which was a Great Plains group  quite a few years and did that mainly when I was an extension specialist.  Oh, I worked then a lot with the national 4-H people and FFA people  and that was a good pleasure, too, but that   s probably enough of that.  You received a distinguished service award I think, did you not?  Through extension?  Well it   s through the Department of Agriculture. And I didn   t put on  there but I   m an Alpha Zeta alum and that was an honorary deal in  agriculture. And oh I don   t know, I   ve got some of them listed in that  brochure.  Well can you tell me a little bit about the distinguished service award  from the U.S. Ag Department?  That material I gave you is a copy of that book. But it mainly is  biographical information and where you served and worked and some of  the highlights of my career.  What were some of the guidelines for receiving that award? Years of  service and contributions you   d made to extension?  21  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  I suppose so, I never was told. (Laughter) I hope so.  What about hobbies and special interests you have? I know you   ve been  retired a few years now and had a chance to do some of that. I know you  love hunting but could you share some of your interests and hobbies?  I do woodwork. That mainly was my hobby, but the hunting after I  retired mainly was, did some a little bit before. I   ve turned down a lot of  invitations from ranchers to hunt quail when I was working in the  counties and I didn   t think I had time to do that. I regret now that I didn   t  do more of that.  Did you look some of them up after you retired? (Laughs)  Well we went out to far western Oklahoma and hunted coyotes some,  but it was mainly to hunt pheasants. My nephews out there always  wanted to hunt coyotes and instead we got tired of going out there for  that.  Bill, your religious faith has always been important to you I know.  Very much so.  And you   ve been a long-time leader in the First United Methodist  Church in Stillwater. In what ways has your personal faith influenced  your life?  In lots of ways. I grew up in a strong Christian family and I think that   s  the right foundation for any family. I   m fortunate indeed to have that  kind of background. But then I think mainly the tragedies that   s  happened in my life, I don   t know what you   d do if you didn   t have a  strong faith on which to turn. And then in the tough times in your jobs  and in your work, it   s impossible to always feel like you had direction  and guidance, but like I   ve heard lots of other people say, I believe very  strongly in prayer.  Reflecting back as we conclude here, there are a lot of individuals that  you   ve had a chance to work with and to know. You   ve mentioned some  of these in the interview that are no longer with us today. Going back,  thinking as a student and in your early career, can you tell us some  people that influenced you and what you remember about them that you  could share with us that had an impact on your life?  Yes sir, quite a few of them in church. There was one named Hog  Thompson that was in animal science and I never had any coursework  under him. I   ve already mentioned Louis Hawkins. And then there have  22  Gill  Taggart  Gill  been people at the county level that I had strong support from and then I  mentioned Fred Huffine, I learned a lot from Fred just by following and  listening. And gee, there are lots of others that I probably don   t recall.  There   s one professor, when I was struggling with advanced analytical  chemistry and working toward a PhD. I took that course as a seven-hour  course in the summertime the first time I came back as a full-time  student. I broke more glass probably than any other student in the class  and he got me off to the side. He was in our Methodist church too and  I   ve long since forgotten his name, I   d have to look it up on my  transcript. He said,    You   re having trouble with this course, but,    he  said,    I see you trying.    He said,    Would you want to come to my house  and let me tutor you?    What a blessing that was, but I don   t know, I   m  kind of a stubborn rascal and I decided I wasn   t going to disappoint him.  I never worked so hard in my life and made an A in that course. I  wouldn   t have done it if he hadn   t had that confidence in me, I   m  positive of that. But some of the courses I had it doesn   t take a too good  grade in or some of the most important good grades in that I made the  progress in probably.  I had difficulty with math stat because I didn   t have the right math  background. I didn   t even understand that when Dr. Bob Morrison  taught it. That brings up another thing I   ll tell you in a little bit. But  anyway, that course in animal science, it was called Research in Animal  Science or something of that sort, Dr. Joe Whiteman taught it. It all  began to kind of open up and I could see the sense in all these different  principals and all that. And it made a whole lot of sense then. I really  enjoyed that later then, but I didn   t have the right background for it.  Later whenever I was doing my research for the dissertation, I was at the  livestock show in Oklahoma City and I was down there in a room by  myself and I took all my work that I was writing part of that dissertation  with with me. I left it in the car one evening and was too tired to work  and someone broke into it and took the briefcase. It took me about a year  to put all that stuff back together.  Wow.  That was one disappointment, for sure. But it was all on computer cards,  all the research. So we just had to call the cards back, they hadn   t been  destroyed yet. (Laughter) That was good.  Boy that was. Well Bill, let me turn the coin a little, we talked about  people that influenced you in your life that were mentors to you and  were special. Can you think of some people that worked under you that  you take a special pride in or that you influenced their lives and maybe  mentored them?  23  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  One of them was named Aubra Wilson. And, of course, Fred Huffine  that I   ve already mentioned. And then, oh I can remember some  individuals in the county, but Pat Patrick at Clinton was another one that  I thought a lot of and Vernon Stephens that worked later as an area agent  for us. Oh I could just name hundreds of those. But if you don   t learn  something with everybody with whom you associate, you haven   t been  listening. And you can learn if you just don   t talk too much. (Laughter)  That   s why we   ve got two ears and one mouth, right? Should listen twice  as much as you speak.  No, that   s true. I mean you learn more. That   s why you   ve got two ears  and one mouth, isn   t it? I read somewhere.  Exactly right. Well two final questions, Bill. One, just reflecting, looking  back on your life, from a young man out in the Panhandle in the middle  of the Depression, did you ever imagine where your life would take you?  I mean looking back saying,    How did I get here?    It   s been an amazing  career. And I   m saying this for you because I know you   re a humble guy,  but you come from a farm in I   ll say the middle of nowhere, out in the  Oklahoma Panhandle in the Depression, you go through and survive  World War II, come through the ranks and you go up to Associate Dean  for Extension for the whole state of Oklahoma. Did you ever imagine in  your wildest dreams that your life would lead you there?  Well the first thing I heard you say on this question was next to the final  question, wasn   t it?  Yes.  (Laughter) Well, I think I would   ve never thought that I would   ve done  the kinds of things that I had the opportunity to do. Opportunities open  up and there you have to do the best you can with whatever you have  and whatever opportunities you   re given. And I tried to make the most  of those. The most important accomplishment I   ve made is my family.  Can you tell us a little bit about your family?  Well they   re all good Christian people and they   ve always been. And  when their mother died Gary, the youngest one, he was just about three  and a half years old. And my oldest daughter, Karen, was killed, was  eleven or twelve. But I think out of some of those kinds of things come  growth and blessings that maybe wouldn   t have otherwise happened.  There had to be a lot of responsibilities that they had to share and  learning to manage their school lunch funds and things that way, their  allowances, and being more independent, and maybe dependent upon  24  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  each other within the family. And they   re still that way. I   ve got a lot of  good grandkids too and some great-grandkids. I   ve got one grandson  that hopes to be a youth minister. They   re all active in their churches. So  I   m proud of them.  Bill, are there other special memories you have of your career and your  life, that special time in your life that are important to you,  professionally or personally?  I don   t recall any particular right now. That hobby you mentioned, I  pursued that pretty strongly because it was a relief from the tensions  with which I dealt. But I   ve never sold anything that I   ve ever made, I  give it away. And I don   t want that to sound like boasting, that   s not me.  But somehow I just felt like that that   s what I was supposed to do with  it. So I   ve spent quite a bit of money and quite a bit of time over 40  years of doing those sorts of things and being glad of it. This pumpkin  patch is coming up shortly here at the church, I   ve made things for that  for several years. I   ve never sold anything and don   t intend to. But I   ve  got a list of hundreds of articles I   ve given away. And the only reason I  keep a list is so I don   t give the same person the same thing twice, I  can   t remember. (Laughter) My memory   s pretty weak.  Bill, you   ve certainly had a great life and a long life.  I   ve been honored. I   ve been very fortunate.  And been very influential in thousands of lives that you   ve affected.  Looking back, how do you hope people will remember Bill Taggart?  Well, I haven   t given that any thought, but maybe that he was one that  tried to help them.  So kind of that land-grant philosophy of service to others is important in  your life.  Yeah. Yeah, that   s what it is. And I don   t mean that to just sound like  goody-goody, that   s not me. I don   t want to leave that impression.  And you wouldn   t. Bill, we   ve talked about a lot of different things and  we could probably talk all day. Are there any comments you   d like to  make or is there something we missed that you   d like to talk about as we  conclude our conversation?  I   ve always enjoyed being a humorist of sorts. Kind of a poor one at  times, but I think I   ve learned from the interviewer here that he doesn   t  know how to count because back about ten questions ago he said the  25  Gill  Taggart  Gill  Taggart  next two would be the last. (Laughter)  That   s right, I   m not a math major. I   m a history major.  Well, I   ve learned that in teaching or trying to teach, whether it   s a work  session or in church any way or whatever, I   ve learned to work with  audiences. And first off they don   t want to hear somebody talk all the  time. If you can involve them in the discussion they   re going to go home  learning more than if you didn   t do that. And then I   ve learned when  sometimes the crowd or the audience gets a little bit tired, some kind of  a humorous situation will revive that audience. They think you   re going  to do it again I suppose, I don   t know. I   ve learned that. But you learn a  lot as you work with people. You have to or you   ll never succeed, I  don   t think. And I think that   d be true with whatever one does.  Bill, I appreciate it. You called my hand so I can   t ask you any more  questions. I guess that concludes it but I want to thank you for taking  time to be here today. And you   re right, humor does make a lot of things  go better, doesn   t it?  Well thank you. Thank you very much.  -------  -------
