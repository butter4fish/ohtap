 Milligan Let   s get started. This is Sarah Milligan with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. Today   s date is November 13, 2015, here in Ponca City  interviewing Brice Chism for the Cowboy in Every County Oral History  Project, and we   re going to talk about Mr. Chism   s life growing up, his  choice for OSU, and his time afterwards. All right. Now it just goes however  we want to go. I like to start with   just tell me a little bit about yourself.  Where are you from? Who are your parents? How many siblings do you  have? Who are they? All that good stuff.  Chism I   m from Tulsa. I graduated from old Webster High School (that   s over on  the west side of town) and grew up there until my father passed away when I  was thirteen, still just in junior high. My momma supported me all the way,  and she finally moved me from the west side of Tulsa, which, not as many  high school students went onto college, over two blocks from Will Rogers  High School. That   s clear across Tulsa. Enrolled me in Will Rogers High  School. Why, I stayed there six weeks and had her talk the superintendent of  schools in Tulsa into allowing me to go back to old Webster High School.  That was my sophomore year. I did that, having to transfer in downtown  Tulsa for those last two-and-a-half years, a little over two-and-a-half years.  The people on the west side of Tulsa are still some of my closest friends.  How my mom came up, because she just had a, she was a clerical, did  clerical work, but she was pretty sharp and did tax accounting on the side for  people and made a little money. Then my sister, who   s three years older, she  went to OSU and started dating (I don   t think they were married yet) a  fellow named Bob Winborn. Therefore, it was pretty much destined that I  was going to go to Oklahoma State (Oklahoma A M, at that time) and  become, also, a Theta Chi. That was his fraternity. It   s the one that was right  across from Bennett Memorial Chapel and is now going to be the location  for that performing arts center. That   s where it was. We were right there on  that. At that time, it was called College Avenue, not University Avenue.  That   s how I ended up there.  5  Milligan Was your mom a single mom?  Chism Well, after my father died, yeah. Yes. Interesting, in her later years, she had  a companion who I liked real well. I would have been happy with them  getting married. I think she thought that I wouldn   t, but you know what? My  wife and I talk about this. If a spouse dies, it is good to have a companion. I  think it extended her life ten years maybe, having somebody to do things  with, go to dinner, play bingo, go to the horse races, and things like that, but  somehow she came up with that one. I think my father must have got a little  bit of social security gift if the student went. That   s how I ended up at OSU  and in the same, that   s the fraternity.  Milligan How did your sister end up there? Do you know?  Chism I think she just had some friends. I think she was just going to, and we don   t  talk about things like that anymore, but I think she went down to get an     MRS    degree. (Laughs)  Milligan That could   ve been. She wouldn   t have been the only one.  Chism She was a good student. She was majoring in secretarial administration.  Milligan What year did you start A M?  Chism Fifty-four, fall of    54. Another thing, I don   t even know why, but in high  school, for some reason, I took a lot of typing and shorthand, the old  shorthand. When I went to OSU, they looked at my background. They said,     Well, you need to be in office administration.    Well, in the early    50s, there  was a, I call it a fad, but I   m not sure it was a fad, that many wives didn   t  like the fact that their husbands    bosses would go on trips and everything  and then to have them female secretary. There was a fad going on, a trend  for male secretaries, and I thought,    You know what? That   s not a bad idea.  I   ll go to the top real quick, and it   ll last a few       That really didn   t pan out.  (Laughs) I think the good-looking gal, you overtook, but that   s how I ended  up in the majoring in office administration.  Milligan Was that in the business school?  Chism Yes. Ed Silverthorn was my academic advisor, and after about six weeks in  shorthand, I met my plateau. The girls took on off. I thought,    This is not so  good.    Then the next year, I just changed it to, well, something, business  management or something that permits the same curriculum. It didn   t make  any difference. You never know what you   re going to do, but I gave that a  shot. I was pretty good at typing and shorthand, but not as good as the girls.  6  Milligan Were you the only, were you one of a few males in that program?  Chism Oh yeah. In fact, I can still remember, trying to remember that professor   s  name. Yes, I was the only one.  Milligan Oh really, period?  Chism Oh yeah. I don   t know about typing. Another thing, too, that you all may  not, there used to be the, oh, a famous golf coach at OSU. This is long  before Mike Holder. He was the shorthand teacher. Labron Harris  Jr.  was  his name. Isn   t that something, to be the golf coach and the shorthand  teacher?  Milligan Yeah. Were you surprised when you were the only guy that rolled up into  some of the classes?  Chism No, I really wasn   t that surprised. I had a good deal going there with all  the   . (Laughter) I can still remember Margaret Piccolo from McAlister,  Oklahoma. That   s a true story. I   d follow her out of class but never did have  the courage to ask her for a date for a long   but finally, I did.  Milligan Did she go out with you?  Chism Oh yeah. (Laughter) Oh yeah. Any guy that can write shorthand   s got to be a  pretty good guy. (Laughter) Isn   t that funny that that name just popped right  up, Margaret Piccolo? I   ll have to look in the old yearbook and see.  Milligan I   ll have to find out if I know any Piccolos at home. (Laughs) You changed it  to business management, which was similar, but were there more men in  that program?  Chism Oh yeah, it was big, yeah. In those days, we had, 55 percent of the people in  college were men. Now that   s completely reversed, and it   s getting close to  sixty for women and forty for men. Thought later on about my job, but yeah,  interviewing people for jobs. It got to be real heavy on the women   s side  because     Milligan You had a lot more women interviewing for positions?  Chism    better organized, normally quicker on the studies. Maybe later on, I don   t  know, but I know that the women were just better students, simple as that.  Milligan Do you have any theories on why?  Chism Only the one. I think just the fact that more of them started going to college,  and then when they started being successful, then they can be successful out  7  in the business world. Therefore, that set us and encouraged other young  ladies to do so. Still, you can do what you want to, and the ladies do. I have  a daughter who   s, was an electrical engineering major, my oldest daughter,  and the other one is a CPA  Certified Public Accountant .  Milligan You just have two kids?  Chism No, I have a young one, a son who   s disabled. He had a massive stroke  when he was nineteen. The girls fly through life, and he had a massive  stroke when he was nineteen. They   re in San Francisco right now. That   s  where he wanted to go for a long time, just to see San Francisco, but he had  a black cloud.  Milligan He and your wife are there right now?  Chism Yeah, and the oldest daughter. She was a good student, not so practical but a  good student.  Milligan (Laughs) Well, it   s good that you got half of that, right? (Laughter)  Chism The other daughter is, she   s the chief financial officer for the largest heating  and air conditioning company in all of Arizona, and she   s the one that  always pleased her parents, pleased her teacher, pleased her professors,  knew how to play the game. The older daughter never learned how to play  the game, and that   s what you   ve got to do. It   s demeaning in some ways,  but that   s the way the world works.  Milligan Business was harder for her?  Chism Getting along with women supervisors. (Laughs) That   s what was hard for  her. She   s brilliant in regard to book learning and all of that. She became an  RN also. She   s a master   s in electrical engineering, RN at fifty-six years old,  and doesn   t have a job, brilliant.  Milligan That   s tough. Those are some degrees, though.  Chism Oh yeah. When she went through an RN in Arizona with a four-point, but  she   d always be in disagreement with the professors or something, though.  She   s a great gal.  Milligan Well, there   s a space for her. She   ll find it.  Chism Just a side story on that. She   s such a good Christian that she   s taking in  three Hispanic kids into her home with no foster home attachment, no legal  attachment but through her church. She knew one of the mothers. She  supports them and helps them do their homework in every way. The moms  8  really weren   t interested in them, but Christy took them in. She   s got some  pretty good stuff going for her, but it   s just she   s a real interesting  personality.  Milligan Yeah. Strong, sounds like.  Chism Yeah. That   s a good Christian gal.  Milligan Well, that helps me round out who you are. Back to when you were at OSU.  You were in the business school. Tell me a little bit about, where did you  live, on or off campus, and what   d you do?  Chism Lived in the Theta Chi house my first, I guess it   d be three, three-and-a-half  years. I moved out to be with this fellow from McAlister, Duane, and a  fellow named Al Casey. We got us an apartment over on North Husband,  which is just, you go through that Shrine where a lot of the people park for  football, that Shrine building. I think it   s the Shriner on up there a few  blocks. We were just the very best of friends, and this one guy would do the  cooking. The other two guys would do the cleanup. We were just good  friends, and we were good study partners, too.  Milligan Was that your senior year you moved out with them?  Chism Yeah, and then   that   s right. Then we got married after the senior year and  moved to Cushing  Oklahoma  so my wife could teach there. There weren   t  any teaching jobs in Stillwater. Drove back and forth from Cushing. I was  lucky in that I only had to go one more year to get the master   s because I  had had, took extra hours probably along. A lot of people take a year and a  half to get the master   s, and I was able to do that in   . My master   s degree  is in   master   s in management. That   s what it, if you look on the diploma,  but then the year after I left, that   s when the term MBA  Master of Business  Administration  became popular through Harvard. They changed it to MBA  at OSU. My curriculum was still   was exactly the same. If I tell people  what it is and they don   t know me well, I   ll say,    I got an MBA from OSU.     Why not? (Laughter)  McDougal Might as well.  Milligan I think that   s fair enough. I like it. That   s true. Tell me a little bit about  living in the Theta Chi house back in the    50s.  Chism Oh yeah. Oh gosh. It was a small house, small, small chapter, too. My  roommate was from down around Mangum  Oklahoma , Cordell   Oklahoma , and the reason we were roommates because that brother-in-law  who went there, had had, his best friend was named Ted Clancy. He had a  nephew named Al Tyson. They talked to each other.    Well, let   s get Brice  9  and Almus together, and they can be roommates.    That   s how that  happened, and he was my roommate for at least two years. I can still  remember the day we moved in. He said,    Let   s go get some cigarettes up at  the corner,    and I went up there with him. I think I smoked one cigarette, but  he smoked for many, many years after that. You never know about that, but  also he was handy. He could do anything and still can do anything, and  we   ve remained friends over all these years.  Milligan That   s fantastic.  Chism For example, he said,    Let   s have different kind of beds.    We took out the  old bunkbeds, and he made beds that would be tied into the corner and went  down and bought some springs. He   d tie those into the two-by-fours, and  then mine would be opposite somehow. I   ve forgotten, but we, that   s the  first thing we did is built beds because he didn   t like the ones that we had.  Milligan He just attached them to the wall, almost like a spring hammock?  Chism That   s right. Probably had a   surely it had a support down to that far corner.  I can   t remember, but after all these years, we   re still the very best of  friends. He lives only, in Sun City, west Arizona, he only lives a mile from  my sister. When we go over there, we always see them. Yeah, he was from  Cordell, Oklahoma. He   s a good guy.  Milligan Did you ever smoke before he talked you into going down to the corner?  Chism No, no. Now then, later on when I was working, I smoked a pipe. I loved  smoking and I liked smelling that pipe, but if you were working it, you   re  spending all your time cleaning the dumb thing. One day, I turned around in  my office, and I had seven of them. Just threw them in the trash. (Laughter)  I loved smoking a pipe. I think it looks distinguished. It smells pretty good,  but it doesn   t taste good. There   s no way. Don   t do that. (Laughter)  Milligan That   s your lesson, Anna, no pipe smoking.  McDougal No pipe smoking. (Laughter)  Chism Aren   t we fortunate that not as many college kids these days do smoke. See,  in my day   .  Milligan Smoke-free campus.  Chism What is it, completely, even outdoors? Well, that   s good, but these cigarette  manufacturers, they were there at the dorm, at the fraternity house, passing  out samples. That   s how a lot of them got started. They say,    Well, the  10  cigarette manufacturers don   t do things like that.    Bull hock ey . They sure  did. They would give you a sample so that you   d start.  Milligan You had smoking in the house. What other bad habits did they bring you to?  (Laughs)  Chism I guess if you guys   I don   t remember them smoking so much in the house.  They   ve got them on front porch or back porch, but I don   t remember them  ever at a meal or anything like that. No, I don   t, that was not a big deal.  Milligan No, right. I mean, I understand that, but that   s interesting that the reps  would come to the fraternity houses.  Chism Oh yeah. They really did. I don   t know about the sorority houses, and I  know the girls    dorms because my wife was in Stout Hall. She remembers  them coming and leaving samples, things like that.  Milligan For cigarettes?  Chism Oh yeah. On purpose, they were doing it, yeah.  Milligan Were there other vendors that came to do that? I guess alcohol would have  been too young, but anything     Chism Alcohol wasn   t a big deal when I was in college. I don   t even remember  hardly drinking beer, and I wasn   t against it, except the fact that my father  died of alcoholism, big deal. That was important to me. (Laughs) He really  did. That   s how he passed away was from alcoholism.  Milligan You had strong opinions about that at some point?  Chism Yes, sir. Now believe me, I   ll go up to the country club at night and have a  glass of wine. I enjoy that, and I   ll have a beer every once and a while. It   s  just not important to me.  Milligan Was it important to other people on campus, do you think, at that time  period?  Chism Not the drinking. Smoking probably was, but I can   t really recall on that.  Milligan Yeah, that   s fine.  Chism You   ve got to keep in mind, Anna, that at seventy-nine years of age, your  brain starts drifting off. (Laughter)  Milligan I think you   re doing better than I am. (Laughter)  11  Chism I love to tell stories, and something   ll trigger another story. My long-term  memory is so much better than my short-term memory. I   ll play gin rummy  with my friends, and they   ll play a card. Five minutes later, I   ll forget what  that card was. Isn   t that interesting that that   s true, that it really works that  way?  Milligan I think that   s common. Well, then let   s talk a little bit more about your long-term  memory. Living in Theta Chi, what else did you all do? Did you have  get-togethers? Did you go out as groups? Did you go to the Strip, for  example, or did you belong to other groups on campus?  Chism Well, I belonged to a lot of groups on campus.  Milligan Did you?  Chism Yeah, and we can talk about those. We did groups because you were in a,  and you   d have a party with a sorority or something like that or we   d have  outings and then invite a particular sorority in that. That was pretty common,  and it still is common down there. There   s a term for it.  McDougal Date parties?  Chism Yeah. That was what it was, but it was interesting when you had a date and  you were poor like me. I didn   t have a car in high school or college.  (Laughs) That   s a twist, but we   d walk from the campus with your date.  We   d walk clear to the old Leachman Theatre. Leachman   s now a furniture  store. It   s on Fifth and     Milligan    Main?  Chism Fifth and Main, yeah. Go down there, go up to a movie, and come back and  walk all the way back and go up on the fourth floor of the Student Union  and have a coke and a donut or something and dance. That wasn   t a really  significant date, but today, would they walk down to    That   s more or little  more than a mile, isn   t it?  McDougal Yes. We still have coke dates is what they call them, but we just walk to get a  soda or get ice cream or drive.  Chism The Student Union is now much, so much more complete then, the  remodeling they did is really nice. We had a lot of good friends, but I  haven   t kept in touch with those in the fraternity as much as I   ve kept track  and kept up with the high school friends.  Milligan Really?  12  Chism Our high school class, class of    54, we still meet once a month at Coney  Island in the west side of Tulsa, just amazing. I don   t go because it   s ninety  miles away, but I go about three or four times a year. This Tyson fellow   s  the only one I   ve kept real close with. It   s ironic that one of my fraternity  brothers is married to   it   s Arlene Jacobson I had, his fianc  , and then they  got married. Then they got divorced. She is now one of (she moved back to  Ponca. She was from Ponca) our closest friends, and we play dominos.  There   s four couples play dominos every Sunday night, and Arlene, she was  married to a Theta Chi brother. Well, then he came out pretty well. He  married a very wealthy individual, and he lives at that fancy retirement  center in Tulsa (his picture was in a paper the other day) where you   ve got  to have some real money to live at that retirement center. I   ll think of the  name in a little bit, but I can   t. Small world.  Milligan You knew her from college then? That   s interesting.  Chism Yeah. He introduced me and all of that. After that, she moved back to Ponca  and was a member of our church and still is a member of our church and in  our Sunday school class and one of our closest friends. We were with them  last night.  Milligan That   s neat.  Chism Yeah, small world.  Milligan It is. You said you were involved in a lot of programs or a lot of clubs and  things. What were they?  Chism I was president of the  Business  Toastmaster   s Club. I was president of  Alpha Kappa Psi, which was a business fraternity. I was vice president of  Blue Key. I was the business senator (they had a College of Business  senator), Who   s Who   I don   t know. Seemed like there was some other   .  Milligan Sounds like they   re all, most of them are business or leadership-oriented.  Chism Very much. That   s right, and that   s how I got acquainted with my wife was  they selected somebody for the Tulsa Tribune or something. It was about  homecoming, and they picked out her and me for some reason and to do an  article. They got us together, and I had met her before because she had had a  date with the best-looking guy in our fraternity. She should have stayed with  him because he became a vice president of RCA  Radio Corporation of  America  and a good friend of mine, but anyway, they didn   t. I had met her  before, but then after they put us together for this interview, I must have  asked for a date. Knowing her, she probably asked me after the party.  (Laughter) The test on her was after we had dated, I think, just two times,  13  she was going home to Bartlesville  Oklahoma . My grandmother lived  there. I said,    Call my grandmother and tell her that Brice is doing okay.     Well, I thought,    That   s an unusual request,    but she did it. That was a little  test, on my part, to see if she was really interested, but she was. My  grandmother and her became best of friends. (Laughter) That was our senior  year.  Milligan Told her to go get to know your grandmother. That sounds pretty serious.  (Laughter)  Chism Yeah, and she, we were, started dating our senior year. She was really, as a  matter, Grace was the president of all the women on campus, Association of  Women Students, but at that time, see, we only had 7500 students. She was  real active in a lot of things and still remembers a lot of those things and the  good times that she had on doing that. There   s some really nice ladies that  we knew that came and did similar things, and she   s, Grace is still very  active in all that she does. I   m telling you this to tell a story about   she   s in  six bridge clubs.  Milligan Now?  Chism Yes. She   s seventy-nine years old. She teaches Sunday school to the little  kids. She volunteers at the hospital two days a week. At  Ponca City  Mid-  High  School , she goes on Friday to pass out food to the students that come  there and don   t have any food at home. She   s past president of PEO   Philanthropic Educational Organization . That   s an organization that some  ladies know about. They give scholarships to the university up in Missouri  or somewhere. She   s been past president of that and at probably several  other things that I don   t even, but yeah. Then we play dominos like that on  Sunday. She   s a busy lady. In other words, I have to find my own things to  do, and I do. (Laughter) She   s a great gal, to say the least. Yeah, she   s pretty  active.  Milligan It sounds like she was that active, too, when she was in school.  Chism Yeah, she   s just always been just, and then raising three kids. We   ve been  lucky in a lot of ways. I   m getting off the subject probably, but anyway, I   m  wanting to   .  Milligan That   s okay. It   s all related. We would get there some other direction. This  works just fine.  Chism Okay.  Milligan Oh yeah. You met your wife, and you all started dating your senior year.  What did you do to date in Stillwater? Would that have been    58?  14  Chism Fifty-six,    57,    58. Well, a lot of times you just go to a movie or go up to the  Student Union, or there would be a fraternity party. Grace was never in a  sorority. She lived in Stout Hall all four years. She was not ever interested.  It does cost a little bit more to be in a sorority, and she came from a family  that didn   t have a lot of money. She got a Phillips 66 half-scholarship or  something like that, but she only got that as an alternate. Then one of the  ones who got it dropped out. She was first alternate. That helped a lot.  Milligan How about you? How did you all pay for school?  Chism It   s just amazing. I think about that. How did my mom do that? Starting my  sophomore year, I worked all the time, either at the fraternity house or  somehow grading papers for professors, but a friend of mine graduated. He  had their cleaning business. Well, what does that mean? Well, you go  around and ask your fraternity brothers that    I think those clothes look a  little bit dirty. Let   s get those cleaned and pressed.    You   d take them, and  then you   d send them to the   sometimes when they weren   t there, you   d  take them off their bed, and you   d say,    Those need cleaning.    Then they   d  clean them and bring them back the next day, and I   d deliver them to their  room. I got paid by the cleaners for doing that. Then I became the   third  year, maybe, I don   t know that it was the third year.  I worked in the kitchen one year, pots and pans and all that and serving the  meals, and then I became the manager of the kitchen probably my   I think  it   s the junior year. I can   t remember. That   s too much. Then when I was  working on my master   s, I did work for   no, before I was a   maybe I was  just a senior. I don   t know, but I would grade papers or fill in for the  instructors when they were out of town. Also, in those days, there was a  thing   you ever taken statistics? They had a lab, a statistics lab. I would  help with the statistics lab, and I got paid not a lot. Somehow, we survived,  but in relationship to now because I   ve got two grandkids in college, golly,  it was just dirt cheap. I think the college tuition has gone up at a greater rate  than people   s salaries. Boy, it costs a lot, especially if you   re not on  scholarship. Now then, one thing, there are a lot more scholarships available  than there ever used to be. I never was on scholarship.  Milligan Yeah. Well, and I wonder if that   s a disparity, too, though. It sounds like you  could work and either make your way through school or partially make your  way through school.  Chism I have always said this. If anybody really wants to go, they can go. The  school will help them out. The university will help them out. Their parents  will help them out. You   ve got to have the desire to do that. One of my  things that caused my desire to go up was, this is off. This goes back to my  grandmother. I came from a school that wasn   t very strong. Tulsa Webster  15  was not a strong academic school, and a lot of it was reading  comprehension. My first year-and-a-half, I might have had a two-four, two-five  at best. I was home for the semester, and my grandmother was visiting  my mother. We were talking, and she was probably eighty-five then or  something like that. She learned about my grades, and she just says,    Brice,  why are you in college?    After that, I didn   t say much, but I took off after  that. Had three, four points and a bunch of Bs, but you just needed  something like that. It was there. I didn   t know how to study. Excuse me.  How about a Coca-Cola, a Diet Coke? I   m coughing.  Milligan Let   s take a break. Let   s pause it. Let   s do it again. All right. Here we go.  We were talking about your grandmother. You went to visit your  grandmother while you were in college, and your grade point average was  just    meh.    She   s like,    Why are you doing this? Why are you wasting your  time and our time?     Chism That   s right. It was a key statement. Yeah, she was quite a gal.  Milligan What happened? What did that do for you? What was the point that it broke  for you?  Chism I started studying a lot harder, going to the library to study rather than with a  bunch of guys around the house. Ended up having my own little desk over  there at the library.  Milligan What floor? Do you remember?  Chism Well, it was the fifth floor. If you had a private desk, it was the fifth floor.  Milligan Everybody seems to have their favorite floor to study on. You were on the  fifth because you had your carousel.  Chism Let me see. You asked me something, I think.  Milligan Sorry. (Laughs) I interrupted.  Chism I remember I took shorthand. Well, that helps like crazy when you   re taking  notes. It really does because you could, some of the people couldn   t read my  shorthand, but I could do that. That became better, and I started probably  liking the classes better because just   humanities? Ugh. Never could figure  out why I took that. Have you taken humanities?  McDougal That   s my whole major almost.  Chism It is? See, you   re good at that.  16  McDougal Yes. It just depends on what you like.  Chism I loved history, but the business courses, I really liked. That was a turning  point in my college in a lot of ways. I think I became a lot more active then,  too. If you want something done, you go to the busiest person you know.  It   ll get done, and I think that was part of it, too.  Milligan Did you find that busy person or you became that busy person?  Chism I became the busy person, yeah.  Milligan What made you decide to move out of the fraternity house?  Chism Bored, probably. I knew that I was around two other guys who were just  outstanding individuals. The second one, the one not from McAlister,  became vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City. (Laughs)  He was very   from Sapulpa, Oklahoma. I was tired of the ritual, and it  didn   t excite me anymore in a fraternity house. The first year or two was  okay, but that was primarily the reason. Then of course the people were  upset with me that I moved out. You didn   t do that. A lot of people move  out of sorority and fraternities now. You didn   t do that then, and I did.  Milligan You got involved in a lot of organizations and took on a lot of leadership  roles. What do you think best prepared you to go out into the workforce at  that time?  Chism If I have an assignment, I   ll get it done. For example, this last week right  here, in regard to church and Hospice  of North Central Oklahoma , if I  have an assignment, I   ll go get it done. I still have that. Another thing, too,  and you   ll take this lightly, but it   s true. I really have a gift of gab that  sounds something like,    He knows what he   s talking about.    Sometimes I  did. Got that, a lot of that from selling ladies    shoes in downtown Tulsa,  Chandler   s shoe store. It   s just interesting how you get these skills with that.  I don   t think I had it at birth, but boy, if you weren   t talking to the ladies,  you weren   t going to make any money. I did that through high school and  college in the summertime. I worked selling ladies    shoes. I just had that gift  of gab, and I can organize people. I   m still doing it in this neighborhood if  they want something done. Did you see the nice sign up there where you  pulled in, Stoneridge? Well, that   s all my baby. It comes on, the light, at  night. The watering system, I   m still doing it and going around and calling  on the people and just getting things done and stuff like that. Where it came  from, in regard to your question, I don   t know.  Milligan Seems like that   s a really important skill to be good at business.  Chism Yeah.  17  Milligan Was that something that the school helped you hone or encouraged you to  develop?  Chism Well, we were talking about that old Toastmaster thing. You have to be able  to interview well. I interviewed for Conoco for twenty years. That really  helps if you know how to prepare a resume and can tell people why you can  do a good job with them, and sometimes that   s as important as intellectual  skills. (Laughs) I   m not saying that   s good, but it   s true in this world. The  really, really bright folks don   t necessarily do the best, as far as advancing in  an organization. Yeah.  Milligan Yeah.  Chism College, that really did help me because of the people I was around and  these leadership roles, and there were some fine, fine students down there in  those days. Still are probably anymore.  Milligan Well, let   s talk a little bit about   you and your wife graduated from  undergrad, and your wife got a job teaching in Cushing, right?  Chism Yes.  Milligan You finished your master   s degree at OSU.  Chism Yes.  Milligan What then? What did you do after you got your master   s?  Chism Well, I interviewed with Southwestern Bell. That was the company that you,  well, it   s still an outstanding company, but if you wanted to be a supervisor  pretty quick, that   s who you went with. They interviewed me after I finished  my undergraduate, and they said they were going to hire me. I said,    You  know what? I   m going to think about going to get a master   s.    That  probably wasn   t a very wise decision, but I did it anyway. I got that, and it  was in Oklahoma City at a training program, management training program.  She went to interview for a teaching job  in Oklahoma City . I was sitting  out in the car, and she was smiling. Then she got the job, and it   s going to be  for  3,600 a year. (Laughs) We were so tickled to death. We thought we had  arrived. With a master   s degree, I started with Southwestern Bell for  425 a  month, with a master   s. We didn   t have anything, but we leaned up against  the wall watching a used TV until we got some furniture over on the  northwest side of Oklahoma City.  Milligan Oh, you were in Oklahoma City?  18  Chism Yeah, Oklahoma City for, and then we, after the training program was over,  which was right at a year, moved to Tulsa with Southwestern Bell. Then she  taught there for a short time until we started our family.  Milligan Over in Tulsa?  Chism Yes.  Milligan What   d you do with Southwestern Bell?  Chism My degree was in business. They had a department called accounting, and  you would do the, my first job, other than far as being a supervisor, I had the  accounts payable group. The bills would come in, and for various things that  vendors would do for Southwestern Bell. We would pay them on a, more  than a typing machine, but it wasn   t very computerized at all. It was  mechanized but not very computerized, and enjoyed that. It was at Seventh  and Elgin there in Tulsa. I   m trying to think. Must have been, I think, yeah,  only a year there or fifteen months, they were going to promote me up to a  computer programming group in Saint Louis, but at the same time as this  was happening, within a week, the Berlin Crisis. Have you ever read about  the Berlin Crisis in your history?  Milligan Yes.  Chism I was in the Air National Guard. They called me up. I was wanting to go to  Saint Louis, and they called me up. I went clear out to the Tulsa airport for  eleven months. That was my duty. (Laughter)  Milligan That was your military duty was     Chism That was my   .  Milligan You were living in Tulsa, and you went to the Tulsa airport.  Chism Oh yeah, living in Tulsa, coming home every night with Mr. Tyson, my  old   he   d moved to Tulsa, too. We had a good time. We didn   t have to  work very hard.  Milligan Why were you in the Air National Guard? When did you go and do that?  Chism In those days, you had to either sign up with the military some way, or if  you   re coming out of college, you had to spend two years in the Air  National Guard or one of those, Navy, something. It was mandatory. You  didn   t have to sign up to be a foot soldier. Air Force, I was in the ROTC.  That   s just a paperboy here in Ponca City. We   d deliver it right to the door.  19  Milligan Right to the door, even your backdoor.  Chism He   ll get out of the car, or his dad will or uncle. Even in the wintertime, it   s  nice. You don   t have to go outside with your cold feet on it. You just reach  out, and the paper   s right there. This is a nice little town.  Milligan They do not do that at my house.  Chism This is a nice little town.  Milligan You chose the Air National Guard, then, for your time, but that was way  after you got done with high school then.  Chism Oh yeah. Well, I got into ROTC in the university, in college. Then from  that, we   yeah, we moved to Oklahoma City, yeah. Then I went out there to  Will Rogers Airport on one Saturday or weekend a month, something like  that, and then we moved to Tulsa when we transferred from Air National  Guard in Oklahoma City over to Tulsa. Then that   s when the Berlin Crisis  called. About eleven months in it, then I moved on to Saint Louis.  Milligan You did go to Saint Louis, then?  Chism Yeah.  Milligan Was that with computer programming?  Chism Yeah, but with Southwestern Bell.  Milligan What did computer programming consist of, and what was that, 1962,  three?  Chism Yeah,    63 because I came here to Ponca in    65, yeah. That would   ve been     63.  Milligan What were you doing? (Laughs)  Chism Well, you learn, in those days, we only had mainframes. These little  computers now are more powerful than the mainframe. We would write  programs, accounts payable, billing of customers, billing of telephone  customers for the use of their telephone in those days. That   s one of the  things that   s gone down in this world is the cost of telephone service to you  and I. It costs a lot. I mean, to make a long-distance call, that was serious  business. I did a lot of that programming.  Milligan How did you learn how to do that programming?  20  Chism Southwestern Bell sent me to a school in Saint Louis out on    can   t think of  the name of that street, but anyway. I was worried about it because I didn   t  know a thing about that, and I didn   t take a job with IBM because I was  afraid of computers. They said,    Well, we   re going to teach you how to,     and they did teach me how to   IBM, it was an IBM school. It was a pretty  good location because it   s only two blocks from the Playboy Club.  (Laughter)  Milligan Now how did you know that? (Laughter)  Chism I didn   t ever become a member, but it was a good place to go eat. If you  could go with a member, I mean, it was a great place to go eat. When  Playboy Clubs were in existence around then, that was a nice place to go for  a dinner. It really was. Then I stayed there and did programming for   .  Milligan It   s okay. I think it   s mine somewhere.  Chism Okay. Well, pick it up.  Milligan No, no.  Chism At Christmas of    64, I was home visiting with my mother in Tulsa, and I  looked in the Tulsa World. Conoco had an ad in their computer department  looking for employees, and through a personnel agency. I went through, and  I did that. Oh, I think I was to a point where I was not pleased with how I  was getting promoted to Southwestern Bell. That   s probably the crime, but  then I came to Conoco and on a Saturday interview. Still remember it like it  was yesterday, and that was in probably January or February of    65. Then I  came to Conoco in March or April of    65.  Milligan Do you remember what your interview was like?  Chism Oh yeah. The big boss man, he was so smooth. Everybody fell in love with  him, but they said,    We want you to also interview with this group.    It was  more of a research group, and that wasn   t my cup of tea. I can still  remember these two guys, Charles Bartlett and another fellow. I could tell  immediately we, this was not a match, but with the boss man and some  others, it really was. They didn   t assign me to that group. They hired me, but  they didn   t assign me to that group. I can still remember that interview with  the big boss. He always wore a cardigan sweater, smoked these real long  cigarettes in his office.  Milligan Four inches long?  Chism Yeah, puffing. We just ended up, became friends after that.  21  Milligan What was the position that you were interviewing for? Did you know?  Chism It was still a computer analyst. It was the move. I did that. I was fair at it, but  I wasn   t really good. I never was a good computer programmer, but on the  other hand, I had this other skill in regard to supervising people and getting  them to do things that they enjoyed. They put me in what they call     computer operations.    Well, in those days, that was key punch. Have you  ever even heard of a key punch? (Laughs) That   s where you key in the data  into punch cards in contrast to everything being on disk or tape. They put  me there and worked, had several groups, but it was primarily, it was a mid-level  management group. Enjoyed it, but one of the things I   ll still remember  is its seventy-five key punch operators were all ladies. Man, you just never,  ever show preference to any one person, even though they may be the best  in regard to absenteeism, accuracy, and all that. Boy, that   s one of the things  you, especially having it now then. You had to be real careful in doing that.  Milligan What would happen if you didn   t?  Chism Oh, they   d get in a bitch fight because they were jealous, and that happened  to me one time. I congratulated a lady. Still remember her name, Georgia  Chambers, fifteen years, I think, or twenty years of perfect attendance,  perfect. In front of the entire group, I congratulated her. My boss found out  about that and said,    Don   t you ever do that. It   ll cause you trouble down the  road.    (Laughs) That was an interesting lesson, whether it was true or not,  but to some extent, it is.  Milligan Did anything happen when you     Chism Well, I don   t know. I can   t remember all of the details, but I know that they  were, some of them were jealous of her. She wasn   t, as far as accuracy, a  key   but I thought that was a great thing, fifteen or twenty years of perfect  attendance. You don   t find that these days.  Milligan That   s interesting, though, because I think we think now in management it   s  good to have ways to praise in some of those instances.  Chism Yeah. That   s right. The times have changed. We now are in more of a team  atmosphere in business, too. That   s right. You want to praise. Look for  reasons to praise people.  Milligan Did women, at that time, what positions did they have at Conoco?  Chism We had the programmers, and they were very good. Then they become  senior, our analysts where they didn   t necessarily do the programming. They  would design the thing and what its purpose was and all, but then somebody  else would do the programming. Being a computer analyst was, I really  22  think that it was one of the really good jobs that women could get and move  on up. There weren   t that many. Schoolteacher, everybody thought of  schoolteacher, and that was an, they could use their skills and their  knowledge and organizational abilities. I think the computer programming,  in those days, probably was, because we   d offer them (believe me, this  is   .) exact to the dollar on opening offer.  Milligan As you would for men?  Chism Oh yeah.  Milligan I think it   s interesting because now today, we think that computer  programming and computers in general is a really male-dominated field,  but then I wonder why computer programming and analysis was more open  to women at that time.  Chism I don   t like that, well, I think that is when I was telling you that there were  more women coming out of college. Maybe if you had this many women  and a fewer men, on percentage basis, women are going to get more of the  jobs. We had them. We hired just as many women as we did men, and we  hired a lot in the Conoco computer department. We would hire up to seventy  a year just here in Ponca City.  Milligan Did you have many women that elevated to managerial platforms or  positions?  Chism Yeah, one from   what   s on the border of Arkansas and Texas? Ah, there   s a  town.  Milligan Texarkana?  Chism Yeah, Texarkana. Her name was Cinda Hallman from Texarkana, and I   ll  just make it real short, if I can. She was real into work harder than anybody,  attractive gal, hardnosed when she needed to be, and she got promoted  several times. Then I was the manager of our computer center in London  and brought her over there, and she   s just outstanding there. Then she got  promoted. She   s the only person that I   ve ever get on a double promotion,  from analyst on up to supervising analyst or something. That   s the only  person I   ve ever gave a double promotion to. She went on to then come back  to Ponca City and then got everybody else all the talent that she had, and she  got promoted up to DuPont, which was our parent company.  From there, she became a vice president of   I don   t know what group up  there because I lost track, but then she became, she was on the board of a  giant personnel agency that did business all over. She became president of  that, chairman of the board from this little old girl from Texarkana, and then  23  a few years later, she got brain cancer and died at the age of about, oh my  goodness, probably in her mid-fifties. You just never know about these  things. She was an outstanding. She was always the best employee, but she  went. I   ll never forget that. At the end, she was with Conoco. Yeah, she was  only interested in herself. That   s too bad because she had a lot of talent, but  she was not a sweet person. (Laughs)  Milligan Was that something that was more common with managers, that they were  team players at that point?  Chism I think so. There was always a lot of politics back in those days, a lot of  politics.  Milligan That   s interesting.  Chism She was so   harassment of a woman. She was so bound and determined to  go to the top. She did, but sometime you have to be not very nice. Yeah, I   ll  never forget her. She was an interesting character. I get off the subject,  right?  Milligan No, I actually think that that   s really interesting. I think it   s interesting, well,  for a lot of reasons because I do think that it   s one of those things that  there   s been more study recently in that balance between what men   s and  women   s roles were in business. For that time period, I think it is really  interesting to get a sense, but I also wonder, it   s one of those things that   do  you think it was hard for her to be a woman in that male-dominated field  with all the different men managers?  Chism Oh yeah. She was going to work, and she did. She worked twice as hard as  anybody else. She   d do extra things. She   d do extra things instead of   in  other words, she wrote a, it was not a book, but it was pretty close to, on  how to organize and develop a new computer system. Here   s the steps  you   ve got to go through. That wasn   t part of her assignment at all. She did  that at night. You can always find ways to do your job better. You could  give me any job in the world. You tell me about that job, and I can tell you  how to do it better. President of the United States, a guy that delivers or  picks up garbage, you think about that, any job, and I can come up with  something that he could do a better job or she could do a better job. It   s an  old term we used to, whole man, whole job. We ought to call it now whole  woman or man and whole job, but I really believe that. You can know about,  in other words, if you tell me more about the details for your job, I can come  up with something that you could do it better.  Milligan Sure.  Chism That   s interesting.  24  Milligan Yeah, yeah. Did you say that you were over a branch of Conoco in London?  Chism Yeah. We had a computer center there.  Milligan In England?  Chism In England. We would serve primarily London, but we had subsidiaries in  Belgium, Ireland, Switzerland, Germany if I didn   t say Germany. They had  small computer centers there, and we had a large one there. I was the first  expatriate from our computer department to go over there, and that was fun  because we didn   t have any help on how to find a place to live, where the  kids to go to school. We had a pretty good idea on that, but yeah, that was  from    73 through    76 or something like that. That   s what it was called,  though.  Milligan You took your family over to England?  Chism Oh yeah, and I   ll still, yeah, I can remember that same big boss called me on  a Saturday morning and wanted to know if I   d like to do that. Well, the wife,  she was okay with it. She didn   t want to, but the kids, they didn   t like that at  all. They wanted it to, but they ended up getting a wonderful education.  Milligan What grades were they in? Do you remember?  Chism Gosh.  Milligan Were they in high school or junior high?  Chism No, no, they weren   t in high school yet, probably in mid-junior high or mid,  and one of the reasons, it was called the American School in London. The  American teachers could go over there and make a lot of money and not  have to pay US taxes. You got the best teachers. For example, Julie, the  movie over in Switzerland, what   s that?  Milligan Sound of Music?  Chism Sound of Music. (Laughs) One morning, they were going down to school,  and this big old limo pulls up. It was     Milligan    Julie Andrews.  Chism    Julie Andrews, and her kids, little old kids popped out of the backseat.  They were about this tall running in the school.  Milligan Just toddlers, yeah.  25  Chism There was some real   it was an outstanding school. One day, middle girl,  middle child said,    Dad, I need  75 to go on a field trip.    I said,    Seventy-five  dollars? That seems like a lot. Well, where are you going?    She said,     We   re going to Greece to the Acropolis and look around there. It   s part of  our history class or something.       Yeah, I think we can handle seventy-five.     That included the airfare, everything. No, it was a wonderful school. They   d  have intramurals and go to France just to play a volleyball game. That was a  great, great experience, and when they came back, they had a really good  background, excellent school.  Milligan Was it hard to come back to Ponca City?  Chism No. I   m such a sports nut that I wanted to go, and they, the shopping is  harder. In other words, you   .  Milligan Grocery shopping or clothes shopping?  Chism Oh yeah, both, primarily grocery shopping. In each little community, you   d  have a hardware store, and they had a little grocery store or just vegetables  and things. You had to go shopping more often. They finally did get a  Safeway in over there.  Milligan Over in London where you were at?  Chism Yeah. We were there when the first McDonald   s came into London and the  first Safeway. The first day at McDonald   s, we were,    All right.     McDougal Yes. (Laughter)  Chism Yeah, that was a good   we were there three years.  Milligan How was it for you to work there?  Chism It was fun that you got to make your own decisions. Good or bad, you had to  live with them. You didn   t have any backup. Well, you had a long-distance  call back to Ponca City, Oklahoma. I like that. In the beginning, the people  were really dubious of me, an American coming in. For example, I had a  boy, a gentleman who was a full communist on the staff when I got there.  Well, I never had even met a communist and some things like that. It was  hard because they were just different.    Let   s go to lunch.    Okay. Well,  they   d go to lunch at a local pub, and they   d drink two pints of ale or so.  Well, I couldn   t do that because I   d go to sleep in the afternoon. They  thought that I was going to join them in that, and I did for about two days.  Now this is not good. I wasn   t accepted. I think later on I was accepted, but  it was difficult. I was glad to get back.  26  Milligan You were glad to get back to Oklahoma?  Chism Yeah, and I   m a big sports nut. In other words, they   .  Milligan For football or national or college?  Chism All of the above because I enjoyed going to the OSU games. Every once and  a while, we   d get a football game on TV, and that was about it.  Milligan In England?  Chism Yeah. On purpose, we lived in a place no other Americans around. Did that  on purpose and to let the kids experience that, and we did. We   d get on the  old tube, as we called it, and it   d stop, there was a tube stop right by their  school. I   d go on down into town. Yeah, I was glad to get back, but I learned  a lot. You learned a lot about yourself because you   re in a whole  different   and they   d been supervised in a different manner, pretty loosey-goosey.  Milligan Why did they bring you over?  Chism I think the fact that I had worked in several groups, did some programming  and then computer operations that I could fit in over there. Then what  happened is   I   m trying to think back. Yeah, the guy who was the boss, I  didn   t go over there as the manager. I was down at the, I didn   t go over there  as the manager. I came over there as just a next level down, and then they let  the manager go because he was too loosey-goosey. Then one of my best  friends, they decided, who was more of an excellent employee than me by  quite a bit, he was going to come over there and be the manager. Then he  came over there, and everything is all set with his wife. On the way back on  the airplane, his wife had a nervous breakdown on the plane over, coming  out over the ocean. (Laughs)  Milligan About moving or just, no, just a breakdown in general?  Chism No, just in general. She had been on some medication. The next day, he  called me and said,    Dave   s not going to be able to be the manager over  there. I   m asking you to stay another year and be the manager.    I   d forgotten  all about that, but that   s how it happened. They didn   t send me over there to  be the manager, just to be just below the manager level. I remember that.  I   m glad you asked that question because I   d have forgotten about that. We  stayed another year or two.  27  Milligan Were there differences between managing people in the London branch than  there were, for example, in Ponca City, other than the noontime drinking?  (Laughter)  Chism No, no, no. No, I didn   t   we built the staff up pretty good, and we had a  good reputation. We were doing what we were supposed to do, and I still  remember we were   one of the hardest things, and people said we couldn   t  do it, was this computer center with these big mainframes and all this  equipment, we decided to move up   have you ever been to London?  Milligan Yeah.  Chism Move our offices from south of the Thames that got bombed out during the  war to behind Selfridges, the office right behind Selfridges. I said,    Well, we  can   t have any downtime. We   ve got to do that on the weekend.    They said,     Well, that   s not possible.    Well, we did it on the weekends. Had to do a  little pushing and shoving, but that was a fun time to do that. That   s where  we were, right behind Selfridges.  Milligan I would guess you   d just pulled overtime, and everyone   .  Chism Yeah, that   s right. Well, IBM, primarily, had to do it because you disconnect  that and then take that thing and take it up on a rope up on the roof and then  into a   there was a lot to it. (Laughs)  Milligan Moving all your computer equipment was a big deal.  Chism Oh yeah, and then the computer and the offices. Then if somebody had a  program that needed to run on Monday, it had to run on Monday because it  could be payroll or whatever.  Milligan Did you lease your equipment from IBM then?  Chism Yes.  Milligan Got it. That makes sense.  Chism Yeah, I leased it. They may have purchased some of it. Primarily, it was all  leased. At those times, you leased it because the obsolescence became so  quick that you bought it, you were not being smart about it because you  know it   d be obsolete in another year or two. That   s the way things are now.  Obsolescence goes at a faster and faster rate. That   s the thing about these  iPhones and iPads. It   s crazy, isn   t it?  Milligan Yep. Everyone   s got a drawer full of old phones now.  28  Chism Yep. I hate it. (Laughs)  Milligan You can   t have a drawer full of old IBM mainframe computers. (Laughter)  Chism No, and these things are just as powerful. It   s amazing what they   my  friends who depend upon a cellphone with a lot of power to do their job,  they   re in real estate business, something like that. I   ve got a little old cheap  cellphone and we hardly use it. We only use it for security purposes. We   re  not into that pretty big at all.  Milligan Well, I think it   s interesting you worked in technology. I mean, it sounds like  a long time.  Chism Yeah, but I   m not techy. Goes all back to being able to get things to, have  people do things and enjoy doing it. Never was a good techy still, not now,  either.  Milligan When you moved back to Oklahoma, what did you do once you came back?  Did you go back into your old position, or did you do something new?  Chism No, I managed a group of computer analysts.  Milligan Okay. That   s what you were doing before?  Chism Yeah. Well, no, I wasn   t the boss then, but then I came back.  Milligan Got it.  Chism I had a group of people, and then I got involved maybe even before I went to  London. I don   t know. Nobody had this permanent job.    We need to go  recruit new people. You go here, and you go here.    I always went to OSU,  of course, and Hays, Fort Hays  Kansas  and some places like that, and  always enjoyed that, getting back on campus because I knew some of the  people at OSU that were still over there in the College of Business. That   s  where I was recruiting. We were in   I   m trying to think. I grew up in old  Morrill Hall, yeah, and then I   d go over to the...then they   d have the present  College of Business, and I   d go visit those people. Now they   re building a  brand-new one, and it   s going to be a monster.  Milligan It   s huge.  Chism Is that Thatcher or Hanner that they tore down to do this? I can   t remember.  I always, still got Thatcher and Hanner mixed up, but it   s right in behind the  present College of Business. We were down there the other day. I really  always enjoyed that, and then, because people now, I   ll see them somewhere  here in town. We   ll talk about the day that I interviewed them for the first  29  time or I hired them, and that makes me feel better than anything else, that I  had a small play in them doing so well.  Milligan It sounds like you did, a lot of your job was recruitment for Conoco as well.  Chism That   s right, yeah. Went to a lot of universities to do that. The knack on that  is, and this is back to some of the stuff at OSU, you   ve got to learn to listen.  You   re not learning a darn thing while you   re talking. You don   t ever ask  yes-no questions. It   s always,    Tell me about   ,    and once you get them to  talking, you can learn a lot about folks and what character they have and  what they   ve done that they   re proud of. I used to ask, we   d,    Tell me about  the thing that you   re the most proud of in your whole life.    Boy, you get  some interesting answers, but you sure learn a lot about them. I   m always  like,    Tell me about   .    That   s my phrase. You   re learning all about  interviewing now. What are you hoping to be able to go do next year?  McDougal Well, I   m going into library science. I want to do something similar working  in the library.  Chism Okay.  Milligan You would make a good oral historian.  McDougal Yeah. Sure would.  Milligan How long did you end up working at Conoco?  Chism Sixty-five to    93, whatever that, twenty-seven, twenty-eight day. I was lucky  I retired when I was fifty-six-and-a half, and they were thinking about, well,  due to a reorganization or DuPont doing it, they were going to have some,  ask people if they would like to. They ask a group of us, and I had been  thinking about doing this anyway. Their timing was great for me because at  Conoco and all the other petroleum companies, you had to be at least fifty-six-  and-a half to get the really good benefits. My timing was great. You had  vacation built up. You had, oh, something else, but we lived off just our  sever   oh, then you got a severance. That   s right. We lived off our  severance and vacation pay for three years.  Milligan Wow.  Chism Yeah, we really, really have been lucky. That was about January 1 of    93 is  when I retired, and I haven   t had to go to Walmart yet as a greeter. As a  matter of fact, I haven   t worked one day.  Milligan Since 1993?  30  Chism Not in ink, but I love investing. I love researching companies and things like  that, and then you   ve got to be a little bit lucky, too. I   m an investor. That   s  my job. I spend a day or about an hour a day in there on the old computer  doing different things. Not everybody can be that lucky.  Milligan Have you done that your entire adult career?  Chism No, no. Problem, all I had is some investments, small, before I retired, but  then you have your retirement, this severance pay, something else. I got a  lump sum. I did not take what they call an annuity. I took the lump sum and  started investing it in mutual funds and things that I had confidence in.  Didn   t ever do anything really risky. Diversification, diversification,  diversification, just stay with that. Now I   m lucky that, and Grace hasn   t,  either, but you end up with more now after all this time because not patient,  I   m not a patient person. (Laughs) I   ve been pretty lucky really, been pretty  lucky, and didn   t go for the short-term stuff. Just stay with it. It   s going to  go up, but boy, sometimes you get nervous when it drops like it did  yesterday. You just stay in there.  Milligan Well, you   ve got to be a fairly patient person to play the market.  Chism Yeah, yeah. I guess I   m immune now. I   m paranoid. I watch it every day.  Hey, don   t laugh. It   s sometimes two or three times a day. (Laughter)  Milligan I   m just thinking, wondering if you have to have blood pressure medication.  (Laughter)  Chism No, but you get immune. If it goes, drops way down, then you just, because  you know it   s going to come back or not going to be the end of the world. I  just love that, just love that, but you   ve got to have some money to start off  with then.  Milligan What were some of the big changes you saw in the petroleum industry or  what you did with Conoco over that time period? That company changed  quite a bit in that course of time.  Chism Yeah. About that, we always just worked so well together, and we didn   t  have assigned teams or designated    you   re in group A    or anything like that.  We did work together, but then just before I retired, they started having  these fancy consultants come in. They   re going to tell us how to change the  business, and we   re going to do this. I didn   t like that, and we just liked the  way it was. Quite a few of us got, we just didn   t want to participate in that. I  think that   s the main thing is that started what they call, was it farming out?  Is that the right   ?  Milligan Contracting?  31  Chism Contracting and farming out, something else, and where you   d, and bring in  other consultants. They   d tell you how to run your business if you   ve been  doing it pretty well. That   s the main thing, bringing in consultants and  farming out and having this particular whole job farmed out to somebody,  and the purpose being you could have less employees, but it costs you in the  long run. We did that. They started farming out a lot of the computer  activities. I think that   s the main thing, and we were pretty good folks and  ran it like it should be, we think. You might erase this, but Phillips  Petroleum who bought us out, they   re a lot different. They don   t have the  care and interest of the people like we did when it was just Conoco.  Milligan If you don   t want that, if you don   t want to say that publicly, you can tell me  that.  Chism Yeah. Yeah, I don   t want to talk about Phillips   s.  Milligan Do you want me to take that part out, or is that part okay just to stay?  Chism That part   s okay.  Milligan Okay, good. We won   t get into it, though.  Chism Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Milligan That   s one of those things, right? Conoco   .  Chism It hurt this little community a bunch.  Milligan When they came in, when Phillips did?  Chism Well, at least our, they took all the, a lot of our high-level, high-paid to  Houston and to Bartlesville. It hurt this town. We   re still doing all right,  but   .  Milligan I mean, you can see in Ponca City that Conoco had a huge impact in  building it, building it up maybe.  Chism Oh yeah. Yeah. We still have a really good refinery, but that   s about what   s  here is our refinery. We had a lot of good ones. The computer department   s  gone. The accounting department   s gone. (Laughs) There   s no really top  executive here. It   s sad.  Milligan Let   s talk about the, you were over the computer analysts, it sounds like, for  a while. Is that the main job that you had for the longest was managing  computer analysis, analysts?  32  Chism I   m just trying to   yeah. That really is true, isn   t it, but I also had then the,  in addition to the analysts, the people who would run the computers and file  the data, whether it be on a disk or on a tape. Had some of that, too, but the  answer is yes.  Milligan How did those roles change over that period of time? If they did, they may  not have very much.  Chism It changed because the technology changed. In other words, the computers  were able to do more, and therefore, it had, an example would be we used to  have all the data onto these magnetic tapes. Then they went to disk, and that  did away with all the people that worked in the tape library. It   d just go on  and on, and then the computers became easier to program. That changed  how many computer programmers you needed, and then the computers  became smaller. You needed less space. It   s all about technology, not hardly  very much at all about the people. Technology changed, and it   s still  changing.  Milligan Did the skills that you needed to hire people with, did that change?  Chism No. I don   t think that changed one iota.  Milligan When you were in London for that period of time, were the computer  analysts over there and programmers over there primarily women like they  were here?  Chism No. There were definitely more men, definitely more men.  Milligan That   s interesting.  Chism I   m trying to think. Yeah. No, it was more men, and I don   t know if that   s  because Europe was a little behind us on that. I don   t know if they are now  or not.  Milligan I don   t have an answer. I just think it   s interesting.  Chism Yeah. Maybe in the United States, I don   t know. I   m hoping that that is the  case that the women were able to prove themselves and put in situations that  just, they weren   t ready for that.  Milligan Was that women to men ratio in your office, did that stay pretty steady the  whole course that you were there?  Chism Golly, that   s a good question. I can   t remember, but I think the answer is  yes, it probably did stay. A lot of people, for example, these were adults.  They didn   t have cars because the train service was so good. (Laughs)  33  Milligan In England?  Chism Yeah. You didn   t really need, you could get by without a car pretty easy.  Yeah. I met some really, really nice people there.  Milligan I didn   t mean to skip around. I just thought of that, and I   m wondering   .  Chism No, no, yeah, that   s right because I know, I see where you   that   s a good  question. I don   t know if that stayed pretty much the same. There were more  men and just have some different experiences when   when they have a  strike over there, their transportation system goes on strike, what do you do?  Well, I had a car. I would go, and I didn   t   London is tough to find your  way. You   ve got to have what they call an A-Z and go pick up key punch  operators to bring them to work because I had to get the job done that day.  You didn   t have any choice. (Laughs) There was no train, no bus. They were  all on strike  (Laughs) You   d think,    Well, that wouldn   t happen.    Yeah, it  did  I can still remember, interesting, yeah. London   s an interesting place in  regard to trying to find your way around. The street we   d worked on right  there by, it was about three blocks from the US Embassy. It changed names  three times in three blocks  Isn   t that weird? Just, yeah, changed always.  That   s something. Those were good times. Brings back some good  memories, brings back some good   .  Milligan I   m just thinking you   re pretty brave to   .  Chism Well, it was, yeah, I   .  Milligan London   s a busy city to   .  Chism Go over there and try to find a place to live for your family. You don   t even  know where to start. Now they have employees who will help you find a  place, find a school for your kids, give you banking information, where to  bank and all of that. They didn   t have any of that for me.  Milligan How did you find it?  Chism Got on the train and stopped, got off at every stop. Got onto and got off at  every stop and go in and knock and then go to the real estate office (there   s  usually one at every tube stop), just ask questions. There   s one place I  stopped, and they said,    We don   t know, but we think down here about a  block and a half, number such-and-such, they   re getting ready to move to  Canada. They might be interested.    I walked down there and knocked on the  door. Ended up taking that place, and we   d pay the rent based upon the  exchange rate between the pound and the US dollar in the Wall Street  Journal the first of each month. That   s how much I   d pay. See, sometimes  you just got to do it. There   s a famous saying. I don   t know who the author.  34     If it is to be, it   s up to me.    I think it was Descartes (I   ll look that up in a  little while), a French philosopher, Descartes, but keep that in mind. It   s  something, I used to have that in my desk drawer and pull that out. When  times get tough, pull that baby out and read that. It   s not a bad idea because  you were having, you have some tough times being the director of down  there. You have some challenges, don   t you? Put that in your little desk  drawer. (Laughs)    If it is to be, it is up to me.     Milligan You need to put it on my wall. (Laughter)  Chism Yeah. (Laughs) Got to just go do it, yeah.  Milligan That   s the truth sometimes, isn   t it? Well, I think I got about a couple more  questions maybe.  Chism Well, maybe Anna, she   s probably just burning to ask some.  McDougal I   m trying to think. Go ahead. I   ll keep formulating.  Chism Please do because I   d like to see questions from your age group.  Milligan Yeah, it   d be fun.  McDougal Yeah, I   ll keep thinking. Go ahead and ask the ones you have.  Milligan Well, I think one of the most important is tell me about the proudest moment  in your life.  Chism Well, that   s a goody.  Milligan You asked people for twenty years. I   m curious if you   ve put thought in it.  Chism I   m trying to think of the normal things in regard to marrying somebody that  you lucked out with for fifty-eight years, yeah, fifty-eight this year, but there  was something   huh. It wasn   t military for sure.  Milligan It   s a tough question.  Chism Hmm. Other than family because everyone, a lot of people answer,     Family.     Milligan Well, if it   s true, it   s okay to answer that way.  Chism Yeah, I know it because we   ve had some really good, and as all families,  we   ve had some challenges, not with the wife and I, but your growing kids  that have gotten in, that are independent cusses. It wasn   t being the leader of  35  organizations. I don   t think that. No, that was, but I don   t know why I  haven   t asked myself that question.  Milligan You tortured all these kids all those years with that question.  Chism Yeah, I know. I know. (Laughter) I think it   s just the fact that people would  come to me years later and say,    I remember that day when I was working  for you and you went to bat for me    because there   s been quite a few of  those. It wasn   t just one. I think it   s a (what am I trying to say?)  conglomerate of those that have said,    Thanks for being my boss    because  I   ve had people that I run in out at the Po-Hi  Ponca City High School   football game that   ll still come up and say, yeah, because    I know you went  to bat for me during the annual evaluation sessions    and how much they  appreciated it. Yeah, there   s still some that I   .  Milligan Supporting your employees.  Chism Yeah. That might be the thing that made me the happiest, though. Lately  (this is not my happiest, but it   s, close us out), my younger daughter, the one  that   s, she had a divorce about four years ago, and they   ve got remarried.  The difference between her first husband and the new husband is ten million  miles. (Laughs) In other words, she   s got it made now. She   s got a good job.  She   s got money. She   s happy. (Laughter)  Milligan That is what you want for your kids. That is without a doubt.  Chism That   s right. I do. Yeah, that   s turned, that really made me happy.  Milligan I think being proud of your legacy as a boss is not a bad thing to be proud  of, but you can think on it. One more thing, I kept thinking about this, and I  kept forgetting to ask it. Your wife, the only thing I really know about her is  she started out as a teacher in Cushing. Did she keep teaching all that time,  or did she stay home?  Chism No, no, she stopped when we moved here, but it   s not like she didn   t work  in Saint Louis when we went up there. She didn   t work   .  Milligan Well, you had kids by that point.  Chism Yeah, I had kids. She did some part-time work out of Conoco in the retail  credit center, just part-time work. She never did teach here, but I think, yeah,  she substituted some. She   s still doing the   the ones she helps at church are  first graders, and that   s what she had is first graders, yeah.  Milligan Little kids.  36  Chism Little kids. She works real   but the times have changed at churches, as you  know. You don   t have the kids. She   ll work real hard on preparing a lesson  for Sunday, and then maybe two or three will show up.  Milligan Which church do you go to?  Chism First Methodist. We   ve been part of the woodwork on that since we came  here in    65. We   re still very active and always will be until   it   s just a good  place. That   s where our friends are, but all the churches, we have this  smaller membership now. Most of them do, though the Baptist churches  here are doing real well, and that   s fine.  Milligan All right, Anna.  McDougal I do have one actually, and this is something pretty relevant for me, too, just  because I   m about to graduate. What would you say is the most important  thing a graduate should take away from the college experience, either  education or just the experience? What was one of your most important  things you took away from going to OSU?  Chism Probably (is there such a thing?) being well-rounded, not the smartest person  on the block, sure not a quiet person, a good listener, but being well-rounded  is probably, and not afraid to go after your goals. I think that if you wanted  to, you got to, yeah, you have to sell yourself. You   re going into more of a,  not so much people-oriented in anything you   ll have, but the area where  you   re going into is   .  Milligan It is now.  McDougal Yeah. (Laughs)  Chism It is? It   s getting more and more so than   yeah.  Milligan It   s changed a lot, speaking of industries of change. Library jobs have  changed.  Chism Of course, the old golden rule is not too bad. (Laughter) Pretty good because  if you treat people, they   re going to respect you, and the old, stay out of the  gossip business. (Laughs) It   ll all just come back to bite you, but being well-rounded,  I think.  McDougal Is that something you took away from the people you met at OSU or just  time?  Chism I think so. Of course, some of it   s God-given, and your family, that helps a  lot. Intelligence is just so important. You don   t have to be the geophysical  37  scientist or anything like that, but you need to be able to research and then  sell your ideas. Don   t be afraid. I   m on the Hospice board here, which is the  finest organization, local organization, and I   m just enjoying that so much  because I, the other people didn   t necessarily come from business. There   s  doctors. I   m in good shape on the business side of it. They   re just amazed  that      you don   t want to do that.    Yeah. (Laughter) Yeah, Hospice is a  good organization. Well, do you think, Anna, that you are a well-rounded  person? You seem like it. You   re a happy person, aren   t you?  McDougal Yes, yes, very much so.  Chism Yeah, you   re a happy person. You don   t think in negatives too much. I have  a son who   s disabled, and of course, yeah, he   s negative 90 percent of the  time. I know we have a fellow that I play cards with. He   s 99 percent  negative. We wish he didn   t even show up to play. (Laughter) No, I think  you   ll do fine. I think you   re going to do fine. You   ll get into that, and then  you never know. Some of these whys in the road, some of those might  happen. Now how about the, is the pay really important to you, or you just  want a good salary so you can have a decent living? Is the pay way up there  or in the middle?  McDougal It   s probably in the middle for me in importance, to be honest.  Chism What do your dad or mom do?  McDougal My dad works for Hewlett-Packard, and then my mom is an office manager  for a pool company.  Chism Well, your dad probably is good friend of Carly   s.  McDougal Maybe. I don   t know. I   ll have to ask. It was EDS and then Hewlett-Packard  down in Dallas.  Chism Carly Fiorina   s who, I thought that   .  McDougal Oh. (Laughter) No, I don   t know.  Chism She   s something else. A few weeks ago, I would have voted for her. I don   t  know anymore. I don   t even know what   s happening.  McDougal I don   t, either. It   s too much. (Laughs)  Milligan You probably can   t keep up at all. It   s changing every second.  McDougal Yeah, it is.  38  Chism That it is, and it   s sad. It really is because it   s   ah, we won   t get onto that.  Milligan We can do it after we, because we   re closing up. Is there anything else that  you want to talk about? We   ve been going about an hour and half, which is  neither here nor there. It   s just to let you know.  Chism Grace and I both, we just really loved our experiences at OSU, and we  stayed loyal and still are loyal for all these years with the athletic events.  Milligan Oh, we   re going to take pictures of your bathroom, too, before we leave.  Chism Yeah, that   s fine.  Milligan We   re impressed with your bathroom.  McDougal Yes. (Laughs)  Chism Some good things happened there for us to stay loyal for so long. We still do  the wave and the whole bit, and we   ll go to a watch party tomorrow at the  country club where they   ll have some hors d   oeuvres, big deal. Pay five  dollars, get some food, and then watch the ballgame with the other people  who graduated from OSU. When they first came out with the lifetime  alumni association memberships, I think it cost us a  100 or something, but  we   re still lifetime members and always will be. Stillwater is a good place. It  sure has changed. We came close to moving there when I retired. She  wanted to move there because there   s just so many, and hindsight says yeah,  probably should have. Stillwater   s growing town, and Ponca City   s not.  Ponca City is a retirement community. We don   t like that, but that   s the  truth. Came close because she would   ve been there for all the activities and  closer. Home values would stay up, I think, a little bit better, but also  they   ve got, that Perkins Road on game day, that   s crazy.  McDougal Yeah.  Chism We haven   t had a traffic jam here in Ponca in a long time. (Laughter)  Milligan Well, and you built this house, you said, you designed it and built it. It   s  gorgeous.  Chism Yeah, we picked out every blade of grass and brick. I had to have it painted  last month. Boy, that was a job. I didn   t paint it. My friend who   s working  over across the street now did. When you get to be almost eighty years of  age, you really want to size down, but I just love this neighborhood so  much. I know everybody who lives here. Probably won   t, probably die right  here. (Laughs) It   s a good place.  39  Milligan It seems like it.  Chism Yeah.  Milligan Well, if you   re okay, if you feel like we   re, covered some of the points   .  Chism Oh, I   m fine. I appreciate your questions and letting me go on and on and  on. I appreciate it.  Milligan I learned a lot. I wasn   t sure what all we were going to talk about today, and  I was really interested. We appreciate your time. All right.  -------  -------
