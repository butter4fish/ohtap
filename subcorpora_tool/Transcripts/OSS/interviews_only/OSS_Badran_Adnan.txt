 Gill and today is April 9, 2009. I   m visiting with Dr.  Adnan Badran on the Oklahoma State University campus here in  Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project  of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Dr. Badran, welcome  back to Oklahoma State University.  Thank you very much, Jerry. It is nice and good to be here with you.  We were just talking about the last time we met back in 1985 when you  were being inducted into the OSU Alumni Hall of Fame.  Right.  And you   ve achieved much in your distinguished career since then.  Right.  We   re certainly proud of you as an alumnus of our university.  I appreciate it.  And I understand you   re back on campus to deliver an address for the  Wes Watkins International Lectureship Series?  Right, this afternoon.  Dr. Badran, could we maybe back up a little bit? I   d like to ask you  about your early life, your family, how you grew up?  Well I was born in Jerash  , Jordan . I was born in December 15, 1935. I  was raised in a modest family in Jerash. Jerash is a very famous city in  Jordan because it is  one of the  Decapolis cities on the Road of Kings to  5  Rome. So it is a Roman city  built by the Roman Empire . And until  now, the Roman city of Jerash is still intact. You see forums, you see  colonnades, streets surrounded by colonnades, amphitheatres, temples,  fountains were built at that time in the old city of Jerash. They built the  best sewage system I   ve seen and water system where the underground  water system goes from fountain to fountain by gravitation of high  springs without using any energy. And then also, they built a sewage  system where the sewage cannot be mixed with the fresh drinking water.  So I was born in a historic city, obviously not in the old city, the Roman  city, because the Roman city is uninhabited right now, it   s antique, it   s  an archaeological site. I was born in the new city of Jerash, which is  adjacent to the Roman city.  I went through my education, I come from a family of seven. I have two  brothers and four sisters.  All of them are well-educated; one is an M.D.  doctor in pediatrics, the other is a lawyer, and my sister graduated in  pharmacy and business.  My father was a judge. My mother, she was  illiterate, but with my father she learned how to write and read. She was  a wonderful mother. I don   t know, sometimes you don   t measure people  by the level of education they   ve attained in universities. You measure  them by the vision and experience they   ve got. And this is why I say  we   ve learned a lot from our mother,  even though  she has a limited   regular  education. We   ve learned how to be, how to make, a cohesive  family, to care for one another, and also to have a bond that if anybody  needs something, he is supported by the other. And this is why you will  find somebody is supporting the other   s education  because my father  with his monthly salary could not afford the costs of education for all of  us .  I went to my elementary school there in Jerash. Then I moved to Karak   in the southern part of Jordan . Karak  is famous for its historical castle      the citadel.    It was built by the crusaders during Salah al-Din and the  crusaders    fight about Jersusalem, which ended peacefully. Again, our  home was next to the castle. So always I am next to a historical site. I   ve  been influenced by that probably because I   ve seen lots of tourism and  tourists who come to visit the site;  chatting with tourists will expose  you to other cultures and make you appreciate civilizations of others .  So I   ve been open-minded all my life. I never believed in a closed mind.  You have to be open to other cultures, interact with other cultures, learn  from them, and enrich yourself, because enrichment comes from  interaction with other communities and with other societies and with  other cultures.  I finished school in Karak,  then joined Khadouri Agricultural School in  Tulkarem for three years to graduate with a diploma . This agricultural  school has helped me to pick out Oklahoma State University to pursue  6  Gill  Badran  Gill  Badran  my study in agriculture. Why agriculture? Because we have a farm in  Jerash, a citrus farm and we also have apples and pears. You know,  citrus needs protection because it requires higher temperature and so  forth. It was a big irrigated farm and it has influenced my life. Every  weekend I used to go and work in the farm,  grafting, pruning, and  cultivating . This is why I picked up agriculture as a career in those  days.  Well Dr. Badran, education must have been very important to your  family and to you personally. Why do you value education so highly?  Well, we value education  very highly in Jordan  because  education is  considered a social status in our society . Those who had education,  they   ve made it in life, and those without education, they didn   t make it  in life. So we always look at examples around us that human capital is  the most important thing  one can have . Something that will be always  with you and never lost. The human capital is carried brain-intensive.  And when you have education, then really you find your way. You are  enriched, you are empowered, so education is really important to people.   We learned from the fleeing  of the Palestinians from their homeland  when they were driven out of their homes by Israel, those who have  education, they made it. And those who didn   t have education, they  ended up as refugees  in camps living on  rations  of food aid  from  UNRWA, the United Nations Relief  and Works  Agency.   Therefore  education among the Palestinians  is a power to become  independent rather than dependent. They became leaders in business, in  universities, in science, in government and politics. And when you go  around now, you find Palestinians in Australia, in Canada, in the States,  in Europe,  in the Gulf region and elsewhere . They made it because   they were empowered by education . So education is really your bank  of knowledge, your bank of skills, your enrichment and your know-how.  Once you are armed with education you don   t have to worry how much  you have in the bank because the bank is your brain.  So you were talking earlier about Oklahoma State. How did you learn  about Oklahoma State University and what influenced you to come to  Oklahoma State?  I have learned about Oklahoma State University through contacts. I had  some friends who went to Norman, the other university on the other  side, OU  University of Oklahoma . And also I have some colleagues  who came to Oklahoma State University. Since I am interested in  agriculture, Oklahoma State was the place for me. My bachelor   s degree  in agriculture education was done at Oklahoma State University in  Stillwater. So the Sooners in Norman, where some of my colleagues  7  were and some other colleagues also were studying engineering and  agriculture on the campus of Oklahoma State University, the Cowboys.  And I like the word Cowboy. You know, the early cowboy films, how  much influence  it had  on society all over the world. They were not  entertainment only,  it was an American culture of early pioneers to  conquer the West , how they worked hard to build America, based on  freedom of thought and freedom of expression and  liberty in the land of  opportunity .  So we   ve been influenced by those films, the American culture, how  they opened the West and how they advanced to the West, and how they  made America within 200 years a great nation on the top of the world  economy, democracy. We believe in the American ideals. Yes,  sometimes we are crushed by the policies in Washington, D.C.  in the  Middle East  but really the American public and the American people,  the roots of America, we  do appreciate and respect . We don   t differ   with those ideals of culture and principles of democracy .  We look up  to  America and try to make things happen in our countries like they   ve  done it in the States. Those people that came to America were  immigrants  and marginalized  from all over the world. And they built a  beautiful democratic country, much better than the old countries. Why?  Because they were free. They were free  to express themselves , I mean,  they were free of pressure. They were free of dominance, and they were  free of so much traditions built through history which is very hard to get  rid of. They came here, they got rid of it. You see they got rid of the old  rule, the old dominance. And this is why once they became free, they  invented  and became entrepreneurs . And they were the pioneers of the  world in term of science, in terms of development, in terms of bringing  new innovations to the world which the world hasn   t seen before.  So what I   m trying to say, those things influenced my coming to the  States for a bachelor   s degree. I   m very happy that I picked up  Oklahoma State University, the Cowboy campus, to pursue my degree in  agricultural education. Professor Robert Price was my major professor  who passed away two years ago. This was a great loss for me. He was   the one  who inspired me and helped to build up my future. He had an  open vision  and advised me to pursue my  horizon of education, to  provide me with the tools and the empowerment to deal with problem  solving. This was very important   I like to prepare people in a broad  bachelor   s degree program. If you want to narrow it down, then go to a  graduate program, Master and PhD. But to have the broad education,  where you can differentiate and make  a choice and use  intelligent  judgment, this cannot be provided if immediately you were put in a  narrow  specialization that you  cannot expand your vision and cannot  look beyond the horizon. This is how you develop. I think OSU campus  is an inspiring campus, an interactive campus. You mix with so many  8  Gill  Badran  Gill   international students  and it is a quality academic campus. I   m so  happy that I picked  OSU  to start my undergraduate work here.  When you first came to Stillwater, what was your first impression of  OSU?  Well, I didn   t know very much about the university system. I remind  you that I came  first to America  as a 4-Her. I belonged to the 4-H  Club. In 1955, before I came and joined this university, I came only for  six months, living on farms in North Carolina and Michigan as a 4-Her  and attending the 4-H summer camps. I was so impressed how you bring  those young boys and girls to learn by doing. So I learned about land  grant colleges and universities through the 4-H camps. I learned how  America was built on agriculture, then on mechanical engineering, to  mechanize agriculture. They put agriculture as a basic need. I think  nobody ever thought of this. And  agriculture has gone up  like a rocket  because they got the basics. I remember when I was here during that  time, 3  of the American public worked in agriculture, they fed  Americans as much internationally. This is remarkable when you look at  it, mechanized agriculture, new breeds of corn, new breeds of soy bean,  new R D, outreach programs, extension,  to develop the community .  So  land-grant  universities in the States,  there is  nothing like them in  the world.  This is based on  teaching quality, doing research, then  extension outreach. So really they got it all  in one land-grant  university . The benefit of research is disseminated to the farmers   through extension service . I used to  participate in  Future Farmers of  America, the FFA, I participated also in the 4-H. So really doing the  research and then disseminating the results and through demonstration to  farmers to convince them of new types of seeds  or new techniques .  Teaching research and outreach programs  is a complete package for   community  development  at home.  This consolidates the  university to  get out of its ivory tower, diffuse  knowledge  to the public, bring the  public to the campus for continuing education, and reach out to the state  where no marginalization would happen. Because marginalization will  lead to inequality. Marginalization will lead to hatred by the minorities.  So the U.S. has been a melting pot.  All are in  the melting pot no matter  what his religion is, no matter what the color of his skin, no matter what  ethnic group he belongs to.  Historical early leaders such as  Jefferson,  John Adams, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson,  FDR laid the foundation of the American ideals, of the American way of  life.  Did you have any difficulties adjusting to American culture when you  came over?  9  Badran   No, I was absorbed into the American culture within six months. People  were friendly and everyone tried to help.  When I went back home, I  was the one who introduced the first American campus in Jordan.  Universities were running after the Egyptian concept. It   s a year   system , not semester with all obligatory courses, no credit hours,  no  semesters . It   s after the French system. When you go to the Sorbonne in  France, you   ll find one year courses and with one final examination at  the end of the year. You are not obliged to attend the course, you come  and go  whenever you like . As a matter of fact, if all the students will  attend the course there is no place for them.  If you pass the final exam  at the end of the year, you move to the second year.   So when I went home and I was asked to establish the faculty of science  with four of my colleagues   happily those four had graduated also from  United States. One of them from Harvard in Chemistry, the other one  from Minnesota in Pathology, the third one from Northwestern  University in Mathematics, and the fourth one was from Purdue  University. I introduced with my colleagues the  American  semester  credit system at the University of Jordan. I was Dean of Science  at the  University  and introduced the yearbook to present the student   s  activities  to show the life of campus . I introduced the outreach  program, where in summer we bring all the science teachers for training  on pedagogy to train the teachers on the  curriculum of chemistry,  physics, and math .  We have developed  the new curriculum system in  Jordan, which was  diffused  to the Arab region. And also we introduced  new curriculum for community colleges. We introduced the concept of  community colleges.  We had resistance in the beginning because people  were traditional and  resisted change .  If the student flunked in one  course, he   d repeat all  the courses;  even if he  passed them, he has to repeat the whole year  I  said if he flunked out in physics, why should he repeat mathematics and  he has very high grade in mathematics? Why should he repeat biology  when he has a high grade in biology? They said,    Oh no, no. He has to  repeat everything because he flunked  one course .    Finally, we  succeeded in spreading the credit hour system. We teach the sciences in  English. Again,  there was a resistance not to use the  national language.  We teach in English because we want the student to be exposed to  literature, to world knowledge. This is the global language for science.  So he has to learn English to have access to literature, to have access to  textbooks. And we use  up-to-date  textbooks, i.e. McGraw-Hill and  other publishers.  We introduced the American  liberal  education in terms of credit hour  system, in terms of  electives . And then afterwards, when we talk about  culture, I think it is important, always I say it that you cannot impose  10  Gill  Badran  Gill  Badran  Gill  Badran  somebody   s culture on others. You have to  learn other cultures to  appreciate and interact with  value systems  that belong to  modernity.  But those dead traditions  which hinder  the person  from advancement   and  will put back the person into alleys of  dark history and back to the  Dark Ages, this should be abandoned. This is why when we talk about  terrorist acts we have  to go to the roots of the problem and look into the  type of education we   re giving to those people at early childhood, the   religious schools  incubating  extremist ideals in those schools and these  religious schools  are brain washing students to  became terrorists,   along with  anti-modernity and reforms. They call it in Arabic dud  hadatha. Dud is against, hadatha modernism, so anti-modernism.  Obama   s speech in Ankara and Cairo called to develop mutual  understanding. To understand cultures  of others , we differ but we have  to respect differences. Otherwise, conflict throughout our lives will  sustain.  Back to your OSU experience, were there any other international  students from the Middle East at that time here when you were on  campus?   We were  twenty-one students  from the Arab region  at that time. We  formed the Arab Club and I was a member of the club. As a matter of  fact we were united, although we had come from Syria, from Lebanon,  from Egypt, from Jordan, from Kuwait. We were active in the intramural  activity. We participated in the  Homecoming  float for the  Homecoming game with the Air Force. I remember we won  that  football game . The Arab Club float  also won the  number three  prize .   Our float was the  concept of the Pyramids of Egypt.  At that time did you develop some relationships with international  students as well as American students that you maintained throughout  your life?  Yes. We developed relationships with international students, people  came from Spain, Latin America, but our interaction was really with  American students on the campus. I want to say one thing, the OSU  campus, the Cowboy Campus, was really very open. We felt at home  within a very short time.  Was it a positive experience for you?  Surely yes. This was an experience. So you are accommodated in a way.  And at that time   I   m talking now about the    50s   in the    50s when you  say,    I am from Jordan,    people they look at you and they start to think,     Where is Jordan again?    Because internationalism in the United States  was limited, let   s face it, because it passed through a period of  11  Gill  Badran  isolationism as you know. Americans were isolated from the whole  world, except from Europe, but they know nothing about the  rest of the   world. This is why I felt that we brought internationalism to the campus  of OSU by bringing where we come from. I was invited to many Rotary  and Lion Clubs in the area to  lecture about Jordan , what form of  government we have, what  type of  legislation, what executive of the  king is and so forth, and our system.  I think you people, you have worked hard for a lot of things and should  not be taken for granted. When I went back home, the gap I found  between the development of the U.S. and development in Jordan and the   entire  Middle East was wide. It now has been narrowed because of  globalization. What you see in the States now you see in Jordan. But in  the gap was huge in terms of infrastructure, in terms of education, in  terms of healthcare, in terms of water distribution, sewage system. I  think globalization has brought  the world closer together and triggered   interacting with other cultures to build peace. Isolated culture will build   antagonism . This is why people do not realize that globalization has so  many benefits by bringing the world from none to one. I think this is  very important. However we have to safeguard diversity. We differ and  this is good, this is mosaic I would say. If the whole world becomes one  culture, we   d be monotonous. So that is why I feel that, yes, the gap was  huge during my days of studies in the    50s, but now the gap has been  narrowed and I feel we are moving slowly for globality where  interdependence becomes a way of life.  Do you have some favorite memories of your OSU experience if you  could pick out one or two things? You talked about Homecoming and the  parade of floats. What do you remember about your time as student at  Oklahoma State?  I was living in Cordell dormitories and Ron Smith was our President.  We had lots of activities. We had the Hay Ride day, we had the Aggie  day because I belonged to the School of Agriculture, the barbeques, the  picnics we used to have, and always there are social activities, almost  weekly, whether within our dormitory or within our clubs which we  belong to, the Toastmaster Club for example, the Aggies Club. All this  really has enriched our life. To tell you a story, for example, during the  first week when I was here on the campus. Two beautiful girls wearing  the cowboy costume caught me on the campus, I was having a hard time  understanding their accent in English. At that time I was a newcomer to  the campus, and they put me in a student jail, behind bars, next to the  Student Union. I said,    Why?    They said,    You don   t know? This is  Cowboy Week and during this Cowboy Week you have to wear  something cowboy: a boot or jean or hat or a tie or shirt.    I didn   t have  any of this. I was put there for almost half an hour, and after that, I went  12  Gill  Badran  Gill  Badran  Gill  Badran  and bought a boot and jeans and this was my official dress on the  campus all the time, jeans and boots.  I felt this type of social activities on the campus brings students together,  delete any differences between them, bring cultures closer together. This  is very enriching for the first week on the campus to have something like  this, because really this broke the ice. Because we come from an area  where you feel that you should be formal, you shouldn   t speak except  when the elders allow you to speak. I mean, a conservative community.  So you come here and you to find this open community. Even if you do  a mistake, people correct you without laughing at you, without mocking  you,  but laughing with you . I think this is very important in building  confidence  and trust .  Did you learn how to say howdy?  Yeah, well this was my word always, howdy.  Howdy.  I forgot that word howdy when I went to Michigan State, you see in  Michigan they don   t say it. After I finished here I went to Michigan  State  for my master   s and PhD  and worked  afterward  for three years  there in research in Boston and Central America so I  replaced  the word  howdy with hi,  but I still love to  say howdy.  Well Dr. Badran, you devoted your life as a professor, researcher,  university president, and government official to developing educational  programs and infrastructure in Jordan and other Arab countries and  around the world. What   s motivated you to spend your life   s work in  educational endeavors?  I feel if you want to change society, the only way to do it is through  education. If you want to develop a country, you have to look  to  empower . Once Tony Blair was asked when he became Prime Minister  of Britain, the  people with education  said,    What   s your project to  develop UK and become competitive in the world? Since we are losing  ground, we used to be an empire but we   re losing ground.    His answer  was,    Yes, I have three objectives.    The journalist said,    What are those  objectives?    He said,    The first one is education, the second one is  education, the third one is education.    So I think really education if you  want to change the world, if you want to change your community, if you  want to change society, you cannot do it except with the right education.  Education of the right thing. People say education is not enough, but  quality education, with purpose, education for living together, education  to appreciate other cultures, education to develop skills, education to  13  Gill  Badran  arm you with free thinking, and inquiry. So you educate how to read,  you educate how to investigate, you educate how to reach to the  information, you educate how to inquire about everything. And this is  the type of education we should look for. Once you concentrate on this  type of education, the right education for everyone, education for all,  whether basic education, whether secondary education, and open the  venues in quality education, higher education, university education, I  think you are on the right track.  You are on the right track because education in the end, the outcome,  has to meet with the needs of the community. And they say well for  example, universities in the third world did not develop the industry.  Yes, I agree they didn   t do like in the States or Europe. But a time will  come when both will meet, where the delivery of higher education will  meet with the needs of the community, the society, the industry. They  will meet, they will come. The most important thing is really to provide  the quality education, diversified education, interdisciplinary education,  because problems right now like climate change cannot be solved except  with interdisciplinary education. Because you need the physicist, the  biologist, the chemist, the mathematician, all together working in the  same room and the engineers and the environmental people, et cetera. So  this is why I think education is very important, but quality education and   blended  education, to reach the target, and this is the education we  need to achieve and reach  out to people .  In your work as Deputy Director General of UNESCO, what has it  taught you about the value and role of education in fostering positive  international relations? And are you hopeful of the prospects of better  understanding and closer relationships between the Arab world, the  Western world, and the world in general?  UNESCO can play a central role in training the teachers and providing  the right education, away from xenophobia, away from  extreme   religious teachings, free and liberalized education for all. You can   t  argue about everything in the world without red lines; this is why I feel  UNESCO can do a lot in terms of free education for all.  In education,  we should not be dogmatic and call for a state of secularism to separate  the state from religion.  Turkey is a secular state. Malaysia is a secular  state. Indonesia is a secular state. I believe in secularism. To save  religion, ethics, out of state politics and keep the politics away from  religion. I think this is what we need to do.  International organizations like UNESCO can build education based on  ideals, based on ethics, based on skills, develop thinkers, creativity, to be  creative, not to be dogmatic about things. This cannot be done except  with UNESCO, I feel. During my days at UNESCO, we   ve succeeded in  14  Gill  Badran  so many parts of the world, particularly in Africa through a program     education for Africa    and I was handling those as Deputy Director  General of UNESCO.  You   ve served in many leadership roles in your country as Minister of  Agriculture, Education, Defense, and as Prime Minister of your country.  During you tenure in these leadership roles, what programs and  initiatives are you most proud of?  During my time, I am proud of really creating the state of the art  universities, three universities, in Jordan, or even four: Yarmouk,  Science and Technology University, Philadelphia, and now Petra. Those  I am proud of because I put them on the right track and I believe the  early seeds which we planted brought us the fruits of development and  success. The second thing, during my research after graduating from  MSU  I was engaged in research to increase  the shelf life  of fruits,  particularly bananas . This helped to solve the food problem. The  Russians have never been able to eat bananas in the past. Now they eat  bananas because of the technique and the method of how to store  bananas green and bring them to Russia and then ripen them. This was  the result of the research I   ve done with United Food Company during  that time. So I   m proud of our work, it   s really a short period but it was a  very dynamic period in bringing R D, patents, and research to  distribute food throughout the world.  And this is being adapted to all fruits with a climacteric  rise in  respiration . Once you reduce metabolism of the fresh fruits, fresh  produce and vegetables to a minimum, then you lengthen the breakdown  of carbohydrates and you lengthen the shelf life and the storage life.  The third thing, as Prime Minister, really I am proud that I   implemented  social safety  in prices  in Jordan. You remember the oil  rise, the food prices were very high, everything went up high and we  were afraid of social unrest because people would go hungry, I mean  they can   t afford  to secure their needs . So we developed a social safety  net where we provided all needy people. We put a tax on  gasoline  to  the social safety net. We developed what we call parallel markets to  provide the basic food for everybody at cost. Obviously we have to  subsidize  the temporary purchase of basic food only , I know that in the  States you are against subsidy, but we have to subsidize only that period  to overcome the high rise of food and now it   s over because we put  things back in place.  So I think this social safety net worked within a capitalistic system. If  we do forget the social dimension, then really capitalism has a short  lifespan. It cannot continue. You have to show that the system you have,  15  Gill  Badran  Gill  Badran  Gill  Badran  Gill  Badran  whether a capitalist system or not, shows social dimension otherwise  people will revolt  so we need to balance free market economy to  advance competition and at the same time to care for the social  dimension .  You need that balance.  You need that balance, a third way. And I think  my government has  adapted the  third way in Jordan. We provided a social safety net and  kept a  free market economy .  How do you hope that your fellow countrymen and people around the  world that you   ve come in contact with, what do you want your legacy to  be? How do you hope they   ll remember you?  Well I think the legacy is building peace and building the culture of  peace among people. It has to start from childhood through education.  Because wars are always born in the minds of men. If you plant the  seeds of love, the seeds of interaction, the seeds of appreciating  differences, and the seeds of appreciating other cultures, and the seeds  that this world belongs to all, not to one or to a segment and this   development , you can plant it from childhood and this we   ve done at  UNESCO. Building leaders in the future who believe in the concept that  peace is a must, that  there should be  no more conflicts. People  obviously should live in peace because they are interdependent on each  other. In other words, they have common interests. I mean you have an  interest, I have an interest, so those interests form a common ground for  us to deal with, to interact with, and to communicate with. I think this is  really the legacy that education for all and building a mutual  understanding, building the culture of peace, building the culture of how  to live together and how to deal with each other. Those are the things I   d  like to be remembered for: security and peace for all.  Dr. Badran, I appreciate it. Is there anything else that you wanted to  mention that we didn   t bring up that you want to say in closing?  Well Jerry, you   ve asked everything you wanted to. I don   t want to add  anything else. I do thank you for your time.  Thank you very much and it was great to have you back in Stillwater.  Thank you.  -------  -------
