 Neurohr  Today is January 5, 2007. My name is Karen Neurohr, and I   m a  librarian at the OSU Library in Stillwater, and we are at the OSU-Tulsa  campus today. We   re conducting an interview for the O-STATE Stories  oral history project of the OSU Library with Mr. Lawrence Erwin. Mr.  Erwin, will you tell us about   and I   m sorry, I should have called you  Dr. Erwin because you have your doctorate of veterinary medicine   so  would you tell us a little bit about what year you graduated?  I graduated with my bachelor   s degree in zoology in 1957 from  Oklahoma A M, and my doctor of veterinary medicine in 1958 from  Oklahoma State University.  And when you were a student at Oklahoma A M College, you were  there right when the name was changing over.  Right.  You said that you had one degree from Oklahoma A M and one degree  from Oklahoma State University.  Right.  So was there a controversy about the name change that you recall?  If there was, I didn   t know it. I was busy (Laughter) studying veterinary  medicine. You didn   t have time to get involved in too many  controversies. I don   t remember one. There may have been.  Did you have any personal feelings about it being called a university  versus a college or anything?  5  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  No. I thought it was probably the best change.  When you were a student at Oklahoma State University, did you have to  work at all?  Oh yes, I worked all the way through at various jobs. When I first went  up there, there was no minimum wage at that time and the average wage  was about thirty-five cents an hour. I worked at odd jobs and had a  reason to ride in the cab one time   taxi cab   and the driver was a senior  veterinary student, and he had his books and was studying. I asked,    Are  you a student?    and he said,    Yes.    I said,    How do you study?    and he  answered,    Well, when I   m not making a run I have time to study      I  thought,    That   s the best job I could have.    And so he says,    I work  evenings and weekends.    I said,    It   s an ideal job for me.    So I asked  him about it, and he said he   d put a word in for me to the owner of the  company. So I went down and applied, too, and he said,    Well you   ll  have to get a commercial license.    So I got a commercial license and I  drove a cab for five years while I was there.  Well, do you have any good stories about driving the cab?  Oh yeah. That   s one of the most interesting things I   ve ever had. I even  met Henry Fonda     Oh.     and he was there for Caine Mutiny Court Martial play for the allied  arts. He wanted to go over to the, we called it the field house then   it   s  Iba Arena   and he wanted to go over and see the stage makeup. So I  took him over and brought him back. He gave me a dollar tip. That was  a pretty good tip back then but I got to meet him and so   yeah, there  were lots of stories. (Laughs)  Well, who was using the cabs mostly to get around town?  Oh, everybody did. At that time, a lot of the students, not like now, they  didn   t have wheels. They didn   t have cars, and there was two buses ran  south and two buses ran north through Stillwater every day, and on the  weekends four buses north and south. So many of the students rode the  bus back and forth to college, and I would pick them up and take them     meet the bus and pick them up and take them to the dormitories or the  fraternity houses or wherever they were living. I picked up a lot of  students. And then if it wasn   t raining or something, a lot of the students  would walk downtown or if it was raining or what have you   bad  weather   well, they   d ride a cab, and so they rode a cab a lot.  6  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  What did it cost for them to ride the cab?  For twenty-five cents you could go anywhere in Stillwater. If you made  an extra stop, it was an extra twenty-five cents   it cost you fifty cents     and so you could ride anyplace in Stillwater for twenty-five cents.  If you had more than one rider, did each rider have to pay that amount?  Pay twenty-five cents, yes.  They did?  And on that same night that I met Henry Fonda, I was patrolling along  what was called College Avenue at that time   it   s University Avenue     and I turned the corner there on Monroe and there was a girl flagging me  down and I stopped, and when I got through there was eight girls in that  cab   all going over to the field house for the play. It was raining just a  drizzle, and I picked them up. (Laughter) But there was eight girls piled  into that cab. (Laughter)  Did you just drive around and wait for a rider? How did you find  riders?  We had cab stands, one at the old campus corner there across the street  south of the fire department on the northeast corner   or southeast corner  there was a cab stand. We had a cab stand downtown, and then we were  radio controlled and people would call for a cab and they would tell us  where to go. We   d go and pick them up.  Well, that must have been interesting.  It was. Very interesting job and enjoyable. Really I enjoyed it. Needless  to say, I had time to study when I wasn   t on a run.  Did you work nights and weekends?  Nights and weekends, yes.  Were there any people that rode in the cab that you wish you hadn   t  given a ride to?  Oh, no, not really. I never had any real problems   pick up a drunk or  two at the bars and what have you. And on Friday nights or Saturday  nights, there would be drunks, a lot of the guys that made the bars  around would ride the cabs so they wouldn   t get a DUI driving, you  know. And back then we had bootleggers, that was before prohibition.  7  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Prohibition was still in, rather, and we had several bootleggers around  town, and I knew where all of them were, because people would want to  go to it. (Laughter)  What was it that made you decide to go into veterinary medicine?  Well, I grew up on a dairy farm and when I was in the eighth grade, a  veterinarian would come out to take care of our animals. I would watch  him and help him where I could. And then I became interested in it. I  decided in the eighth grade I   d like to be a veterinarian, and so that   s  what I worked toward. When I graduated from high school, I had a  scholarship to the University of Tulsa and paid half my tuition so I could  live at home then. I went there for a year   two years really   and lived  at home. And then I got married the second year I was there. I married  my high school sweetheart, and so I did a lot of my pre-veterinary work  here at the University of Tulsa and then in    53 moved to Stillwater.  Was she staying at home while you were going to school or did she     No, she        have classes, too?     she was there and worked. She worked in the university accounting  department, not the school of accounting, but the accounting department.  Mr. Barry was the chief accountant at that time, and she worked for him  for four years while we were in   five years while we were there.  Did you have a special housing area that you lived in?  We lived in what was called the College Courts and it was located where  the Stillwater Hospital is now. They were temporary frame buildings  that I understand, originally they were a WAC  Women   s Army Corps   base during the Second World War, where they trained WACs, and then  after the war they converted them into apartments. They were just  essentially one-room apartments with four apartments to each unit. We  lived out there, thirty-five dollars a month.  Oh.  Utilities paid. (Laughter)  It certainly has changed, hasn   t it? (Laughter) Then did you walk to your  classes?  No, I had an old    47 Chevrolet car that my dad had and I drove it and we  8  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  drove to campus in that.  Was it unusual for somebody to have some college classes at another  school before they went to OSU or was there a lot of that?  I don   t know. I suppose that they did, yes.  Now they call them transfer students.  Yes. I was a transfer student. I transferred my resume up there.  And when you were a student in the veterinary college, tell me a little bit  about what that was like. I notice that you brought a yearbook with you,  and so   you had a special yearbook just for the college of veterinary  medicine?  Yes, and our class was the second edition of it.  Oh it was?  Yeah, the first class graduated in    51, 1951, and we   this is the second  edition of it. It was called The Caduceus and it   s a pretty nice little book.  It has class pictures in it and a nice reminder.  What is the significance of the title    Caduceus   ?  Caduceus is the medical emblem. That   s the Caduceus.  Okay.  And there was a two-winged one. Now the military still uses this     Army Medical Corps uses it and the Navy Medical Corps uses it. I was a  hospitalman in the Naval Reserve, and I had that emblem on my   as a  hospitalman on my   and now then they call it the    Asclepius.    The  Asclepius is just a single pole with one snake on it and it doesn   t have  the wings on it, so that   s the new medical emblem that   oh I say it   s  new   it   s been in   probably twenty-five, thirty years, but the old one  was what was called the Caduceus.  Who were some of the professors that you remember from your time?  Well, probably the most wonderful professor, I think, and ever   I think  most every student that had him would agree with it, was Dr. Duane  Peterson, and Dr. Peterson was the professor of anatomy. This   The  Caduceus is dedicated to him. He gave the first lecture to the first class  at OSU, and   A M at that time   and he was a wonderful professor and  9  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  a very wonderful man. And, so he   s probably the outstanding man that I  remember, professor that I had. Had a lot of good professors, but he was  probably the outstanding one.  And I understand that after you finished your program and you received  your doctorate that you opened your own practice in Stillwater.  Well, I went to Cherokee, Oklahoma   northwest part of the state,  Alfalfa County, for five years, and then I came back to Stillwater in  1963 and started a practice there.  And what type of practice did you have?  In Cherokee, I had about eighty percent large animal and about twenty  percent small animal. In Stillwater, it was about fifty-fifty until  about   oh, let   s see, about 1990 or    89 I hurt my back and so I couldn   t  do large animal work then.  Did you really have some nice advantages of having a practice in  Stillwater with the college there?  Yes, I had an educated clientele for the most part and they were very  easy to work with, and easy to discuss with and understand, you know.  Were you able to keep up to date with new developments and things, you  think, more than people that were further away might have been?  Oh, I don   t know if that   s the case because each of us have to   it   s  required to have twenty hours of continuing education every year, and  most of us read our journals and what have you. It   s like anything else.  If you don   t stay up with it, you die. And so, you know, it   s a matter of  continuing your education. New stuff is going to change. Things have  changed so much since I graduated   been at it now for forty-eight and a  half years, and it   s changed tremendously in that length of time.  What has been one or two significant changes that you   ve seen?  Well, diagnostic procedures for one thing   a lot more laboratory  equipment and   modern laboratory equipment that helps us   also, with  the improvement in medications and drugs and materials, such as  bandaging materials. I was just thinking the other day when I was  putting a bandage or a splint on the dog that it was so much easier than it  was when I first graduated and the materials that we had to use then as  compared to the materials we have now.  Well, that   s interesting. Is there anything else that you want to say about  10  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  your veterinary practice?  Well, evidently I   ve enjoyed it. It   s provided a good income for my  family. I   ve been able to raise three children and educate them with it,  and provide some retirement for myself   not anything that I   ve gotten  rich at, but I   ve been rich in that I   ve had a lot of fond memories and  very wonderful experiences at it.  Okay, let   s talk about OSU, or OAMC, a little bit, too   and I was  wondering if you had any memories about Homecoming. Was that  something you participated in or did you     Homecoming was a very wonderful experience back at that time. The  parades, I think, were even better than they are now, and the housing  decorations were wonderful, too. But probably the one thing that has  changed so much   going to a football game was a dress-up experience.  Men wore coats and ties, and the ladies wore dresses, and at  Homecoming, well any young man of any character would buy his date  or his lady a corsage. And it was a very wonderful experience to go to  Homecoming. As I say, it was a dress-up affair, and I think  sportsmanship was a little more emphasized at that time. There wasn   t  much booing and what have you as we see today.  Did you attend sporting events when you were a student?  Oh yes, I went to the football games. When I first went, that was one of  the jobs I   d have. I   d sell popcorn and Coke   s and shades   you know,  the sun shades at the football games. (Laughter)  So, were you selling them out of a concession stand?  Yes.  Well, that   s interesting.  Through the stadium   go through the stadium selling them.  How much was popcorn and a Coke?  Oh, I don   t remember   probably   Coke   s back then, you could get  them for a nickel or a dime, and popcorn probably the same.  They didn   t have any nachos or     No. (Laughter) No nachos back then. (Laughter)  11  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  What about hot dogs?  Yes, hot dogs. (Laughter)  Do you still go to Homecoming?  Yes, sometimes, yes   when I can get away for it. (Laughter) Got so  many family things to do now that it keeps me busy with my family and  my new wife   s family. Why we (Laughs)   we stay busy.  It was probably a little unusual for you being a student because you  were a married student     Right.     while you were there, did you and your wife participate in different  social activities? Did the married students kind of hang out together  and     Well, I would say that most of our social activities was associated with  our church. The married young people in the department there and at  First Baptist Church and   I can remember even on Sunday evening  we   d maybe have 150-200 married young people there, and it was a big  time. Mr. Claude Bradshaw who was the insurance agent there was my  Sunday School teacher for about five years, and they provided lots of  friends for us to have a good time together and     I   ll bet that was fun.  It was and I sang in a quartet with   while I was at OSU and in our  church, and so I did a lot of singing. My wife and I both sang in the  choir. We sang duets together.  Were there other places that you all enjoyed going outside of your  church activities?  Well, the ballgames   or you went to the basketball games   wrestling  matches some and football games. We   d take in a movie once in awhile,  not a whole lot. I didn   t have time or whole lot or the money. Money  was a hard thing then. We didn   t have to have the best apartment. We  didn   t have to buy a brand-new car and the best of everything. We were  just proud to be able to get through. She worked and put food on the  table and a roof over our head, and I worked to pay for my books and  tuition and my equipment, veterinary equipment that we had to  purchase.  12  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  What type of equipment did you have to purchase?  Surgical equipment that we had to have, and also our uniforms, clothing.  Was it expensive?  Oh, not expensive     Was it        to us at that time, but you know     But it wasn   t a great hardship     No.     necessarily? Well, I   m sure you probably had to study a lot. I   ll bet  that was a demanding program. Did you go to the library and study?  I studied at the library a lot, yes. If I had a break in a class   between  classes, I studied at the library, and I studied till midnight every night,  and so I took Sunday afternoons off   Saturday if there was a ballgame  or something like that, I   d take Saturday afternoon and Sunday off, and  then I   d go back to studying Sunday evening. After we got out of  church, I   d come home and start studying.  What do you remember about the library?  Well, of course, it wasn   t as big as it is now. They put that extension on  the north side after I was there. But one of the things I enjoyed, if I had  any free time at all, was going to what was the reading room on the  second floor, there to the right, and just go in and pick up   I had a book  that I would have a marker in, that I   d keep on the shelf there, you know,  and then if I had a little time I   d go in. And I loved to read, and I   d go in  and get that book and read just for the enjoyment of it. But most of the  time I spent in the veterinary medical section of the library. They didn   t  have a library. The veterinary school didn   t have a library like they have  now and all of our books were over at the main library.  Do you remember what floor they were on?  I think about the third or fourth floor, if I remember right.  Okay. Do you have any other favorite stories from college? Were there  any interesting stories of being in the vet school that you had, any  interesting classroom experiences or any research that was going on  13  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  that you were involved in?  Well, at that time there were these   what we called    necrotic rhinitis     was a disease in swine that we were researching at the time and   along  with the animal husbandry department, animal science they call it now.  Could you explain what that was, that disease?  It was a disease that just literally broke down the cartilage in the nose of  hogs, and their nose would turn and twist to the side and what have you.  And they were researching that disease, and they have, I think, found out  that it is probably genetic as much as anything and they have eliminated  it now. You don   t hear about it anymore. But that was one of the things  that they were working on at the time. And as far as research projects, I  wasn   t involved in research very much at that time.  What about Theta Pond? (Laughter) Did you and your wife like to walk  over around Theta Pond?  Oh yes, that was a wonderful place   just go up and walk on the campus,  you know, and especially   we liked to go up there even when there was  snow on the ground, too, and it was beautiful on the campus. I have  several pictures of us on the campus and during the wintertime. But, yes,  Theta Pond has always been a center, you know, for people to gather  around. And we had one professor that got married while we were in  school and the class just took him down to the Theta Pond and threw  him in.  Oh.  That was part of the    (Laughter) and I guess when the students would  get engaged at the fraternity houses and what have you, they   d take them  over and throw them into the Theta Pond.  Were you one of the students that helped throw the professor in?  Oh yes. (Laughter)  Did he fight pretty hard or     No, I think he knew he was outnumbered. (Laughter)  Were there any ducks or geese     Oh yes.  14  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr     around the pond at that time? Yes? Well, that   s a good story. What  about other places around campus?  Oh, I don   t know. Of course, we were on the campus every day so we  didn   t go up there just for the fun of it sometimes.  What building did your wife work in?  She worked in Whitehurst.  In Whitehurst?  Yes.  So were you all able to meet for lunch?  Not very often, no.  Well, you had full days then, didn   t you     Yes, we did.     with classes and working?  But now we   d go out to Yost Lake sometimes, and then at that time  there were two restaurants called the Town House and the Country  House. The Country House was there on McElroy where the Elks or  Moose Lodge is, I guess it is, and that was a restaurant and that was out  in the country then. Then Town House was located at what   Elm and  Main- where the car wash is now, and it was a big restaurant. Those  were two pretty nice restaurants in town at that time.  Was it like a diner where you had a plate lunch     Yes.     or a plate dinner?  The Country House had a dance floor and everything.  Oh.  We   d go out there for parties and what have you.  That sounds like that was a fun place to go. Have you had other family  members who have attended OSU?  15  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  My daughter, youngest daughter, graduated from OSU in English  literature. She played in the band all the time she was there   played the  saxophone.  What   s her name?  Karla.  Okay.  And her husband   s family   well, he is a third generation OSU graduate,  and their daughter   they live in Dallas now, but their daughter is  planning on going to OSU, which is     Does that make grandpa happy?  Yes, probably. (Laughter) Probably. And then my oldest daughter  worked on her master   s degree in music at OSU. She graduated from  Oklahoma Baptist University in music and then worked on her master   s.  Okay, you talked about Theta Pond being a tradition when someone  would get engaged and they would discover (Laughs) what it felt like to  be thrown in Theta Pond. Were there any other traditions that you  remember at the university?  Well, when we   in our graduating class the last week of school we had  what we called the    Water Follies    that veterinary students had at OSU.  Water Follies?  Yes.  I haven   t heard about that. I   d like to hear about that.  No, they have been discontinued.  Oh. (Laughter) Well what happened?  Well, the senior students   the last one that got wet got thrown into the  Theta Pond   so we were out with water buckets and syringes and  everything else just soaking each other, running up and down the halls.  (Laughter) There was a men   s restroom right off of one of the treatment  areas, and one of our professors, the head of clinics, was in there one day  and one of my classmates had doused me down with a dosing syringe  and I got pretty wet and I grabbed a bucket of water and was chasing  him. He ran into that restroom, and I thought it was him in the stall and I  16  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  just dumped the water bucket over on top of him. Well, it happened to  be Dr. Wolfe, and that put an end to the Water Follies. (Laughter) So I  don   t think they have them anymore. (Laughter)  Oh, that   s a good story   hadn   t heard Water Follies and so it went on  for about a week?  Yes.  It did? So you just always had to be watching over your shoulder, didn   t  you? (Laughter) Were you disciplined in any way when they found out  who did     They didn   t find out who did it. (Laughs)  They didn   t find out who did it?  But it put a stop to it anyway. (Laughter)  Oh goodness. Well, do you have any other traditions that you can think  of like that or any other stories about life on campus or around campus?  Oh, I don   t know. I spent most of my time studying and working.  Yes, and driving the taxi.  Right.  The article that you brought for us to look at   there was an article in the  Payne County Historical Review   and could you tell me a little bit about  that article?  Well, it   s called,    Memoirs of a Student Taxi Driver,    and it   s about my  experiences as a taxi driver while I was there. There   s several stories in  it about, as I say, Henry Fonda and then also the driving. I remember  driving one of the basketball team   s   we had one of the NCAA playoffs  there in Iba Arena at that time   and so I got to transport some of the  basketball teams around as well.  Were there several taxi companies?  Two. Safeway Cab and Yellow Cab. I drove for Safeway.  And was it associated with the grocery store somehow?  No, that was just     17  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Just a coincidence     Yellow Cab, of course, had yellow cabs and we had black and white  ones with    Safeway      big    Safeway    across the     What kind of car was it?  They were Chevrolets, about 1952,    53 Chevrolets.  You just had a flat rate then? There wasn   t a time meter or anything?  No, just flat rate.  And then the rate was charged for a one-way trip?  Right.  I see.  If people went out of town, then there was a mileage charge. I don   t  remember exactly how much it was, but there was a mileage charge  added to it. But twenty-five cents, you could ride anywhere in town.  And then when you collected the money from the passengers, you took it  back to the     Right.     office?  Right, and I got forty percent of it.  You got forty percent? How often did you get paid?  After every day.  Well, that was nice.  Yes.  That   s interesting. And you were in the Naval Reserve   served several  years in the Naval Reserve, I see. What is a hospitalman?  A hospitalman is a corpsman, same as a corpsman in the Army. Navy  hospitalmen were nursing assistants, and then if you make the rank of  chief petty officer hospitalman, you   re just like an MD because many of  18  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Neurohr  them go to what   s called independent duty school. For instance, I was on  a destroyer and we would have a squadron of destroyers of two or five  or more, and on that you   d only have one medical doctor or surgeon for  the whole squadron. And on each ship, your chief petty officer acted  as   and some of them were even skilled at surgery and what have you.  Your hospital corpsmen were the ones that provided hospitalmen for the  Marine Corps. And during the Second World War, there were more  hospitalmen, percentage wise, that got the Congressional Medal of  Honor than any of the other ranks. Because they would go out on the  battlefields and administer to the wounded out on the battlefield and  even bring them in and rescue them. So I   ve had a lot of good training  while in the Navy.  Did you ever toy with the idea of going to medical school?  No, well the same year I was accepted for veterinary school I was  accepted for medical school at OU. I applied for both, but I had decided  the Lord wanted me to be a veterinarian so     You had already figured that out when you were younger, hadn   t you?  Right.  Okay, do you have anything else that you would want to share with us?  What kind of advice would you give to students nowadays?  Pursue your dream. Pursue your dream, your calling. And so many  students, I think, don   t have a vision as to how they really want to go  and I guess they have to find out what their talents and abilities are. But  I   d say,    Pursue your dream.    I wasn   t the best student till I got in  veterinary school, but when I was accepted for veterinary school I just  thought if I flunked out, it wasn   t going to be because I didn   t try, and I  worked hard, studied hard. I   m a slow learner, but I worked hard and  studied hard, and I graduated in the upper five percent of my class so     Well, congratulations.  There was only one semester that I didn   t make a 3.6 or above.  You did very well then.  You know, I worked hard to do it, but it takes a lot of hard work and  determination, but you can do it if you want to.  Okay. Can you think of anything else you want to add here?  19  Erwin  Neurohr  Erwin  Well, I don   t know. I   ve loved OSU, loved Stillwater   that   s the reason  we came back to Stillwater because of the church there and the people,  the friends that we made while we were there. It   s been a big part of my  life and I can   t deny that. My children grew up in Stillwater and it   s a  wonderful place to live, wonderful place to raise your children.  Well this has been a nice interview and we appreciate you coming today.  Thank you very much for sharing your stories with us.  Thank you.  -------  -------
