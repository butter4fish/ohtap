 Gill. Today is October 17, 2008. I   m visiting with Dr.  C. J. Clark in the Conoco Phillips OSU Alumni Center on the OSU  campus. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project which is part  of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Dr. Clark, welcome  back to campus.  Well it   s nice to be back; it   s been many years.  It   s been, what 1950s, since you were on campus?  Yes. We actually left Oklahoma in 1956, but the last time I was  associated with OSU   it was Oklahoma A M at that time   was in  1953.  To back up a little bit, where did you grow up? Could you share with us  a bit about your early life?  Yes, that was in Lansing, Michigan and I was born in Jackson, Michigan  not very far from Lansing. We spent our whole youth in that area and I  graduated from high school at Lansing Eastern. What year was that? My  goodness   must have been    43, maybe   something like that.  Well, there   s got to be a story. I mean, did you come directly out of high  school to OSU or is there military service?  Oh, no. How I got to OSU is an interesting story because after I  graduated from high school World War II was in progress, and I started  my college career at Michigan State in East Lansing. That   s very close  to Lansing. When I grew up, everything was associated with Michigan  State, but as a result of the war going on, I was in the ROTC program  there. But I decided, well maybe I would prefer to be in the Navy  program, so I joined the Navy. It was called the V-12 program. What it  was is you continued on in college essentially, but you were in the Navy  5  and it was all Navy-run; that college was Western Michigan at  Kalamazoo, Michigan.  So I was in the V-12 program. I went there a year and a half or two  years   something like that   and when you graduated from there, then  you went into a pre-midshipman program and then midshipman   s  program at Northwestern University. As a result of that, I got my  commission and then there wasn   t much alternative except to be sent to  the islands trying to re-take Japan. But they had a language program     the Navy did   if you qualified for that, then you could study Japanese  language. Well, it turns out that I did qualify for that, so the alternative  being given was some kind of a landing craft and going across the  Pacific looking for an island   not something that I anticipated.  Although a number of my colleagues did and I heard stories that some of  them even got lost. This whole officers candidate program was  shortened so I   m not quite sure how really good sailors we were, at least  I wasn   t too good. Anyway as a result of that, the language program was  in Colorado   the University of Colorado at Boulder. However, that was  full, and we anticipated a long time to get into Japan and so they  expanded that program and opened an oriental language program here at  Oklahoma A M at that time.  I was sent here. You couldn   t get married until you got your  commission, so as soon as I got my commission in 1945, then we got  married. My orders were to come to Stillwater, Oklahoma and we got on  a train which let us off in Ponca City. Ponca City was an interesting  name, but then we still had to get to Stillwater. We didn   t know where  that was. We got on a bus. We were the only non-native   by that, I  mean the bus was filled with Indians   this was our introduction. So we  got   I don   t know, it must have been 10 or 15 minutes   and the bus  stopped. They all got off. We learned later that   s the Ponca reservation.  We didn   t know that at the time, of course, and that four-lane road now  going up there   I can   t believe it was a two-lane   a lot of it was gravel  (Laughs) so we came into Stillwater. We lived at 203 North Duck, a  little garage apartment above the garage. We were just there recently and  that   s been bulldozed away. Now OSU really has expanded unbelievably  from when we were here.  So anyway, that   s how we got here. I did that program and then the war  ended. The program was an 18-month program and it wasn   t finished,  and they said,    Well, are there a number of you that want to stay on?     This was taught by Nisei   that is second generation Japanese  Americans   and of course these are the only ones that were not in the  internment camp in those days. So I said,    Yeah, why not?    So I  finished that program. I don   t know, there must have been 20 or 30 of us  that finished that program and then that    now the war   s over   I got  6  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  discharged in Memphis. Came back here and I had   my original interest  was mathematics and as a result of that, I got to know Dr. Diamond     Ainsley Diamond   at that time was head of the Math Department. Well,  essentially before that I contacted the administration here and wondered  what it would take to get a degree   a bachelor   s degree   and they said,     Well, let   s see.    So they got my credits from Michigan State and  Northwestern and Western Michigan and put them all together and they  said,    Well, also, we can use what you did here,       because it was  equivalent to a masters in Japanese as a major.    You can walk out of  here today with a degree.    I said,    That sounds good.     So as a result of being in the Navy and in Oklahoma   which was  weird   and the war is over, I have a degree. And as I say, Dr. Diamond  said,    Gee, you know, we   ve got all these people coming back on the GI  Bill. How about staying on here and working on a master   s?    I said,     Well, I don   t know. That   s interesting, but we   re from Michigan. I   ll go  back up there and see what   s going on,    and so we went back and  nothing was going on compared to what was happening here. (Laughter)  So I said,    Hey, I   m back,    and so I worked on my master   s degree with  a graduate teaching assistant program.  So you finished here that first degree where you kind of cobbled that  together     Yes.  Was that 1948?  1946.  And then you were working on your master   s from 1946 to     To 1948. Yes. I got the master   s in 1948.  So really in a sense, you didn   t have the traditional undergraduate  experience most people had here?  No. Who knows the alumni my class? I mean, 1946? I didn   t know any  of the other    civilian    students at the time.  Were you in that program   were some OSU faculty teaching sometimes  or was it all military faculty?  Yes, it was all military. We lived off campus, but most of the people  lived   I think it was Cordell Hall, as I recall. The instructors were all, as  I say, Nisei Japanese. I guess they took them out of the internment  7  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  camps. They were young. In fact we made close friends with a number  of them.  So on your master   s program you had more of a student experience,  although a graduate     That was a student experience. Although they were all back from the  war usually and even that was not the heavy (Laughs) OSU experience  that happens these days, I   m sure.  You said you lived off campus and then you came back also, where did  you live?  As I say, we lived at 203 North Duck. I was in the Navy oriental  language program, which was 24/7 as they say today. But then the war  was that way, too. It was very, very heavy and we had a two-hour  written exam once a week and an hour oral exam every Saturday. I used  to go after I   d get out of that, for relaxation, to a record store very close  to the campus theater which was on the corner over here   gone now     and that   s the kind of thing that took place there.  Picking up on that, you were living off campus for your master   s  program, but what did you do for entertainment? Did you have friends?  Well we had friends that were in the program, so we would have social  get-togethers with them. There were programs that were taking place at  the auditorium here on campus, which I gather has been bulldozed and  replaced by the     Seretean Center.     Performance Center   and we   d go there. In fact our first child was  born here in Stillwater in 1946 with the navy doctor. As I say, everybody  stayed on another few months until a number of things got wrapped up.  There were a number of programs at the auditorium and we   d go there  and we danced. We still dance   ballroom dance and we would dance  backstage when there would be these bands playing.  I guess Swim   s was right up the street. Did you do some activities there?  Yes. Well, the other thing   oh, we went swimming often, particularly  when it was hot, at the municipal pool down south of town it seems like.  You talk about Dr. Diamond     Yes.  8  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Tell me a little bit about some of the professors that you knew at the time  and how Dr. Diamond got you engaged   the head of the department at  the time   professors you particularly remember that      Well, O. H. Hamilton and Dr. Allen. There were some other people     Dr. Mendenhall did the astronomy kind of things. The department then  was small, of course, right after the war. There was   who was that?  Somebody in statistics, Carl Marshall.  And where was the Math Department housed?  In Quonset huts.  Quonset huts. (Laughs) I remember those.  Walking through   up here   I saw some pictures of those Quonset huts.  Yes, that was the immediate expansion activities at that time. Also, we  got together with the Japanese teachers, too. Horison was a very close  friend of ours.  You mentioned Dr. Diamond   do you recall the faculty controversy over  the loyalty oath? I think Dr. Diamond was one of your thesis advisors,  and he actually resigned at Oklahoma State and went to the University  of Kansas over the issue. Were you aware of that? Was that an issue  when you were here?  Well, yes. There were a number of things going on. Well, as I say, I  finished my master   s in 1948 and left to take a job at Curtis Wright  Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. I did return here the following year  because they were starting a doctoral program, a new program, with Dr.   Nachman  Aronszajn who was quite famous. Dr. Diamond was very  active in making things happen, I   ll tell you that. (Laughs) So they  started the doctoral program and then there must have been, I don   t  know, four or five of us, I guess.  Did they seek you out for the doctoral program? Did they tell you about  it or did you find out about it some other      No. They invited me back. Yes, we were only in Ohio one year because  I took a job with Curtis Wright Corporation which I found I didn   t care  for and my wife was pregnant with our second child at that time and I  quit. I came home and told her I quit. She said,    You did what?     (Laughs) Well, the idea was   and of course you   re young and brash to  begin with and   I   ll just go down to Ohio State, in Columbus and go to  the Math Department and work on a doctorate there or something and  get some teaching. So anyway, I went down there and the Math  9  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Department didn   t need anybody, but they said the Electrical  Engineering Department was looking for somebody. Again, being young  and brash I assume, I went over to the Electrical Engineering  Department. Now electrical engineering, in at least theory, is all math, so  it was just a matter of reading and keeping ahead of students essentially,  but the problem is no matter what your rank there you had to teach labs,  too. Now that was interesting. But anyway, that   s what happened there.  So I taught electrical engineering for a year there   and they wanted to  keep me on, but as I say, Dr. Diamond and Dr. Aronszajn had this new  program that was starting up and said,    Come back here and        Very attractive to you?  Yes. So we came back.  Were you a teaching assistant or research assistant or     Oh, yes, research assistant. They had an office which was a research  program with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and that provided  quite a bit of money, as a matter of fact. Then I taught, also.  I   m trying to recall, Dean Sheller Scroggs was Dean of the College of  Arts and Sciences. Did you have classes with his son about that time?  I know the name, but I can   t remember that I did.  Did you ever meet Dean Scroggs?  Well, yes. As I said     Well what are your thoughts about him? What do you remember? He  was a long-time, fairly influential person on campus for many, many  years.  Oh, yes. Yes.  What was your recollection?  Well, I really can   t remember. I can hardly remember Dr. Diamond or  Dr. Aronszajn these days. (Laughter)  Dr. Leroy Folks, who for many years was head of the Math Department  here, was an undergraduate student in the 1950s. Did you ever have any  activity with him, any connection?  No. Oh, I   m trying to think of who replaced Dr. Diamond. There was  10  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  another man, and he was here for awhile. I believe Professor Wayne  Johnson.  Dr. Jean Agnew?  Jean Agnew, I knew her well.  You knew her. Well she and Ted Agnew, her husband, taught on the  History faculty     Right.     but Jean had that policy in place where if the husband was employed,  the wife couldn   t work. They finally changed that a little bit later.  Oh, is that right?  Yes. She was one of the best math instructors we had.  Oh, yes, very good.  What do you remember about Jean? Did you have a class with her?  Well, she was a fellow faculty member at that time. We did a lot of  activities together, the whole department. I remember her as a graduate  student   it seemed like it was Friday afternoon, a number of us gathered  at a small   I would call it a beer joint these days      Hangout?  Hangout, that   s right, (Laughter) and as I recall it was 3.2 beer because  this was dry, that was ostensibly dry. (Laughs) So a number of us would  gather there and get together. Of course, I remember her later because  she went to all of the American Mathematical Society conferences and  was responsible for gathering all the OSU graduates together and  having   I think we had a breakfast every time   haven   t gone to those in  many years now.  Let   s see, you mentioned Dr. Hamilton?  Yes, O. H. Hamilton.  I   ve heard of Professor Hamilton   he used the Moore Method     Yes, out of Texas.  11  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Out of Texas? What do you remember about the Moore Method?  Well, I   ll tell you what I remember about the Moore Method. Dr. Allen  was the other   I can   t remember his first name now   when I first  started graduate work, he was my ultimate professor. He was extremely  prepared. He had every lecture written out and would proceed to go  through that in great detail, written out and you could follow it just  beautifully. It was something. I thought this was it but that   s not it, it  turned out.  Now O. H. Hamilton   s method was the Moore Method. In terms of  mathematics, you hand out a page of axioms, postulates, and theorems  and of course there is nothing else. And what you do is go from these  axioms, postulates and prove these theorems   nothing else. I thought I   d  hit a different field of study even. It was radically different and very  hard, very difficult, very frustrating. What this all came down to was     in a fairly short period of time after I got through that horrendous thing  O. H. Hamilton was my thesis advisor and he was the ultimate teacher. I  learned a lot because I taught many years later in the sense that  presenting a beautiful lecture can be appreciated by the students, but  what do they learn? They only learn if you essentially pose questions  and queries and have them do things without them being told exactly  what to do. They have to create and that was actually a method I used  later.  Used that in your career then later, did you?  And that wasn   t too popular with students at first, either. I taught at, well  a number of places, but I taught at San Jose State University where I did  essentially my academic work teaching later. I was teaching in the  School of Business. I was teaching Quantitative Studies in the School of  Business at this time. The new dean didn   t appreciate it, because the  students would complain. I would ask them something, and of course I  hadn   t told them yet and that was one of their complaints      He hasn   t  even told us yet what       That whole query method, I actually developed  there at San Jose State under the acronym of DIRGIE. It was the method  of Direction. And then Individual Response. They all had to even write a  response because when you have to write something, you have to think  on your own. Then there was Group Interaction. They were in small  groups. They would get together and discuss their responses. And then  Evaluation where I would call a member from each group and they  would give a response and I   d write that on the board and then lecture  which essentially was discussing what these responses were. It was  always interesting.  Having three degrees from Oklahoma State University and being one of  12  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  the first three individuals who received a PhD in mathematics     That   s right.  Do you take pride in that?  Oh, yes. We were the first three to receive the doctorate in mathematics.  There could have been five in the program. George Pedrick went to  University of Kansas and finished up there. The two other doctoral  students were Abdul Gazem Zirachzedah, an Iranian student, and Dal  Gerneth, who was a student from Texas.  Did you keep up with them over the years?  Yes, we maintained contact. They   re both gone now, although I   ve  talked to Abul   s wife periodically. Dr. Zirachzedah ended up teaching at  the University of Colorado in Boulder, and Dr. Gerneth taught at various  places, but he was primarily associated with industry which I was for a  number of years, too.  It sounds like from our conversation about the Moore Method that you     did you feel like your degrees and instruction, learning, your education  at OSU prepared you for your career?  Oh, yes. Yes, very much. Well that technique (Laughs) left you with  creating and taking material or what is there and thinking. Thinking was  the idea, but it was so hard in the beginning, so hard.  Well, you alluded to a couple of things. Can you share briefly a little bit  about your career, your professional career and your life after you left  Oklahoma State University?  Yes, let   s see. I got the doctorate in 1953 and I took a job with  Continental Oil Company in Ponca City in the Geophysical Research  Department. The primary activity that I did there was analysis work for a  new geophysical mapping technique where instead of using dynamite  and have geophones arranged to try and map the underground, that they  used a technique   we developed this technique of   it   s actually trade  named Vibrosys, where we used the controlled frequencies. That is, it  was large machinery essentially tied to the ground where we did  vibration at various frequencies and used that technique because you  could use that in urban areas. And having just returned from Conoco  Museum, that was a big thing up there   many companies, I was told,  tried to break that patent. The patent came in 1955. I was there from    53  to    56 during the development. It became worldwide and is the primary  technique used today.  13  Gill  Clark  So I left there right at the peak of that activity, but a couple of things I  wanted to do: study with Dr. Tarsky at the University of California in  Berkeley, and I had received an appointment at the Naval Postgraduate  School in Monterey, California to teach   and so it seemed like we  should go. We were heading to California, and in California, Sputnik     What happened is I ran into a bunch of colleagues from various  universities there, and they said,    Why don   t you talk to Lockheed?  They   re gonna open up a research facility in Palo Alto, and they   re  looking for people.    Well, I talked to them. They said,    What are you  making at the postgraduate school?    They doubled that.  Berkeley didn   t look near as attractive     Well, and they said,    You won   t have any activities for the first year.  You can do post-doctoral work at Stanford and various other things.     Yes. So I never made it to the Postgraduate School. I was with Lockheed  essentially doing basic research and, of course, at that time electronic  computers were starting to come on, the development of them. You  didn   t go out and buy an IBM; everybody built their own, and they were  in huge rooms. But one of the primary things I did there was develop a  mathematical business system model. That was new. Nobody had done  that. At corporate Lockheed, which was in Burbank, they said,    Would  you be interested in doing that?     Now my degree, by the way, my mathematics degree, was in pure  mathematics, not applied. Lockheed had gathered over 50 PhDs in  mathematics at that time with essentially no assignments because they  were, of course, looking for big contracts   which came, and so all of  that did develop. I decided that I really should stay there and work on  that, and even though my degree was in pure mathematics, closure  relation  C-R  algebra was my thesis topic I said,    I could be interested  in doing that.    Well it turns out that   s the kind of thing that   s an  operations researcher does these days but at that time it didn   t have a  name and there was nothing around like it. So what I had to do was  essentially study the corporate structure and the operations of Lockheed  and try to model that mathematically, which we did. But these days  (Laughs) the computer capabilities makes it look easier now. So I was  with Lockheed for about five years. Then they lost some contracts and as  a result of that I was laid off.  This was an unbelievable emotional problem. I was a hotshot PhD  working with a corporate office and so forth. However, they were kind  how they did it. Then I went with Sylvania Corporation which had a  research lab there. So it wasn   t that bad, of course, but at the time it  seemed like it. I was with Sylvania about three years or something like  that   four years I guess it was   same thing happened to them. In fact,  14  as I was into some research they said,    Well, finish that up.    So it was  two or three months later and I interviewed for a job at Matson Lines  which was doing operations research (OR) work in developing, at that  time, a brand new concept, containerization. Would I be interested in  that?  Well it sounded interesting, and that was in San Francisco, but at the  same time I interviewed with Texas Instruments in Dallas   or  Richardson, north of Dallas. They wined and dined us unbelievably, kept  flying us back there and now I know what it means to be seduced.  (Laughs) I said,    Hey, we   ll do it.    So we moved to Texas. We sold  everything in California because I knew that would be a problem, and  also the idea was we   ll go back to the Southwest. Well Texas is not  Oklahoma. It   s some other foreign country. (Laughs) Everybody was  very nice, and we never lived so well   a beautiful home and  unbelievable lifestyle, but we   I don   t know. It wasn   t Oklahoma to  begin with and so as a result we were only down there two or three  years, I think.  So then I came back to California. Northrup Corporation had a research  lab in the Bay area, Astrotechnology, and had me come back to that and  I headed up a department there and that went for another four years and  it folded. Now Northrup wanted me to come to the headquarters in  southern California, and we didn   t want to go to southern California.  California consists of two states, northern California and southern  California   they   re radically different, really   but as a result of that   they established Northrup Advanced Studies in the San Francisco Bay  area for me to head up.   After about five years I went with a new organization called Underwater  Sciences that was doing research work in all kinds of underwater  activity, and wanted me to come there and head up the research  department. So I did that. One of the things they were developing was  underwater techniques for gold mining, which   the potential was very  lucrative. Another area they were doing, new techniques for dredging  reservoirs, and there was some industrial sabotage   our competitors  were using older techniques and they actually physically blew our  operation right out of the water, literally, and the company never  recovered from that.  Now in the meantime, I had contracts with the China Lake Navy  developing mathematical models for weapons. We were in Vietnam  then, too, so we could essentially study the effects of blowing up power  plants and so forth without blowing them up of course. I novated those  contracts and opened my own company, Interscience Systems, Inc. and  took those contracts that were still there from Underwater Sciences and  15  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  ran those for another four years   always, by the way, teaching on the  side. I always taught evening programs and so forth.  Was this last one your own businesses you   re talking about or      Right, Interscience Systems. I was very active, for awhile. Then, as I  say, I was always teaching on the side and so forth. Well the other thing  I would do in terms of academics is every spring I   d think,    I   m going to  go teaching full-time someplace.    So now that was in March when you  interview. I   d fly around the country various places, Utah, Idaho,  Virginia, West Virginia, a number of places. I   d get there and, of course,  it was very bleak looking. March was   trees were still sticks, you know,  and in March in northern California, that   s when Spring starts, I mean,  everything is blossoming and it   s green.    I don   t know. I don   t think I  can leave this area.     Did you ever get back into     Well, I did. I finally did. Yes. Then due to this variety, it was five years  here, five years there, and at that time there was not a retirement benefit  that you could carry from place to place. They were always cashed out  and it seemed like I better get someplace and now it seemed appropriate  that the full time academic world might do it. So I made local contact  with San Jose State University. I did not teach in the Mathematics  Department, I taught in three different schools: engineering, social  sciences, and business. All of these areas, by the way, had   and that   s  true of almost every discipline   started to move into the quantitative  side of things, building models and so forth. Due to my real general  background, I was able to do this. The discipline wasn   t that important.  The Dean of the Engineering said,    Everything is too narrow. We need  to develop a systems program in general systems theory,    and so I  helped develop the graduate program there called Cybernetic Systems  and that was a program that was involved with general systems.  Of course, one of the systems I had studied in detail was the business  system of Lockheed Corporation. So as a result of that, the business  school got a hold of me and said,    What about teaching in our  quantitative area here?    and that was very interesting. I eventually went  with the School of Business. My professorship was at the School of  Business in Quantitative Studies and Decision Sciences.  I developed a  detailed model of a general business system.  One of the big areas that  was starting was Information Systems or Management Information  Systems. So that   s essentially where I ended up the last eight, nine years  in the academic field, and then I retired from there in 1989 at the peak of  information system research. I didn   t feel that it was time for me to retire  exactly, although in terms of retirement credits at university and a  16  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  number of other things, it seemed appropriate to do that.  You live in the state of Washington. Is that correct?  Yes, right now. Well, we still live in California in the Santa Cruz  Mountains.  Two homes?  We spend about two months or so in Washington and then we come  down to California for about a month or so.  You   ve got to go back to California. Don   t you have grandkids or kids      Yes, we have grandchildren. All our children live in the Bay area,  essentially. Well, one of them is a county planner in San Luis Obispo.  We had three daughters and now we have three great-grandchildren.  They   re all in California. So there   s always something taking place  there   birthdays, weddings, something, so that   s why we kept the house  there actually.  This is your first time back here in many, many years   what do you  think of your alma mater now?  Oh, my    (Laughs) It has been over 50 years.  Have you been on campus? Were you able to find some of the      Well, luckily, you sent me a map   and it took me awhile to find what I  call the original campus. I did that by saying,    Here   s the fire station.  That   s still there.     Old Central.  Old Central, yes, and then I started to   that part of the campus, I could  identify with essentially all     You remember the Student Union. It was here a couple of years before  you left, right?  Yes, the Student Union, but I think it   s expanded maybe ...  It has.  It must be because I   m looking at the map. This wasn   t the size it was  before. But yes, it was essentially new, more or less. The Student Union  17  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  was such a nice place.  Are you proud of the growth of your alma mater?  Oh, yes. That was the other thing. Mathematically it   s grown very great.  How do you feel about the Math Department? Have you had a chance or  are you going to go over and visit?  I am going to visit this afternoon.  You talked about your meetings with Jean Agnew at your national  meetings and you followed OSU heavily through the years and stay  connected     Yes. Oh, yes. I can   t think of the name right now, maybe it was  Mathematical Research Institute or something like that   is in the Palo  Alto area, and that   s headed up by a professor who was here at OSU.  That   s great. Through some of your correspondence and some of your  meetings have you stayed connected to OSU?  I haven   t stayed that connected at all, but I am connected again.  That   s great.  I   m back here.  Well, let me follow that a little bit. Looking back, are there some special  memories, favorite times you had at OSU in your experience here?  Well, the doctoral program was very, very intense so there wasn   t a lot  of activity other than what I mentioned. It seemed like once a week on  Friday afternoon a lot of us would gather up there at this   I   d call it a  beer joint, I don   t know. It was a brand new one; it   s not even there now,  I guess. I couldn   t find it.  And it sounded like Dr.Hamilton   s Moore Method was a mixed blessing,  but it   s been a special memory for you.  Oh, yes. Well, it   s the only way to teach. I mean, every individual does a  slightly different technique on the Moore Method, but it requires you to  be creative and think and     Finally, did your OSU background experience serve you well, in your  career experience? Did your training in mathematics here at OSU and  18  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  your OSU experience serve you well?  Oh, served me extremely well. It was in pure mathematics, but as a  result of that   it   s sort of like the classical pianist that once you know a  lot about the basics of it all, then you   re able to really do anything from  that. You see, I went from pure mathematics into essentially applied  math. By the way, pure mathematics is a lonely business. There are five  people in the country that know what you   re talking about. One of them  was Dr. Tarsky, but socially it   s not that great I guess. So I went into  applied mathematics and then the engineering aspects of things. Then  into, well, the various industries that were involved, and then into the  quantitative area in business. So as a result of the training here, the basic  and the breadth of that, I was able to feel comfortable and do anything  really. I don   t know how much quantitative activity is involved in  history these days. (Laughs) Not that much.  That   s a great testimony to your background here. Dr. Clark, in closing,  anything else you   d like to bring up or mention that we haven   t talked  about?  After I retired from San Jose State, I felt at the peak really in terms of  intellectual activity, I took a position at the College of Notre Dame in  Belmont, California, which is a private school, in their graduate  program. All during this time I had developed   I didn   t use standard  textbooks   I had developed my own manuscripts for all of these courses  actually, and also Information Systems was another area that I had gone  into big-time. The College of Notre Dame wanted somebody to take  their graduate program in the Quantitative Studies area and Information  Systems. So I went with them, and that was the best teaching in the  sense it was all graduate students. The maximum was ten in a class and I  rotated through these four syllabus manuscripts that I had written, and I  did that for another   I guess it was eight years or something like that.  So, yes, that was something I   d forgotten about.  Dr. Clark, thank you very much for taking the time with me today, and  welcome back to OSU and Homecoming. Do you remember  Homecoming?  Oh, I remember it   great   I remember the parades.  You   re going to see the parade tomorrow. You   re going to see some  house decorations. What do you remember from Homecoming back  when you were here?  Well, the thing I remember   actually the house decorations at that time  was something, but it wasn   t the big thing as I understand now is really  19  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  Gill  Clark  big.  Huge.  Walk Around is, as I found out. But I remember the parade, and I was     Floats     Yes, and of course the other thing I remember about in terms of the  athletic situation, that   s when Hank Iba was here and basketball   and  wrestling was big, too   but basketball was really one of the top in the  country. And of course the football stadium, something changed over  there.  And at Gallagher Iba Arena.  Yes. Unbelievable. We   re looking forward to that.  Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
