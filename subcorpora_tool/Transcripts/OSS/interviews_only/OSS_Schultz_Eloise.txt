 Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Today is Saturday, October 21. It   s about 10:30 in the morning, and I   m  here at the OSU Alumni Center with Eloise Schultz. My name is Jennifer  Paustenbaugh with the OSU Library, and Mrs. Schultz has agreed to be  interviewed as part of our O-STATE Stories Project. When you came in,  we asked you to fill out a questionnaire and, just looking at that  information, you indicated on here that you attended OSU from 1956 to  1958     Yes.     and you were here when the university changed from OAMC to OSU?  It happened in my senior year.  And were you a transfer student?  Yes.  Where did you transfer from?  I transferred from Oklahoma College for Women at Chickasha.  I went there one year.  And what made you decide to come up here to school?  Well, when I started school I didn   t really know what I wanted to do and  so my mother decided that maybe I ought to go down  Chickasa  there  and major in music. After one year, I decided that that would not be a  money-making degree for me at all. It was a wonderful experience, but I  needed to get something practical and my heart had always been at OSU  because both my parents went there and Dad   s state office was here and  all I ever knew was Oklahoma A M.  5  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  You had mentioned to me before we started the interview that your  mother graduated from here in 1935.  1935. My Dad in    34.  That was kind of unusual for someone in your generation to have had  parents who both graduated from college.  I think they were very fortunate because they came from modest means.  In fact, Dad   s junior year of school, he came to OAMC with five dollars  in his pocket.  That   s just incredible     I know.     and that he was able to make it.  He was able to make it, yes. Yes.  Did you have siblings?  I have a sister.  And did she also go to Oklahoma A M?  She attended OAMC, but my husband and I introduced her to a  fraternity brother of his, and they eloped    (Laughter) and so she didn   t  finish school here. She moved to Iowa with him and, after her youngest  child started school she drove in to Omaha, Nebraska to finish her  degree. But she did start out here. She got two years.  Was that something that was encouraged as you were growing up   the  expectation that you would go to college?  Education was important.  That   s really wonderful. Well, since this is Homecoming weekend, we do  have some questions that are related to Homecoming. What were  Homecoming events like when you were a student here?  Well, we didn   t have the Walk Around. This is a new concept. We had  beautiful floats that the fraternities and sororities built.  I have seen pictures of some of those.  6  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  There was one in the paper here recently   I guess it was The  Oklahoman   and it was two of my sorority sisters on the float for the  Acacias.  What sorority did you say you were in?  Zeta Tau Alpha  And they had the house just across from        from Theta Pond, which was a wonderful location.  Yes, it was. Now, was it called Theta Pond at the time you went to  school?  Yes. And it wasn   t near as attractive as it is now. (Laughter)  It   s really just in the last couple of years that whole area has been re-made  and renovated   and it   s so beautiful     It really is.  And that fountain sure helps to keep the water     Absolutely.     moving around in there. When you lived in the sorority house across  from the pond, what was that pond like? Was it stagnant or     Very.  It probably didn   t smell real bad?  Not too clean.  Do you have any memories that are associated with Theta Pond in  particular?  Well, we had a wonderful view whenever there was a pond party, and  we got to see a lot of fellas thrown in. (Laughter)  You   re talking about pond parties   is that associated with someone  being engaged or     Or if they were pinned or even given a drop   fraternity drop.  7  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Now, what was that?  It was a little insignia on a chain and that was before you were pinned.  Pinned. I   ve maybe heard that same expression before of being  lavaliered    Is that     I have no idea. That   s a new term.  Okay.  Times have changed.  There were wonderful floats that the sororities and fraternities made.  And I know there were some house decorations, but not like what they  are today.  I don   t recall house decorations at all...  You don   t?     but then I don   t remember everything. (Laughter)  Were there any other traditions associated with Homecoming that you  remember in particular? I mean, if there were floats then obviously  there was a big parade     It was the parade   a big parade. That was the big, important emphasis,  and Homecoming was not as big as it is today.  I know that so many alumni return now, but at the time you were going  to school here, were   there were obviously fewer alumni to begin with  at that time, but did many of them return to campus or is that a more  recent phenomenon?  Well, living in the house, we always had a lot of girls come back, so I  assume that it was a big thing then   but maybe it   s on a bigger scale  now.  What made you decide that you wanted to be in a sorority?  My mother was.  Was she a Zeta, too?  Yes. Yes.  8  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  All right, that influence can be really strong.  You   re right. It is.  Are there other traditions that you remember from your time as a  student here other than Homecoming or pond parties?  Well, the one thing that really stands out is that the girls had a curfew.  We had to be in by 10:00 at night and they locked the doors. That no  longer happens.  So what would happen if you got locked out?  Well, I really don   t know because (Laughter) I didn   t try it. (Laughter)  Did you hear stories from other girls who weren   t so lucky?  No, but I didn   t live in the dorm on campus so I really don   t know what  happened to the girls in the dorm.  All right. But that curfew was true regardless of whether you were in a  dorm or in a sorority?  Yes. That   s right.  And I assume that you had house mothers     Yes.     and so what was her relationship with the girls that lived in the  house?  She tried to be helpful. She tried to be reassuring. She was an away-from-  home mom, and some of them we liked and some we didn   t, you  know.  So did they change from time to time?  Yes, ours did while I was there. Some of them didn   t change for years.  What was dress like on campus? (Laughter) I take it people did not go to  class in their pajamas or    (Laughter)  And we didn   t go in blue jeans either.  So, you would always have worn a dress?  9  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  We had a skirt and sweater or a dress.  And that was true even if you went     And when we went to church, we always had to wear a hat and gloves.  I remember doing that when I was little. Even when you went to social  events on campus or if you were studying in the library in the evenings,  you would still be dressed up in a skirt and   I mean, you probably  didn   t consider it being dressed up     I don   t remember that, but we probably were more relaxed   probably  wore jeans to study, and I did spend a lot of hours at the library.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Good for you. Now the library building   had already been built?  It was new.  It was new when you got here. And you said you spent a lot of time  studying there   do you have any particular memories of the library?  No  No?  No.  Okay. Spending time     Just studying. (Laughter)  Now, the fountain was not part of the original building was it   I mean  when they opened that building that fountain wasn   t operational?  I thought it was.  Well, it could have been. Now that I   m thinking about it     And then the formal gardens were out in front of it, which are all gone  now.  Yes. So, I bet it was really a beautiful view.  10  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  It was.  Are there other places on campus that you visited with a great deal of  frequency? The Student Union     The Student Union was our hangout.  And what kinds of things did you     We went for coffee between classes, visited with a lot of people, and  played bridge. Also, I studied over there in the Union, too   up on  different floors in different rooms, between classes.  So how was bridge organized? Was there like a     Oh, it was just individual groups.  So you just would pick up and find three other people that wanted to  play     Right.  And that was just pretty much wherever there was a table and four  chairs available     Or a friend or whatever.  Were there places to eat in the Union?  Oh yes.  You mentioned getting coffee.  In the cafeteria which is no longer there.  No. (Laughter) Like a lot of things.  Right.  And were there other places on campus or off-campus that were popular  hangouts for you and your friends?  There might have been, but I did not have wheels  referring to a car  so I  was pretty limited.  Well, I know there were some places that were on the strip   like  11  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Swim   s     Right. We would go down there to eat sometimes on the weekends when  the house dining room was closed.  Oh, all right.  Sunday night in particular.  So, even though your parents were here in Stillwater, you pretty much     No, my parents did not live here.  Oh, your parents were not here? Where were they at the time that you  attended school here?  Medford.  Medford, okay. And you said that your father was the Extension Agent  for Grant County?  Yes, that   s where he retired.  What kinds of things did you do for fun while you were a student here  besides playing bridge? There would have been things that involved  your friends   but did you go to dances or     There were some. If you were in the dating stream, why there were  dances and parties to go to. The movies were a big thing then.  And there was that movie theater that was up on the corner        on the corner which is where the Hideaway is now     Okay.     or you could go downtown on Main Street. There was a new theater  down there.  Oh, okay. Was that like between Sixth and Seventh?  Yes. The fa  ade is still there.  Okay, that   s right. How many shows per month would they show?  Oh, I don   t have a clue. (Laughs)  12  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  So would it just be one movie at a time and it was in the theater     Right. Right. It   s not like it is now with multiple     Yes. It   s mind boggling. (Laughter) And most of them aren   t even that  good.  I know. (Laughter) They were good movies back then. (Laughs)  That   s right. And you said that you didn   t have a car, so how frequently  were you able to go home?  Oh, maybe once a month.  Okay, and most students didn   t have cars     No.     so they were more or less here on the weekends and...  Yes. So we had to devise our own entertainment   and if we were really  studious, we studied. (Laughter)  How would you have gotten home? Would your parents have come here  to pick you up or     Sometimes, I had a ride with somebody from home.  Okay.  One of the fellas.  And today that trip to Medford would take what   about an hour and  fifteen minutes approximately?  Oh, let   s see. Probably, because it   s forty-five minutes...fifty minutes  from my house now, and it   s forty-five on from my house to Medford.  All right. So how long would the trip last?  Well, we didn   t have I-35 and we didn   t have the Cimarron Turnpike so  it was two-lane highway all the way.  And was it paved road all the way?  Yes.  13  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  It was?  Well, no. There was part of Highway 11 west of Blackwell that was still  dirt     Okay.     but we didn   t go up that way.  Okay. Well, I had heard that even Highway 51 was     That   s right.     well ten years previously had been unpaved.  That   s right. That   s right.  Yes. I just can   t imagine what that must have been like after a heavy rain  with all that mud     In 1957, it flooded.  Yes. Yes. We heard about that.  And I spent the night   it was the night before finals   in the basement of  the house bailing water out so it wouldn   t get into the boiler, and it just  all went over and flowed through the Pi Phi house.  Oh, gee.  Because their dining room, I believe, was sitting down in the lower area,  and it just flowed over from the street down into the dining room. I think  that   s what it was, but     What a mess.  It was.  So they didn   t cancel finals     No. No, but Stillwater flooded bad. (Laughter) You know how that is.  Nothing cancels finals.  If someone mentions OSU or OAMC, is there anything that immediately  comes to mind for you?  14  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  It was just a wonderful time in my life. The sorority house was my home  away from home, and it was my family. I don   t believe that situation  exists anymore, and it was a wonderful experience.  Do you still maintain contact or friendships with some of your sorority  sisters?  I have. I have a few. And I have been going to a reunion every three  years with a group that   s just two or three, four years younger than I am,  and I enjoy it thoroughly.  So, is this here or do you go     No, we   ve been going all over the country.  Oh, how fun. I can see why you would enjoy that.  I   ve seen places that we didn   t go otherwise. (Laughs)  That   s really wonderful. How often do you come back to campus?  Oh, we have season tickets for football games so we   re on campus in the  fall. And I bring my dad in the spring to the Animal Science awards  banquet because he presents a scholarship.  Is it one that he set up     He and my mother set it up.  That   s really great. Is that through the College of Agriculture?  Yes, through the Foundation     The Foundation?     and Animal Science Department.  Great. Is this designed for the assistance of students in Animal Science  that     Yes, from the Northwest District.  That   s really wonderful. I know that the College of Agriculture probably  has the best scholarships     Do they really?  15  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz     of any of the colleges.  Really? Very good.  That   s good to hear that he does that. When you were here and the name  of the institution changed, how did you feel about that?  I was upset. The university concept just wasn   t in the right mode at that  point, you know. There   s constant change in the world and you always  say,    Oh, I don   t want that to change,    but we get used to it. And that   s  what   s happened here.  Sure.  But I was really upset when they changed our school song. (Laughs) I  loved that song. (Laughs) So, it   s the wave song now.  Were students involved in choosing the new song or how did that work?  There was a selection committee.  I know introducing something like that to some degree seems really  artificial because it   s not your song     No, it   s not. And finally, just this year, I   m able to sing that song...  (Laughter) after all these years. (Laughs) But we weren   t in Oklahoma  for a number of years so I didn   t really have any reason to try. (Laughs)  So what led you to Billings then if you were out of state?  When he  husband  retired from the Air Force. He came back to farm  because he took over from his dad.  So that   s where their family farm was then, in that area?  Right. It was not my choice. (Laughs)  To come back to Oklahoma or to come back to     To go to Billings at the farm.  Well, if he weren   t in the Air Force you probably would not have been to  some interesting places     Yes, wonderful places. South Dakota was not the best one.  16  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Well   was your husband a missile officer?  Eventually he was. Then he ended up in missile nuclear safety in  Albuquerque. That was his final job.  My father was an Air Force officer, so when I hear people have been in  the Dakotas, I usually think they were in missiles.  It was the banana belt of the Dakotas.  Definitely. (Laughs) If you were to give advice to future, or even the  current, students, would you have any advice?  Pursue all you can and get the education you can because you just do not  know down the road what is going to happen in your life and you need  to be prepared to support yourself.  You said that that was really a driving factor for you when you came to  school here was the difference between liking music but knowing that  you        could not make a living from it. Of course, I had no idea I was going  to get married and wouldn   t need to, but    (Laughs)  You mentioned before we started the interview that you met your  husband when he was a graduate student here   and were you a senior?  My senior year.  Okay. So, how soon after that did you marry?  A year later.  A year later.  He went on active duty after he got his master   s degree in 1958 and went  on active duty and came back the next year, and we got married. So I  worked one year.  Okay. So you got a taste of that     Yes.  And you knew that you could support yourself if you needed to     Well, I was going to go to work after we got married, but family became  17  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  primary responsibility.  Tell me about your children.  We have a son, David that graduated from Stillwater in 19   well, I   ve  lost count. He was supposed to graduate in    82. Things didn   t work out  for him so he dropped out. He finished his ROTC  Reserve Officer  Training Corps  commitment, came back and worked for us for awhile  and then came back to school, finished his bachelor   s and got his  master   s.  Well, good.  He   s an electrical engineer.  Okay. Did he get his degrees from OSU?  Oh, yes.  He did, okay. And I take it he was in Air Force ROTC?  Yes. And then our daughter graduated in    84, and then she worked for a  few years and then she went to pharmacy school at Weatherford and  became a pharmacist. She was in medical research.  So both of your children decided to go to school here?  Well, my son said he didn   t have any choice. (Laughter) We were in  Albuquerque at the time and I said,    Well now, David, you can either go  here in New Mexico or you can go to Oklahoma, and you can go to OSU  or OU.    I said,    They have both good engineering schools.    And he  didn   t believe me, so one day he came home from school and he says,     Well, Mom, I guess you were right.    That   s the only time he   s ever told  me that. (Laughter) I don   t know anything anymore. But I said,    What  do you mean?    He says,    Well, my math teacher says OU has a real  good engineering school.    And I said,    Well, you didn   t believe me, did  you?       But I   d prefer you went to OSU.    (Laughter)  I think that would be a little bit hard to take as a parent if you were an  OSU alum to write that check to the University of Oklahoma.  Yes. That   s true. It would.  So, well maybe you   ll have another generation in the family that will  attend     18  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Paustenbaugh  Schultz  Not likely.  Not likely?  Not likely.  All right. Well. Is there anything about your experience here that you  wished that I had asked you that I didn   t ask you about? Or any story  that you   d like to tell    (Laughter)  I   m not full of stories like the fellas are. (Laughs) It was just a wonderful  time here. Campus is not anything like it once was, now. There was  more of a homelike feeling. There   s just so many here now.  It   s kind of hard to keep that coziness when you have more than 20,000  students.  That   s right. But it was such an enjoyable time.  That   s great. Well, I really appreciate your doing this.  Thank you.  It   s been really fun visiting with you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
