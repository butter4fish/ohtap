 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is October 20th, 2007 and I am at the ConocoPhillips  OSU Alumni Center interviewing Jo Ann Pegues. This interview is  being conducted as part of O-STATE Stories, an oral history project of  the OSU Library. Thank you for joining us today.  You   re very welcome.  Well let   s learn a little bit about you, if you could, tell us where you are  from, where you grew up.  I grew up mostly in Payne County, Oklahoma, on a farm not too far  from here   the address was Perkins, Oklahoma. I was my mother   s only  child, so I grew up basically as an only child because my sister and  brother were much older than I. My dad had a large farm near Wild  Horse Creek which is on Highway 33, between Perkins and Coyle. We  grew alfalfa, wheat, corn, cotton   those kinds of crops. My dad was  honored for his crops by OSU when he was actively farming and that  was a nice tribute for him. Actually his picture hung on the wall at Payne  County Bank for years with him in one of his fields of cotton. I grew up  participating in 4-H Club   that was my main source of activity  throughout my teen years.  My mother was a teacher. She taught in one-room school houses when I  was a little girl. I attended the schools where she taught during my years  of elementary school. When I graduated from the eighth grade I rode the  school bus to school in Stillwater. That   s pretty much my childhood.  There weren   t a lot of kids   when you live on a farm you usually don   t  have a lot of playmates because there weren   t a lot of farmers that had  children to play with. Most farm kids worked and did not have a lot of  spare time.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Did you help out on the farm?  Oh yes, I did everything. We baled hay   I rode the hay baler and  stacked hay and we   d combine wheat. I rode the combine and I learned  to drive a truck. Of course when you live on a farm, farm kids always  drove vehicles earlier than most city children. So I did a little bit of  everything because my dad had no sons around by the time I was old  enough to work, so it was me. I use to ride the back of the drill when we  planted wheat and then I helped my mother freeze foods from the  garden. We preserved all of our own food. We raised chickens, hogs and  cattle so we always had our own meat. We grew almost everything we  ate. I learned to do the work of canning and preserving foods as a child.  Well why did you attend OAMC? Was it just because it was so close?  Yes, I think so. My mother and sister both graduated from Langston  University and I just decided I wanted to do something different, so I  chose to go to Oklahoma A M College. And at the time   I guess you   ll  ask me about that later   but at the time I came there were very few  black students here. We were a part of that first group that helped to  integrate OSU.  What was your major?  I enrolled in the School of Home Economics, because as a member of  4-H Club, I had experienced a lot of things that were home-ec related. I  sewed and I used to conduct food demonstrations. My home  demonstration agent was very influential in my life, helped me to decide  that was an area that I liked, because she would always find  opportunities for me to demonstrate my cooking skills. I made yeast  rolls   that was my specialty. I actually won a trip to Washington D.C.  for my accomplishments in 4-H Club. My home economics teacher in  high school also influenced me because we did a lot of sewing and a lot  of cooking and I knew I liked to do those kinds of things.  My mother was a school teacher. My sister majored in elementary  education and was a school teacher for awhile and I didn   t think I  wanted to be a teacher, but I wanted to do something in that field. So,  when I came here, I had a very great advisor who talked to me about  dietetics. She said,    Had you ever thought about dietetics?    I had no  clue. I didn   t know any dietitians. I didn   t know anything about the field  of dietetics. Once I got here that was the route I decided to take.  Let   s talk a little bit about campus at that time. You mentioned that you  were one of the first groups to enroll to help integrate OAMC/OSU.  What was that like for you? We talked to other alumni and they say,  6  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues     Well, we didn   t really notice race relations at that time, it really wasn   t  that big of a deal        (Laughs) Yes, that   s because they weren   t black. It   s never a big deal for  the person that   s on the other side of the coin.  Exactly, so what was it like for you? Was it hard, was it difficult  breaking that barrier?  I had some survival skills because when we moved to the farm in Payne  County from Logan County, I was quite young and we were the only  black family in that area of the county. It was interesting because  farmers are people that help each other, so if you   re harvesting grain,  then all of the farmers pitch in and help other farmers to harvest their  crops. My dad was no different, he just got into the mix, and he would  work with them. I never will forget when we fixed dinner, my mother  cooked and everybody sat down and ate at our table. When my dad went  to these other farmers homes, they wanted to put him at a separate table.  That was like   you come to my house, you   re going to eat at my table,  so what's the problem here? As a result I was aware of the kinds of  discrimination that went on.  I followed my dad   s lead   he was open with everyone and he happened  to be a very good farmer. He was a very smart man although he didn   t  have a formal education. For example, he would take the grain to  Perkins to the granary and when you parked on the scales you weighed  the truck full and then you weighed it empty. He would have figured out  in his head how much grain he had on the truck before the man could do  it on the adding machine. He was just that smart. So there was no sense  that I was any less important or less skilled than anybody else, I learned  those skills.  When we came here to OSU I felt that I didn   t have a problem relating  to other people, they may have a problem relating to me. I had been  riding the school bus all those years to Stillwater from where we lived.  That was twenty-five miles and Perkins was just right down the road. So  the year that the schools were integrated, I should really have gone to  Perkins, but I was a senior and I did not want to go to a new school. I  got permission and I came to Stillwater and finished with my class. I  went to Perkins for a week and I thought,    Ah, I don   t think I want to do  this, I think I want to go and be with my class.     When I came to OSU there were, I believe, about eighteen black  students. I lived in Murray Hall and for me it was interesting to see the  attitudes of the white girls regarding why they were in school. Most of  the white girls seemed to be focused on getting a man. I came to the  7  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  school to get an education because I was always taught you need to get  an education so that you can take care of yourself, you don   t need to  depend on anyone. And that was my goal. I need to get this degree.  The conversations   there was not a lot in common when you thought  about why we were they all there, because they were the party animals  and the sororities and all that. We didn   t have any sororities. I felt very  fortunate because my advisor, her name was Mary Leidigh, in the  School of Home Economics liked me. She just sort of held my hand  throughout the four years that I was here. She always gave me good  advice and she would sit and talk to me and tell me things. So I just felt  like she was in my corner and I was on the right track.  Now, you talk to my husband on the other hand, he had some very  different experiences as did many of the other black students. The  grading system was hard. I made straight A   s in high school. I didn   t  know what it was to get a B or a C or to get a D, and I ended up with a  couple D   s and C   s and I   m thinking,    This is not good,    but I attribute  it to the fact that I believe I was graded differently than the other people  in the class. You just had to keep going. You couldn   t let that stop you  and it was designed to discourage us, I   m sure. A lot of students did  flunk out, they just decided, you know,    I don   t have to put up with  this.     How did they room you at Murray, did they mix?  I had a black roommate.  Did anybody have a white roommate?  I don   t think so. Looking back I think everybody had a black roommate  or they were in a room by themselves.  At that time was there meal service in Murray Hall?  Yes the meal service was wonderful. That   s what I   m appalled by now  because they don   t have the same system of meal service. If you look at  what's happening in the world, in the country, everybody   s obese.  People are eating too much and are eating all the wrong things. All you  see is fast foods on campus now. And I think not only should these  students get an education, they should be taught something about health.  We ought to be trying to help them with their health as well as their  education. My grandson is here and all I have seen is a la carte fast  foods and I just have a real problem with that.  We had great food. We had balanced meals and we had choices. There  8  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  was usually a choice of two meats, vegetables, desserts and salads. It  was like going to a restaurant every day. Yes, food service was  excellent and I ended up being part of it so you know I thought it was  great.  Did you not partake of it all the time or   ?  Oh yes, I always did. I was studying to become a dietitian. I was  eventually hired as the first black dietitian on staff and I worked at  Bennett Hall. I completed my dietetic internship here and I met most of  the people in food service which made it a good experience.  Well, that   s good. I won   t tell you what I eat normally. (Laughs) You   ll  frown upon me. Tell me about laundry, I know it sounds like an odd  question, but how did you do your laundry?  How did I do my laundry? Sometimes I went home and my mother did  it, but I think we had   I   m thinking that we had Laundromats in the  dorm. You know I don   t remember   that was a long time ago  I wasn   t  one to do a lot of laundry, even when I was at home. I would wash and  Mother would iron. I didn   t iron, that   s what it was   Mother would iron  my clothes. Maybe we went to the Laundromat? You know, that  escapes me. I can   t remember what we did.  I only ask because some students have sent it home with a courier and  then they would send it back, so I was just curious. We were trying to get  different perspectives.  I know my mother ironed my clothes so maybe she washed them. I don   t  remember.  Okay, fair enough    (Laughs) Now were there a lot of social activities  going on around campus that you participated in?  There were some. The Student Union was the place to go. On the  weekends the black students would go and dance in the Student Union.  I remember on the fourth floor there was a place where we would go and  dance. That   s where you got to socialize and meet your friends. A lot of  the students flunked out because they spent too much time in the Student  Union. Instead of going to class, they were in the Student Union. But I  only went there on weekends. Once I had a boyfriend, my husband, we  would go to various functions. There were quite a few different dances  that we could attend and that was always fun. I remember they would  have different kinds of concerts featuring popular musical artists  Do you remember the kinds of music you listened to, the popular artists  9  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  you enjoyed?  Oh there were bands like The Platters, Fats Domino, Bo Didley, and Ray  Charles. I   m trying to think. Many of those rhythm and blues songs,  some of them were really good songs. You knew all the words and they  were good dancing and listening songs, before rap. The music was good.  Now your husband, he went to OSU?  Yes, he received a track scholarship.  Tell us how you met.  I was here in    56 and he came in    57. I just saw him, we were in the  Student Union and I asked my roommate, who was from Tulsa,    Who is  that guy?    And she said,    Oh, that   s Sam Pegues. We went to school  together,    So she introduced us, you know, and that   s how we met.  Just kind of started talking. He was on a track scholarship, so he didn   t  have a lot of time.  When I talk about different experiences, his experience was very  different from mine. His older brother had gone to the University of  Pittsburgh and majored in engineering. When Sam came here, he didn   t  know what he wanted to major in and I guess he was talking about his  brother, so he enrolled in the School of Engineering. His advisor  enrolled him in 21 hours as a freshman and by midterm, he was flunking  every course. Because he was on a track scholarship, he had track  practice, work, and then try to keep up with 21 hours.  At some point before the end of the semester, he was getting off the  elevator, and his advisor was getting on. The advisor looked at him and  said,    Oh, you   re still here?    Needless to say, that was a wakeup call for  him. He said he remembers calling his mother and just cried like a baby  over the phone telling her that he had all F   s and this just wasn   t  working. She told him he could come home and he said,    I   m going to  give it one more try.    He went back and the second semester enrolled in  15 hours, what a normal person would take, and from then on he did fine  but that was his wake up call.  And you know a lot of the students had those kinds of experiences. The  advisors would either give them too many hours or put them in all these  hard courses that they knew they would flunk out, so they wouldn   t  succeed. That   s why I say I was really lucky because I had a good  advisor who was fair and caring and she just really wanted me to  succeed. But that was, the exception rather than the rule I think at that  time. Not everybody wanted us here. I think you felt it more in the grade  10  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  setting and the way you were treated in the classroom more so than by  the students. The students were all doing their own thing. There were  students who spent some time with us but for the most part we just had  to do things with each other.  Did you ever feel unsafe on campus?  No, it was a safe environment. It was much more structured then. I  remember when I received my packet of information, they sent a dress  code. You had to wear certain kinds of bobby socks and you knew what  to pack and what was expected. Then you had certain hours that your  house parent assured everyone was in their room   there was somebody  checking the rooms at night to make sure everybody was there. You had  to sign out for the weekend it was a very safe environment. I never felt  any fear going anywhere on campus.  Touch upon, for me, the support system you found with all the black  students.  I think we just all kind of stuck together. If somebody needed help, you  just helped each other out. If somebody needed food, money   people  were concerned about each other. Some students didn   t have enough  money to last the whole month or whatever so we looked out for each  other. We studied together. More than likely you were not in class with  anybody black, it might be just you. I think that was probably the  hardest part, because it   s always good to study with somebody. The  white students were reluctant to spend a lot of time. They didn   t want to  help you so you didn   t ask, you did your best.  Well, when you all got together, what types of activities did you do for  fun, outside of dancing?  There was no time to do much else. (Laughter) You know, you might go  eat together in the dorm or walk downtown or go shopping. I know my  roommate and   to go back to the laundry question   I think there was a  Laundromat (Laughter) down here on, what is that street, Knoblock?  Washington?  Washington   maybe it was Washington, where all the little shops are  and the pizza place and all that. There was a donut shop down also. We  would walk to the donut shop. Maybe that   s when we did our laundry.  Between the two of us we   d eat a dozen donuts and I didn   t gain any  weight then (Laughter) but I couldn   t do that now. I still remember that  and those donuts would be so good, but I think maybe we did laundry  down there.  11  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Were you involved in any on-campus activities or organizations?  There was the Baptist Student Union. I used to go there on occasion. I   m  trying to think what else. I can   t think of anything else that we did.  Did you hang out in the Library much? Did you spend much time there?  What were your thoughts of the Library?  I did. We went there to study. That   s what the Library was for. Library  science class was a freshman requirement so you could learn to use the  Library. I spent a lot of time in the Library. If you wanted peace and  quiet, that   s where you went to study.  Did you attend many sporting events while you were here in school?  Yes, we would go to the football games, the basketball games and some  wrestling matches.  What was the atmosphere like?  It was always exciting. The games were fun, we did enjoy those. That  was an outlet. It was something to do that everyone could go to. The  basketball games were particularly fun. They did have more black  players because they recruited the black students, of course, for the  sports. There were some athletes out there that you were looking  forward to seeing in football, basketball, track and they had couple of  black wrestlers. So the sports were pretty diverse especially when they  started integrating and recruiting black students. They too had some  struggles. My husband has some real stories to tell.  You   ll need to talk him into it for us.  (Laughs) Yes, he probably will. He and Orlando Hazley were on the  track team. Orlando   s picture is hanging in the alumni room. He was  here when we came and Orlando was a very fast runner. My husband  was a high jumper. When they ran the Texas Relays in particular, they  couldn   t eat with the team or stay in the same hotel. There was a man  named Mac Delozier who was my husband   s mentor. He followed the  track team. He was the son-in-law of President Bennett, who was  president when we first came here, and was killed in an air crash. But  Mac Delozier went to bat for Sam. Because of him, Sam was able to  manage on the track team. The first time Sam went to the Texas Relays,  they stopped at a restaurant on the way back and mind you these guys  had gone out there and run and jumped and done all of that hard work,  and then coming home you go to a restaurant and you   re told,    Well you  can   t eat in here with the team.    He was so upset he just started walking.  12  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  He was walking back to Stillwater. After that incident, Mac told the  Coach, he said,    If one person can   t eat, nobody   s eating.     Wow.  There were people here who were really good-hearted and they knew  what was right and they didn   t allow others to mistreat them. But like I  said, he could tell some stories. I never had that kind of experience. But  yes, we went to the sporting events so that was an outlet because it was  always fun to see the guys participating that we knew.  Is there a faculty member or class that you remember that played a big  part in your life here at OSU?  Miss Leidigh. She's the main one because she was one of my teachers  as well as my advisor. There were other people that I didn   t have as  instructors. Dr. Winterfelt, Leah Ebro came later   we were always  friends but I never had classes. Other than that, I don   t remember any  particular instructors that stood out.  Well it   s Homecoming 2007. Tell me about Homecoming back then     was it as big of a deal back then?  You know, I don   t think so. We didn   t really celebrate Homecoming  until later years. We started coming once they set up the Black Alumni  Association and the golf tournament   we started coming back for that.  We encourage people who were here when we were here to come. It is a  big deal for us now, because this is the only time we get to see a lot of  our friends that we met here at OSU. Many of them are coming back.  Some of them we   re still working on. They had such bad experiences  they don   t ever want to set foot on Oklahoma State again. But we   re  trying to encourage people that this is   it   s good, that we need to come  back and we need to celebrate and we need to let the black students  know that this is a good place and that we received a good education.  I try to encourage people to come here and go to school. This is a good  school. I received a really good education and because of it I   ve been  able to do the things that I have done in life. So Homecoming is, for us,  a big deal. My grandson is here now, he   s a sophomore, he was a  transfer student, and he   s all into it. He just thinks it   s the greatest that  he can go to the school where his grandmother and grandfather went.  His dad, my youngest son and his wife and two little ones came down  for Homecoming. They walked around with Myles this morning. It   s  like a big family and just walking in the street last night with all the  people   I just don   t remember it being like that. I don   t think I   ve ever  seen that many people in the street before. At some schools you  13  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  couldn   t be out like that without someone getting in a fight or something  happening. We didn   t see anything like that, it was just all good.  After graduation, what did you go on to do?  What did I do? I completed my dietetic internship here. Then my  husband returned here to get his teaching certification. When he  graduated he took a job in Kansas City, there again there he faced a lot  of discrimination. So he decided to come back and get a teaching  certificate. While he was working on his teaching certification, I was  hired as a dietitian here and worked in Bennett Hall. And that was fun  because all the people in the Food Service, all the dietitians and all the  management were very supportive, so that was a good environment.  My husband interviewed with Denver Public Schools. He accepted a  position in Denver, and we moved to Denver, Colorado. My first job in  Denver in 1964 was with the Children   s Asthma Research Institute and  Hospital. It was a home that treated asthmatic children from all over the  world. That was an interesting job. I was the manager of food service. It  was a Jewish hospital so I had to learn all the Jewish dietary laws. It  was a fun job I stayed there for several years.  I worked in a research and demonstration project for the Administration  on Aging when they were doing the research for the older American Act  Nutrition Programs. I worked in one of the pilot projects. I also had a  part time job teaching people in food service to get their certification in  food service through the Emily Griffith Opportunity School, and I  thought I never wanted to teach. But I realized,    I can do this.    It was  teaching adults, it wasn   t teaching children. I was so nervous (Laughs)  when I taught my first class. It   s funny now because it was a three hour  session and I had all my notes and everything, and by the first hour, I  was out of notes, and I thought,    Oh dear  What do I do now?    But I  soon learned that you have to ask questions, and you have to get the  students involved, and now I do a lot of adult education and really enjoy  it.  After that, a friend of mine who worked for the Administration of Aging  shared with me that there was a vacancy in the federal systems. I applied  for that position at the Administration of Aging and began there April 1,  1974, and at that time it was Health Education and Welfare and then the  name changed to Health and Human Services. I served a career of thirty  years with the Administration of Aging, doing mostly community  nutrition and administrative work. I worked with the State Units on  Aging and Tribal Organizations. It wasn   t like working at a hospital or  anything. I started out working with six states, and by the end of my  career I had fourteen states, including Hawaii and Alaska. I had a huge  14  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  territory. But it was fun. I always enjoyed all of the work I have done, all  of the experiences. I attribute it back to having been here, getting a good  foundation because of my food, nutrition, and institution administration  base, I could do any of those jobs.  When you worked in Bennett Hall did you advise students?  No, it was mostly food service   planning the meals, and then serving  the meals.  Well what is it about Oklahoma State that sparks such loyalty in students  and alumni?  I think number one, if you had a good experience here, if as a result of  being here you were able to go out and get a job and be productive, then  you can see the advantages of having been here. You want others to be  here, and you just want to be supportive of everything that goes on here.  You want to be a part of something that   s good.  Now you and your husband have endowed a scholarship?  Right.  Why is that important, for you to give back?  I think so often people don   t give in a way that can help others. And  because the field of nutrition is dominated by basically white women, I  want to be supportive of black students. If you look at the American  Dietetic Association, with some 90,000 members, nine percent are  males. I think it   s about six percent African Americans, four or five  percent Hispanic, and I think it   s about seven percent Asian, one or two  percent Native Americans. We need, especially with the population  growing more diverse, and the whole issue of health disparities that  impacts those diverse groups, I think it   s important that we have more  people of color who go into the field of nutrition. So for me I wanted to  have that   something out there for black students in the field of  nutrition who might need a little help, there would be something there  that could help them and give them a boost.  What advice would you give to students today?  That even though they may have to take a lot of courses that at the time  seem so farfetched from what it is you think you want to do, you never  know when you   re going to use those skills and have to pull that  knowledge out of that computer in your head that you learned here. If  you apply yourself and just know that the hard work will pay off, they  15  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  Pegues  Nykolaiszyn  have to stick to it, they have to give it their best and just never give up,  That   s what I was taught, whatever it is, whatever job you have to do,  you have to give it your all, and do your best. And that   s what I   ve told  my children and my grandchildren,    Give it your all and you   ll reap the  benefits in return.    You may not see it right away, but it will come back.  Is there anything else you   d like to add that I haven   t asked you today  that you would like to talk about or mention?  No, not really. It   s just nice to be back and see all that   s going on, the  excitement among the students and see old friends and to be a part of  something big. It makes it all worthwhile.  Well I do appreciate you taking time out to meet with us today. We hope  you enjoy the rest of your Homecoming, and look forward to having you  back for many, many, more Homecomings to come.  All right, well thank you for asking me.  Thank you.  -------  -------
