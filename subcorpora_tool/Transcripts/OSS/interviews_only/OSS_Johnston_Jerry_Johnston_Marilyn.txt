 Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is October 20, 2007 and I am at the ConocoPhillips  OSU Alumni Center interviewing Jerry and Marilyn Johnston. This  interview is being conducted as part of O-STATE Stories, an oral history  project of the OSU Library. Thank you for joining us today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s begin by having both of you tell us a little bit about yourself, where  you   re from originally. Let   s begin with you, Marilyn.  I was born in Blackwell, Oklahoma. I have always lived on a farm in the  Braman area with my parents. I have two younger sisters. I went to  country school until the beginning of my freshman year and then I  attended Braman High School, graduating from there in 1953. I went to  Northern Oklahoma College, called Northern Oklahoma Junior College  at that time, and have an associate degree from there.  And then Jerry and I were married. I came down to OSU then to attend  college   he was already here. I went my junior year and then my senior  year   that   s when our daughter was born, so I did not finish my degree.  We went back to Braman where he was associated in business with his  father, in the Ed Johnston Grain Company. That   s where we still live. I  went to work in the grain company in the early    60s because they just  needed somebody to help, somebody that was dependable. It was one of  those things supposed to be temporary that turned out to be full-time.  After our daughter we had a son and both of them graduated from  Braman, and both of them came to Oklahoma State. Both of them  graduated from Oklahoma State in accounting. They   re now living in  5  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Tulsa   working. In 1982 we sold the grain company and my husband  became interested in municipal government. He became Mayor of  Braman and that   s pretty much what we   ve done since that time   the  last twenty-five years, being involved in municipal government.  When we sold the grain company, I did come back to Oklahoma State  and finished my accounting degree. I began in January of 1983 and  finished in July of 1984. So that was a rather difficult accomplishment,  competing with all those young students. They were very determined  and so it was a great experience. I   m glad I did it then because I don   t  think I would have what it takes now to be able to do that but I am proud  to have that degree. So we   re an OSU family.  What a great accomplishment  Your blood definitely runs very orange.  Jerry, where are you originally from?  I   m originally from Braman, Oklahoma. I was born in Braman. I  actually moved two blocks from where I was born. I was born at  home   a doctor came up and delivered me. I remember looking back  through some records and it cost twenty-five dollars to be born back  then.  Wow.  I spent my whole life in Braman   raised up in a country elevator  business that my father started in 1927   spent my life there. It   s just a  fun little town, an old oil and agriculture town. It has lots of very  friendly, giving people, great church. My parents were both Christian,  raised in a great church with a lot of loving people, and just little old  ladies prayed for me and got me through till I was old enough to hold  my own in whatever nonsense I was always into. But just raised in a  great small town community and have been really blessed because I   ve  been able to do lots of   been active in municipal government since we  sold our business.  I was one of the first persons from a small town that was ever president  of the Oklahoma Municipal League. First person from a small town  that   s ever been Mayor of the Year for the state of Oklahoma. So I   ve  been very blessed to do a lot of things. I currently serve on the  Department of Environmental Quality board for the state of Oklahoma. I  serve off of that board on a national board that meets directly with the  EPA  Environmental Protection Agency  that represents small  communities. I have served on school boards and hospital boards and  church boards. I currently serve on seven or eight municipal type boards.  I   ve just really been blessed, and blessed with a great OSU family and  6  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  worked with people like Jerry Gill for probably thirty years, who is now  retired, and have just been really lucky for a small town person to be  able to do the things we   ve been able to do.  Well, let   s go back to your OAMC years. I want you to tell me why you  decided to attend OAMC to begin with. Marilyn?  Well I attended Northern Oklahoma College first because it   s as far  away from home as my parents would let me go. And of course then  when I graduated from there and we got married, the natural place for  me to go was where Jerry had already been in school for two years. And  so that was my basic reason for coming to OAMC.  And Jerry?  I don   t really know. My father was one of very few people who  graduated from college in 1926 from Southwestern College in Winfield,  Kansas. Most kids his age, boys his age, didn   t even go to high school.  He had an uncle who builds houses over there and he was really  interested in education, so he got his education. He was a big OU   University of Oklahoma  fan when I was growing up. I learned     Boomer Sooner    before I learned anything about OSU.  We were in the agriculture business and this was an agriculture college,  and so I came down and got an agronomy degree. I came down four  years, got my degree, went home and went back to doing what I was  doing before I got my degree. But coming to Oklahoma State changed  my life because you   re from a small town, a small school, and you   re not  sure that you can do what the big school kids can do. But you find out  pretty quick that you may not be as smart, but you   ve got a lot more  common sense than a lot of them so, we survived really well. I had a  wonderful time, and it just changed my whole life and made me realize I  could do whatever I wanted to do after I got out. So it was a big turning  point in my life. And being able to marry Marilyn in the middle of it,  and we   ve been married fifty-two years, wonderful years, and just really  have been blessed.  When you came to OAMC where did you live on campus?  I lived in Cordell, two years in Cordell, until we got married. That   s all  of the friends that I   ve seen since I   ve been back, were mostly Cordell.  A lot of them were agriculture, but it seems like a lot of the agriculture  boys lived in Cordell at that time so it was really a fun place. A lot of  good memories there.  Did they have a lot of social activities in Cordell?  7  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  We had quite a few things that we did and got involved in. We were  close to the stadium and from the upper windows you could watch ball  practice. All that   s built in now but it was open when we were going to  school. You could watch the football practice and we were pretty active.  I belonged to the drama club and sang in the symphonic choir when I  first came down. We had a really good music program in Braman and I  enjoyed doing those things. We just had a fun time in college.  We didn   t have any money but nobody else that we knew did, so it did  not make any difference. We were fortunate enough   coming from a  small town you always had meat in the lockers (Laughs) so, we   d bring  down food and we just had a good time. We had a lot of good friends  that were our age and they didn   t have any money either. For a quarter  you could go to the matinee on Saturday and see the movies. We just did  fun things. I had a bicycle, and (Laughs) we walked a lot. We actually  lived in the upper story of a double duplex which is where the  McDonalds over on 6th Street is now. But it was a fun time, a really fun  time.  And you lived in that duplex after you got married?  Mm-hmm.  At that time was that kind of considered the outskirts of town?  It pretty well was   mostly just houses south of town at that time. The  campus was a lot more open. There wasn   t hardly anything going out on  west, which is really active right now.  Marilyn, when you were here, in those early days, what was your major?  Education   secondary education, English.  And where did you have the majority of your classes?  Oh, most of mine   there were some in the Classroom Building and at  Old Central   I had a couple of literature classes there and an advanced  grammar class. That was basically where my classes were.  Were there Quonset huts on the campus at that time?  I was not in that area, but I   m sure there were because I can remember  people talking about them. A lot of that was built when the G.I.   s, after  World War II, came back on the G.I. Bill. A lot of those went up during  that time to accommodate them, but I didn   t have classes in any of those  Quonset buildings.  8  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  I had a chemistry lab in a Quonset building when we were first here.  And what were some of the other buildings on campus you had classes  in?  The Classroom Building was new then and we had just classes all  over   this is before they built new Ag buildings and all those things. We  had just a lot of our stuff was in the Classroom Building. I don   t even  remember if some buildings over in that area where the new Ag building  is   maybe it was the old Ag building. I don   t know, but it was where we  had a lot of our classes.  What were some of the popular places on campus where students would  gather in their free time?  Are you talking about before or after? (Laughter) I   m thinking about the  Anchor Inn and     Well actually both, yeah. (Laughter)  Some of the places that she didn   t know about (Laughter).  That was before I got here.  She was in Tonkawa and I was down here   really didn   t have a lot of  money to spend on much so we just had a lot of fun on campus with  people. Cordell Hall was pretty noisy. We were on the ground floor and  I spent a lot of time in the library. The only place you could get quiet to  study was the library and really enjoyed the library. I always loved to  read and I studied over there. Also, I loved the archives, especially the  old magazines and stuff that were in it. I spent a lot of time doing that  and just a lot of Ag courses. We took some Ag courses with the  livestock people and made a lot of friends. I had a lot of friends down  here already that were from the Blackwell area where we come from,  and most of those people were fraternity people. I was called then a GDI  so, that   s an old saying that I won   t repeat. An independent.  For those that didn   t belong to a fraternity.  That   s what fraternity people called us.  Oh, what kinds of music did you listen to back then, what was popular?  Oh, Kaw-Liga   Hank Williams.  Early country and western.  9  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  And did you go to a lot of dances?  No. Dancing was never big in our high school at Braman.  It was against the law in Braman when we were young.  Yes, actually there was a town law forbidding dancing and we did have  a Saddle Club out east of Braman, but it got a little wild, and most  parents did not allow their daughters to show up there. Now I don   t  know what the boys did. They may have checked it out, but we just  really never did much dancing.  Did you play card games?  When we were down here for college our best friends would come over,  and we played a lot of Pinochle and kind of put together whatever both  of us had. She worked at a grocery store and every once in a while  they   d have a big special on something, and she   d bring that. Usually we  always had, since my parents lived on a farm, they always sent meat  home with us.  We ate a lot of hamburgers.  Yes, a lot of hamburger and so, nobody really had any money, but we  didn   t realize that. We were all having a good time, and so that really  didn   t matter.  When you lived in Cordell, how did you do your laundry?  How did we do our laundry? We had a laundry   they had a washer and  dryer in Cordell, and we did our own and wore a clean sturdy shirt.  (Laughs).  What was the dress like back then, would you go to class in jeans?  About what I   m wearing today, usually jeans and a shirt of some kind.  Of course, I wore jeans for as long as I can remember. I still wear jeans.  And was it different for the women back then?  Yes, girls wearing jeans was not   I mean that was considered sort of  racy. Most girls wore dresses, so jeans were not a big deal even for   if  you were going on a picnic or anything like that where you   d think  maybe jeans would be more practical, that was still pretty much dresses.  And how about sporting events, did you attend many sporting events on  10  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  campus?  We attended football games and basketball games. That was all   you  had tickets for all the sporting events. And also tickets for two kinds of  entertainment events. One was more classical, I guess, and one was  comedians and country western bands that came in. And everybody that  went college had, I think it was, an A and B ticket and the A was more  orchestras and stuff and B was country western bands. Bob Hoke was  here and people like that. We got to do those things and had a lot of  things to do. The same with symphonic choir   we sang around a lot.  You sang at different things, different occasions on campus and off  campus. That was a pretty busy time. Then I wasn   t dumb but I was  pretty lazy in high school so I had to study a lot to catch up in college. I  had to spend a lot of time with the books.  Is there a place on campus that   s special to you?  The library to me was always special, I really enjoyed that. That was  before internet and all the things that are so great now that you can sit in  your room and do all those things. At that time you had to learn the  Dewey Decimal system, learn how to find things in the library. But it  was, the library was still, to me, still more fun because you could go find  something, anything you wanted to look at, you could find because it,  once you knew the system it was all so easy to do. And I was raised    at  home we had a lot of classical music, and so you had places where you  could check out the records and listen to them in a room and stuff. I  always enjoyed that, things that were a little noisy to do in the dorm.  Now Marilyn you returned to OSU, graduating in 1984 with your degree  in accounting. What was it like for you, returning? What was the big  driving force that made you want to come back to school?  Well because Jerry had a college degree and my two kids had college  degrees, I did not want to be the only one in the family without a degree.  Then also I thought since we sold the grain company, the big employer  in our area was Conoco in Ponca. And I had been told that a degree  usually meant five thousand to six thousand more on your paycheck a  year if you had the degree. I thought I would probably have to go back  to work, so I thought well, I didn   t want it to disturb me to be doing the  same kind of work as the person next to me, and I was getting paid less,  so that was one of my motivations.  It was a little tough to come back. You know when you   re nearly fifty,  you   ve been out of school for a long time, and by the time you get into  your junior and senior level accounting classes those kids are very  serious. They   re not in there to play, they   re in there to work. You   ve  11  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  got a lot of competition and they   re really bright. So the time I was in  school, I spent most of my time studying. When I was home I was  studying. And Jerry did quite a bit of travelling during that time, and  most of the time I did not go with him because I needed to be studying  to try to keep up my grades.  Sometimes I got discouraged and I   d come home and I   d say,    You  know, I don   t have to do this, why am I doing this   ,    and he   d say,     No, you can   t quit, you can   t quit   you   ve got to stay in there.    So I   d  go back and it   d be another week, and then another week, well as you  went a long, then you could see there was light at the end of the tunnel.  I just stayed with it until I got through, I didn   t take summers off or  anything, I just went right through, and     Did you commute back and forth?  I stayed with   our daughter   s advisor was Dr. Dan Badger who was an  Ag econ professor here. When our daughter told him that I was thinking  about returning to school he said,    Would she like to stay with Betty Jo  and I?    So, I came down and met them, and Betty Jo and I just hit it off  just really great. They had a room kind of separated from the rest of the  house   a bedroom and a bathroom, so I stayed with them.  The first semester I was able to have classes on Tuesdays and  Thursdays, so I   d drive from home early Tuesday morning and leave  Thursday afternoon, but then as I went on I wasn   t able to arrange my  schedule so I was down here pretty much five days a week. When I  finished, of course I was glad, but I was sad. Betty Jo and I had a little  cry over it because we missed each other. Since then, Dan retired and  they moved on to the Washington D.C. area. Every time we were up  there, we always stopped to see them. Now they live in Charlotte, North  Carolina and we email back and forth and still keep up with each other.  But if it hadn   t been for them it would   ve been really   I would have felt  really alone down here, but they   re great friends and I just really  appreciate them taking me in.  I would come down some in the middle of the week because I knew she  was lonely and sleep in a twin bed which is very interesting. (Laughter)  Well, when I started in January of 1983, the first morning I woke up, of  course, it was dark. My first class was at 7:30, and I thought,    Why am I  here all by myself, I could be home,    you know. And it was kind of dark  and dreary that time of year, so it was a little tough. But I was so glad to  have that degree and to feel like it was a great accomplishment.  Definitely.  12  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  I think if you want your kids to value something, it has to be valuable to  you. I just wanted to really make that a reality so that would make them  realize how important I valued education and how important I thought it  was to them. Of course, by that time they had graduated. Both our kids  were through college, and our granddaughter was born in November  before I finished that following July. And so one of the reasons I was so  glad to get through was because I could spend time with her. She was  our only grandchild for five and a half years. She's the only  granddaughter we have and then she had a little brother, and then four  months later she had a little cousin, so she kind of got a double whammy  there, when those two boys arrived and moved her out of center stage for  a little bit.  She was    queen of all,    up to that time, you know. (Laughter) And one  of the parts Marilyn didn   t like was that when she was born, she was  having tests and couldn   t go, and I got to go to the hospital and see the  baby     She was a day old before I got there.     and see the baby first. She   d never forgive me for that one.  Now, both of your children are OSU graduates     Yes, uh-huh and our daughter-in-law also.  Wonderful, and when they were growing up and getting ready to go to  college, was OSU the logical choice? Did they not even bother looking  at other places?  Well actually they both went to Oral Roberts a year before they came  over here. We were in the family business and our children were an  active part of the business and had earned lots of freedom because they  were very dependable. It was kind of a        restrictive environment.     restrictive for them, and it just didn   t work for them, because you are  kind of cloistered over there. You had to be in at ten o   clock at night and  you always had someone telling you exactly what to do and what to  think. They actually said once they came back to Oklahoma State, that  they had a lot more love at Oklahoma State than they did over at Oral  Roberts     It was a much more loving campus than     13  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston     which they would really appreciate that. But, some of things they did  at Oral Roberts are actually showing up today, and you see in the news.  All that glitters isn   t gold.  And kids can pretty   well, some of them anyway, can see through that  pretty quickly, so they saw it quicker than we did.  It was a good time in their life, and they   ve always been active  religiously, and had a good strong faith, so that part didn   t hurt. And  we   ve been very lucky to have been raised in a Christian family. Raised  in a great, giving little church. It   s still a very active church in the  community for a little church. It supports just about   we actually have a  Good Samaritan fund which is the top ten percent of everything that   s  given to the church goes to the Good Samaritan fund. We have people  that come through and have problems. We get them in a motel room and  fix their cars and we have a pantry and we help single mothers pay their  bills sometimes. We do a lot of things that a church is supposed to do.  It   s not special. It   s just what the Lord told you to do.  Do you have a favorite faculty member, teacher, class that is dear to  your heart?  Well, my favorite member that she   s talking about, that actually kind of  lined our daughter out and got her back on     Because it was demoralizing, I think, for our daughter to go to ORU, and  so when she came here, Dr. Badger really was her advisor, and he  really   and Dan has done so much of that for so many young people.  He   s just done so many good things for so many kids.  My favorite teacher was probably Dr. Johnson that taught organic  chemistry. Of course we had eight hours of regular chemistry and five  hours of organic chemistry. He was here and made it exciting   big  classes, you know. We came from a school whose graduating class was  16?  Yes, 16 in our graduating class.  But it was an exciting time because I figured out that I could compete  with about anybody and overall, had learned a lot more about life and  had really been able to do things for myself than a lot of kids that made  straight A   s, so that really helped. The Ag part was fun because  everybody over in agriculture was usually from a farm area like us and  had a lot in common. In fact three or four of them   we met four or five  people just this time around that we went to class with and are still in  Ag, still great people. So it was a good choice for us.  14  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  Did you have a lot of women in your classes?  No, not really. In the Ag part at that time there weren   t very many girls  or ladies in Ag classes. There were more over in the animal side of it, a  few more. Actually when we got out in the grain business, I served on  Oklahoma Grain and Feed Board and represented the Oklahoma Grain  and Feed Board in the National Grain and Feed Board and represented  the small country elevators. At the time we started doing that probably in  the, what    50s,    60s   there weren   t very many ladies that even went to  those meetings because it was basically   she and another lady that  ended up running Continental Grain out of Enid. But it wasn   t a  woman   s world at that time.  I felt kind of lonely in some of those meetings. I   d look around and  usually the only women there would be maybe those that were  presenting a paper, except for the lady that actually worked for  Continental Grain at Enid   managed that for them. But she and I were  usually about the only two women actually involved in the grain  industry that attended most of those meetings.  Wow.  But we   ve always done so many things together. We worked side by  side in the grain business and she always, even any of the boards I was  on, she always went along. I always told people,    She was like my  American Express Card, I never left home without her,    but we had a lot  of good times together.  The great thing about serving on a lot boards   most of the boards that I  serve on, you don   t get paid to serve on so the people that are on those  boards are interested in their cities and towns and that   s why they   re on  there   some really great people. We   ve been very fortunate, made a lot  of life-long friends, even at the national level. We   ve got some good  friends back in Washington D.C. that we usually visit. We usually get up  there every   we   ve probably been going to Washington D.C. every year  for the past 45 years, I suppose.  Well actually, friends all over the country. He spent thirty-three years on  Canogla Telephone Board     A rural co-op telephone.     it   s a rural co-op board. And we went to four or five meetings a year  for that, and met people all over the country, and so we have friends  from that. Then with his work with the small community advisory  committee with the EPA   that   s made up of people from all over the  15  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  U.S., and you know you just have friends from one end of the country to  the other, from top to bottom.  Some of the boards you   ve been on for a long time are just kind of  family, get to be family, you know their problems, you know their kids,  you know what all they   re going through and so, and we keep in close  touch with a lot of people that way. We   ve got a big circle. It   s the  difference between growing up in a town and not doing anything. It   s  just the size of your circle. The more you do the bigger your circle is,  and the more great people you know. So we   ve been very, very blessed.  Well it   s Homecoming 2007 right now. What was it like back then during  Homecoming, what was the celebration like?  Basically, and I was telling somebody this morning, where we sit every  year and where they have the bleachers set up for us, none of that has  hardly changed. The Homecoming Parade and everything has been a lot  like it is now. It really hasn   t changed that much. And looking down the  street that part of the city hasn   t changed any. You can still see where  the old theatre was and everything from where we were. That part really  hadn   t changed.  It   s always been exciting, it   s always been an exciting time, you know  and we   ve come back with our kids ever since they were little, and  usually sit about the same place. So it   s kind of a tradition, we always do  Homecoming. And we do it a little fancier. We used to drive down,  drive home. Now the kids stay in a hotel and do the whole thing. Of  course they make more money. The kids make more money in a year  than we about made in a lifetime (Laughs) but that   s partially due to  coming to Oklahoma State, getting an education. And of course, we   ve  always been very outgoing, the kids are very outgoing, you know  they   ve never met a stranger. The grandkids have never met a stranger,  so we   re a pretty noisy family when we get together, we love to visit.  What were house decorations like back then?  A lot simpler.  A lot simpler. A lot more floats and a lot less house decorations. We had  a lot of floats and then the winners of the different floats, during the ball-game,  would get to, there was a track , and the floats would come in at  half time and go around. So it was a lot more open than it   you walked,  it didn   t seem like anything was as far as it is now. We walked more and  we weren   t as spread out especially to the west as near as much as it is  now. But the G.I. Village and Quonsets and everything were all over  there and it was great because we had a lot of friends that come back  16  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  from   oh it would have been Korea, I guess, and were studying with us  and so, that was fun.  Do you remember any campus traditions? Was getting thrown in Theta  Pond a big thing?  I was about to say something to do with Theta pond, but I can   t  remember.  Yes, I got thrown in Theta Pond and my pants ended up back over at the  dorm. It was quite a trip back across campus (Laughter) in my  underwear.  Oh that   s when they had the panty raids down here. I remember, I wasn   t  here when that was, that was before I got down here.  That was an interesting thing to be a bystander for.  How did that work? I   ve read a few things     Well, the guys said it was their idea but I think that if the women hadn   t  thrown the panties down from their rooms (Laughter) it wouldn   t have  turned into such a thing. Then of course some of them were climbing up  the walls and going into their rooms. And I think that   s when the police  decided that wasn   t a proper thing to do. It was more like a riot you  know. (Laughter) The petite, gentle ladies kind of caused that to happen,  but it was the guys that all got in trouble (Laughter).  Did that happen every night?  No. It just all happened in a two or three night period. And all over     It got worse as it went on, I think.  It got way more press than it deserved, like everything does. It   s you  know, good kids   we supported the Ag Econ department. I had a  scholarship for years and years and there was probably a hundred or so  kids in their very finest and, you know, no press. One kid kills  somebody or something and you get all the press. The good kids very  seldom get much press but there   s still a tremendous amount of good  kids around.  What is it about Oklahoma State that sparks such loyalty in students and  alumni?  I think after you   re down here, maybe even a year or two, it   s just a big  17  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  family. I always think of Popeye the Sailor Man   we are who we are  and that   s who we are and we don   t pretend to be anything else. I think  it   s great because most really sincere OSU supporters have graduated  from OSU, while the other college supporters, I don   t think some of  them even graduated from high school. We see a lot of that in a rural  town. You know, you wear an OU t-shirt and an OU hat, and you   re an  OU supporter, but basically the OSU people have graduated and they  really support their school.  Do you have anything you want to add to that?  Well, I think there   s just a feeling of loyalty maybe. I think there   s  maybe more compassion, more caring, and I think that relationships  maybe are deeper   more really good friendships. I think people just feel  ties and I think there   s probably a lot of concerned professors that  students really feel have helped. So I think they feel that OSU has really  given them a step up and made some great things possible in their lives  and I think they just feel a loyalty and a responsibility to OSU for that.  At Braman, we have a pretty good percentage of people that go to  college, and then probably seventy-five to eighty percent of those people  go to Oklahoma State. And we   ve had a lot of young people from  Braman that have been the top ten Ag students or top ten seniors. I think  it   s the tradition where the people going know that these other people  have done these things and they can do these things if they just work  hard. I had friends that I graduated with that have been in businesses all  over the world and have done really, really well, so you don   t have to be  from Tulsa, Jenks, or something like that to do well. And so we are just  very proud of the school.  What advice would you give to students today?  Just go and learn and graduate and have a good time. One of the things  that I   ve always said,    Don   t take yourself too seriously and enjoy  people.    The greatest thing in the world is the people. We just don   t  know how blessed we are to live in the United States and do what we   re  able to do here and everywhere and not worry about somebody shooting  at you. We just don   t realize how blessed we are. A lot of young people  who come back from Iraq and really realize that. I think that   s, we   re  going to see a movement of realization when these kids get through with  the war or whatever   s going to happen,    cause they come back with a  whole different idea of life, and how great the United States really is.  But we   re just really blessed to live here and do these things and stay  involved.  Cowboys for Our Education, which is a lobby group for the school and  18  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  one of our state representatives is a Braman boy. He graduated from  here, and was pretty active   he   s active with the college. And so, we   ve  just been blessed to be able to do all the things we   ve done, and blessed  to be able to do them together all these years. And really enjoy it, we  still enjoy travelling. We go to, I   d probably go to, I suppose at least ten  meetings a month, probably go to Oklahoma City. Every month we have  the meetings of municipal government meetings in Oklahoma City.  Marilyn, any advice for students today?  Well, I would like to see students think about being involved in their  communities when they graduate because I think that you get out of life  what you put in. And I think that the students, if they are willing to give  themselves to their communities when they get out of school wherever  they go, whatever they do, I think they need to think about being  involved in their church and in their community. Participate   because I  think that when you do that that there are real dividends for you, in being  connected with your community and involved with others and caring  about others.  I know that families are busy and especially when they have children,  there   s so many school activities and everything to participate in, but I  just think that there   s so many charities and things that need helpers, and  there are just so many opportunities to reach out and have relationships  with other people. So I think that makes life much better, if you can give  something of yourself, because it will never return to you empty. It   ll  always be more than you give. So I   d just like to see young people keep  that in mind and be involved.  Is there anything you two would like to add that I have not asked you  about today? Any final thoughts?  I just think that a lot of our families don   t understand how important it is  to be close, and work together, and love one another, how important that  is. Today there are so many families that just don   t work together, don   t  know how to work together, don   t know how to be a family and we   re so  blessed to grow up and my   both of our families were, our parents had  big families, and those families had been close. They   re all getting to the  age where they   re all about gone, but those families were so close when  we were growing up, the whole, the large     We had many cousins        had many cousins, we were all close, and        times together     19  J. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  J. Johnston  M. Johnston  Nykolaiszyn  M. Johnston     and our families weren   t that large but they   re very, very, very, very  close. We do a lot of things together. We communicate together and  we   ve had a lot of times to really spoil our grandkids. And that   s a  blessing because we   ve had time to do that. We   ve sold our business and  had time to help them buy their first houses and help them remodel and  get in them and things, but we   re really close. And that   s really a  blessing.  Any last words Marilyn?  No, I would just have to echo what he said that we really feel like we   ve  been blessed. You know, we have good health, which is, when you get  older its one of the major things you think about, and one that can really  impact the quality of life you have, and so we   ve been blessed. My  mother   s ninety-five and still lives on the farm, drives her own car. Just  a real energetic     Goes to senior citizens        independent, stubborn person        church and the Chamber of Commerce.  Yes. (Laughter) She   s very involved in activities and I think that   s  what   s kept her young. So I think that that   s what we need to think  about, too as we grow older, not just to retire and do nothing, but retire  from one thing and get involved in something else that keeps you alert,  and keeps you active, and keeps you giving. I think makes for a much  better and longer life.  Definitely. Well, we appreciate you taking time out of your schedules  today to meet with us. It   s been a pleasure learning about your time here  at OAMC and OSU. Thank you.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
