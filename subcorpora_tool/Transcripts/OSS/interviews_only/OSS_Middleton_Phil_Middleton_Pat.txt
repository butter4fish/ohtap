 Gill. Today is October 17, 2008. I   m visiting with Phil  and Pat Middleton in the Alumni Center on the OSU campus. This  interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project, which is part of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program, and I want to welcome you  back. It   s good to have you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jerry. We really appreciate it.  This is the 50th year of what for you   what are you celebrating?  Homecoming co-chairmen.  Homecoming co-chairmen.  Of 1958. We recall quite fondly what a great event that was, and we   re  kind of surprised to see that there   s a Homecoming committee now of  about 20 or 25. (Laughter) We did it by ourselves in 1958   Tell us a little bit about where you grew up and then a little bit about  how you got to Oklahoma State.  Well I grew up all over. My dad was Air Force and Oklahoma State was  my 17th school, but I had a wonderful career here as a student and many  fond memories of being here, so     And your maiden name was     Chapel was my maiden name. Pat Chapel.  5  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  And so was there a certain influence that you got to Oklahoma State? It  appears there were a lot of places you could have gone     Well, I went to Norman High School for two years and then moved to  New York State my senior year, and the decision was to be between  Norman and Stillwater and I picked Stillwater.  Great choice.  Yes, I think so. (Laughter)  Well Phil, where did you grow up and a little bit about your family life?  Well I was actually born in Texas, and we moved to Waynoka,  Oklahoma in about 1945 after my dad got out of the navy. I went to  school in Waynoka for several years and actually I was not so much pro-  Oklahoma State as I was anti-OU, so    (Laughter)  Was there a family influence here?  No, actually not   but it was like everything else in Oklahoma at the  time. You had to take sides     Sure.     and if you weren   t for OU, you had to be for OSU. So by default I sort  of entered Oklahoma State, or at the time      Oklahoma A M.     Oklahoma A M College.  So now what was your major, Phil?  I majored in mechanical engineering with what they called at the time a  petroleum production option.  Okay.  So I was gonna be an oil guy.  And Pat what about you?  I graduated from the School of Housing and Interior Design, which was  under the School of Home Economics at that time.  6  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Now Human Environmental Sciences.  Right.  Okay, great. So just continue on, Pat, with you. What are some things     aside from the Homecoming now   other things you did on campus?  Where did you live and     Well I was president of Murray Hall, which I understand is no longer  here. Is that correct?  It is here.  Oh, it is still here?  They   re doing a renovation on it. Murray Hall is going to house the Arts  and Sciences and Humanities Department, people that are in history,  social sciences, humanities and political science and those areas   some  renovation right now. A several million dollar renovation     Well, we   ll have to check it out when we get there. But I was president  of the dorm and then was elected the representative for Independent  Women   s on the Student Senate, and that   s how I met Phil.  It was part of the Student Senate? Wonderful. So Murray Hall; what  were some of the activities that you had in the residence hall?  Oh my goodness. Most of the activities were just book learning, school  oriented back then and it was strictly women.  Did you have dances or anything? Did you sponsor dances?  Not so much at the dorm. I spent a few hours in the basement when the  tornado alerts came over (Laughs) but just was pretty much involved  with   I was a counselor on one of the floors, so I did that as well.  What were the women   s hours at that time?  Oh my, let   s see. I think we had to be in by 9:00 or some     Can   t believe that, can you? (Laughter)  Didn   t they give you a little bit of time     A little bit of time on the weekend, yes.  7  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Eleven o   clock on the weekends. (Laughter)  Well now, in your day, do you remember PDA   public display of  affection?  Oh, yes.  That was a sure something with the house mom.  Yes, that did not happen. (Laughter)  Is that right?  Wasn   t supposed to happen. (Laughter)  It wasn   t supposed to happen. Well, let   s see   do you remember your  house mom?  Oh, yes, and     Do you happen to remember her name or something about her?  Yes, Ruth Ahrberg. She was truly a    mom    away from home.  I knew her     She liked you. She let me in late a few times because she liked him.  (Laughter) Helped a little bit.  That   s great. Well Phil, where did you live? Did you live on campus?  I lived on campus. I was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon called    the  Tekes,    and the chapter, I understand, has at one time been off-campus  and now has been rejuvenated   hope to get by that house and see those  young men. I was president of TKE and when they had the residence  halls elections, I was elected IFC representative.  Interfraternity Council.  Yes, Interfraternity Council. And the practice at that time was, every  Homecoming, they alternated between having the Independent Women   s  rep and the IFC rep be chairmen of Homecoming, and the next year it  was the Independent Men   s rep and the sorority representative.  Oh, okay.  8  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  So we happen to hit it on the rotation that we were on.  There   s a story around this, isn   t there? You met in the Senate before  that   is that right?  Right.  But now what I recall from the 22 plus years at Homecoming here, you  spend a lot of hours and      That is true.  So before you became Homecoming execs, there wasn   t anything serious  in the relationship?  As a matter of fact, the first time the Senate met after that is the first  time we had laid eyes on one another.  Yes.  And now I understand maybe   Pat, did you have another guy in your  life at that time?  I did at that time. I was engaged to a young man from the academy  actually. However, we had broken up prior to Homecoming, so     She didn   t tell me that. (Laughter)  She told you she left him right after she met you. Well that   s great. But  again, you all I think after Homecoming had become closer and started  dating regularly and     Right, right.  This was in 1958, so this would have been in the fall of 1958     Fall of 1958   Spring of 1959.  Did you graduate in 1959?  I graduated in the spring of 1959.  Did you get married soon after?  September of 1959. We got married prior to my graduation because my  parents had orders for Europe and they would not be back at the end of  9  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  my graduation for us to be married, so we went ahead and got married  ahead of time.  Your father was in the Army?  Air Force.  Air Force?  Right, and while we were on our honeymoon, their orders were  cancelled   but we decided we   d stay married. (Laughter)  That   s great. I want to ask then a little bit about Homecoming, what you  remember. Now you   re going to be seeing Homecoming this weekend I  think ...  Right.  Oh yes.     so you   ve maybe been around and seen some of the stuff already. I  understand at that time there was more emphasis on floats and less on  house decs. Was that the case?  It was kind of a combination.  I think it was about an even split because the house. I don   t really recall  if there was some conscious effort to split it down the middle or it just  sort of occurred by happenstance, but there was about an even split  because we had about as many house decorations to judge on the Friday  evening before as there were floats to judge the Saturday morning of the  parade.  Talking about the change, there used to be a major influence on floats,  but house decorations weren   t very much and then over the years it kind  of got to be     More of the homes.     and then finally probably a little bit more of the house decs.  Well even the house decorations that we did back in 1958, there were  some mechanized and light shows that were really quite extravagant. I  know at our house we did a house decoration one year that involved  more moving parts than a Swiss watch. And there was a young man  named Bob Baker who put it all together and we absolutely marveled at  10  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  how intricate this thing was. But Bob had done a bunch of productions,  set decorations and set constructions for a lot of the play productions at  the time so he put together quite a piece of goods   and we didn   t even  come in first as I recall.  I   m gonna challenge you here. What was the Homecoming theme in  1958?     Wagons to Wheels.        Wagons to Wheels.     Wagons to Wings.  Wings   wings,    Wagons to Wings.    (Laughter)     Wagons to Wings.    Okay, great.  Yes,    Wagons to Wings.     Who won the all-around trophy?   The Grand Champion trophy went to Phi Delta Theta; the Grand  Champion house decoration went to Delta Chi; Chi Omega won first  place float on originality with    Have Team   Will Conquer   ; and the Pi  Beta Phi float placed first in beauty with    A Monarch Born   .  Well what kind of participation at that time   I know fraternities and  sororities have always traditionally participated very heavily from the  residence halls and then some that we have pretty good participation      Oh, absolutely, yes, very good. Very good.  Most of the residence halls, as I recall, just did outside decorations. I  don   t think they put together too many floats.  No, I don   t recall any floats, but     What are some of your special memories of Homecoming 1958? What  stands out in your mind that year?  Well in the beginning we had to select the judges, contact the judges, get  their acceptances or refusals. We had to select the trophies, plan  activities for the judges when they weren   t judging.  Did you have a different set of judges for parade versus house  11  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  decorations?  No. They did it     No, did them all. Yes.  There   s an interesting side story that goes on with the judges that   s even  more remote I think. Pat   s parents, after we had been married for awhile,  got orders to go to Taiwan where her dad was a liaison with the  Nationalist Chinese Air Force. They were taking a vacation to some  remote area in Taiwan where   do you remember the name of the place?  No, I don   t. I   m sorry.  Well anyway, it   s sort of a remote resort that   s quite upscale in Taiwan,  and her little brother was with them at the time. He was going to be an  OSU student the next year, and some gentleman engaged him in  conversation that they met up there, he was an American   so they had  some conversations there, and he asked her brother where he was going  to school. He said,    OSU.    He says,    Well, I   m from OSU.    (Laughs)  And so they got to talking about as being from OSU and then Jason, her  brother, took them over to meet her parents. They got to talking and  mentioned that his name was Colonel Chapel. The gentleman thought  Chapel sounded like a familiar name. Turned out that he was one of the  judges at our 58th Homecoming. What was his name? He ended up being  a governor of Oklahoma, I think.  Not Bellmon?  No.   C.V. Richardson and wife Dorothy.    The other judges were Pete Bartlett and wife Pat and Lee W. Jenkins.   So what kind of organizational structure did you have? One of the things  that I think that   s really noted about our homecomings is its student-led,  student-driven. How many students did you have? Not the pomping, but  the organizations, setting up the houses and so on, and the executive  team. How many people were you working with?  Not very many.  Us. (Laughs) We would have meetings with the fraternity  representatives and the people who were building floats. We set up the  float organization and even organized the parade, as I recall.  12  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Yes, I think we did. We were the whole banana. We really and truly did.  How did you work with   I guess Murl Rogers was the     Yes. Right.     executive at the time. How did you work with Murl and his staff? Was  there a close working relationship there?  Oh, yes.  Murl was one of the championship people in the world, I think.  Yes.  We will always think it   s remarkable that we had the opportunity to  work with Murl Rogers over that short period of time.  He was a ball of fire, wasn   t he?  He was a ball of fire and what a gentleman. There   s just no other way to  describe Murl Rogers, as an absolute gentleman.  And each fraternity and sorority and dorm had a representative to  Homecoming who told us what they were gonna do, and they did the  organization as far as the people that did their floats and their house  decorations and things, but they all pretty much carried out the theme of  the    Wagons to Wings.     When did you first start organizing for Homecoming 1958? How soon in  advance did you start?  As I recall, we had our first Student Senate meeting in December of  1957     Yes.     and the next day we started setting up the organization     So almost a year     A circle   it   s a year cycle, and it took a year to put everything together.  Yes.  13  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  As you look back, you probably had a chance to look, in your lifetime, at  other university Homecomings. What stands out about OSU  Homecoming?  Well just had lunch at the Student Union, and we were down in the  atrium area that used to be the dance floor that we danced at. The thing I  noticed was all of the enthusiasm from the students   the clothing, the  attitude, everything   and that   s the way it was when we were in school.  We   ve been in towns that have had other universities at Homecoming  and they   re kind of lackluster. UNM   s is   I mean, you hear about it on  the TV and you look at the news report of it; it doesn   t hold a candle to  what Oklahoma State has.  I would say it   s a donkey cart compared to a Mercedes.  Yes. (Laughs)  In our travels around the world, we   ve seen several universities and  several Homecoming-like celebrations, and they always seemed sort of  lackluster compared to what we recall. And then we saw last year   s  Homecoming report on the alumni magazine and saw the spread out of  what they had for floats and what they had, and it hadn   t changed a lick.  It   s just as extravagant and the effort put into it far exceeds anything I  have ever seen before anywhere else.  You   re right about it, Phil. I mean, have you noticed that while a lot of  universities back in, say the 1950s, they   ve had strong Homecomings  and then they kind of went away, but OSU   s has continued to stay  strong. Why do you think that is?  I really think it   s a strong ethic that   s Oklahoma State. It   s what you  would think of in the workplace as a work ethic. There   s a student ethic  that exists here that I don   t think is duplicated anywhere else.  Oh, and we noticed that today at lunch. It gave me a very excited feeling  to see the students in that kind of an atmosphere and     And you just pick it up from seeing kids   they are kids as far as I   m  concerned   on the sidewalk here, you know.  Does it give you special pride, to know that you were the co-chairs of  Homecoming, to see that OSU Homecomings continue to grow and  expand     Yes.  14  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton     and to stay major? What do you think about it as    America   s Greatest  Homecoming Celebration?    Does that give you a certain pride?  It does. It does me.  Yes, I don   t know who thought up that    America   s Greatest  Homecoming,    but I rather imagine it is pretty close to being true.  Well it is one of the better ones here in the United States.  Do they have a judging nationally of Homecoming celebrations?  Because if they don   t, they ought to, and I think we   ll win it.  Well you know now they   re putting a lot of Homecoming on the Internet,  on our web site. Are you aware of that?  I didn   t know that, but     They   re having some pre-shot things and then some live things, but now  you can really participate in Homecoming in Fairbanks, Alaska or  across the     In Oklahoma State   s Homecoming? Oh, how exciting. That   s great.  Yeah.  Well I guess we   ll have to light up the computer and see where the blog  goes from there. (Laughter)  Is there any special event of the 1958 Homecoming you remember that  stood out for you? A special memory or special event or something?  Oh, I think it was the camaraderie that we shared, even though we were  not romantically involved at the time. We had a bond. We were able to  work together. We didn   t argue about things. It was pretty easy in that  respect. It was the panic at the last minute     It still had that     Oh, I   m sure. (Laughter)  As I   m sure many are experiencing today, but I think it was a great  working relationship between the two of us.  I think it was an emotional   the emotional swings     15  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  True.     because we had such a remarkable house decoration tour and the  house decorations were just phenomenal that year, and then the parade  was   I have no idea   I can   t recall how many bands we had, but we  had at least 20 floats and the floats were all like self-powered   a couple  that were hinged in the middle, almost as good as a Rose Parade float.  (Laughs) You have a good memory.  I have a marvelous memory for     Not that it   s really that important, but do you remember who we played?  And did we win the football game?  No, we did not. That was the emotional swing.  Oh. (Laughs)  It was a back-and-forth game and the     Last nine seconds.     the action was non-stop and Air Force had a guy named Rich Mayo  throwing the ball and OSU took the lead, I think, sometime late in the  last quarter. But they left enough time on the clock that Rich Mayo  completed a pass, nine seconds to go, and ended up winning the  ballgame.  What a heartbreaker     Oh, we cried. I cried  (Laughs) I didn   t see him for two days afterwards,  so     I was asleep. (Laughter)  Now that   s one tradition that hasn   t changed for Homecoming  executives. You didn   t get any sleep, did you?  No, not that weekend. I must have had at least an hour or so sometime  during the weekend.  You think? (Laughter)  Well, can you just give us a typical day in the life   I mean, during the  week before Homecoming? Start us in the morning, hourly and how long  16  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  did you stay   what was it like?  Oh, all I can remember is starting Thursday night because I think  Thursday night is when we had the     Well they couldn   t start decorating up until like the week before or  anything like that. It was just a couple of days, I think   like maybe  Thursday     I think Thursday was the start time for putting together the house  decorations. Considering how intricate the decorations were at the time,  it   s remarkable that they could get that sort of production put together so  fast.  You look at it one night before and say it   s not ever going to happen.  Well, that was the panic that was running through my mind at the time.     Gosh, will this ever be done on time?    And up until 5:00 when they  started the judging or something   maybe it was 7:00 because it had to  be dark for the lights to work. I know I toured through some of the  houses about 5:00 and I thought,    This is never gonna get put together,     and as soon as we got to touring through the housing area, you could see  guys taking the last of the nails and hammers and putting them behind  the displays, but there they were somehow all done, all lit, all moving.  You were there early in the morning and stayed up late at night?  Oh, yes, and then, of course, by the time you get through with the  judging, you get the judges put to bed and you have to be there to pick  them up the next morning and get them out to the parade, and you know  how this parade   try to get the parade through all these little side streets.  You start staging about 6:00 in the morning, don   t you?  Yes, start staging at dark so we   re up at 6:00 in the morning to start  getting the people in the right place, and you have to orchestrate how  they can move into position because these floats are enormous. Well,  they were then. I   m quite sure they probably are today.  So all the man hours, the people hours and so on   is Homecoming  worth it? What do you guys think about that?  It   s worth every moment and every penny.  We can look back on it now and feel the excitement of being here now  for the anniversary and   yes, it was worth it, and it   s worth our being  17  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  here to now, this weekend.  Why do you think it is that Homecoming has continued to be such an  event for the entire university and for alumni?  I   m sure the Alumni Association has had a lot to do with it because I  think that   s handed down to the next generation of kids. I think had we  not been in the military and had been closer to the university perhaps  one of our children would have attended Oklahoma State. It   s not that  we didn   t pursue it and push it, we just weren   t here for them to catch up  in any of the excitement. But they are as excited about our being here  this weekend as we are, so it   s fun.  I think the Alumni Association, the follow-up of students that have  graduated   I had stopped to get my nails done last week, and this young  lady came running out because we have the OSU sticker on the car and  she said,    Oh, is that for Oklahoma State?    and I said,    Yes,    and so I  told her we were coming back for the Homecoming and she said,    My  husband and I graduated in 1998.    And she was just thrilled to death.  She wants to come back so badly, but economically they   re not able to. I  just thought it was really fun that she came after me   she pursued me     she watched the car while I was in getting my nails done and she came  running out, so      Well what do you think it is? What   s that special bond that alumni have  with OSU   that passion?  I don   t know, but to go back to your previous question I think with the  type of displays, floats and so forth that get built here, I think what  happens is they generate a great deal of team making. The youngsters  who put these things together learn how to put a project together in a  hurry and get it done     And they   re proud.     and the team building that goes on just putting one of these things  together is really quite enormous and you form bonds there that last a  lifetime and that may seem sort of trivial at the time, but you depend on  those things throughout your life.  Why do you think alumni keep coming back, like you   you   re coming  back here? Of course, you   ve been around the world. They   re estimating  up to 50,000 people at Walk-A-Round tonight. Why do you think so  many alumni come back? What brings them back?  Probably not the weather (Laughter) although it   s nice this weekend.  18  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Part of remembering what it was like when they were here. I mean I  have nothing but fond memories of this campus and this university, and I  think that   s a lot of it. We went down into the Student Union bookstore,  clothing part, to pick up some things to wear and stuff, and ran into all  sorts of people that are here for Homecoming. This one lady said her  husband came here and she went to the other school, but she says,    I  bleed orange now    (Laughter) and I thought that was a cute, a cute  comment   but I don   t know. I think all of us now, for us anyway, are  seeking what was, what used to be, and coming back and seeing that still  existing on this campus   because I   ve talked to a lot of people that have  gone back for reunions and they come back and they say,    I   ll never go  to another one. It wasn   t good. It didn   t feel right. Things have  changed.    Now granted things have changed here a tremendous amount,  but there   s still that feeling of   I don   t know   pride, of what it was  when we were here, and you still pick up on that today   at least I did.  Oh, yes.  I felt that very strongly.  I   ve been interviewing the Pistol Pete   s and they   re having a 50-year     Oh yes.  Right.     reunion for the 50th year that Pistol Pete first wore the papier-m  ch    head; do you recall? I mean, was this a big deal for the students when  Pete came out?  Did they? I think they unveiled that first papier-m  ch   head at that  Homecoming.  I was looking at that the other day that indicated that they     Is that right? I thought so, but actually we had so much on our minds at  the time that that sort of passed off     Well I   m sure we noted it when he was introduced.  At the later games though, do you remember Pete being on the field?  Oh yes. Yes, definitely.  How was it received by the students?  19  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  They loved it.  Did they think it was needed and they liked it?  I thought they loved it, yes.  I think so. They must because they are still carrying it on.  I was quite surprised   we now live in New Mexico   and I was really  quite surprised to see that New Mexico State Aggies use a similar Pistol  Pete.  And Wyoming.  And Wyoming. So why didn   t we copyright that? (Laughter)  A M Colleges, yes.  A lot of changes around this time, around your senior year because  you   re 1958, 1959     Yes.     so they changed the name from Oklahoma A M     Yes.     College to Oklahoma State University. How was the name change  perceived among the students? Was it popular? Did they like it?  Well I still have a fraternity mug that says Oklahoma A M on it, and I  do know at the time there was a great deal of loyalty to the old  Oklahoma A M College name, and I know there was some sentiment to     Why do we have to change the name?    we liked A M quite a bit. That  lasted about a year and then OSU was firmly entrenched and from then  on it   s been OSU.  Yes.  And so the name changed and they started using the Cowboys now. Of  course, it had been used some before.  Yes it had.  But officially it was the name Cowboys now instead of Aggies.  20  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Yes.  Of course, a lot of the Aggies   still they   re Aggies but how did that go? I  mean, the name change?  I think it took about a year for the transition to really evolve, and once  the transition was made it was like,    Gee, I forgot why I was worried  about that.    (Laughs)  I remember I wrote a paper for one of my classes   I   m not sure, it must  have been maybe an English class   about how I began school at  Oklahoma A M, but I graduated from Oklahoma State University.  Let   s see 1958 class was actually the first grad, but you were in the  second graduating class?  I was in the second graduating class that was OSU.  The Big Eight athletic conference, was that a big deal for everybody to  be in the Big Eight Conference?  To get into the Big Eight Conference, that was momentous, and for the  longest time we were the doormat of the Big Eight   sort of a tie  between us and Iowa State as to who would come in last. (Laughter)  We   ve changed that, haven   t we?  Yes, we have. I recall the first time we beat OU two times in a row. My  mother called us up and said,    I can die happy now. We beat OU two  years in a row.    (Laughter)  I want to test another expression on you. Do you remember the  Hideaway Pizza? Do you remember when it first opened?  My fraternity brother opened that.  Okay.  Richard Dermer.  Richard Dermer.  Dick Dermer is a fraternity brother of mine.  Do you remember the old original location of it?  21  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Yes, over there on the other side of where Bates Brothers used to be on  the corner?  Where the Baptist Church is, it   s just across the street from it. Was pizza  a big deal for Stillwater? I mean, having pizza     Oh yes. Yes.  Did you all ever go out there?  Oh sure. Sure. We were introduced to pizza in Oklahoma City just prior  to that, right?  Yes.  Was that immediately pretty   it   s a big OSU hangout now and alumni      Yes.  Was it a pretty popular place then?  It actually was. It took awhile to catch on, but Dick and a kid named     his nickname was Tank, Tank Griffin   both of them were Stillwater  graduates and they started delivering pizza for the place and pretty soon  Dick ended up owning it.  That kind of spread the word, didn   t it?  That spread the word, and it   s taken over from then   but it was just a  hole in the wall at the time.  Well what were some of the other student hangouts on and off campus at  that time?  Where was the drugstore? We used to go and get those buns that they  heated.  Oh, that was down on Washington Street somewhere on a corner there.  Where was it? What   s the name? I don   t recall.  It was a huge sweet roll that they heated and of course back then I  weighed 90 pounds so I could eat those. (Laughter) But   well for us,  our main hangout was the library and the Student Union. His last  semester of school I think we spent twenty dollars total for entertainment  that semester. We were both poor little kids (Laughs) and after we were  married, we lived off campus. He had graduated, but I completed my last  22  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  semester then.  Where did you live off campus?  Oh, it was north of the stadium on Hester Street.  Yes, a little     I think it   s probably been taken over by part of the university by now.  A little duplex.  Athletic village area now?  Yes.  Reflecting back in the segment on Pistol Pete, do you remember when  they had the competition for who was the official mascot? Do you  remember that? I think the O   Colly had a     Yes, took a little survey on the thing.  And do you know what the student opinions   you could vote and you  could   do you remember that?  I remember the competition, but it   s like all competitions. Who came in  second? (Laughter)  I heard it was a cowboy riding a bronco, kind of like we used to have.  Might have been, Jerry, but I couldn   t tell you. (Laughter) I can   t even  remember who came in second in the Super Bowl last year. (Laughter)  Getting back to your college years just a little bit, Pat, you majored in  then Home Economics, now Human Environmental Sciences. Were you  in food nutrition or     No, I was in housing and interior design.  Do you remember some of your professors you had then?  Oh, golly. I knew you were gonna ask that. Well     I   m sure you remember the dean.  Oh, yes.  23  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Dean O   Toole.  O   Toole, yes. She was a lovely person. My memories involved getting  to go to Dallas with a class and we went to the market and we got to  design a couple of apartments that we saw down there. And then I  remember Theta Pond and the serenade that the Tekes gave after we got  pinned.  But now, you didn   t get thrown into Theta Pond, did you?  Of course I did  (Laughter)  Just a tradition.  And I got doused in the shower.  If you hadn   t had a swim in Theta Pond    (Laughter)  Oh gosh. I   ve got to ask you. Didn   t the Home Economics majors have  to spend a semester living in Adams House, where they all lived together  and     I was waived from that because we were married. I took the classes, and  those classes were invaluable, but I did not live in the house because  Dean O   Toole waived it since I was married.  Having talked to other alumni, they all remember, boy that semester they  had to live in the house and it wasn   t always a pleasant experience for  everyone   so you got a bye on that.  I got a bye on that one, yes.  That   s good. Well what do you remember   and of course for you the  Homecoming of 1958 had to be the highlight     Oh yes.  Oh it was.     but what other special memories do you, individually and collectively,  stand out in your OSU undergraduate experience?  Well while I was on the Student Senate, I was also selected to get to  attend Texas A M on the Student Conference of National Affairs, and  that was an extremely valuable experience that has stayed with me all of  my life. They were dealing at that time with different international  24  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  relations   Russia was the biggest one   and we learned a lot about the  history and the government, and so that of course stands out. Certain  classes stand out. I had a clothing and textile class that I had to take and  the instructor said,    Whether thou sewest, thou will rip,    and (Laughter)  I have remembered that every time I   ve used a sewing machine.    I am  not gonna rip this out. Oh, yes, if I have to, I will.     She   s worn out about three seam rippers     So those things I remember. Other football games, I remember  basketball games. I remember   maybe I shouldn   t bring this up   a  panty raid that     Oh yes. Those were big in the 1950s, right?  I got a phone call from my father very quickly on that one, wanting to  know if I was involved.  The stories I   ve heard is that some of the ladies might be encouraged by  throwing garments out the window     Absolutely.  Is that the case, Phil?  That   s   I seem to vaguely recall some of those sorts of enticements.  (Laughter)  Well, let   s see, there were still a lot of Quonset huts on campus at that  time, were there not?  As a matter of fact, there were. A lot of the chemistry labs at the time  were still in Quonset huts.  Yes, I     What was that like being in a Quonset hut? Kind of cold in the winter  maybe?  Well they were a little bit cool in the winter, but then we were young  and that was no big deal. But actually when we got in college, Quonset  huts were part of the architecture of the age because there have been so  many Quonset huts built for a variety of things. They were temporary  housing for almost every sort of endeavor that you could imagine.  Well a lot of married students lived in Quonset huts when     25  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  They were temporary housing for about 30 years. (Laughter)  Right.  Funny how that worked out.  Now you can probably relate to this question. What were some of the  favorite dating places, I mean for couples on campus? Where did they  go for dates?  The movies.  Do you remember the Campus Theater here?  Right.  The Campus Theater     And of course ours was the Student Union.  And there used to be one downtown that I don   t recall the name of off-hand.  I don   t either, but I remember the bugs that we had to deal with in the  summertime.  Oh, yes.  Crickets.  As soon as the neon signs went on and springtime happened, the neon  signs gathered bugs by the millions.  So movies and other places then where   for dates?  I can   t tell you the number of cups of coffee that were consumed at the  Student Union.  We played bridge in the Student Union.  Played bridge in the Union and...  Didn   t they have dances, too, in the ballroom there?  Yes, we had different dances, proms     26  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  On the top floor, there was an inside and an outside dance floor, and I  have no idea     Sweetheart        how many jukeboxes they wore out     Well Sweetheart dances and we had live orchestras.  Oh yes. We had a couple of student bands. There were at least two  student bands that I know of that stayed busy, you know, playing for all  kinds of parties   fraternity parties in particular.  Can you briefly share with us a little bit of where your life took you, and  did your background at OSU help prepare you?  Actually there was quite a bit of preparation from Oklahoma State, yes. I  talked about the team building business that occurs because of, just the  way the youngsters have put together a project in a hurry and do it well.  I went into the air force originally because when I graduated, the draft  was still alive and as I went out on my job searches my prospective  employers would say,    What   s your draft status?       One-A.       Call us  when you get back from the army.    That was just a fact of life and the  way things got done back then.  I decided rather than being a private in the army I would go through a  commissioning program in the air force where at least you could make a  little more money. So I ended up getting into officer training school in  the air force   went through that training and fully intended to just do a  tour and get out. After I finished my first tour in Denver, Colorado     which was a really interesting job that I employed my engineering skills  that I   d learned here   and I had an opportunity to go to Iceland for a  little two-year tour and I said,    Well, that sounds like great fun. Iceland  is sort of exotic.    So I went to Iceland for a couple of years and was  fully intending to get out then and they said,    Well, we have this       At  the time you couldn   t just get out. You had to apply, and you had to go  back stateside   I got sent to Malmstrom, Montana   and that sounds  kind of bleak.  Great Falls, actually.  In Great Falls, Montana   and it is pretty bleak   but it   s a remarkably     Beautiful.     beautiful place to be stationed. So by this time I   ve got almost ten  27  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  years in the service and I thought,    Well, heck, I may as well make a  career out of it since I   m halfway there.    So I spent some time in the  missile business and was in military intelligence for awhile, and I ended  my career in the nuclear safety business at Kirtland in Albuquerque,  New Mexico.  So you   re retiring in New Mexico now? Some connections there, having  been stationed there     We went there on our honeymoon 49 years ago (Laughs) and said,    Oh,  we love this. We   re gonna come back some day.    So we did.  We had a shotgun honeymoon. I had to sell my shotgun so we could go  on a honeymoon  (Laughter)  Little bit different than     Yes. (Laughs)  Glad you explained that.  A different twist on that. When we went to Albuquerque on that  honeymoon, we thought,    This is a really nice place. Let   s come back  here sometime.    So we ended up retiring there and     We love it.     and we love it there.  Because you traveled, did you ever get to come back to Oklahoma State?  Did you stay connected with OSU during those years?  Well, we always managed to take the alumni magazine and pay alumni  dues and we sort of stayed connected like that. I came back about, oh, 15  years ago, for a fraternity reunion when they were trying to reconstitute  the TKE fraternity, I came back for that event. I was almost afraid we  were gonna face the same kind of weather because it was like 20 degrees  for that Homecoming game.  What was the temperature at your Homecoming in 1958?  It was about like today.  Yes. It was beautiful.  It was a marvelous day.  28  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Phil Middleton  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  It was a little earlier. I think it was the first part of October,  Homecoming was.  I have no idea.  Well it   s in the dates. (Laughs)  Probably got the dates right.  But he also served a tour in Southeast Asia. From Malmstrom, he went  to Vietnam.  What was your final rank when you retired?  I retired as a Lieutenant Colonel.  What are some special memories you have of OSU? Can you share some  of what it meant to you to go to Oklahoma State University? Special  memories that you had that stand out?  You   re first.  I   m first. (Laughter) Well of course the Homecoming, but we grew up. I  grew up a lot. Of course being a military brat, I had been exposed to  some high-ranking individuals, but being in the Student Senate  introduced us to some rather sophisticated people so you learn that kind  of exposure helps you grow.  And did the leadership opportunity that you had then help you? The  educational opportunities outside the classroom, was that important in  your education experience?  Oh absolutely. Absolutely, yes. We   ve been in leadership all of our  lives, be it PTA, be it Wives    Club, be it whatever. We   ve always taken  a leadership role in our lives.  Well back to Murray Hall   president of the hall, what was it like? What  was dorm life like then, Pat? What do you remember about that? What  are your memories there in the residence hall?  Well I remember the little snack shop down in the basement. I had to  make sure that none of the girls got left down there when we closed the  door and had the room count upstairs. I mean it had a different code as  far as restrictions on what you could and could not do in the dorm. Our  dorm rooms consisted of two beds, two desks, a sink that   I think we  shared the sink, I don   t think we had our own sink   and we had to go  29  Gill  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  Gill  Pat Middleton  Phil Middleton  down the hall for the showers. So life in the dorm, my responsibilities  were just to kind of keep everything on track with the house mother.  Was there any issue with the name of Murray Hall then? It   s named  after Governor Bill    Alfalfa    Murray and     I didn   t know that.     there   s a little bit of discussion on campus now because some of his  philosophy and so on   which was unfortunate   was reminiscent of some  of the time in the 1920s which was racist so some of the students were  questioning whether we should continue to keep the name Murray Hall.  I do not even remember that being an issue at all because our dorm was  certainly intermixed. I mean we had blacks, we had     So that wasn   t an issue whenever     No, I don   t recall   maybe I   m na  ve or was then, but I don   t recall that  being an issue at all.  I don   t think there was a quiz that they gave us as to who was named for  which hall. (Laughter)  Well we appreciate you guys very much for the interview. Welcome back  and we want to wish you a great time here.  Thank you so much.  Jerry, thanks very much. This has been a great pleasure.  -------  -------
