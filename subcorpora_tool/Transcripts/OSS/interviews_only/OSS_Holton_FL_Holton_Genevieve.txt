 S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  My name is Karen Neurohr. I   m the Project Investigator for the O-STATE  Stories Oral History Project, a project of the Oklahoma State  University Library. We are at the home of F. L. and Genevieve Holton in  Poteau, Oklahoma, and they   re going to be interviewed by their son,  Steve Holton. Today is Thursday, October 5, 2006.  Homecoming will be celebrated in just a couple of weeks at OSU and we  know of the national reputation that Oklahoma State has for their  Homecoming celebration, and what we would like for you all to share  with us first thing is your recollections of Homecoming while you were  in school   what it was like at OAMC, Dad?  Well, we had parades. We had limited budgets but all the fraternities and  sorority houses had decorations, and it was celebrated. If Homecoming  was with OU  University of Oklahoma , we would have a week of  guarding the campus. Pep Club members would guard it at night with  paddles. They took one car from OU   and they broke the windows out  of it and they headed back to Norman. So there was quite a rivalry then  between the two schools at Homecoming. They also had a Homecoming  Dance, and the Student Senate had two dances a year where they made  their money that financed them for the year, and that was the Ribbon  Dance at the first of school and Homecoming Dance at Homecoming.  Mom, do you remember your first Homecoming at OSU?  I think I can remember one incident, and it may have been my second  year. But anyway, our sorority had a float in the Homecoming parade  and we won, and I have a snapshot somewhere. This float had a huge  clear plastic frame on it, like a corsage box, and one of our beautiful  Alpha Delta Pi girls sitting up there as an orchid corsage. It was very  5  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  neat, and we won.  Would the parade route be downtown?  Downtown.  Would it come out to campus then? Would they do the floats at the  football stadium? Would they take them on to the game?  We did sometimes.  Yeah. Around the track. They paraded around the track at the football  stadium.  And that was nice. You got to really see them well.  And house decorations, did you decorate? I know not to the extent they  do now or was it more centered on floats?  Oh, we had some decorations at the house, but limited. I remember one  time we had a John Deere tractor. It was a two-engine type of tractor and  that was going to beat them down or something or other but that was our  Homecoming decoration.  As far as rivals go we mentioned, of course, OU. Was that the biggest  rivalry when you all were in school?  Yes. That was the main rivalry. We played Tulsa nearly every year and  that was the important game, but they didn   t have any campus feelings  like they did against OU   the tea sippers. (Laughter)  What about gathering places on and off campus? What are your  memories of those? Let   s start with off-campus.  Well, off campus we had of course the Oasis   at the corner of what was  then College Avenue, now University Boulevard. At the corner of that,  at the beginning of the campus, they had Aggie Drug on the corner and  the Oasis, just a student hangout. They served sandwiches and Cokes,  and above that was the dance hall, and it was about 50 by 140 feet, and  they had a dance band stand. We had two varsity jazz bands on campus,  swing bands they were called then, and they would have twelve  members and a singer. And then they   d have a card table with four  chairs, and the chaperones sat at the card table. Everyone else danced. In  the middle of the floor, they would have stags  people without dates ,  and they   d have about fifty stags and about 100 couples. You would  dance clockwise around the dance hall, and if you danced with your girl  6  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  over two rounds, well you   d take a paddle and beat the pledge that  (Laughter) didn   t tag your date during that time. And then they   d have  program dances and sweetheart dances and nearly all the fraternities  would have a costume dance from sailors to frontiers to a hobo dance in  the fall. In the spring, they would have formal dances. All the fraternities  and the dormitories would do the same.  The other hangout   they had one in front of the Chi Omega house  called the Frat Shop and then   the first year, Swim   s was more  important, but it was declining because they moved the girls    dorms to  Murray Hall and the girls    dorms the year before had been in Thatcher  and another girls    dorm next to Morrill Hall, and so when they moved  the girls west, Swim   s lost some of their popularity there.  Mom, was there a lot of excitement at the sorority houses in anticipation  of the dances and the parties?  Oh yes. Lots of preparation. Lots of hair curling, trying on dresses,  sometimes borrowing a dress. Lots, lots of activity getting ready.  Where was your sorority located? How far from campus?  1309 College across   well, how will I say   from Murray Hall, we were  about two blocks behind Murray Hall.  And where were most of your classes?  Well, they were over in the middle of the campus. I was in Public  School Music, and we had an unusual building. We had the old  Crutchfield Hall, which had been for the football players. So the football  players got a new building. The music department got Crutchfield Hall.  So all of our practice rooms and so forth, and classes, music classes,  were in Crutchfield Hall which was right close to the stadium, so it was  handy. I didn   t have to walk too awfully far. Whitehurst was a little  further out maybe. But, you were asking about the places where we  enjoyed partying off campus. F.L., what was the name of the one that we  weren   t supposed to go to?  The Rock Castle.  The Rock Castle. (Laughter)  It was across the creek past Stillwater Milling Company, and that was  off limits to most sorority girls. We were supposed not to go there, but  I   m sure that a few broke the rules and attended. They said afternoon  dances were popular there. (Laughter)  7  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  That   s just toward Perkins Road?  Yes. Near Perkins Road.  Right.  And did you ever go?  Oh, maybe once. (Laughter)  Okay, what about on campus? Were there any student hangouts?  The only student place you could get a cup of coffee and a doughnut or  candy bar was next to the power plant, and it was about a block west of  Morrill Hall   a little wooden building  called the Y Hut . And the blind  man and his wife ran the little student building there that you could get a  Coke. Across the street from it was the bookstore and the post office and  The Daily O   Collegian and upstairs was The Redskin and Aggievator.  Aggievator was the humor magazine, censored frequently.  No student union?  No student union.  And how far were you off campus   the Lambda Chi house?  Lambda Chi house was on Hester Street, and that was only two blocks  from the president   s home in Old Central. So we were right in the  middle of the campus.  Where were most of your classes?  My classes nearly all were in Morrill Hall. I did have a class in Williams  Hall, which was an old building that was torn down later. It was located  where the fire station is now. I had an 8:00 class there and I had a 9:00  class the second semester in the Dairy Building. After you passed the  new Engineering Building, there wasn   t a strand of barbed wire between  that and the North Pole. (Laughter) The wind blew, and you had to leave  on the first bell and you got there on the second bell as they were  checking the roll when you got to the Dairy Building. You walked  briskly.  What about dating when you all were in school? Can you comment, give  us a little idea   not necessarily dating each other, but just dating in  general, what most dates consisted of?  8  G. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  Of course, one of the ideal places to meet was in the evenings around  7:00 we had dance hour. I lived in the dormitory for the first two years.  We had dance hour there. Then in the sorority house we also had dance  hour. So the young men would come for thirty minutes, and we   d have  our time to dance and then you often got to go with them   walk up to the  corner to get a Coke...and I understand that they often, after they took us  home, having given us a Coke, they went back and had hamburgers or  hotdogs. (Laughter) But I remember the first dance, big dance that we  had was my first year in Murray Hall. It was brand new and I didn   t  really know anyone to invite to the dance so I called and had my big  brother come for the dance and he came, so that was pretty neat. I was  real pleased at that. But we loved dancing, and we particularly enjoyed  our dance hours and the dances all the fraternities and sororities had. It  was lots of fun and we really dressed up. The girls had beautiful dresses,  and we had on high heels   which makes me think that high heels   I  wore them to class. We dressed when we went to school, and we were  dressed up and wore heels. I got my first corn (Laughter) on a toe  wearing those high heels. Then as the years went on, we came down to  flats and lower heels and bobby socks and so forth. We even dressed to  go to ballgames. We dressed up. There wasn   t any sloppy, casual-looking  dress. That was good.  Dad, can you give us an idea of what, as far as the cost of things that  you all did?  Oh yeah, the one thing I might tell you   the hours. After we mentioned  that the girls   thirty minutes to take the girls and buy them a Coke or  just sit there and visit with them in the dorms or in the sorority houses.  They had to be in at 8:00 from Monday through Thursday night, Friday  nights and Saturday nights 12:00, and Sunday 11:00. And what  Genevieve didn   t say, too, about the boys with the hamburgers   the  girls would go back and order a hamburger and they had a rope, and  they   d let down a basket from Murray Hall to the ground floor, and  they   d deliver hamburgers for a dime.  And foot-long hotdogs.  All the time I was in the School of Business, called the School of  Commerce then, now it   s College of Business   I never paid over  30 a  semester for enrolling. The enrollment fee was  10 then, and then they  added your different labs and fees on there,  1.00 for The Daily  O   Collegian,  2.50 for The Redskin and  1.00 for Allied Arts and  1.00  for your athletic tickets. I didn   t ever take the Allied Arts, but I did take  the others, and it cost me usually  26 or  27 a semester to enroll. When  they built the new field house, they added  2.50 a semester to help pay  for the new field house, and they ran editorials in the paper that they  9  G. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  were denying people education to have to pay that  2.50 fee.  (Laughs) To buy a brick     What about the cost of dating?  Oh, it wasn   t expensive. Like I said, you   d walk downtown to the picture  show and save your dime to ride two for a dime in a taxi cab to come  back in case it rained. Sometimes it didn   t rain and you walked back, but  anyway they had two taxi companies and they gave good service, and  they would be at the theater when the shows were over, and they   d load  up three couples in the back and one in the front and deliver them  around. There was always room in the taxi cabs for more, and they gave  good service. But the Theta house was considered the limits for a dime.  If you went past the Theta house, you were out in the country and that  was fifteen cents. They had run a bus earlier, but they quit it during the  Depression because money was tight. A lot of things were free on the  campus to attend. House bills were  35 in the fraternities. House bills  out in the Aggie Lodge (old CCC Camp) were  12.50 a month for room  and board and they had work study programs where one could work for  their board out of that. A lot of boys  lived there and became campus  leaders . They had one for the girls called Aggie Lodge and the other  dormitories were priced reasonably. They had co-op dining rooms then.  For  12.50 a month, they got three meals a day.  On the weekends when people wanted to come home, you   d go down to  Perkins Corner and that was nine miles down there. There   d be thirty or  forty boys at the corner. They   d hitchhike a ride down there and then  they   d wait and people would come by and pick them up and take them  home. They were awful good to college kids. And then those going  north would get up on the eleven-mile corner and they   d go to Perry and  up through there and hitchhike. So young men hitchhiked all the time  back and forth home. It took me eight hours to get home my first  Thanksgiving. I came home on the bus from Stillwater to Poteau.  Transportation   you just didn   t get to Stillwater without having a  handicap.  Mom, what was the sorority house like coming from a small town, small  high school? Was that a big change for you   the dorm life, too, I guess?  Talking about dorm life, let me tell you an experience I had. I lived the  first two years in a dorm. I lived the first year in Murray Hall and the  second year in Willard, which were both brand new. And they were  lovely, really lovely   big rooms and well done. One of the things I  remember especially, too, was in our dining area which was quite large.  We had tables for eight girls and had a hostess, one of the older girls, at  10  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  every table who sat at the head of the table. She was the one who saw  that we passed everything correctly, used the right silver, etcetera. So we  learned a lot about manners at each meal. And we learned to sit down  and eat together as we were used to doing at home, which would be  different now, wouldn   t it? On each floor there was a counselor who was  also a junior or senior and it was awfully good to have her to ask  questions and help you with anything you were having a problem with.  But, the difference   I loved the sorority house. My room was just a little  ol    bitty room, and I had a roommate and we had bunk beds. It bothered  my mother much more than it did me. She just couldn   t understand why  in the world I would want to move out of that beautiful new dorm room  and into that little    ole room in the sorority house where we were all  kind of jammed up and many slept out on a sleeping porch. Of course,  we had house mothers, and they were very helpful and kept a thumb on  what we were doing and told us what we shouldn   t do, too. (Laughs)  How did Rush work? Was there a Rush Week or was it an open Rush  during school? How did you get members?  We had Rush Week. We had Rush and I remember that we dressed for  Rush. I understand now they don   t do much, but we wore new fall  clothes and you know it was hot that time of year but we dressed up in  our new fall clothes and went through Rush and we loved it. It was fine  and I   m sure that a lot of things are different now in Rush, but it was  okay.  Do you recall how many men were in the Lambda Chi house?  Oh yeah, twenty-seven. That   s all it would hold. (Laughter)  We had forty-five.  They would have a Ribbon Dance. Say Rush would end on Friday, and  Saturday night they   d have all the pledges and have a Ribbon Dance and  each sorority had three or four house boys that washed the dishes and  served the meals and cleaned up the tables and all. They were nearly all  fraternity boys and wherever the fraternity had a house job, they would  call them to be sure that all the pledges got invited to the Ribbon Dance.  Naturally, we used to laugh and say the    closet pledges.    We   d have to  take them to the Ribbon Dance   and the same way   everyone had on  new fall suits. You wore a shirt, tie and coat to the dance, and you  danced every dance. It was the only thing you could do, but there wasn   t  any place to sit down.  I understood it was a wetter campus before we got on campus. I started  in 1937, but during my term it was a very dry campus. There was just no  11  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  drinking at the dances, on campus or in the fraternity houses, so it was  quite different. The Hell Hounds had some beer and Ruf-Nex at some of  their parties, but that was about all     Did they encourage you all to be active on campus and to be involved?  Oh yes, that was part of it. And they helped you get interested in things.  What are some of the things you did?  Well, I went to work on The O   Collegian. I wrote about sports at Poteau  High School and also for the county papers. For the O   Collegian, my  first assignment was to interview Coach Gallagher, and he was the  world   s champion wrestling coach at OSU. So we got acquainted with a  lot of people that way. Then I started working on The Redskin. I worked  there for all four years and edited the last year. Working with names and  pictures, I could nearly tell you someone in every town in Oklahoma.  There was only a little over 4,000 when we started to school in    37 and  there was only about 4,800 when I graduated. There were 825 in my  class, including master   s and doctor   s degrees.  What about the student government? Was it active?  Active? Politics was very active in student government and they always  had some kind of plan they were working on. Like all students, they  wanted to change something or other. In 1940 in our yearbook, we  campaigned for Oklahoma A M to be changed to Oklahoma State. We  sent a letter and got a picture back. Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians,  were quite a renowned band at the time. They  the band  wrote a song  for Oklahoma State and we published it in our 1941 yearbook. That was  fifteen years before they changed the name to Oklahoma State.  The next year, in the yearbook that I edited, we had a campaign to name  the 4-H Club Building. That was the way they got the got the money to  build the new gym. They kept the basement floor dirt as they had to have  a livestock show in the basement every year. So we wanted them to  name it Gallagher Hall. We wrote it up in the yearbook. It   s now  Gallagher-Iba Hall. So I took Dean McElroy, Dean of Men, and the two  outstanding class members over to what is now called Gallagher Hall  and had them pointing up at the cement block over the doorway. Then  we took an engraver and engraved Gallagher Hall. We put that in our  yearbook. So we named it Gallagher Hall ten or twelve years before it  was named Gallagher Hall. Politics were interesting, and they controlled  a lot of the dances and different organizations on campus. We   d have  some heated contests for student government elections and had secret  political fraternities, so it was a lot of fun. When you were there on the  12  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  campus four years, you got acquainted with many people, and we were  always eager to point out that you spoke to everybody crossing campus.  They didn   t do that at OU  University of Oklahoma . They were more  citified (Laughter) and that was always a big selling point.  Did the girls get involved in campus politics or running for offices?  Oh, yes. They were involved. Probably not as much in politics, but we  did run for offices. I was President of the Women   s Choral Group and  belonged to the Peppers Organization, which was the girls    sports  cheerleaders. The Peppers and the Hell Hounds kept things going. But  we encouraged the girls to join organizations and take part in all the  activities that they could on campus. We even played basketball.  This was, you know, during the 30   s, when the Depression was still very  much on     Very much on.  Yes, and so   were there fellow students that were just barely making it?  Or did you have kids that had to drop out   they just couldn   t afford to  come?  Nearly every semester, particularly in the end-of-spring semester, you   d  have one or two end up in the infirmary. They were just starving to get  through. Grades were important, but they weren   t emphasized. The thing  was to get that degree and get out and get a job. So some of the kids  really had it hard, but they stayed in there.  I thought it was kind of unusual   my class was the first class in ROTC   Reserve Officers    Training Corps  to get long pants for uniforms. We  were glad to get the new slacks. They were nice, new uniforms. It was  required for all freshmen and sophomores to take two years of military.  We would have classes Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and  Thursday in military. Most people would wear their uniforms to class.  Those men that were having a hard time having enough clothes wore  their uniforms all four days and no one knew which two classes that they  really attended. But the men all wore slacks and ties and shirts and  sweaters to go to class. There weren   t any jeans and sweatshirts in the  class. Mr. Iba had his basketball boys all wear suits. They had to have  three white shirts and ties when they went on a trip, and he told them he  was training them to be future businessmen and not tramp athletes. He  took them to good shows when they went back east to play ball games  and stayed in nice hotels.  Mom, do you remember any hard times for some of the girls financially?  13  G. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  I don   t too much   I know that some of them had to work and it was  difficult for them to stay in school, but they were determined that they  were going to make it, and so they would just do most anything to be  able to pay whatever bills they had and stay in school.  Many borrowed  money to stay in school.   Do you think overall   were students any more serious about why they  were there?  They definitely were. It was a sacrifice for most of them, for their  parents to send them. They knew why they were there. They were there  to get an education, and they were determined.  When they decided to change the name to Oklahoma State University,  did that bother you all? (Laughter)  Oh, for five dollars you could send in and they would send you a new  diploma saying Oklahoma State on it. I never did send in the five  dollars. (Laughter) It didn   t bother us. It might be of interest to you   in  1937 when I enrolled in school, the droughts of    36 had been the worst  in the State of Oklahoma. All the trees on the campus had died and  Theta Pond was dried up and cracked open. The freshman and  sophomores every year would have a rope-pulling contest to see who  could pull the other through Theta Pond, but they didn   t have it that year  because it was dry. One of the other little customs was for freshmen  boys to wear little beanies on their heads, orange and black skull caps.  That was one of the traditions they had at that time.  Is there just one thing that really when you think back about those years,  anything that   s just a particularly fond memory that you have of those  four years? Is there something that just really comes to mind?  Oh, I can   t think. There   s just the association with so many young  people your age, making good friends, and so many of them that you  keep in touch with to this day from those days at Oklahoma A M. We  were proud of our school and loyal to it, and we enjoyed it. We stayed  on campus on weekends and we had all kinds of activities and just lots  of fun. We loved going to the football games, and we enjoyed it when  we got to go to Tulsa for a weekend. That was a really neat or to  Norman. F. L. can probably come up with a good one.  Well, they had those special trains when we   d go down to Norman.  You   d leave at about 8:00 in the morning from Stillwater and then go to  Oklahoma City and pick up some more cars. The ballgames would be in  the afternoon, and thirty minutes after the ballgame was over you got  back on the train and you   d get back to Stillwater about 9:00 or 9:30 that  14  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  night. They were always interesting, those rides down and back  with  happy students .  I think a highlight, too, was the athletics. We had a national champion  basketball team later on, but some of the players were in school when  we were and Mr. Iba took over the new gym. It was packed all the time.  You had to go at 6:00 to get a seat in the gym. The students had free     open seating, but you had to get there early to get a good seat, and it was  always crowded. I thought it was interesting that they had house boys at  the sorority houses. Bob Fenimore, the All-American halfback for  Oklahoma A M was a house boy. After practice, he   d go out to the  Alpha Delta Pi house and wash the dishes     He was our house boy.     and eat supper. During noon, he   d have to go out there and get his  lunch but he was their house boy. Genevieve was President from  Woodward, and Bob was from Woodward so that   s the connection with  the All-American   you can imagine All-American players now washing  dishes for their meals.  Can you all tell between your two families a little bit about how many  brothers, nephews, nieces, children, went to OSU?  Back in the late    60s and early    70s there, we would have as high as  seven at a time at OSU between all the families, the Holton's and the  Benbrook's so we had a lot of family reunions at Homecoming. Pistol  Pete didn   t come on campus until about 1940, and the first I can  remember Pistol Pete emblems being sold was by a new drugstore. The  drugstore was across the street from the fire station. They had built,  while we were in school, a campus theater across the street from the  Oasis and Aggie Drug. They had a new drugstore, and they were selling  plastic stickers you could put on your car or put in your room of Pistol  Pete. That   s the first time I can remember seeing him and he became our  mascot from then on.  What about the tradition of waving the arms was that   ?  OAMC would wave the arms with every touchdown they made.  Did you go to a lot of the sporting events?  Oh, yeah. Yeah, we went to all of the games. I was a member of the pep  club, the Hell Hounds, and we   d go out of town. We went to Kansas to  basketball games. We went to Arkansas when they opened their new  stadium and we went to OU.  15  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  A kind of an unusual thing was that one of the dance band leaders was a  Lambda Chi, and they bought an old hearse, grey hearse to transport  their musical instruments. We would take it down to Norman and drove  around the campus when we played OU. We thought that was really neat  to be down there. A M was a very interesting, friendly campus. They  also had some outstanding students  that made successful lives after  graduation .  The editor of The Redskin my sophomore year became a major general  in the Air Force and the business manager my freshman year became a  brigadier general in the Air Force and we had a lot of majors and  colonels. We got out at the right time from    40 to    42. We graduated a  lot of men just ready to go into the service, but they made outstanding  records. C. A.  Overstreet  flew thirty missions and got several medals  on a B-24 bomber in the European theater. My class scattered quickly all  over the country in the military as war broke out. I had a date with  Genevieve and we   d gone to the matinee on Sunday afternoon. I   d taken  her back to her house, and I came into the fraternity house and it was  absolutely silent, which was unusual downstairs. I went up and they  were all in a room around a radio as Pearl Harbor was being bombed,  and we thought it might at first be an Orson Welles    story, but it wasn   t.  The next day they began to drop out of school, and in a week or ten days  they began to get engaged        and get married    (Laughs)     and get married, and the campus really turned over fast in the next  few days   months as students left for war.  Mom, can you tell us about your first date and what your impression  was?  My first date with F. L.?  Yes.  My first date with F. L. was at dance hour, and he asked me to go to the  corner after dance hour. We went there and had a Coke and walked back  and I enjoyed it very much. He was pretty neat, a neat guy and he  followed up...he called back. And so I think that   s one reason I enjoyed  dance hour so much.  Do you remember this the same way?  Oh yeah. I was right there.  16  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  He was right there. (Laughter)  I was impressed enough I called back for more dates and     Then after I was pinned, he sent me a dozen red roses to the sorority  house and of course the girls sang to you and all that neat stuff that goes  on and so it was very impressive. Anyway, he kept coming back and I  kept being glad to have him back.  And how many years have you been married?  Just sixty-four.  Just? (Laughter)  I held on to him, didn   t I?  You did. It was a good dance.  Good dance.  It was a good dance,  and we have enjoyed dancing together all these  years .  They had good dance bands and there was intermingling of all at dances.  One dance, in particular, I remember we defeated Tulsa, and Pete  Rivers, our best halfback, kicked a field goal and won the ballgame in  the last minutes. We organized a walkout and paraded downtown and  back, and by the time we got back they   d got a orchestra set up in the old  gym and everyone skipped classes that afternoon. Some professors  threatened to flunk them if they did. We had a picture in the yearbook of  the victory dance because we had won the ballgame over at Tulsa.  Victories were kind of short at that time. (Laughter)  Tell me about how campus has changed over the years?  The Oklahoma A M campus had changed. It had very little new  buildings when I arrived on campus in 1937. It was following the years  of the extreme drought in Oklahoma, and Theta Pond was dry and  cracked open. All the trees on the campus had died. Murray Hall was  one year old. Dr. Bennett went down to Alfalfa   Bill Murray, the  governor, and courted him and got him to come visit A M. OU didn   t  want any more dorms. They had boarding houses and so Bennett told  him they would name it after him if he   d give them money to build a  dorm. That was the first new dorm that had been built on campus, the  first building been built on campus in ten or twelve years and it was  17  S. Holton  located out on the western side of the campus.  The next year they built North Murray, and then they had torn down the  old library building and it was in a temporary building between the  Science Building and the president   s home   a very small library at the  time. I took History of Western Civilization and I had a lot of books to  read. You   d go over and they had a limited amount of books. You had to  stand in line or go back two or three times to get your books to read for  your class because they didn   t have enough books to go around. We had  a small library in the Business Building called the Commerce Library  and I used that a lot and tried to have one hour in between morning  classes and studied during that hour because I never did cut class, but I  didn   t study too much outside of class so I used that as study time.  Williams Hall was right behind the fire station. It was a huge old hall  and had a lot of history. It had been the Theater Building and a lot of  different departments had been there. I had a math class in it and then  they tore it down and they built a fire station there. Fire Chief Pence had  quite a reputation. He wrote books on fires and printed them. They had  students taking firemanship. I had a class in Old Central, a money and  banking class with about eighty students in it and the fire whistle would  blow twice. A fella named Hopper sat next to me was a fireman. He had  to get up in the middle of class and go fight the fire. They had a money  and banking teacher  who  was very precise. The second time the boy  was leaving the teacher said,    You tell Chief Pence to quit having  laboratory exercises during my class time.     And the funniest story happened in AGR  Alpha Gamma Rho  house  that had been the old Theta house. It was next door to what now is the  Sigma Nu house. One Saturday afternoon, the members were asleep on  the third floor. They had laundry chutes down to the basement. Two of  the pledges brought home chickens from home and the cook had dressed  the chickens to have fried chicken that night. Well, they took the chicken  feathers and put in a tote sack and lit them and held under the laundry  chute, and the smoke went up to the third floor and awakened the  members. The pledges thought that would just be fun but here came the  fire department. They come roaring down the street. The boys just shut  up their tote sack and went down the alley and stomped it out. They  came back, and were scared to tell anyone. Chief Pence always wanted  to determine or the origin of fire. So he took axes and chopped holes in  walls and did about  300 worth of damage, which now would be  3,000  or  4,000 worth of damage, to it and he never did find out what caused  that smoke. (Laughter) So there are lots of funny stories that I can  remember from college.  You   d mentioned something earlier about the Dairy Building?  18  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  Yes, I had a class out in the Dairy Building. In my last semester in  school, I had a Farm Economics class there, which was a long ways  from Morrill Hall. But everyone walked on campus and enrollment had  gained during my time. We gained 600 or 700 students in the four years  while I was in school and classrooms became crowded.  The year before I went to school, the top blew off of Whitehurst Hall.  Gas blew the top off of it, so they built the top back in the new style of  architecture that took over   what is it   the Georgian style of  architecture? And that was the first building to have that type of roof on  it, and they followed that style. During my time, they built a new  Engineering Building, built Willard Hall and they built Cordell Hall, and  it was recorded in our 1940 yearbook as being the finest men   s dorm in  the United States. It cost all of  639,000 to build that dorm. It was an  excellent dorm and they built a new field house, and we got to see many  ballgames in it. So they had a new field house and a new Engineering  Building, a new men   s dorm, and two new women   s dorms while I was  on campus. The school had really begun to get some more money, and  Dr. Bennett was very popular. He was killed in an airplane wreck in Iran  on a four point peace program for President Truman. He and his wife  were both killed in the crash.  He was a good politician, it sounds like     Yes.     able to get state money for OSU?  Yes. He was very good and he also had been county superintendent  down at Hugo, Oklahoma,  then he was President of Southeastern  Teachers    College for ten years . When Governor Johnson was  impeached and Holloway, the lieutenant governor was made governor.  He appointed Dr. Bennett from Southeastern College to be President of  OAMC. I don   t know, as I could verify it, but it was reported at the time  that the academic group on campus was very much disturbed at  this  appointment  to become President of Oklahoma A M College so he  went down to OU and took a quick course that summer and got his  doctor   s degree. He proved to be an outstanding president and did a lot  to improve the campus and get more money for the Oklahoma A M  College.  Was Theta Pond as large then as it is now?  Yes, it was about the same size and, like I said, they   d throw boys in and  then take their pants over and put on the Pi Phi   s or the Zeta Tau   s front  porch, and they   d have to go in their shorts and get their pants back. On  19  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  campus there was always something going on. There was a lot of free  entertainment, like you said   they created a lot of their own  entertainment on campus. Dances that they would have   people were  invited to them and you met people. You had so many acquaintances on  campus by the time you were there for three or four years.  Crutchfield Hall was in bad repair when the Music Department got it. It  was the building next to Hanner Hall. Hanner Hall was on the way, close  to the old gymnasium. They wanted to build Cordell Hall between  Hanner and Thatcher Hall, but the mortgage bond holders wouldn   t  allow them to do that. They   d had the bonds on the other two dorms, so  they built it where they did. It was an outstanding dorm for that day and  time.  And what was Old Central being used for?  Old Central had classrooms in it, and the Oklahoma A M Alumni  Association had an office in there. Frank or A. O. Martin was the head  of the Alumni Association at the time, and I think he had one secretary. I  had an English class, a math class and a money and banking class in Old  Central, and most of the rest of the classes were in Morrill Hall. The  Theater Building has been remodeled and all since then. It looked quite a  bit like it does now, but it was in the late    60s that they remodeled the  Theater Building.  You mentioned that there had been a drought and a lot of the trees had  died. Were there efforts during your time there to re-plant trees?  Oh, yes. They got some federal money or WPA  Works Progress  Administration  money, NYA money they   d call it...National Youth  Administration money and they got jobs for twenty-five cents an hour,  and that helped a lot of the students. They got human fertilizer, dried  fertilizer, from Oklahoma City and put it out in the spring of 1938 and  planted trees. It did a wonderful job of growing and a terrible job of  stinking when it rained. (Laughter) But Sixth   no, Washington Avenue  went through the campus. It was open as a street, and it wasn   t closed  until after the war and they built the new library.  It was Washington I   ll bet.  Yes, Washington Avenue was open all the way across campus and the  Student Union building was built and the library was built and they  closed Washington Avenue and beautified the campus. Theta Pond   I  think it was enlarged and landscaped after that. That   s about all the  campus that I can remember.  20  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  I think the football stadium was enlarged about the last year or so, and  the north side of the football stadium   why it was made that some of the  boys after the war returned and veterans slept under that on cots, but it  would only hold about 8,000 people. When I went to school all the  games, of course, were in the afternoon. And, as Genevieve said, they  dressed. They   d wear fur coats and hats and high heels and all, and even  one of the editors of the paper who was an unusual person. I have a  picture of him even with a shirt and tie and hat on with a date. They  complained then about the food then like they do now, but they gained  ten pounds the first semester usually    (Laughter)  Were there any other traditions on campus at certain times of the year  that were particularly memorable around any of the buildings or  anything?  No. The old cafeteria was across the street from Morrill Hall, and they   d  have banquets and special meetings and dinners in there. I can   t  remember too much happening on campus except that victory parade  that time with the football game and     Was there anything similar to Spring Sing or     No        or any     Oh, they had Varsity Review     Varsity Review.  Yeah, they had Varsity Review every year, and they   d have some good  shows in it.  The sororities and fraternities used to try to do things together, join  together and present a skit and do house decorations.  They had about twelve beauty contests, and they had about twelve  different queens on campus. I dreaded that many going in the yearbook.  The Homecoming queen was always quite an event and they had band  queens and the queen of every school and ROTC queen so those were  some of the activities. The daily newspaper carried a gossip column that  always created attention. In the left-hand column of the daily paper  there was always a gossip column in there about coming activities, what  happened at the last activities and all the couples going steady.  Who was dating who and who broke up     21  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  Did they bring guest speakers in to talk to the students like they do now?  Not very much. We had a few. I remember in the School of Business,  they arranged a program and got Mr. Raymond Young of TG Y. He  had at one time 300 variety stores and it was quite a chain. He had been  business manager of The Redskin in 1925. I got him back on campus to  make a talk. They were beginning to get a few come back and make  speeches then, but before that I can   t remember too many outside  speakers or events that they had. Money wasn   t available to finance  them.  What was commencement like when you graduated?  Well, we graduated in the new field house and the parents sat around the  sides and in the balcony, and they could put all 800 of us on the gym  floor.  Genevieve   s graduation, class of 1942, was also held in the field  house.  We   ve got pictures of graduating classes in their yearbooks and  they   d have speakers to that   but a Senator or president from another  college. And like I said most people didn   t remember what they said  anyway. (Laughter) They were just glad to get out, and they had a rule  then. For a long time, you had to go through graduation to get your  diploma.  How often did you go home?  You stayed on campus a lot and you didn   t come home but during the  holidays because it was so hard to go home and you got better  acquainted with others. They   d put out the bid list at two or three weeks  before a fraternity was going to have a dance, they   d mail all the other  fraternities and the dorms a bid list and the older people would get five  or six bids for dates and then they   d have two or three bids for stags in it.  As you got to know many, why you got invited by all the different  fraternities and sororities and dormitories. They would invite you to their  dances and you   d invite some of their leaders to your dances. It was a  good opportunity to get acquainted.  Looking back on it, it seems like it was a simple life. (Laughs) It just  didn   t take a lot to make us happy and we were happy with our lot,  whatever it was right there, and we made a lot out of it.  Talking about expenses, it would cost  2.00 for a dozen roses.  (Laughter)  That   s a lot of cab rides.  Yeah, that   s right. Yeah.  22  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  S. Holton  G. Holton  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  Neurohr  F.L. Holton  I think C. A.  Overstreet  told you about the laundry bags we sent home.  It cost you twenty cents.  I don   t know whether he told them or not, but we did send laundry boxes  home.  Okay, they had a pasteboard with a canvas wrapping around it   oh,  about, twelve inches by twenty-four inches and about four inches deep.  You   d put your laundry in that and, for twenty cents, you   d send it home  and your folks would do it and they had a flip card on it. They would  flip the card over and they   d send it back for twenty cents. So it would  cost you forty cents to get your laundry   and, like I said, Mother would  always put some gum or toothpaste or something else in your laundry  bag as it went back and forth.  I remember one time Mother sent me a pecan pie back in my laundry  box.  In your laundry? (Laughter)  I don   t remember whether there was laundry in it or she just did the pie,  but I do remember that I got that pecan pie in the laundry box.  How long did it take to get your laundry back?  Oh, about four or five days.  Five days, yes.  Also they had a laundry agent in the fraternity houses. The Stillwater  Cleaning and Pressing would appoint a student to take care of each dorm  and fraternity house and he got ten percent for sending in the orders and  collecting. I think it was fifteen cents to get a shirt washed and ironed.  Nearly all of our people had extra jobs and would work out or some kind  of student help and it was tough times, but everyone was in the same  boat and they all got along, tolerated everything, or didn   t know any  better. I guess we didn   t know any better at that time.  Did you have live music at most of the dances?  Oh, yeah. We had a twelve-piece band.  So jazz bands would play for the dances?  Oh, yeah. They   d cost fifty dollars to get a twelve-piece band to play  three hours.  23  G. Holton  F.L. Holton  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  Neurohr  S. Holton  F.L. Holton  Neurohr  We had Woody Herman one time     At our junior/senior prom, we had Woody Herman and he was quite  renowned. One of these singers with a local band, college band, left with  Woody Herman   s bands and she followed him out of town. (Laughter)  One fella my senior year and in Genevieve   s junior year, was a drum  major   Jimmy Baker. And he had a dance band. He went on to, after the  war, to California and was around the movies   in the production end,  not in movies. He came back on campus ten or fifteen years ago and  played a lot of the old music that they played. Glenn Miller and the  Dorsey Boys were popular. Each fraternity had a good phonograph with  78 size records on it, and every house had a dance hour, that   s what you  had was canned music, but they had some good bands then.  There was one boy that was a senior in the high school in Muskogee, he  came to in Stillwater to play with the Varsitonians, and the bandleader  lived in our house, Lambda Chi, the Phil Nabors    Band. He later was the  guitarist and went to California and he played after the war and all with  Benny Goodman and some of those   Lyle Hampton and you all don   t  know those names, but those were great musicians at the time. He  played guitar in a trio for them    so they had some good musicians at  that time.  Did you have party pictures? Did anyone come around   was Dr. Pruitt  on campus then   come around and take party pictures?  No, not party pictures   usually someone in each house would take some  party pictures. We had a boy named Fisher, he had him a little dark  room, and he would take pictures of the parties. Then The Redskin had a  real good camera, and that was always a job to get pictures of the  campus at different parties and scenes and but they had a class in  photography at OSU at that time, a college class   an elective one-hour  class.  Well, we appreciate your time with us today, giving insight into your life  at OAMC and OSU.  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  That was great.  -------  -------
