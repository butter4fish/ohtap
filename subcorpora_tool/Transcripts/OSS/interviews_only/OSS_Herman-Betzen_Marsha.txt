 Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  My name is Jerry Gill. Today is June 27, 2009. I   m visiting with Marsha  Herman-Betzen here in the student union on the Oklahoma State  University campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE  Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Marsha, I appreciate you taking time to visit with us today.  This is a special day for the student union. What brings you to  Stillwater?  Absolutely. I was honored when Mitch  Kilcrease  called me and asked  me to join who I consider the real stalwarts of the student union  movement and the college union as far as Winston Shindell and Tom  Keys and, of course, Mitch Kilcrease. Although I was never a director of  this building, I was a department head, and I must say that even after  thirty years, there is a special place in my heart that will always be  occupied by the Oklahoma State Student Union.  Why don   t we go back and get a little history on that, Marsha. Can you  share a little bit about where you grew up and how you got to  Stillwater?  I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico, went to undergraduate school  there and then to the University of Michigan for my master   s degree.  Went back and taught school for a little while in Albuquerque in the  inner city, then went to work on my doctorate at the State University of  New York-Buffalo. During the 1977 snowstorm when there was 200  inches of snow in Buffalo, the Allan Bakke case had just come up. That  is where this young man at Cal-Davis  University of California-Davis   wanted to go to medical school and was turned down because of his age.  The Supreme Court had said that that was illegal and he could go to  medical school. Up until that time, veterinary school was the same way.  Rarely would they ever accept anybody over twenty-six years of age.  As we sat there, my husband was twenty-nine, and it was always a  5  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  dream for him to go to veterinary school. He grew up in West Texas. I  grew up in New Mexico. We wanted to get back close to our families.  There was no veterinary school in New Mexico, and the one in Texas is  at Texas A M which would have done us no good to be close to his  family in Hereford. So, we flipped a coin. We said if it would come up  heads, we   d go to Stillwater, Oklahoma, and establish residency. If it  came up tails, we   d go to Colorado State in Fort Collins. And this is an  honest story. It came up heads, and we loaded up a    56 blue panel truck  and a five-month-old baby, and we headed for Stillwater, Oklahoma.  That   s how we got here.  A great story. It tells you how great decisions are made in life.  (Laughter)  Or wonder if we would make those decisions the same way when we   re  sixty as opposed to when we were twenty-eight.  Can you share about how you got connected with the student union?  Right. So, I had decided to stay home with our daughter. I was supposed  to be writing my doctoral dissertation. Tom Keys always reminds me  that I should stop putting an ABD,    All But Dissertation,    on my vitae  because it   s not a recognized degree, but I am one of those individuals  who never finished their dissertation. But when my daughter was about  three years old, because she was an only child, I really wanted her to  have the experience of being around other children. I started to look for  a job. I noticed in the Stillwater paper there was a job at Oklahoma  State   s student union for a supervisor for reservations. And my  husband   we were establishing residency, and my husband had just  been accepted into the Oklahoma State veterinary med program to  become a veterinarian. So, I applied for the job, and I was interviewed  by Allen Reding, and he said,    Well, you   re very overqualified for this  job. This is an entry-level position.    My father was dying of cancer at  the time, and he was so upset that I had applied for this job that was  going to pay minimum wage when I was supposed to be writing my  dissertation. He never lived to see what happened with this job and what  it had become.  Anyway, I went home, and I said to my husband,    Something is going  on at that building. I don   t know if they   re going to reorganize, but  they   ve asked me to come back and meet with the director. And, you  know, there   s 300 employees in this building, part-time employees. Why  would they have me, the supervisor of reservations, come back for a  second interview and meet with Winston Shindell? I think there   s more  to this job.    And so I came back in the next day and met with Winston.  They brought me up to his office and I was hired. A year and a half later,  6  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  they went through a tremendous reorganization, and I then became the  department head and wound up having a department and learning more  from my five years at the Oklahoma State Student Union that carried  with me and affected how I then ran an organization more than any other  single experience of my life.  What department did you head up?  At that time, I was in charge of meetings and scheduling. At that time,  we did all of the meetings. Of course, the hotel was the Union Hotel, so  we had Oklahoma bankers and professional insurance agents who would  come and do a week program. Then, we did summer conferences, so we  had wrestlers and gymnasts and all of the football camps and basketball  camps. We had the youth, and we   d use the residence halls. We had all  the extension folks who would do the meetings. Then, we would do  events just for the university. At that time, all of the food service went  through the union, so the vet school banquet, because the ballroom was  the largest ballroom, or the president   s reception at the beginning of the  year. We would work with any event that would take place.  One of my favorite events that took place was the Oklahoma Wheat  Commission was trying to sell wheat to Israel. They brought this Israeli  delegation here, and it was hard to find a Jewish person in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. I was the resident Jewish person at the Union, and they said,     What are we going to cook, and what are we going to make?    I  remember working with Bud  inaudible  who was the food service  director. We did the menu, and I ordered an Israeli flag with the  American flag. I made matzah ball soup and arugula and stuffed cabbage  and was right in the back of the kitchen. We had a wonderful experience,  and they signed the wheat deal with Oklahoma State.  That was the tipping point.  I   m sure it was the tipping point. You know they say,    Through your  stomach.     That   s right. Marsha, we didn   t get the dates. So, you came to Stillwater  in what year, now?  We came to Stillwater in 1977, and then I interviewed at the end of    79.  So, actually, I think my first day of work was in    80, January of    80.  Then you stayed there about a year and a half, and in the reorganization  was the department head. Then how long were you a department head?  I was one of two women  who were department heads . Allison  7  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Richardson was head of the accounting department, and myself. I was  here until October of    84. So, my total time   I had worked with  Winston for a couple of years and then with  Tom Keys , so I was here  just right under five years.  What were your first impressions of the OSU Student Union?  Well, they were just going through the big renovation of the food court,  going from a cafeteria to the food court. First of all, I have to tell you,  until I worked here, a union for me was always the facility side of the  house. It was buying your books. It was going bowling. It was buying a  cup of coffee or studying. That   s why you went to the union. I did not,  until I worked here, understand the student development side of the  house. I didn   t understand the student activities portion, the Student  Union Activities Board, how the union became a laboratory of  classroom outside the classroom to really be able to take what you  learned in the classroom and see it to fruition in a practical sense. So, I  really didn   t understand the higher ed student-development side of the  union.  I thought it was an incredible facility. I was struck by what happened in  its surroundings, the diversity that happened. It became the community  center for faculty, for students, for alumni, for staff and for guests of the  institution. It truly was the community center. Of course, when I was  there, the State Room had the very best brunch on Sunday. You couldn   t  go anywhere else for brunch on Sunday or Mother   s Day or other  wonderful holidays, so at the time that we came here, it was not only a  community center for the campus, but, I think, for the community of  Stillwater.  Looking back, from the time you were here, what did you leave knowing  that you didn   t know when you came in?  Oh, so many things. So many life lessons that I tell my young staff  about. Some lessons that I learned because I wanted to emulate what I  saw. Some lessons because I   ve always been the kind of kid that learned  the hard way. They were just lessons that will be with me always  because I didn   t always make the best decision. But I had wonderful  mentors in Tom and Winston who saw a spark of ability or of potential,  and they pushed hard and they gave me opportunities and they made  sure I was truly mentored. You know, a lot of women talk about a lack  of women mentors in positions of a CEO of a company. I remember that  time. You know, the only women on this campus were the dean of the  nursing school or home economics. There weren   t a lot of  women  in  the administration, women staff members, so my generation, most of the  time, were mentored by men. I was mentored by two of the best.  8  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  I think, probably, the most diverse place in Stillwater was this building  because it brought international students and faculty and staff and people  from all over. You wouldn   t  otherwise  have an opportunity to share  and to be with those individuals. You were in your major in the  classroom. You were in with other chemistry students, or you were in  with other nursing students or veterinary students, but when you came  here, then you had this opportunity to work with so many different kinds  of folks. I thought about what it was like for somebody who maybe grew  up in a small town in Oklahoma to all of a sudden be in this kind of  educational environment where you   re open to so many other people and  so many other ways of thinking. So, for me that was very special. If you  would have taken Oklahoma State and especially the student union out  of Oklahoma, I would not   this is a terrible thing to say, but Stillwater  would not have been a place for me. But this community was made so  special by this higher education institution and everything it stood for,  and it was a joy to be a part of it.  You mentioned your mentors. Can you tell me a little bit about strengths  and personalities which you learned about?  They were two very different people.  Why don   t we start with Winston?  Two very different people. Well, now, Winston is kind of like my dad in  the sense that I lost my dad when I was thirty. I   m going to tell you a  story about Winston so you understand the kind of man Winston was. I  guess the first thing about Winston and his style (and I had really had a  short period of time with him) was nobody loves the role of the college  union like Winston. I mean, Winston understands how important that is.  Nobody loves students like Winston. Winston had a wonderful way to  bridge the gap and to be able to bridge the gap between the faculty and  the administration and still let the students grow even when maybe some  of their interests at the time or the ways of dissent were not what the  administration wanted to see. Winston was the perfect person at that  time because he was able to work with both groups of individuals and  bring these students along.  But to give you my favorite story about Winston is one that you   ll  understand what a family we were in this building. I had been there just  a few months, and my father had been diagnosed with colon cancer.  When I interviewed with Winston, I said,    I need to tell you that my  father   s just been diagnosed with cancer, and there will be several  surgeries. I know that I won   t have sick time because I   m just starting,  but I need to go home when I need to go home to Albuquerque. If this is  9  Gill  Herman-Betzen  going to be a problem, I want you to know ahead of time, and if you  decide not to hire me, I understand. But I just felt like before you make  this decision, you need to know this.    He said that he just so appreciated  me saying that and that they would work with me in any way that they  could, and I went home for his surgery. He had had chemotherapy, and I  went home for his surgery. And flowers came. I   d only been working in  the union a month, and flowers came from Winston and the staff wishing  us well through the surgery.  It wasn   t more than five months later that we got a call that my father  was not doing well. Winston was in a meeting, and he couldn   t be  interrupted. I had gotten the call and called my husband at vet school,  and we were going to leave. I was going to run home and get our  daughter, and we were going to try to get to Albuquerque. Winston   s  secretary, Betty, did not feel he could be interrupted at the time, and I  said,    I have to go.    As I was walking down the hallway to the parking  garage, he yelled behind me. He said,    Marsha.    I said,    Winston, I  don   t know when I   m going to be back,    and I   d only worked here four  or five months. And he said,    Whenever you come back, your job will  be waiting.    I would walk on hot coals for Winston Shindell.  I think what people don   t understand about those roles, when you treat  an employee like that, that employee would give you everything back  and then some. I think that   s what I took for my staff. Most people want  to do a good job. The people who are going to mess with you are going  to mess with you no matter how many rules, but I think what I learned  from Winston is that if you hire good people, you do two things. You  treat them the way you want to be treated, and then you get out of their  way and let them do their job. And that trust in an employee was really  important. And then that I wound up in Bloomington, Indiana, with him  was a dream come true. So, he   truly, I would never have found this  profession if it wasn   t for Winston Shindell hiring me.  When Winston first went to Indiana University, you then worked under  Tom Keys.  I did, and we   re talking very different personalities. But I will tell you,  from a technical standpoint, Tom Keys was the best boss I ever had. I   ll  tell you the reasons why. There was never any doubt in my mind what  the expectations were. They were clear. He articulated them, I won   t say  concisely, but he articulated them so that I knew what the expectations  of my job were. I was a crier. I was so passionate. I was thirty years old,  and I was a crier. I wanted to do well. I would occasionally look for the  Kleenex. After several years with Tom, just like a child when they cry,  and it   s manipulative, he would just go into his drawer and throw the  box of Kleenex on the other side. I   d get my crying done, and then we  10  Gill  Herman-Betzen  could move on. I never wanted to disappoint him; I think that   s why I  took it in my heart. I wanted Tom more than anybody in the whole world  to say to me,    You did a great job, Marsha.    I just wanted to hear those  words from Tom Keys.  My degrees were in communication and public speaking and  interpersonal communication, organizational communication. Here I had  this department, and I had to do budgeting and finance, and I just didn   t  understand. I used to cry when my dad would help me with algebra, and  here Tom would just sit with me hours on end during our weekly one on  one and teach me basic accounting. Now that I run an organization that  is several million dollars, and you know I couldn   t have done that and  prepared budgets and cost estimates. That would never have happened  without Tom Keys. I used to get so angry with him because I always  thought he picked on me. I thought he let other people go, but he was  just on my case all the time pushing me and pushing me and pushing me  to be better. It wasn   t until years after I had left that he said,    I knew  what was there, and I wouldn   t have pushed if I knew I couldn   t get to  everything that was there.    And he said,    Some people I had here, I  couldn   t push like that because this was the job they were going to have.  This was the best they can do, but you were not giving me your best.     So, I had a great lesson in situational leadership from Tom Keys.  He held you accountable. He absolutely held you accountable. He taught  me to take responsibility for my actions, for less trouble you get into if  you say,    I did it. I made a mistake. I apologize. It won   t happen again.     Now, I was lucky, even though I learned the hard way. I was lucky that I  never made the same mistake twice. I just every day made a new  mistake, (Laughter) so I don   t know if Tom would say that was a lucky  time. With Winston, there were many more life lessons that we can talk  about later on because then he was at Indiana University, but for Tom,  the main major part of me working here, he was my direct supervisor.  So, what I learned in those one-on-one meetings with him was  extraordinary.  You must have learned a lot, because from here you went to   can you  share your career then?  While I was at Oklahoma State,  our union  was a member of the  Association of College Unions International. It was a higher-ed  association professionally for folks who worked in the college union. It  had been around since 1914, one of the oldest non-profit associations for  people in higher education, student affairs, college unions. So, we got all  their materials; we went to their annual meeting. I was fortunate. I  applied, with Tom   s guidance, to be on a conference program committee  as a volunteer from Oklahoma State. I was selected out of a hundred  11  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  people around the country to do this. I remember Tom and I were flying  home from the homestead where the annual conference was, and he said,     Marsha, what are your career goals? What would you like to do?    And  I said,    I would love to work for the association some day.    That was in  March, and in July the director of Educational Programs and Services  became available. My husband was done with veterinary school and was  teaching anatomy at the vet school and working on a post-doc, and I  always thought this is where we would be. But this was just an  incredible opportunity for me, so they flew me there for the interview.  They flew my husband with me. I went there the following October with  my husband and daughter. My daughter went with me, and my husband  stayed here until the following May to finish up his commitments and  his post-doc work.  October of what year, now?  October of    84. The end of October    84. So, I was the education director  of this international association. My job was to do all the educational  programming, to find the places for our conferences, to do the site  selections and to work on the educational programming. What was so  fascinating was that it was just after I got there that Tom Keys became  the vice president of Educational Programs and Services, and I was his  program advisor. So, there we were, working together again. And you  know the six degrees of separation?  Can I give you one lesson that Winston told me because it turned out to  be right? Winston has always said,    You know what? The organization  is always bigger than the person, so when you leave, you leave because  this is an opportunity for you or this is the time that you want to go for  other reasons. But don   t ever leave to punish the organization because  the most you can do is inconvenience them for a very short period of  time.    He also said,    Never ever burn your bridges.    Now, I had a  wonderful experience. It wasn   t perfect, like any job, but I always  remember what Winston said. And sure enough, I wound up in  Bloomington, Indiana, as the director of Educational Programs. Winston  was the director at Indiana University in Bloomington, and Tom was the  new vice president of the association, and I would work with him  directly.  So, the association is located in Indiana?  The association had started from 1914-1968; the association had been  run by all volunteers. In fact, Abe Hesser had been a president of ACUI  years and years and years ago. So, Oklahoma State had been very, very  active in the association. Then in 1968, they had their first executive  director and staff, and they were at Stanford until 1981. In 1981, they  12  moved to Indiana University when they hired a new director who had  been the union director at K ansas  State and then at Indiana before  Winston, Dick Blackburn. Dick then became the executive director of  ACUI, and he didn   t want to move. He loved Indiana basketball and  Bobby Knight, and he just didn   t want to move. And he put out a  proposal where the association became an external agency of Indiana  University. In other words, it was such a great deal. We could be in a  university building. Us and the Kinsey Institute, they were the other  external agency of Indiana University.  For Indiana University it was really important because Indiana  University is one of the founding schools for the association. There were  seven colleges and universities, and, of course for the association, it was  a terrific experience and great to be affiliated with Indiana University. I  became the educational director and worked with Dick. Then it was the  thirty-fifth anniversary of the Oklahoma State Student Union, and who  did they invite to come back and sit at the center table with Dr. Beer and  Dr. Bogart and to say a few words on behalf of the association? I got to  do that. So, here I was as the supervisor of reservations; I was coming  back now as the education director of the association.  Then my boss, Dick Blackburn, passed away. They hired another  gentleman who only wound up a year, and I flew back to talk to Tom.  We were doing a video tape, and I really wanted to apply for executive  director, but I did not fit the mold. I had never been a director of a union.  I was not ten years away from retirement. I had only worked in a college  union for five years and then with the association for ten, and  there   never had been a female. I came back, and I knew if anybody   Winston  really was my mentor. I think by this time, Winston   our families had  become very dear friends. Maybe I   m mistaken, but I think he was a  little bit ego-involved in me as somebody he had hired and brought  along and even was getting to this position. Although, Winston can be  tough with  you  as only a dear friend and mentor can be, but I knew  Tom would tell me straight up whether he thought I was capable of  running this organization. And not only did he say   he actually  interviewed me, basically. He asked me a lot of very poignant questions,  and I was able to articulate, I guess, the answers because both Tom and  Winston served as references for me to become the executive director.  And this part, because we   re doing this on tape and I can say it because  it   s so many years later, I found out how close it had been. The president  of the organization broke the tie, and that   s how I became the executive  director. Although, now I am the longest-running executive director by  many years. I   ve been the executive director for fifteen years (knocks on  wood) and if   because I report to a new board every year, my boss  changes every year. So, I   ve learned how to adapt, and hopefully we   re  13  Gill  Herman-Betzen  going to be celebrating our 100th anniversary in 2014, and then I   ll retire.  But if it hadn   t been for Winston and Tom and this building, I would  have never found this profession.  How important was your experience here, and how well did it prepare  you for your national position?  First of all, I think because I was in event planning and because I worked  with everyone from students to bankers to the president   s office to the  Board of Regents. There were functions including the Miss Cinderella  Contest, which I almost got killed for. I signed a little beauty contest.  There were little four-year-olds singing songs from Annie and tapping  up and down the hallways. I was just trying to make money, but Tom  said,    We   ve got to stop with the children   s beauty pageants, Marsha.    I  said,    It   s a market, Tom. It   s Oklahoma. They go right to the Miss  America pageant.    But in so many countless ways, I learned how to be a  supervisor of staff. I learned how to be able to effectively work with  individuals even if it meant sometimes I wasn   t going to be loved which  had always been important, and Tom worried about me because I  wanted to be loved. I learned to be meticulous in planning because if  you did not plan, you had a Greek wedding on top of the president   s  reception because we had no computers. We had these big books. If you  did not draw the setup right, we are going to mess up and not going to  bring return business back to the union.  So, I got to meet with the customer and really work on my listening  skills to find out what the customer wanted, how to finesse some of the  things so that maybe if I knew it wouldn   t work, how to gently move  them to a different decision, how to follow it up. I think one of my few  regrets is that I had a young family. But, you know, events happened on  nights and weekends, so I lived here. I think at that time I missed a lot  of   and I hear women my age say that a lot. That   s the only regret I  have of this. I learned accounting.  My favorite story of Tom   I wanted to build my department. I just said  we need more people in order to do an effective job. Tom would always  tell a little folksy story. After he would be done telling the folksy story,  we   d have a lesson that we learned from that folksy story. So, the folksy  story was about a grocery store. He said,    Mom and Pop are going to  open this grocery store. They are not going to go out and hire a butcher,  and they   re not going to hire a produce man, and they   re not going to  hire   they   re going to do everything themselves. And then as the  revenue starts to build, then they   ll go out and hire a produce man,     which then I usually turn and say,    I   m not getting anybody to help me,  right?    (Laughter) But that was the folksy story instead of Tom saying,     No, you   re not getting anybody else to help you.     14  Gill  Just the events we had here. I remember this was the only escalator in  town, so we would bring kindergarteners and first graders into the  building. We   d give them cookies and milk and let them ride the  escalators so they would have this opportunity. That   s because my  daughter was a young student. So, we would have them here. I  remember Jimmy Johnson was here as the football coach, and we would  do the lunch or brunch before they would go into the Oklahoma Room.  Then, they would stay in the hotel at night before a home game. They   d  go up. We   d have to turn the elevators off, and they would go up. The  experiences that I had here were amazing. And we would have banquets.  We would have events for 1,000 people. Here I was planning those  events for 1,000 people. When people don   t understand event planning,  you can have the greatest program in the world, but if there is not  enough air conditioning and if there isn   t cream on the table or if the  room isn   t set up, it affects how that presentation  is perceived .  By doing that, I think I also learned I didn   t have to be front and center  stage. I got a tremendous amount of satisfaction watching the event take  place and be successful, and then quietly I might get a letter from a  department head or the head of the vet school or the president or the vice  president saying,    Boy, Marsha, you were great in getting that event  out.    But they were applauded at the event, and that was okay. There  was a good feeling inside of me that the event went well.  Both Winston and, I think, Abe Hesser did this from the stories I hear. I  think Winston and Tom were able to build a team that we were like a  family. And that doesn   t mean we couldn   t fuss at each other just like  everybody can fuss at each other because you work many hours, but  anybody would have given everybody else the shirt off their back.  Sometimes when students weren   t here, we would get all-calls. That was  my favorite time. The students weren   t there, and we would have a big  banquet or a big conference or turf builders with tractors that would  come into the building with these big tractors down the hall. And they   d  have an all-call. We   d be in the kitchen; we   d get the stick out. First  we   d be helping the setup crew set up tables and doing a turn around.  We   d get this stick out. I understand Abe Hesser invented the stick. But  Allen Reding is the one that taught me about the stick, and that   s what  you would put in between the tables so the ballroom was very uniform  when you looked at it. Who has the stick? It was engraved; people  would sign the stick. People didn   t realize that that stick was really  important in the ballroom. But every event that I had and the experiences  that I had and the camaraderie that was felt really made me the kind of  boss that I became when I had that opportunity.  Marsha, maybe generalizing a bit, maybe moving up to 30,000 feet, I   m  15  Herman-Betzen  going to ask a personal question: what you felt the mission of a  university student union should be. Then I   m going to ask you about  OSU and how it matches up.  For me, the role of the college union is incredibly important, and that is  that it is a place where all people can come together and be safe and  have a diversity of opinion and be able to argue that diversity in these  walls. I mean, when you look back at college unions, they started from  debating societies at Oxford and Cambridge. That   s how a college union   started . It wasn   t until later that we started talking about the  convenience and amenities of the university family that are also found in  a college union. But I think that if you talked to young people who have  been very involved in student activities in bringing speakers to a campus  and running a budget, in planning an event, of being a president of a  sorority, fraternity, Panhellenic, a student organization, their lessons for  life are profound. They take what they   ve learned in the classroom, and  they truly become well rounded individuals.  The word    union,    when you think of it, it   s not an accidental term. I  don   t like the term    university center.    There are many centers. There   s  the medical center and the athletic center. There   s a shopping center.  And what makes a shopping center very different from the union is the  intentionality of why we do what we do. There was a gentleman who  was a union director at the University of Florida. His name was Bill  Ryan. I know many of us in the profession really looked up to Bill Ryan.  But he said the reason we sell hotdogs is so we can hang art, and that   s a  very different reason than why they sell hotdogs at the shopping mall.  For the college unions, there   s about 100 of them that have alcohol,  mostly in some of the Catholic colleges. But when they have pubs where  you can serve beer and wine, and I   m thinking of the University of  Wisconsin, what you have there is a safe place on campus where alcohol  is a means for social interactions, not the end-all.  I remember it when I was at the University of Michigan because the  laws changed. They closed the pub at the union at the University of  Michigan. I remember a lot of the women leaders coming up to the  director and saying,    You just took away our safe place,    because the  intentionality of what happens in this building is extraordinary. It   s not  by chance. It   s not a shopping mall. For me, the union is the community  center of the campus. It is the complementary piece to the education, and  without it, I think your education is not as full and as vibrant and as  experiential if you don   t have your involvement in student activities.  Years ago they did this study. AT T, Bell Labs was the subsidiary, or  AT T was a subsidiary of Bell Labs. They wanted to find out what  were the qualities, the best predictors of future success in Bell Labs.  16  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  They went to get the best engineers at all the schools  to discover  what  was the very best predictor of future success in Bell Labs, and you know  what they found out the number-one predictor was? Besides major,  involvement in student activities. And, so, I remember Time magazine  many years ago in the    60s called it    the party place    because there were  balloons and gummy bears, and you sold t-shirts and key chains. But I  bet if you talk about where a lot of memories happen for students on  campus, it was in the union. I   ve heard people talk about meeting their  wife at a dance in the union. It just was the place to go and to be, and  I   m just very proud I had that opportunity to be at one of the best.  Students being the primary stakeholders at the student union, who else  does the union serve?  They serve the students, certainly, but they serve faculty and staff and  alumni and guests of the institution. And that   s what really makes it a  community center. That   s what makes it a union because it is not just the  chemistry department. It   s such a diverse group of people meeting in this  building, and you don   t have that opportunity. I know across campuses  now you   re getting a lot of mini unions. You know, the business school  wants to have their coffee cart, and that   s great, and meeting rooms and  bring speakers in, but you   re with business students. But when you come  to the union on a campus like the Oklahoma State Student Union, that  might be your opportunity. It might be the place where the business  student gets to go to an art program, or it might be where they get to go  to a theater production, or it might be where they work hand in hand  with somebody that they never would have had the opportunity to meet.  They might go to an international festival and try food from a country  that they never would have been able to do that. So, while I think those  amenities and services and convenience are great all over campus, I  think that it will not take the place of that union where all folks can  come and have a community experience.  Marsha, how well does OSU fulfill that mission? Or, let me back up first  and ask. You probably have a unique position to look at student unions  across the country. How   not rank. I   m not talking about ranking.  Thank you, because I probably wouldn   t have my job until 2014.  But what kind of reputation does Oklahoma State University have  nationally?  Well, I think it   s kind of a hidden charm. I don   t think people realize  what a gem it is. I think people do know, certainly people know in the  Big XII and the Big 10 and the PAC 10. Those are our largest  institutions in those conferences. Certainly we get together every five  17  Gill  Herman-Betzen  years as all of the groups. So many folks have visited Oklahoma State.  Personally, I have been to all but Alaska in the United States, so I have  been to forty-nine states and visited student unions on campuses all over.  I   ve been to many cities in Canada. I   ve been asked to speak in  Edinburgh, Scotland, and have seen a lot of unions in Ireland and  England. I   ve been to the island of Tasmania. Saw a university and a  student union in Melbourne and Sydney. I   ve been to Puerto Rico. So, I  have had wonderful experiences of seeing many college unions, but I  can   t think of one that is as comprehensive as this college union is, or at  least was in my time.  It had the bookstore; it had the Union Hotel. It had a wonderful food  service; it had conferences and scheduling. It had all of the shops  downstairs, from the drug store to the candy shop to the jewelry store to  the clothing store to the post office. It had a great theater for films and  movies. It had a bowling alley, and it had classes for bowling for years  and years. Had a parking garage. It served great food and in many  different ways, and it had offices at the time for the Foundation, for  Alumni Affairs. The people who would interview people for the  corporations would come back and interview folks here. It really became  the gateway to the campus. Then, put in the most comprehensive student  activities reports through the union, so all the clubs and organizations,  probably 600 clubs and organizations work through Student Activities  and Panhellenic and IFC  Interfraternity Council  and Student Union  Activities Board. It brings all the speakers and the concerts to the  campus. So, I don   t know of a more comprehensive union. While there  will always be arguments about which is the largest, this union is one of  the largest college unions in the world, and, I can say, the most  comprehensive.  Marsha, we talked a little about where Oklahoma State Student Union  has been, where it currently is and where it   s going, but what do you see  as the emerging issues in student unions in the future? And how are  student unions changing? How will the student union of the future be  different?  Well, there are so many ways for young people to develop community. I  think that the social media and how community is developed is going to  be continually on the rise, but that makes it even more essential for us to  have a place to bring people together. At sixty, I   m on Facebook, and  I   ve learned how to Tweet. I don   t quite know why I do that yet, but I  Tweet just so that I can say I have a Twitter account and I   m on  Facebook at sixty. Social media is wonderful. It has allowed me to  connect with people that I haven   t talked to in forty years. It gives me a  new way to share pictures of my grandchild with friends, and it   s  terrific. But I think as technology increases, it becomes even more  18  Gill  Herman-Betzen  important for that contact we have with each other. It will never be  replaced. I will send Mitch an email. I will send Tom an email every  once in a while, but sitting in that room together with individuals, people  I worked with thirty years ago, and we walk in today and we start talking  like   we spend this much time talking about what happened in the old  days, and we start just now. I think that   s really important.  There was a gentleman named Ernie Boyer who worked for the Carnegie  Commission. He talked about how you build communities. One of the  things he talks about is how important the building is. Now, in the role  of the college union, you say it   s not just a building. It   s a program. But  the building, that   s where the artifacts are. That   s where we hang the  pictures. That   s where our history is of what happens within these walls.  I think these are not going to be monuments to a time gone by. I think it  will change on what kinds of programs and services we have in the  building. I think our tastes will change, so we   ll constantly have to  move. I   m sure the next iteration of food service will have sushi  somewhere in the building. Those things will constantly change, but I  think the core values of what a college union is will remain for some  time. I think it   s our legacy to make sure even in tough times that it  remains.  How close in your opinion has OSU stayed to those core values in our  student union program?  Well, I think that certainly on paper, we are   I think when times get  tough, people look   it   s an auxiliary, and so it   s not getting (except  probably the student activities, if it was like it was a long time ago) any  kind of state money, and that state money is diminishing year after year  after year. So, you   re forcing the union to pay its own way. As you force  the union to pay its own way, it   s very easy to steer clear or steer away  from some of those core values. That has to be really important. So, it   s  a balancing act of how you support yourself and still maintain those core  values. You know, the bookstore, you take the bookstore out of  Oklahoma State and it   s going to be tough. Now the hotel is over the  Atherton and hotel and restaurant. Food Service, it used to be in-house  food service, and now it   s food service companies. It   s difficult to make  the bottom line on food service when your community leaves. When I  first came here, there wasn   t all the places you could eat right across  from the campus. Well, how can you be competitive when you have  university employees with the folks who are working at the other places?  I think it   s always going to be a juggling act.  I think the core values   I think we have to constantly tell our story. I  don   t think all administrations understand the core values. I think they  look at it as a service center. They look at it as    This is where I buy my  19  Gill  Herman-Betzen  Gill  Herman-Betzen  books. This is where I get my coffee.    They don   t understand the  educational value, and that   s our fault. We have to work harder at  making sure the mission of the college union is understood by telling the  story. Years ago we did terrible things. We said,    Oh, you can   t have a  class in the union.    Well, now, wouldn   t it be wonderful if we could  bring a professor, and jointly with the students we could bring in a  renowned speaker and find the ways we could connect the faculty with  the students and the staff in the union in some combined programming  in ways that would be just profound for both the student and the faculty  in a setting that is outside of the classroom.  You   ve been pretty thorough, Marsha. I appreciate you sharing your  thoughts. Is there any final comments you   d make about Oklahoma State  Student Union or student unions generally that we didn   t cover?  You know, for a very short period of time, for being here five years, the  profound effect the Oklahoma State Student Union has had on me, and I  do not take this lightly. I come back every time I   ve been invited. I came  back for the fiftieth anniversary. I came back for Tom   s retirement. I  came back this time. It will always occupy a very special, special place  in my heart. For me, this is the benchmark. This is the epitome of what a  college union should be. I hope that this building will stand for a long  time on those core values even as it reinvents itself over and over and  over again to remain vital to the campus community.  Thank you, Marsha. I appreciate it very much.  Thank you.  -------  -------
