 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Friday, July 24, 2015, and we   re in Welch, Oklahoma,  Craig County, Oklahoma, for our Cowboys in Every County oral history  project, visiting with K. C. Walker. K. C., thank you for joining us.  Walker Thank you very much for the opportunity.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s begin by learning a little more about you. Could you tell us the year  you were born and where you were born?  Walker I was born in 1986 in Chicago, Illinois.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your parents.  Walker My mother is Gaye Anne Higbee and she and my father both, Russell  Higbee, are from Pueblo, Colorado, not born but raised there. My mother is  a registered nurse, and she   s been working in the NICU, neonatal intensive  care unit, or labor and delivery unit, depending on where she   s living. Then  my father is Russell, and he has a multitude of degrees, the latest being his  DVM  Doctor of Veterinary Medicine , which he got at Oklahoma State,  which is how we ended up there in Stillwater.  Nykolaiszyn Eventually, your family moved to Oklahoma?  Walker Yes, when I was six in 1992.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about where your family ended up settling in Oklahoma.  Walker We settled in Stillwater, and I was six or seven when we moved there. We  lived on the southwest side of town and lived in Stillwater. We went through  all of our schooling there.  Nykolaiszyn Talk me through the schools you attended as a young girl.  5  Walker I went to Sangre Elementary, and I was close enough to ride my bike or  walk if I wanted to. Then I went to the middle school and then the junior  high and then the high school.  Nykolaiszyn Activities you were involved with during your schooling?  Walker I briefly dabbled in music, and then I was a cheerleader for a while. I did  soccer and dance.  Nykolaiszyn Kind of describe to me the environment in Stillwater in the    80s,    90s.  Walker Well, I wasn   t there in the    80s. We got there in    92. In the    90s, I mean, it  was just a peaceful, quiet town. You know, just small town, but big enough  where I could go grocery shopping in the same town I lived in, which is  different than here. It   s taking some getting used to. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Did you always think about attending college?  Walker That   s how I was raised.    You   re going to go to college.    My mom went to  college. My dad went to college. My brother went to college. That was just a  role that I needed to fulfill.  Nykolaiszyn As you were growing up, did you have any experiences at Oklahoma State  prior to enrolling?  Walker Oh yes. We went to sporting events. We did the Walkaround. We did the  Lights on Stillwater. We did all that, the Homecoming week and all that  stuff. My dad went to the vet school, so I learned to drive a car, drive a  stick-shift, at the vet school parking lot, just driving around in circles.  Nykolaiszyn (Laughs) Did you have a favorite place on campus you liked to hang out?  Walker Theta Pond was always nice to walk around and feed the ducks when I was  little, but mostly if I was going to the campus it was going to the vet  hospital. That   s where I remember walking around a lot.  Nykolaiszyn Did your father practice in town?  Walker No. He did more research after he graduated. He worked for OSU, and then  he started practicing in Claremore.  Nykolaiszyn Talk to me about your path to OSU and thinking about attending and why  OSU.  6  Walker Honestly, it just seemed easy. I mean, there was a period when I was in high  school I wasn   t really thinking about my future at all. I was having fun. I did  the Gateway Program from NOC (Northern Oklahoma College) and then  went over to OSU. It was easy, and it was there. I liked the security of being  close.  Nykolaiszyn You have an older brother?  Walker Yes, ma   am.  Nykolaiszyn Did he also attend OSU?  Walker Briefly, and then he joined the military. He joined the Air Force. Then they  didn   t need pilots, so he joined the Army. That   s what he did.  Nykolaiszyn You attended starting in what year? Your freshman year was in...?  Walker Two thousand five was my freshman year, 2005.  Nykolaiszyn Did you live on campus or at home?  Walker At home, and then off-campus but not at home. I got an apartment.  Nykolaiszyn At that point, did you have an idea of what your major was going to be?  Walker Always. It was going to be psychology from the beginning.  Nykolaiszyn The reasoning behind psychology? Did you just really like that area?  Walker I really liked it. I had a professor who inspired me, Dr. Jeremy Cook. He   s  fantastic. I took all of his classes even if I didn   t need them. That, and I  figured I was kind of crazy, so learning a little bit about that. Then I just fell  in love with it, and I was like,    This is what I want to do. I want to help  people.     Nykolaiszyn Kind of talk to me about some of your favorite classes. You mentioned  Jeremy Cook. Any other professors that really stick out in your mind?  Walker That was so long ago. Oh my gosh. Well, Dr. Abramson, he   s pretty  intimidating     Nykolaiszyn Yes. (Laughs)  Walker    but really enjoyed his class. I only braved through one of them. I wish I  would   ve done more. Then Dr. Byrd-Craven, she   s fantastic. She   s fantastic.  7  Nykolaiszyn Were you involved in any on-campus activities?  Walker Yes. I was in OSU Psych Club for a couple years, and then 2009, I was an  officer. I was the Homecoming Chair for the OSU Psych Club. Then I was  also active in Eco-OSU. We did Earth Day fests and things like that and did  the OSU parade on scooters and bicycles and stuff, teaching people how to  recycle.  Nykolaiszyn What was the environment on campus while you were a student? What was  it like?  Walker I would have to say it wasn   t hard. It was pretty easy. I mean, I never felt  like it was too big and overwhelming. I mean, a ten-minute walk from class  to class. I mean, it was big, but it didn   t feel overwhelming at all. I   m kind  of extraverted. Maybe that   s part of it, but I liked it. It was nice. I felt like  the professors really cared about me and what I needed to succeed. It was a  good experience. That   s for sure.  Nykolaiszyn Any campus traditions that come to mind?  Walker Homecoming. We have the best Homecoming in the world.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me about Homecoming.  Walker A lot of partying. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Yeah  That   s part of it   Walker It   s part of it. There   s a lot of people at the Walkaround. I didn   t usually  brave the Walkaround, because even though I   m extraverted, that many  people was kind of overwhelming. It was fun. It was a lot of fun. Then, I  mean, the Homecoming parade. I love football, so everything that has to do  with football. Gundyville is pretty fantastic. I never did Gundyville because  I always had a job and I had to go to work or class, but I know people that  camped out for days. I don   t know. It was fun.  Nykolaiszyn You mentioned you worked. Tell me a little bit about your job.  Walker I worked at Albertson   s, which is now called Food Pyramid, and I worked  there for about five years through the end of my high school, through my  third or fourth year in college. I was a super senior, you know. Took me a  little extra time to get that degree. That   s good stuff. (Laughter) I worked at  Albertson   s. I was a cashier. I worked in the customer service department. I  worked in the floral department. Worked in the bakery, the deli. I stocked  shelves. I did a lot of stuff. It was fun. That was a great family of people to  be a part of. It was good.  8  Nykolaiszyn Not the meat department. (Laughs)  Walker I mean, I stocked, but I know a guy who cut his thumb off there. Not really  my thing. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Do you have a place on campus that is kind of your favorite spot?  Walker Out of all of the, I mean, North Murray was like my home for a while. It   s  kind of a creepy home. It   s a little old, but as a building, I would say that  maybe that would be one. Then I liked to study up in HES West over there  on the walkway, on the skywalk. I liked studying up there. It was nice and  peaceful. Then somewhere on the library lawn, usually. I liked being  outside.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me about dating in college. What was that like for you?  Walker I never dated a guy in college. If I had a serious boyfriend, it was not with  someone that I was in classes with. I made good friends. I mean, I don   t how  much you want me to tell you. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn What would you do for a typical date while you were a student?  Walker Beer pong. Beer pong was always good.  Nykolaiszyn Where would you play?  Walker At friends    houses near campus, usually. You know when they had all those  old houses before they expanded the athletic department?  Nykolaiszyn Yes.  Walker A bunch of those houses. We   d hang out there. That was fun. We   d watch  scary movies, get drunk, do stupid things.  Nykolaiszyn The typical college experience.  Walker The typical college experience. It was fantastic. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Were there popular places off campus?  Walker Shortcakes. The guy I dated worked at Shortcakes. That   s where you go  after you go to the bars, so makes sense. Then I studied at Panera Bread a  lot. I don   t know if that   s popular or not, but that   s where I studied. I don   t  know. I spent a lot of time at Shortcakes.  9  Nykolaiszyn Did you spend much time on the Strip?  Walker Not terribly much. I didn   t really like the whole drinking and driving, and  nobody ever wanted to be a sober driver. I tended to just drink where I was  staying. It made it safer.  Nykolaiszyn Sure.  Walker You know, I never got a DUI, so that   s good.  Nykolaiszyn That   s very good. (Laughter) While you were in college, did your parents  continue to live in Stillwater?  Walker My parents divorced when I was twelve or thirteen. When I graduated high  school in 2004, my dad moved to Florida. My mom stayed in Stillwater until  2013, and then she moved to Arizona. She was around through college.  Nykolaiszyn Did you go home and see your parents much?  Walker I mostly lived at home. There was just a brief period of time towards the end  of college that I wasn   t living at home.  Nykolaiszyn You always had that good family connection for the most part, right? Got it.  Walker Yes. It   s definitely good now. Back then, it was a little strained.  Nykolaiszyn As you   re studying and you   re working your way through the psychology  program, did you have any idea of what you wanted to do when you  graduated?  Walker Ideally, I wanted to be a therapist or something of the sort, something in the  mental health field, but after I graduated, I kind of took a different route for  a while.  Nykolaiszyn When graduation day came around, and it was in   .  Walker In 2011. There was a brief period   my husband got reattached to a National  Guard unit. He was inactive. He served four years in the military before I  met him. Then we met, and we were dating. He got a letter stating that he  was going to deploy to Iraq, and that was in 2007, very end of 2007. We had  a month, and we were already engaged. We just went ahead and got married.  Had a week together before he deployed or got stationed somewhere else  then deployed. During that year that he was gone, I kind of struggled in  school. I dropped a few classes and kind of got behind. It took a while.  That   s why from 2005 to 2011. It took a little bit of extra time.  10  Nykolaiszyn How   d you meet your husband?  Walker At a party, (laughs) at a friend   s house, through a mutual friend. She   s pretty  fantastic, and we worked together. We met and bonded over a website,  talking about a website, and a pack of cigarettes, of course, because that   s  what you do when you   re in college. You smoke cigarettes. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Was he also attending school there?  Walker Not at that point in time, no. He did after or   was it before or after he  deployed? I think it was   I don   t remember. I think it was after he got back.  I could be lying to you. I think it was before he deployed. There was a brief  period of time when we were, I don   t either remember dating or married,  where he was attending OSU for a hotel and restaurant administration  degree. He never finished, as of right now. That doesn   t mean he won   t go  back and finish. It just means that we had babies and things. That   s what it  was  We were married  We were married, and it was after he got back. He  was attending college. He did a full year before we had our first child, and  then he went to work fulltime so I could finish because I was closer to  finishing.  Nykolaiszyn Talk to me about graduation day. What was that like?  Walker A blur of a lot of people. It was pretty awesome because a lot of people  didn   t think, whoa, that I   d make it to eighteen, let alone graduate college. It  was pretty cool to prove a lot of people wrong, and there was a lot of pomp  and circumstance. You know, you have the party. You have the food and the  whole shebang. It was nice. It was pretty exciting. I sat next to a girl that I  know who still works at OSU now, so that   s cool.  Nykolaiszyn You mentioned that a lot of people did not think you   d make it to eighteen.  Walker Oh, oh yeah. I was kind of a hellion. (Laughter) We   ll go with that.  Nykolaiszyn Okay. Good. After graduation in 2011, kind of take me through your work  career.  Walker Right before I graduated, about a year before I graduated, I started working  at Cockrell Eyecare Center. I worked there through and after graduation. I  got into nursing school because at that point, I decided that I wanted to kind  of follow my mom   s footsteps and become a labor and delivery nurse. Got  into nursing school, but I spent a lot of money from my student loans on my  bachelor   s degree. I didn   t have enough money to fulfill that because it was  at the same level. If I were to get a master   s, I would have student loan  money for that, but not for a bachelor   s or associate   s degree, which is what  11  the RN program at NOC is. I didn   t actually get to do that, so I stayed  working at Cockrell Eyecare Center.  I was a certified paraoptometric, and I worked with the doctors. I would take  back patients and teach people how to put in contacts and touch people   s  eyeballs all the time. I got pretty good at it and pretty used to touching  things that I wasn   t quite comfortable with at first. It was a good experience.  I learned a lot. I learned a lot about medical records. I learned a lot about  HIPPA, a lot of legal things that I hadn   t learned before. Learned a lot about  customer service. It was a hard time in my life because I was like,    I want to  graduate. I want to get a job in the mental health field, or I want to become a  nurse.    Then I wasn   t a nurse.  It was kind of rocky period, and I was a new mom. I learned a lot. It was a  good life lesson. I was there until 2012, and I left there to have my second  child and stay home. Then I stayed home for a little bit and worked with  newborn and infants at my church daycare. I was the director of before and  after school care at the First Methodist Church. I did that for a while. Found  out that I like kids a lot one-on-one. Not really a huge fan of fifteen of them  at a time. We all have our strengths, and that was not one of mine. That   s  okay. I loved the ECC (Early Childhood Center). Fantastic group of women  who take care of and alloparent your children.  It   s fantastic. I loved that my kids were there. My husband also worked there  at the time. He was the director of food service there. He worked downstairs.  My kids are upstairs. I worked across the street. It was really nice. My tiny  human was in a little baby carrier right here, so I got to chase little kids  around with her right here. It was nice. I did that until she was about nine  months old, I think. No, she was about a year. She was about a year old  whenever I left there. Then I worked at Stillwater Medical Center as a  receptionist for an offsite doctor   s office, and that was until October of last  year, 2014. Then I got a job up here.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about what you   re doing today.  Walker Right now, I am called a Care Coordinator, and I   m a certified case  manager, level two, for the state of Oklahoma. That means I am able to do  case management and rehab services. I work in the children   s department, so  I help kids with a little extra need. They need a little extra support. It just  depends on whether they may have had a bad home life or a traumatic  experience. Any number of things could   ve happened for them to be able to  get into our services. I work at Grand Lake Mental Health, and I   ve been  there since April. It   s a fantastic place to work. It   s a great place to work.  Nykolaiszyn Are you doing what you enjoy doing?  12  Walker Oh yes  I finally found a place that takes all my quirkiness, and it   s actually  a positive. I   m able to use all of my strengths, which haven   t always been  looked at as strengths. I   m able to fill a need, which is fantastic, and they  obviously like me. I   m Grand Lake Mental Health   s July employee of the  month for Craig County.  Nykolaiszyn Congratulations   Walker Thank you. Yeah, I was pretty excited about that since I   ve only been there  since April. Yeah, I work with a great team of people, and we are changing  the world one little bit at a time. That   s fantastic.  Nykolaiszyn You moved from Stillwater, Oklahoma, to Welch, Oklahoma. Talk to me  about Welch.  Walker Well, it   s tiny town, USA. It   s a sweet little community. I   m learning to love  it. It   s taken a little bit of time. It   s got a population of 623 people, after we  became residents. However, I haven   t seen more than two hundred people  ever together at one time, so I don   t really believe the number. I don   t know.  It   s very small. It   s a little farming community. My husband   s family   s from  here. This is where he graduated. I   m making some pretty great friends here,  and I   ve got great family. I   ve got great in-laws here. I   m getting used to the  trains, and I   m getting used to having to get groceries in a different town.  That   s okay. It takes a lot of adaptation, but that   s good. Change is good.  Nykolaiszyn When you go to town, what town do you go to?  Walker I work in Vinita, which is about seventeen miles away from here, and they  have a grocery store there. They have two. They have a Wal-Mart and a  different grocery store. I can just pick up groceries on the way home, or  we   ve got Miami, which is about ten miles to the east. I am about ten miles  from Kansas and twenty miles from Missouri, so that can kind of give you a  frame of reference of where we are in the state. I used to work in Joplin.  When we moved up here, I worked in Joplin. I worked for Ozark Center,  which, I was doing a very, very similar job that I am here. I worked in a  children   s department. I was a case manager. I had a clientele that I would  work with one-on-one. Vinita   s a lot closer and it   s in my same state, so  that   s where I went when they offered me the job. Yeah. It   s good stuff.  Nykolaiszyn Have you ran into many OSU grads or OSU folks who attended OSU in  Craig County?  Walker Actually, I work alongside one of the guys I went to college with. That   s  pretty cool. He did his undergrad at OSU, and we did it at the same time.  We did our psych degrees at the same time. He   s three offices down from  me, so that   s pretty cool.  13  Nykolaiszyn That   s good.  Walker Yeah, and then there   s a few. There   s a whole lot of Sooner fans up here, so  got to put that orange up everywhere. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn You   re a second generation OSU grad.  Walker Yes, I am a second generation OSU grad, and my kids will be a third.  Nykolaiszyn There we go  How do you show your OSU pride?  Walker Well, on my name badge, I have an OSU little pin right there, and then on  my car. I   m wearing OSU stuff all the time. I have a bright orange OSU  chair. My whole office is OSU. I have some friends from church who are  big Sooner fans, and they   re like,    You need to get rid of that.    I say,    I   m a  second generation. You ain   t getting rid of it. They   re graduating there, too,  so you   re good.    (Laughter) My husband, he just, OSU every day, every day  of his life.  Nykolaiszyn That   s great. How do you try to remain connected to the university, or do  you?  Walker Through Facebook a lot. We still have friends that work at the college, are  professors or staff, or through Facebook. (Laughs) I lived there for twenty-three  or four years, twenty-three years. I have a huge village down there, so  I keep in contact with them a lot.  Nykolaiszyn Do you make it down to Stillwater?  Walker We did more frequently up until we sold our house there in February. We   ve  made it back once since then. I want to get back there. I miss it there. I want  to go and see my friends. We   ll get back there. It   s Krazy Dayz this  weekend, so I   ll probably be going then.  Nykolaiszyn I know, right? (Laughter)  Walker Yesterday is when it started.  Nykolaiszyn Yes. (Laughs) Thinking about your experiences as a college student and kind  of looking ahead, what  advice  would you give to students today?  Walker Do well in high school to get those scholarships because college is  expensive. I did not do that. I partied a lot in high school, and I didn   t have  any scholarships. I have a lot of student loan debt. Unless you   re going to  14  get out of school, get a job that   s going to pay a whole lot of money, then I  would recommend definitely working on those scholarships and grants.  Nykolaiszyn We   ve spoken about your husband, but tell me a little bit about your  husband and your children.  Walker My husband   s name is Glen Walker. He   s the one who actually nominated  me for this. He is recently hired as the food service director in Parsons,  Kansas, for their school district. That   s really exciting. Besides the time  where he was in the military, in the infantry, he has been in food service,  and he absolutely loves it. He wants to open up his own restaurant one day,  and he   s just fantastic. He   s handy. He is so thoughtful, and he is a  wonderful cook. All wonderful things. Yeah, he   s really nice, and he   s about  seven years older than me. He   s just fantastic.  Nykolaiszyn Your children?  Walker Zoey, she   s five and a half, and she will tell you that.    I   m five and a half.     She will be starting kindergarten this year. She   s very excited about that. We  just recently went to try out for a play because she   s so extraverted and very  theatrical, and we just wanted to kind of embrace that. There   s a Miami  Little Theater that we were going to try out for, but she got a little  overwhelmed. We didn   t do that this year. She goes,    I just want to watch it.  I   ll try out for the next one.       Okay. Let   s do that.    She   s always putting on  some type of show, singing, dancing, doing something. She   s fantastic.  She   s spunky. She   s very intelligent. She   s very tiny, though. She   s a very  small human.  Then Teagan, Teagan   s two and a half. She   s just like me. I   m pretty scared.  (Laughs) She   s amazing, and she   s so bullheaded. She wants what she  wants, and she knows what she wants. She   s so intelligent. She   s going to  give me a run for my money. I can tell you that. She   s awesome. They   re  both awesome. I love my kids. I   ve been blessed. My whole family   s pretty  amazing.  Nykolaiszyn Could you talk a little bit about how your time at OSU has impacted your  community, whether it be in Stillwater or here in Welch?  Walker It   s definitely made me comfortable with public speaking, and I   ve been  able to be a part of some nonprofit groups, some early parenting and  resource groups down in Stillwater, which I know changed my life, being a  part of that, and I helped integrate other women becoming mothers into that  group. They   re a fantastic group of women, and I know we ourselves have  changed the world just there in Stillwater. I brought a little piece of that with  me here, and I   m starting an early parenting resource group here. Yeah,  getting comfortable with public speaking, that was something that I learned  15  at OSU because I was not good at that before then. (Laughs) I gained so  much self-respect just by becoming a graduate, and I just do everything I  can to change the world and make it a little bit better. Anything I can do, I  probably learned it there.  Nykolaiszyn We notice when we talk to alums that people have a certain passion and  loyalty to the university. Here we are in Welch, Oklahoma, in your OSU  room     Walker Heck yeah   Nykolaiszyn    with your orange chair.  Walker My orange chair, which my in-laws gave me, who may or may not be  halfway Sooner fans.  Nykolaiszyn Oh  Even better.  Walker My mother-in-law is a half-and-halfer. She has an OSU-sewn OU shirt. It  says the word    Oklahoma   , and then it says    State    on half of it because it   s a  half of an OSU shirt and half an OU shirt. One side of our family   s OSU,  and one side   s OU. She   s mending the bond right there, and then my father-in-  law   s diehard OSU fan. We   re kind of winning out. It   s okay.  Nykolaiszyn What do you think it is that sparks this type of loyalty in OSU alums?  Walker Just a pride. It   s a fantastic school. I mean, academically, they   re awesome,  and I mean, we love our sports. We   re pretty passionate sports fans. We   re  not bandwagoners. We   re not going to jump on and off when we   re winning  or losing. I think a lot of that because we   re not always winning. A lot of  times we are, but we   re not always winning. We   re always loyal, loyal and  true. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn What are we missing? What have we not covered that you want to share  about your OSU experience or your feelings about the university or your  time in Stillwater?  Walker I think you   ve covered a whole lot.  Nykolaiszyn Is there anything else you   d like to add that we haven   t spoken about today?  Walker Go Pokes.  Nykolaiszyn Go Pokes   16  Walker Wanted to make sure I put that in there. (Laughs) I don   t think so. Probably  after you leave I   ll remember something. I   ll be like,    Juliana, come on.  Come back.    You   re going to be,    No.    (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Well, we definitely appreciate your time today, and it   s great seeing all the  wonderful things you   re doing as an alum with the university and making a  difference in families here in this part of Oklahoma.  Walker Oh yeah, I forgot to say. Can I go back to Grand Lake?  Nykolaiszyn Yes  Absolutely   Walker The program I work for, it   s called Health Homes, and it integrates physical  well-being with mental health well-being and puts it all together. The team  that I work with, we are working towards keeping the family together and  strengthening the family instead of putting them inpatient or getting them  taken out of the home. It   s a really big deal. I love my job. I love the team I  work with because we are making that difference in somebody   s life.  They   re staying with their family when they might not have been able to  before, so it   s pretty fantastic. You   re teaching those things like coping  skills and anger management techniques and things everybody needs, not  just kids. (Laughs) It   s pretty cool. I love being a part of it.  Nykolaiszyn You could definitely see that impact. You   re definitely helping and making a  difference.  Walker Yes, it   s pretty exciting, and it   s very slow. You have to be patient, which is  not my strong point at all, but you do get to see that positive change and  difference in those kids    lives. I   m going to go back and get my master   s and  become a licensed therapist so I can further that and then be even more  impactful, I hope.  Nykolaiszyn Where you going to go?  Walker I have no idea yet. I don   t know if OSU does an online. I   m waiting until  Teagan gets into school before I get back and get my master   s, because I   m  tired. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Yeah, kids take a lot out of you. (Laughs)  Walker When you work with kids and then you come home to kids and you just  want, you just get tired. You know what? It   s okay. It   s fantastic. I wouldn   t  want to be anywhere else. I think that I   ve been aligned here for a reason.  It   s good. I   m happy.  Nykolaiszyn It was the plan. It   s a good plan.  17  Walker It is a good plan for now. We   ll just adapt when we need to.  Nykolaiszyn Well, K. C., thank you so much for sitting down with us and sharing a little  bit about your life and your family and your work and your passion for  OSU.  Walker Thank you very much for having me. It   s been awesome.  -------  -------
