 Gill. Today is September 23, 2010. I   m visiting with  Matthew Horning at the Oklahoma State University campus in  Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project  of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Matt, I appreciate  you taking time away from your busy student schedule to be with us this  morning. I understand you just finished up a test, as a matter of fact.  Yes, yes.  Hopefully you   re a little more relaxed now.  Yes, I am. I   m glad it   s over.  Matt, we   ve been talking a little bit, before we turned the camera on  earlier. Your family is really a proud Oklahoma A M and Oklahoma  State University history, beginning with your great-great-grandmother,  Gay Lynn Albright Clark, and then five generations of your family,  including yourself, attended Oklahoma State University.  Yes.  Pretty special, isn   t it?  Yes, it   s very special.  Just a handful of OSU families have been five-generation families. I  wanted to start, just kind of ask you, have you heard some stories about  your great-great-grandmother Clark? I know you didn   t know her,  obviously, but hear any stories about her?  No.  5  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  She taught school several years in some small rural schools around this  area.  I really have not. I haven   t heard much about her. All I know is I heard  she attended here. That   s about it.  Attended in 19-teens.  I heard 1910, but I don   t know if that   s accurate.  Well, kind of moving down a couple generations, it was your great-grandmother,  Jamie Dunn, and your grandmother, Gay Lynn Bullock,  both of them still currently live in Stillwater.  Yes.  They attended OSU as well. Have they ever talked to you about their  OSU experiences?  I don   t really talked to my great-grandmother that much. I haven   t seen  her a whole lot because I live so far away, but I just know she enjoyed it.  She told me she enjoyed it. My grandmother told me stories like how   I  asked her about Rush because I joined the Greek system. I was asking  her about Rush, and she said she didn   t want to join Rush because  something didn   t work out. She just wanted to spite the other people and  not do it.  She maybe didn   t connect with her first choice or something.  Yes. I think it was one of her good friends didn   t get in a house, so she  was just,    Well, if my friend can   t get in this house then I   m just going  to spite the rest of the Greek system and not join.    (Laughter)  I hope she had some more positive experiences wherever she went.  Yes, it   s weird. I   m Sigma Chi. There   s a gym right outside called the  Charles Lanphere Gym, and she said she actually knew him. It   s kind of  weird that I play in this gym that she knew this person that it   s dedicated  after.  He was a great alum, by the way. I knew him personally. He was a good  guy, a good representative of your fraternity. Both of your parents were  also, of course, graduates of Oklahoma State University. Was your  family history, was that a strong influence on you and your decision to  come to Oklahoma State?  6  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Yes, I would say so. Some of my favorite parts of my childhood is  Thanksgiving dinner, going to my dad   s family   s house. Every sibling of  my dad   s, which is a six-sibling house, is an OSU alum. All we do is  watch the Bedlam game. It was just so much fun. I always love that.  Plus, we have an aunt who is an OU alum, and she just would act like  they were going to win, which they did, but    (Laughter) She would just  make noise and stuff. It was fun.  Not talking trash, surely.  Oh, yes, definitely some trash  (Laughter)  Were there other factors, Matt, that influenced you to come to Oklahoma  State, other than your family ties?  Well, I visited here a couple times when I was younger, and I seemed to  like it. I don   t know. I just felt like since knowing all my family has been  here, I felt like I couldn   t go wrong going here. It seems like a good  place to be.  You were talking about your memories on Thanksgiving, so a couple of  follow up questions. Did your parents ever talk to you about Oklahoma  State University, some of their experiences at OSU?  Some, not a whole lot. I really should   ve asked them more questions  before I joined. I just felt like   I don   t know. Before I even applied to  schools I just knew that this was the place I was going to be, so I didn   t  really ask them a whole lot. I just know they enjoyed it and they had fun  going to class and doing whatever else after class and stuff.  Two engineers in the family, Mom and Dad, man, that   s got to be tough  trying to follow that.  Oh, I know. (Laughter)  You talked earlier about being on campus when you were younger. Did  they take you to some OSU events like, maybe, Homecoming, different  activities while you were growing up? Of course, you were out of state  several of those years.  Yes, I was in North Carolina my first nine years, and I don   t know if we  ever visited. If we did, I don   t remember. I know we visited when I was  like thirteen or fourteen, when I lived in Texas. I think we just came up  some Saturday afternoon, and we just kind of looked around the campus.  You got a chance to see the campus? What were some of your first  7  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  impressions of the campus?  What I remember of it, one of the only things I remember is the Bullet  rider statue, the Spirit Rider. That   s about the only thing I really  remember, just taking a picture in front of that. I really liked the picture  for some reason. (Laughter)  Did you get a chance to see Theta Pond or Iba Hall or anything?  I just don   t remember it that much. I think we just came up here for   oh,  we came up here to visit my great-grandmother. That   s what it was. We  didn   t really go on campus too much, but one of the things we did was  look at the stadium and the Spirit Rider statue.  We were talking earlier about you mentioned where you grew up, and  you kind of shared a little bit about where you grew up. You were born  in Texas. Is that right?  I was born in Longview, Texas, which is East Texas, about middle of the  state. Then I moved when I was nine months old to Charlotte, North  Carolina, and I lived there for nine years. I didn   t come visit Stillwater  for sure, but Oklahoma very rarely. My dad   s family lives in  Bartlesville, so I didn   t really visit here that often. Then after I was nine,  I moved to Beaumont, Texas, and I graduated there and came here.  What about when you were in high school, some of your school activities  and community activities you were involved in?  I   m a big sports guy, so in high school I played a lot of soccer and  basketball. That took up a lot of my time. I went on a couple youth  group mission trips to South Carolina one time and a place called Jasper,  Texas, and we did some clean-up there. I was involved in student  council as a representative. I was in some honor societies, like a math  honor society and the high school National Honor Society. Between all  that, that pretty much kept my day.  That   s right. (Laughs) Well, how did your teams do in soccer and  basketball? Very competitive?  Yes, very competitive. My first two years of high school, we won the  state championship in TAPPS  Texas Association of Private and  Parochial Schools  basketball. I made the team as a freshman, which is  pretty impressive. I didn   t play a whole lot, but I was there. Sophomore  year I played quite a bit more. I didn   t start, but I played. I was a good  sixth-man.  8  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  What was your position?  Well, freshman year I was back-up center/power forward. Sophomore  year, I kind of did that, also, was a shooting guard and small forward. I  played just about everything. Then junior-senior year, basketball, we  weren   t quite as good, but my senior year we went to the final four. We  just didn   t win the whole thing. Then in soccer, I didn   t play my  freshman year. I played my sophomore year. We lost in the first round of  playoffs. Same thing with junior year, but then senior year we made it to  the semi-finals and lost to the eventual state champions.  I   m going to guess you   re a defender?  Yes, I   m a defender, yes.  What is it, midfielder, striker, and     I played sweeper.  Sweeper, okay. That   s what I was trying to think of the word. That   s  great. Your academic activities, you talked a little bit about being in  some science clubs or math clubs.  I was in Mu Alpha Theta, which is a math honor society. And then I was  in  NSHSS, National Society of High School Scholars . I think I was in  another one, but I can   t remember.  Any hobbies or interests that you had? Of course, you   re already  engaged in a lot of things, but were there any special interests that you  had?  Not really. I mean, my hobbies are watching sports or playing sports, so  I was doing my hobbies.  Remind me to ask you about that at OSU because I want to get your  opinion on some of our sports programs. Surely you play intramurals,  right, because you   re spending time on the basketball court?  Yes, I   m actually the sports chair of my house, so I handle all that stuff.  Oh, okay. Don   t let me forget. I want to get back to that, okay? Which  year did you enroll at Oklahoma State?  I enrolled in 2008, fall of 2008.  You came straight out of high school to OSU in that fall?  9  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Yes.  Okay. And you major is     Architectural engineering.  You picked a tough major, huh? (Laughs)  I guess the engineering part of my family influenced me to pick an  engineering. I   ve always been good at math and science, and I   ve always  liked building things or designing things. When I was little I would build  little toy cars and stuff.  Erector Sets and things.  Yes, and use LEGOs and stuff.  Do you like drafting and drawing?  Yes but no. I did before I came here until I went through that. I   m tired  of it now. (Laughter)  Do you want to elaborate on that?  Oh, I   ve spent countless hours. I don   t know how many all-nighters I   ve  pulled just drawing pictures. It   s a tough major.  Pretty brutal, isn   t it?  Yes, it is.  There   s lots of rumors and stories that go around that the lights never go  off over there.  Yes, that   s very true. (Laughter) I can attest to that.  So you   re a junior now. You   re living in the fraternity house, okay. Talk  to me a little bit about your OSU experience, all right? Are you involved  in any student organizations or activities here?  Yes. I   m starting to get involved in the architecture clubs. I   m a  representative for my class in AEI, which is Architectural Engineering  Institute. Then I just got invited to some other honor society among the  architecture program, so I   m going to join that. It   s called ALSC. I can   t  remember what it stands for. And then I   m in NSCS, National Society of  10  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Collegiate Scholars. I   m also in some other   my mind is going blank.  I   m in another club.  Matt, you   re obviously a good student. Do you mind sharing your grade  point average at this point?  I just looked it up yesterday, and it   s actually a 3.55, I believe.  Which for your major is very impressive.  I would say so. I think I   m near the top if I had to guess.  That   s great. Congratulations. Any special things you like to do on  campus?  I like playing in the intramurals. That   s always fun. I   ve done some  philanthropy events. Those are kind of fun. We did that big event where  you clean up houses and stuff. It   s a lot of fun. It   s early, but once you  get doing it, it   s pretty fun.  And early is anything before ten o   clock for a student.  Yes. (Laughter) It   s actually more like seven o   clock on a Saturday  morning.  So you   re chair of your sports committee in the fraternity?  Yes.  What do you there?  What I do is I sign everyone up for intramural sports, and I keep track of  them, make sure they   re going to the games and not forfeiting them  because when you forfeit you get a fee. That   s about it.  How do you guys do in terms of the point system ranking?  I haven   t checked in a while, but I   m sure we   re near the top. I mean, it   s  too early to tell. There   s only been a couple of sports that have been  completed.  Do you participate in any of the team sports yourself?  Yes. Right now, I   m in flag football, co-rec and men   s, and I   m in soccer  co-rec and men   s. I did archery a couple weeks ago. I haven   t shot a bow  since second grade, but it turned out all right. (Laughter)  11  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Were you able to hit that target?  I did hit the target a couple times. (Laughter)  That   s great.  I did not get the high score. That   s for sure, but it was fun. I signed up  for kickball, but I think we ended up conceding that.  As being a member of a five-generation OSU family, has it in any way  influenced your perspective of Oklahoma State, before and now as a  student?  Yes, I would say so. I feel like   I don   t know. I feel like I have a  deeper   I don   t necessarily know more about OSU than other people,  but I feel like I just     Have a deeper connection.  Deeper connection, yes, than some other people. I don   t know how to  elaborate on that.  I guess it   s sort incentive, too, to want to do well and to kind of carry the  flag of the family.  Right.  Do any of your friends know that you   re a fifth-generation Cowboy?  I   ve told them since I heard about this interview. I   ve told them. I   ve  started telling some people.  What   s your reaction?  I think when they hear    fifth generation,    they think five family  members, but then some people I actually elaborate on it. I   m like,    It   s  five generations, as in my great-great-grandmother went here.     What   s their response to that?  They go,    Wow.    (Laughter) If I would   ve done it as family members,  it   s close to twenty-five family members have actually been to OSU. So  if you go with that, I   m twenty-fifth generation.  You   re part of a significant group.  12  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Yes.  That   s great. What are some of your favorite student hangouts on  campus and off campus?  Well, like hangout spots?  It sounds like to me it   s over at the Architecture Building.  Yes, it   s the Architecture Building. (Laughter)  Other than that.  I live and work in there. I guess the fraternity house. I really don   t do  much outside those two things.  Student Union, library, any place on campus you go frequently?  Just the Architecture Building. I do all my homework over there, all my  projects. It   s kind of convenient. They have it all set up so I don   t have  to come in here, deal with all the mass crowds in here.  What about off campus, any place you like to go to when you get a  chance?  I   ve been to Lake Blackwell once. That   s a pretty nice place, but I   ve  only just been there once. Usually, weekends, I try to relax, just sit in my  bed and sleep and recover.  After your all-nighters? (Laughs)  Yes.  All right. Are there some professors you   ve had to this point or  administrators that have been influencing your personal development as  a student?  Yes, I would say most of my architecture teachers have taught me quite  a few things.  Any that stand out?  Professor  John  Phillips, I have him this semester. I   ve only had him for  a few weeks, but he seems   he   s my first architectural engineering  teacher. He seems like a good representative of what I would like to be  13  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  when I graduate, like how I want to present myself and stuff. He seems  to be on top of everything. I like that.  Who   s your advisor?  My advisor is Steve O   Hara. He   s actually on a sabbatical this year, so I  would   ve had a class with him. He seems like a really good guy, too, but  I just haven   t had a class with him.  What do you enjoy most about your OSU experience, anything you  really like? You mentioned earlier you like sports. Do you watch OSU  sports?  Yes, I love OSU sports. I have to stop everything and watch. If it   s an  away game I have to watch it.  Do you have an all-sports ticket?  Yes. Well, if you   re a student you can just swipe your ID, but then I  purchased the football and basketball, yes. I do that every year. I actually  managed to make it to every single home game last year for basketball,  which is kind of impressive with my major.  Outside of sports, anything you just really liked about Oklahoma State?  I heard the architecture program is the top twenty in the nation, which is  also what intrigued me. I   ve heard it   s growing. It   s on the up and up  and getting better and better every day. Since I   ve been here, there   s  already been like four buildings that have been built, four classroom  buildings.  What do you think about the facility? What do you like about it? I guess  it   s been about five or six years   I   m trying to think of when they  completed the renovation, maybe about four years ago or so?  Of the     Of the Architecture Building.  Of the Architecture Building? It actually just got finished last year,  which is convenient because I   m now in professional school. I actually  am one of the first people to experience     How do you like it? What do you like about it?  I love it. My freshman year, we were in the top of the ATRC  Advanced  14  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Technology Research Center , and it was awful. I was in a room that  was no windows, and I felt like I was going to kill myself because I was  going crazy. (Laughter) Now that there   s always windows, I feel like  I   m not in a classroom. I   m just doing what I like to do, not being a  slave.  Some favorite memories of Oklahoma State at this point that stand out in  your mind that you   ve really enjoyed?  I guess pre-college, I would say, watching the Bedlam game, finally  winning a couple in a row. That was always nice. As of now, favorite  memories, I rushed the court at the Kansas game last year. That was  really nice. It was pretty cool. Seeing everything getting renovated is  really like   people see this as a good place to be, and they   re putting  money into it. There   s a few things that need to be renovated. Like my  fraternity house just got recently renovated.  How do you feel about the Branding Success Campaign, the billion  dollar campaign of the university?  Once we get the money, it should be amazing. I think so far they   ve  done great stuff with the scholarships and everything. I haven   t received  anything yet, but hopefully I can get something.  Did you like the fact that about half of that money (I think it   s 600  million) is     Six hundred million.     scholarships and professorships and endowed chairs?  Yes. I like that, yes. It should help bring interest into the school.  In retrospect, how to you feel about your decision to enroll at Oklahoma  State?  Well, I love it. I actually applied to sixteen schools. My mom, I don   t  know what she was thinking. She made me do it all. (Laughter) I always  knew I would go to Oklahoma State, so I didn   t really understand why I  applied to the others. Part of the reason was I wanted to play college  soccer somewhere, and OSU does not have a men   s soccer team. That  was part of my decision, but then by the end of my senior year I kind of  got a little burned out. I don   t think I could   ve handled being an arch  engineer and playing college soccer. I just don   t think I could   ve  handled that, so it was an easy decision for me to go to Oklahoma State.  15  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  So, the same kind of question, but in a little bit different way. Have your  OSU experiences, academically and socially, been pretty much what you  expected it to be?  Yes. Yes, it has actually exceeded expectations in some ways.  Great. You   ve still got a couple years left here at OSU, I guess. Do you  have some goals in mind, academically and otherwise, for these next two  years?  I would just like to graduate, obviously. One of my goals, just recently  started, is become the president of this AEI group that I   m in. I think that  would really help me as far as my career goes. I   d like to be able to go  to   there   s a program where you can go to Europe for a little while, and  I would like to go there and do a little architecture there.  Summer program there?  Yes, I think that would be really neat.  Is that the one that goes to Paris? I know there   s one that goes there  regularly.  Yes, I think they go to Paris, somewhere in France.  Matt, you   ve already mentioned a lot of organizations that you   re a part  of, and you just mentioned a minute ago about being the president of one  of those. Do you feel like you   ve had good leadership opportunities at  Oklahoma State? Has that been helpful to your personal development?  Yes, yes. I think since I   ve been here I   ve realized that I have the  potential to be a pretty good leader, so I have tried to utilize my ability  and tried to become a leader of some group of some kind.  The university talks a lot about that, and does more than just talks but  takes pride, maybe I should say, in the programs they offer for students  for leadership and personal development. Do you sense that in your  experiences in other students around you?  Yes, of course. I think just some of the students I   ve been with, they  have the same push for being a leader. I feel like that   s really helped out,  not only my grades but like just me as a student.  I know your fraternity encourages you to get involved, I   m sure, in  activities.  16  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Yes, and that   s helped me, too, just because some of my friends, my  pledge brothers   I have one pledge brother that really has influenced  me, you know,    Why don   t you go join that club because I think you  could do well in that club.    I greatly appreciate that because it helps my  resume, and it will only help me later on in life, meeting people and  stuff.  Matt, are you anticipating graduating in two years? When do you get  your bachelor   s degree?  In 2013. It   s a five-year program.  Five-year program. Of course, I   m asking you now, but do you  anticipate doing some graduate work, perhaps, after that, or do you  want to go right into the industry?  I think I   m going to go into industry. I don   t think it   s completely  necessary to go to grad school. I don   t know. We   ll see.  How many hours is your program, then?  It   s 157, maybe.  Like a normal would be 120 to 130.  Yes, but there   s an extra year.  It   s a five-year program. A lot of people aren   t aware of that, I know,  because you have to have so much of the engineering side of it and the  math side of it, and you also have to have the architecture part of it.  Right.  You mentioned being in the professional program. Your first two years is  pre-professional, and last year you were admitted into the professional  program.  Yes.  You have to have a certain grade point average to do that.  Yes, you have to take certain classes, certain amount of hours.  Congratulations on getting up there.  Yes, thank you. I   m one of, I believe, seven, yes, one of seven that are in  17  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  the program in my year.  What career options are you looking at? Are you thinking about where  you want to go, not geographically but career-wise, in terms of your  expertise?  I would like to go to a big city. I have a huge fascination in skyscrapers.  I would really like to work for a big firm that, you know, constructs and  designs skyscrapers for big cities. Another thing is stadiums. I really  would like to   I   ve heard there   s a firm, they focus on stadiums and  they do stuff like the World Cup, and they design those stadiums, or the  Olympics. I think that would be really cool to work for a big firm like  that and design those stadiums for those new sporting events. I think that  would be really neat.  What   s the architectural firm that   s done so much work with OSU and  Tulsa? I   m trying to think of the name of it. It might be good to check  with them, kind of get     Yes, yes. I know who you   re talking about, but I don   t     Gary Sparks is the architect. It   s Sparks-and-something architectural  firm in Tulsa.  Yes, I think I   ve actually talked to one of their employees.  Might be a good kind of thing for you.  Yes.  So what is the fascination with skyscrapers? Is this from your Erector  Set building days?  I don   t know. All I can tell you is, like, when I drive from Beaumont, I  have to drive through Dallas. I have to take a lot of exits, but it   s really  hard to make those exits because I   m always looking. I always like to  look at those skyscrapers and see what they   re all about. I guess part of  me wants to make something that   ll be known by a lot of people so I   ll  be remembered for something big because no one   s going to really  remember something, a small house or something. So that   s why I was  thinking I guess.  Are you interested in green buildings? Are they important to you?  Yes, that   s a big thing the school is pushing, I mean, for obvious  reasons. We need to start paying attention to how we make things, how  18  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  we design things, so our future generations can still be alive because  some of the buildings hurt the ecosystem and stuff. That   s what we   re  trying to push for.  Coming back to some of the family questions again, is it special for you  to be part of a five-generation family and be able to share those kind of  experiences?  Oh, yes. Yes, I really like the fact that I can share OSU with all my  family. I actually find it weird that people have families from other  colleges. I don   t know. It   s not weird, but I just for some reason find it  weird. I think we all share the same love for the same school, and it   s  kind of like a bond.  When you have family get-togethers, you talked about Thanksgiving and  you get together, do you ever reminisce or tell stories about Oklahoma  State? Do you talk about some of that on occasion?  Yes, we do sometimes, more so now that I   m in Oklahoma State and I  can actually share some of my experiences. That way we can actually  have a conversation because before, they would mention Kerr  Drummond, and I   m like,    What   s that? I don   t know what that is.    But  now I know, and I can share some stories.  There   s a connection now.  Yes.  And since you   re in college and your folks went there, they   re asking you  about your experiences.  Right, right.  Well, kind of speaking of that, looking your personal experience here  and then hearing some of their personal experiences, are there some  commonalities that these generations share that you can think of?  Yes, yes.  Could you elaborate on some of those?  One that comes to mind is my mom was in a sorority, and she went on  Coke dates, which is, like, the freshmen get paired on a date and they  just go around town. Usually, they go to the Barn and get a little Coke,  or they go to, like, Marble Slab and get some ice cream. I did the same  thing, the same exact thing that she did. Oh, another thing. My  19  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  grandfather, Gay Lynn   s husband, he went to OU, but he transferred  here. He said at OU, he went on a geology field trip, and it was to certain  places. And I, like, forty years later, I went on the exact same field trip,  exact same stops in the same order. I just thought that was really  interesting.  Same class? Was it geology?  Yes, geology class. It was pretty interesting that forty years later they   re  still doing the same thing. (Laughter)  You   re talking about Kerr Drummond, and they   ve talked about Theta  Pond or this building or that     Yes, my mom talks about Theta Pond as the make out spot. That   s what  she would tell me, the make out spot. Another spot was the library lawn.  That   s what she would tell me.  It   s really interesting that you   ve heard the stories and then now, like  you said earlier, you   ve been there, so you kind of connect with that.  Yes, yes.  There   s a commonality through the generations.  Yes, I know what they   re talking about.  How have your experiences been different in your generation, in your  era, than what you heard from your parents or grandparents?  I guess just the technology, having computers and stuff. That really  makes things different. Plus, apparently, it   s grown ten-fold since my  parents have been here. I mean, I can   t imagine when my great-great-grandmother  had been here. It   s just exploded in size.  Looking generally as a student, I know your head   s down most of the  time in a book, or computer probably more likely, but as you think of the  general university, have you ever met or heard President Hargis talk?  What do you think, as a student, about his leadership?  I think he   s doing a good job. Just this campaign has done so much. I   ve  looked into what tier schools are. Like when I was applying to schools, I  saw that OSU is a tier-three school, and apparently we   ve moved up  spots. Things have changed, the grading system, but obviously there   s  some improvement there, which is always good. Improvement is always  good at a university, so I like him for that. I thank him for that.  20  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Any other administrators on campus you   ve met or heard about that you  can relate to, that you   ve got a chance to hear or talk or know about?  Well, the dean of my college has talked to us a couple times, and he   s  stressed a few things about being green and representing architecture  well and doing your best always, stuff like that.  Just generally, the big picture, what do you think are the strengths of  Oklahoma State University?  As far as I know, it   s the CEAT College. I can speak for that myself  because I   ve been there.  College of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology.  Yes. I   ve heard some other programs are good. I   m not in them, so I  don   t know that much about them. I   ve heard the HRAD  Hotel and  Restaurant Administration  program is very good here, but other than  that, I don   t   sorry, what was the question again?  Just sort of asking your general impression of Oklahoma State. You  know, like if you were talking to somebody about OSU, what would you  say and what would you tell them?  Oh, another thing is it   s a family, a friendly atmosphere. I feel like it   s a  family-friendly atmosphere, like everyone here loves OSU, works for  OSU. We   re all working together for this university, and it   s not like  there   s Stillwater and OSU. It   s kind of all mixed together. There is a  difference, but it   s kind of mixed together.  Great, super. Based on your experiences today, would you recommend  OSU to prospective students, and what would you tell them?  Yes. I would tell them it   s a great school. I   ve had a great time. I   ve met  a lot of people, great people. They   re all friendly here. It   s fun. Back to  sports, as far as sports go, it   s fun going to games. All the fans are into  it, every sport, it seems like. It   s not like we pride ourselves in just  football or something. Of course, we can   t because they   re haven   t had  too much success in the past, but I just feel like it   s homey. I don   t  know.  Have you learned to love orange now?  Oh, I   ve always loved orange, (Laughter) but, yes, more so now.  21  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  That   s great. Would you recommend OSU to your younger sister?  What   s her name?  Madeline Horning.  Madeline. I was visiting with your mom, and she said she wasn   t sure  where she was going to go.  I don   t want to push her. She   s like me. She wants to play soccer. She  wanted to play soccer somewhere, so I don   t know if she   s continuing  with that or not. I think if she doesn   t, I would assume she would go  here. I   m not positive on that. I don   t have to do a whole lot of  influencing on her. I think she   s already     It would be pretty cool to have a fifth generation of the women in your  family.  Oh, yes.  What   s her interests other than soccer, academically.  She   s talking about being a doctor. I don   t know if that   s changed. It   ll  probably change when she gets to college, but we   ll see. I don   t know.  She   s talked about being a doctor, though.  Matt, what have we not talked about that would be of interest to  somebody watching this interview thirty years from now? What have we  not covered that we ought to talk about?  I   m not really sure how to answer that. My mind   s going blank.  Have you had a chance to talk to any   had any architects come back,  professionals that will come back and talk to you or work with you?  Actually, I believe almost every faculty member is an OSU alum, or just  about every faculty member is an OSU alum, so I get to interact with  them all the time. That   s pretty neat.  Is that helpful, do you think?  Yes, it   s pretty nice to   if they love the school so much to come back to  teach it, it   s pretty impressive. Apparently, it did good for them, so it  will probably be good for me.  Matt, another quick question about the campus. You were talking about  how much it   s growing and new buildings going up. Of course, there   s a  22  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  lot of disruption because of construction.  Right.  The Student Union now, especially, kind of trashed a little bit. Maybe  you   ll get some of that again because you   ve got a couple more years  after this.  Hopefully it   s before I graduate.  What do you think about all the construction and the growth of the  campus?  I wouldn   t want to see construction when I   m here, but I know it   s going  to help the university, so I don   t mind it. I   ve seen some get completed,  so I   m okay with the construction now because the completed stuff is  really state of the art. It   s really nice.  You   ve heard about one time they proposed Athletic Village.  Right.  Probably back north     Right. I actually lived in Bennett, so I was right next to the proposed  area.  If it ever gets on track and ever finds a situation where it turns around,  what do you think about that complex and that concept?  I haven   t really seen a lot of sketches, but I   ve heard it   s pretty  impressive. I think it would just increase interest in OSU. If it ever gets  built, I think it would be a great asset to OSU.  You mentioned a little bit earlier about the community, the closeness of  the Stillwater community and the OSU community. Are there some  places in Stillwater that you like, eating places, stores, different things  that you   ve had good experiences with?  I don   t shop a whole lot, so I don   t really go into any stores, but I guess  restaurant-wise, I like Freddie Paul   s  Steakhouse . That   s a really good  place, and Curly   s  Old Fashioned Hamburgers . I like Curly   s. It   s a  good little burger joint. Some others that come to mind, House of Greek.  I love gyros. Back home we don   t   in Beaumont we don   t really have  any Greek places, so I like to get a gyro every now and then. It   s really  good.  23  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Do you go to Hideaway occasionally?  Hideaway. I don   t know why I didn   t mention that. Hideaway, yes,  Hideaway is really good.  I guess your parents probably went to the Hideaway.  Yes, I   m sure. I   m sure. They haven   t really mentioned anything, but  yes, I   m sure they did. I have an aunt on my dad   s side who   s talked  about she was here basically when the Tumbleweed was just started.  Actually, my dad   stories are starting to come back. My dad has talked  about   my parents, actually, both, were here when Eskimo Joe   s was  starting out. He talked about going there when he was going through  college. It   s pretty neat that he was there at the very beginning. He didn   t  know it was going to be as big as it is today, which is kind of a landmark  of OSU.  Did they have cheese fries back then, too, do you know? (Laughs)  I haven   t asked him about that. I don   t think so. I think he was going  there for the beer, if I had to guess. (Laughter)  Again, I wanted to sort of ask you a quick question. You were talking  about your architecture and buildings. What do you see when you  graduate? What do you think your career track be? How do you hope to  manage your career, if you will?  I hope to start out on probably a low position on a large firm and  hopefully just work my way up to bigger positions in that large firm  somewhere in a big city. That   s what I   m hoping for.  East Coast, West Coast, maybe?  Probably, just because   I don   t know. I may stay here in the Midwest  area or the South. I haven   t really thought about it. I don   t have really a  preference, just wherever I get a job at in a large city.  Closing out then, just to kind of ask a question I asked earlier but in a  little bit different way, are you excited? Are you hoping that there will be  a sixth generation someday, maybe seventh generation?  Oh, yes. I mean, I   m going to try to push for it. I would recommend my  son or daughter to come here for sure. That   s what I would push for.  You said there   s been about twenty-some-odd members of the family at  24  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  Gill  Horning  this point that have attended?  Yes.  Pretty impressive. That   s great. Matt, I appreciate you taking the time  today to come and visit. Again, any comments you   d like to make about  your feelings about Oklahoma State at this point that you   d like to  share?  Well, I just hope we keep this winning streak going on the OSU football  team. (Laughter) It   s going to be tough next game, but    I hope OSU  keeps growing, eventually reaches its full potential, which I can see it  happening because all this money is being pulled in here.  Being an alumni guy I   ve got to ask you. You   re going to stay connected,  aren   t you, after you graduate?  I hope so. Yes, I plan on it.  Join the Alumni Association, stay connected?  I plan on it.  That   s great. Again, thanks. I appreciate you taking the time to visit with  us.  Thank you.  Good luck with the rest of your career, okay?  Thanks.  -------  -------
