 Nykolaiszyn and today is April 7, 2008. I am in  Sanibel, Florida interviewing Mr. Robert A. Kurland, better known as  Bob Kurland, and it   s a pleasure to be here today and we thank you for  making time to see us.  Well, you   re welcome, and we   re glad to see you.  All right. Well, Mr. Kurland, this is for a project at the OSU Library  called    O-STATE Stories    and we   d like to begin today by learning a  little more about you, where you   re from originally   could you start  with that please?  Well, my mother was from Indiana and my dad was from St. Louis,  Missouri and, as a result, I was born in St. Louis in 1924. We lived in  the city of St. Louis or the suburbs until I left to go to college in 1942.  Jennings High School was where I went to high school, which was just  on the city limits of the city of St. Louis. It was a relatively small school  but a very good one in terms of academic discipline, not for the super-intelligent,  but for the kids that were made up of what America was in  those days. There were immigrant families, mixed families of different  national origins, and they all worked well together and I think we got a  pretty good high school education for the standards in those days.  I eventually, of course, went to Oklahoma A M in 1942 and finished  there in 1946, and then went to work for Phillips Petroleum Company.  So in between those changes, I did a lot of things, most of them as they  related to the schools that were associated with athletics in one way or  another. Over the years I was very fortunate to be involved in some  interesting situations that brought a great deal of satisfaction in terms of  a sense of accomplishment and actually was involved in some aspects of  the game of basketball that changed the game in its history and its make-up  and the way it   s played. It   s an interesting story in itself.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Now you mentioned that you were involved in some of the development  of basketball   s game changes. Could you go into detail please?  Well, if you want to be here for four hours, we can go all the way back  to Naismith and the founding of the game of basketball in the YMCA in  Springfield, Massachusetts. It was invented mostly to keep energetic  young men out of trouble during the winter months in the cold climates,  and the original rules were very simple and straightforward. They   re still  mostly applied today, except that the game has changed radically with  the changes in equipment and travel and additions to the rules or  changes which made it a better game for the benefit of the fans. It   s a  very competitive sport and really didn   t come into its own in this  country, or the world for that matter, until the soldiers spread it around  the world in World War II. That   s where basketball really had an  opportunity to be known throughout the world because the soldiers  could play basketball nearly anyplace   in the alley or in the street or in  a gym   and it was a game that people liked. They still like it.  Regarding the changes that have come about, we were directly involved  at Oklahoma A M with the goal-tending rules and also had something  to do with influencing the 30-second rule, which is the rule that says that  you have to shoot the ball in 30 seconds. The guy who really led that  charge in terms of my involvement in being involved in the goal-tending  rules and the other things is Henry Iba, who was a remarkable coach in  terms of being before his time, in terms of being able to interpret the  various aspects of the game. He loved the game so much that he did not  take advantage of the circumstance because of my height and size or the  other kids that came along. He went along with the idea of changing the  rules of the game to make it a better game for the participants and the  fans.  So in all of this time, I got involved and we won the NCAA national  championship in 1945 and    46   the first team to do that. I went to the  Olympics twice, once in London and once in Helsinki, and over the  years was involved in some aspects of the game having to do with the,  and you   re going to hear more about this in the next few years,    dunk  shot    whatever that is and why it is as it is today. Those are long stories  that I don   t know if we   ve got that much time.  Well, tell me how you first met Mr. Iba.  Well, my high school coach was a man named Walter Rulon who went  to Maryville Teachers College immediately after the time that Henry Iba  was the coach there, before Mr. Iba left Maryville to come to Oklahoma  State and the University of Colorado. Mr. Iba   s reputation as a man, and  his character, his moral character, his leadership ability, his image as a  6  leader of young men was outstanding. Mr. Rulon never really met Mr.  Iba, but he wrote him a letter and asked if he would be interested in my  coming down to Stillwater for spring tryouts which Mr. Iba had, and it  was Mr. Rulon who influenced me to give favorable consideration to  Mr. Iba   s interest in me.  When the Oklahoma State, then it was Oklahoma A M, basketball team  came to St. Louis in 1942, the spring of    42, they had a dinner at a place  called Ruggeri   s, which was in south St. Louis, and it was an afternoon  dinner. I took the bus, went down there and I went into the room and  here was the Oklahoma A M basketball team and Mr. Iba all in suits, or  coats and ties and gentlemen   and made a great impression on me. Also  the biggest impression I guess was the steak that they had, and I thought  it was going to be a heck of a deal if I got associated with them.  But anyway, we went to Stillwater from St. Louis on a bus, a kid from  Webster Groves and myself. Mr. Iba, in those days, had a three-day  workout tryout, and he worked us pretty hard as high school kids. At the  end of that time, he invited me into his office and he said,    I   ve never  seen a young man like you before.    He said,    I don   t know whether you  can play college basketball or not but if you   ll come to Oklahoma  A M   and you   ll stay eligible and you study and you do the job which  will be assigned to you,    he said,    I   ll give you a scholarship at  Oklahoma A M.    And that   s all I needed because it was a time that the  war had come on and other schools had dropped their scholastic  activities, or their athletic activities, and Oklahoma State was a good, or  well-known, school for engineering, and I thought at the time I wanted  to be a civil engineer.  So Mr. Iba, Oklahoma A M   s educational standards, and his basketball  team   s reputation were all things that I needed, and particularly the job  to help me get through school because my father made it very simple  that he wanted me to go to college. We were sitting on the front stoop  one day and he said,    Bob, I want you to go to college.    I was delighted.  No one in our family had ever been to college at any level, and many of  them had never finished high school. I was just tickled to death that he  was thinking on those lines because this was in the middle of the  Depression in 1939 or    40. I couldn   t figure out, now where   s he going  to get the money to send me to college? And he turned to me and he  said,    And if you don   t go, you   re going to start paying room and board  when you finish high school.    That was my incentive (Laughs) to find a  way to get to college, and athletics was the tool to get it done.  So we went to Stillwater, and from that time on it was hard work. A  great deal of effort was required, but it was an enjoyable time and a  successful period in my life in terms of satisfaction of participating in  7  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  sports because I dearly loved to compete. I loved to play the game of  basketball. Between Mr. Iba and myself and the help of some other folks  in terms of developing skills and techniques for a big man I improved. I  was a big kid, not very muscular, but big, tall, lanky and rather unique  looking. People came to the first game that we had, a demonstration  game, in Stillwater when I was a freshman. The gym, or the Gallagher  Hall, was pretty well full. They came to see this seven-foot guy that was  supposed to be some kind of phenomenon. I remember falling down  three or four times and the crowd just laughed, but we kind of got the  last laugh when I was a senior.  I would say so. Well, you mentioned that you had your eyes set on  engineering. Did you stick with that path?  No, I found out that when I had four tough courses   descriptive  geometry, a second course in algebra, college chemistry, and English or  literature, I   ve forgotten which or how they classify it   but when I  loaded that up and then we would practice from seven o   clock until 9:30  every night, I found out that I wasn   t as smart as I thought I was. So I  changed to the School of Education and really enjoyed the choice of  courses that we had in terms of interest in things. I had a chance to look  at things in terms of history, in terms of economics, in terms of natural  sciences, but I really didn   t want to be a teacher, not a classroom  teacher.  As I developed into a better player in my senior year, the world started  to change in terms of what might be done in terms of using basketball as  an entree into a career, as I did, by joining Phillips Petroleum Company  with their basketball program or going into professional sports. But what  most people don   t realize is that the war was over in 1945, or practically  over, and then professional sports were just beginning to change because  of transportation, of stadiums, but mostly because of TVs. People can sit  on their fannies in their living room and vicariously participate in sports.  America does just that and that   s where the money came in from  advertising and the world changed. What you have today is a result of  technological changes in terms of communication, and that affected  sports because of the money involved and all the things all put  together   but that   s another four-hour story.  Absolutely. Well, do you remember where some of your classes were  held, some of the buildings?  Well, I remember the old Chemistry building that was over   gee,  probably where the Student Union is today, I guess. I remember that it  didn   t have any sidewalks or ways to get to it other than to walk across  what was lawn in the summertime or in the spring and in the wintertime  8  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  it was a pretty muddy place. The campus was certainly not like it is  today in terms of buildings that were being utilized. They were still  using Old Central. I was trying to recollect where the library was. I  think it may have been in Old Central for all practical purposes. Oh,  Morrill Hall was the School of Education and the new Engineering  Buildings were referred to, but the campus was entirely different than it  is today. It was a different institution, but I don   t think the kids are any  better today than they were in those days.  How was Gallagher Hall set up?  Gallagher Hall was, of course, built as an agricultural exposition facility,  and the state put in   I   ve forgotten how many million dollars, but a lot  of money in those days. And its purpose was kind of a sub-rosa thing, I  guess, because they intended all the time to use it as an athletic facility  and not so much as a demonstration hall for agricultural purposes. It fit  into the college basic program as far as the agricultural sciences was  concerned and the state legislature allocated the money, so they built it  and it was named after Ed Gallagher who was a wrestling coach. In  more recent years, they added Mr. Iba   s name to it as the outstanding  basketball coach.  I lived there for three years, and we, as athletes with scholarships, had to  work an hour a day in order to earn that   we were paid   the money was  transferred   or the value of the money was transferred   for food and  shelter actually. I lived in the Gallagher Hall with two other fellas in the  building that faces the football field and that room is now gone, but we  lived there for three years. It was very convenient for me because I could  practice and get off the floor in ten minutes and be at my desk. I didn   t  waste time going down to Swim   s or the drugstore and wasting time, so  it was a great thing for me. But my job also included locking every door  and window in that big building every night. During the war when the  soldiers and the WAVES  Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency  Services  and the sailors were having their little trysts in the upper floors  of the Gallagher Hall, it was my job to run them out, so I interrupted a  lot of romances by being the custodian, so to speak, in Gallagher Hall.  But it was a great thing for me because it caused me not to waste time,  which I would have done I know, as others did, in terms of being tired  after practice and wasting another hour before you get back to the books.  That was really a help and a boon to me, but we didn   t have all the  facilities for the football players in those days because we had the only  bathroom with a tub in it where they could come over and treat their legs  in the hot water. I had the football players during football season in my  room along with my roommates every afternoon, which was kind of a  pain in the neck, but we put up with it.  9  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  So it was pretty common back then for all the athletes to work?  Oh, yes. Yes, ma   am. Those who were on scholarship   now there were  those who were trying and were on their own who had a tougher nut to  crack as far as that was concerned, but we had an existence in those days  that was certainly different because they didn   t have the facilities that  they have today for the athletes. They were much more Spartan and a  little less glamorous than (Laughs) what I think they have today. Kids  are treated pretty well as athletes, if they can cut the mustard.  So you   re going to school and you   re working   did you have any free  time to hang out on campus or off campus?  Well, in off-season you did, but during the basketball season, we  really   practice started at seven o   clock and it was over at 9:30. By the  time you got to the gym   had dinner and got to the gym, you really  didn   t have much time during the season. In the off-season, yeah, you  had some free time which you could do things with. We had one, two,  maybe three theaters   or at least two theaters in the city of Stillwater.  One up on the corner where the   it was   I   ve forgotten the name of it,  but it was right across from the firehouse, and that was one of the  movies. And during the war, the soldiers and the WAVES would be  around that and around the theater downtown in lines that were three  blocks long waiting to get in to see the movies.  Stillwater was not a great place for service people to come to because  they had limited facilities for recreation and they would sneak down to a  place called the Rock Castle, which was a little dance hall, and I suspect  there was a little    mountain dew    going under the table (Laughs) for  purposes of enjoyment. I never got down to the Rock Castle for three  reasons   one, I never had any money, two, I never had a girlfriend, and  three, I never had a suit to go in, so I found my activities sitting on the  mailbox across from the theater up on the corner by the firehouse. That   s  where I spent a lot of time.  Now you mentioned you practiced quite a bit.  Oh, yes, oh, yes.  Was it five days a week?  Generally speaking, it was five days a week, yeah, but as the season  came on, we   d squeeze in a Saturday or maybe a Sunday afternoon. And  during the holidays, I never came home in four years for Christmas or  Thanksgiving or New Year   s. We practiced three times a day when we  were in town in that period of time.  10  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Now how would you travel to road games?  Well, if the games were in Oklahoma City or down at Norman or even  as far as Kansas City, we could go by car. But you   ve got to remember  gasoline was rationed in those days. You had to have an    A,       B    or    C     sticker   I   ve forgotten which now   in order to get the fuel to go. I  mean it was relatively cheap as opposed to what it is today, but it was  scarce. And then when we went to New York or Chicago or other places,  we would travel by train   go over to Perry, Oklahoma, get on the train,  and many is the time we were on trains that were moving troops and  we   d have to stand in line on the train for an hour waiting to get  something to eat with the soldiers. But going by airplane was out of the  question because the general public just didn   t do that, and particularly a  basketball team with no money.  What were home games like? Were there a lot of students that attended?  Well, there were after we started to be an interesting team, yeah. My  sophomore and junior/senior year were well attended. The fact of the  matter is when I was a junior and senior, and particularly when I was a  senior and we had gained some notoriety as a team and I had as an  individual, the place would pack. It would be packed   absolutely  packed   and people would start to fill up the Field House as soon as  they would open the doors, and they would do that sometimes at five  o   clock in the evening to get a seat because it was    hully-gully    for the  seats for the students. And my job was to sweep the floor before every  game and before every practice   every game and every practice   and  so their favorite All-American was out there with two mops sweeping  the floor with the fans in the stands. I doubt seriously that most of the     prima donnas    would do that today. They would be reluctant to take on  that assignment, but that was part of my job.  Now Oklahoma A M played in the national championship in 1945.  That   s right.  What was that like for you?  Well, we had been to New York when I was a freshman and a  sophomore and played in the New York Invitational Tournament. Those  early years in    42,    43,    44, the tournament in New York City, the  National Invitational Tournament, held precedent over the NCAA,  which was really only organized in about 1939. So New York was a  central location for basketball. And we went to New York when I was a  sophomore, and I think we got fourth place in that tournament. Gee, we  didn   t have the best team in the world, and it was made up of people  11  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  who had already graduated from college, military people, and guys that  hadn   t played much basketball. We didn   t get waxed, but we got beaten,  but the trip to New York was nothing strange to us in the succeeding  years.  In 1945, we had a different team. Actually I was the only guy that  returned to school for the 1945 team. Every other player on it was a new  addition but we welded it pretty well. We had an outstanding group of  guys. You wouldn   t even look at them, I guess, in terms of initial  examination as to whether or not they had any potential as basketball  players, but God, they were tough guys   not mean, but just mentally  and physically just tough, and welded into a great team. They were truly  teammates that believed in one another.  We had one fella, who was an outstanding athlete, named Cecil Hankins  who saved our bacon in the national tournament. The rest of us played  reasonably well, but Cecil kind of held us together when we needed him.  So we won that year. We beat New York University and the next year,  we went back and we had been down the road before and had been  through the experience and the pressure that is on you. We weren   t  exposed as the kids are today to all the pressure that comes from the  news media because Mr. Iba wouldn   t permit it. The only person that  talked to the media was Mr. Iba. None of us were allowed to talk to the  newspaper people because you can make stupid mistakes, being young,  about a lot of things.  As a result, we were well-directed in terms of our activities and we knew  what our limits were and what we were gonna do and how we were  gonna play, what we were gonna run. That   s where you learn the lesson  that I think is terribly important. You run what you practiced. It   s like  people who are trying to sell you stocks today or investments, they   ll tell  you,    Get a strategy, stick with it, don   t deviate, hang with it, but learn  how to run your particular strategy.    Well, we were   after the    45  season and a tough season in    46, we knew what we were doing and we  knew how to play the game. As a result, we beat North Carolina State,  not easily, but enough to win the tournament for the second time, which  was the first time it had ever been done.  What was the reception like back on campus?  Well, not much. We came back and we got off the train over at Perry  and the cars met us, brought us back to the campus. We all went back to  our dormitories or wherever we were, and somebody about a week later  said,    Gee, we won the national championship again. We   d better have a  little get-together.    So we went over to the theater, which has since been  remodeled. I guess a couple of hundred kids may have come over and  12  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  the girls got up and somebody said,    Rah, rah, rah. We won the  championship. Rah, rah, rah,    and we all went home. It wasn   t any big  deal.  (Laughs) That   s interesting. Now outside of basketball, you ran track.  Well     Kind of?  Kind of. (Laughter) I was never a runner, but when I was in high school,  I wound up one rainy afternoon and I won the state championship as a  high-jumper in the Class B schools. It   s because I had the muddy  approach to the bar, and because I couldn   t buy track shoes because my  feet were too big, they wouldn   t make them in those days, so I had a pair  of baseball shoes. As a result of my being able to get traction in that  muddy field with those baseball shoes, I made it maybe an inch or two  above the other guys over the bar and wound up with a State-B class  championship, which was kind of unique. But I was never a great track  man but I enjoyed it. It was a good thing to kind of let off steam in the  spring.  Now on a whole, what was it like for you as a player to be guided and  coached by Mr. Iba?  Well, Mr. Iba was the same age as my father. He was thirty-seven, as I  recall, when I went to school, and so was my dad. And Mr. Iba  impressed me as someone whose leadership could be accepted without  question. He was a difficult coach in terms of getting us to accomplish  what he wanted to get accomplished, but we had great respect for him  and great confidence in his leadership. It wasn   t that he was a genius in  developing things, but he would think things through. His forte was  really defensive basketball rather than offensive basketball.  Probably, I learned more about the business of playing the position that I  played as center from a man named Floyd Burdette, who was a captain  in the Air Force and was one of those people that played in 1943-44.  Burdette was about 6-foot-5 or 6, and probably had to stoop down just a  little bit because anybody over 6-foot-6 couldn   t get in the military in  World War II. And Floyd taught me more about playing the post  position than Mr. Iba did, but then Mr. Iba would see things that caused  me to work on different shots. Between Floyd Burdette and Mr. Iba   s  examination of what a big man could do, we got pretty good at the type  of offense that we ran. But, it required the support and the unification of  the other four guys on the team the way we played in order to make it  successful. That was the thing that I come back to   we ran the plays, we  13  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  ran the plays, we ran the plays   we never got excited   we ran the plays.  Did other teams get excited?  Oh, well, we presented somewhat of a challenge to them I would say.  (Laughter)  Now do you stay in touch with any of your former teammates?  Yes, I call Mr. Aubrey who was on that basketball team, and he was my  first roommate when I went to college. He was the coach in Stillwater at  Oklahoma State for a number of years. He still lives in Stillwater. I talk  to Weldon Kern and J. L. Parks, who were also on that team, and many  of the others are dead. They   re gone. They   ve disappeared, as have  many of the other teams that were   fellas that were on the Olympic  teams. I don   t like to look at those kind of pictures.  Now outside of basketball, you stayed pretty busy on campus. You were  student council president     Well        twice?     yes, yes.  How did that come about?  I don   t really know, but I think that there were   as I recall, there was  some semblance of an    independent party.    I was not a fraternity man.  After I was a senior and we had won the national championship two  years and other things to go with that, the fraternity group were  interested in having some    rah, rah    boys off of the athletic teams in  their fraternities. So they came over and solicited us, but I ran as an  independent, not as a fraternity guy. I guess there was a fraternity group  and then the independents, the kids that were not in the fraternities or  sororities, that really represented the two groups on the campus.  I think mostly because of the fact that you   d get your name in the  O   Collegian a little bit more than somebody else that you wound up  during the selection process on the council. I guess nobody else wanted  the job as president and I got elected, but we played a little politics. My  sister was on there my senior year and then Weldon Kern, who was one  of my teammates, was married and he needed the job so I think as  secretary, we paid him  25 a month to kind of help him along. So a little  politics was involved.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  But the great thing about that time was that the soldiers had come back,  and their interest was not in small things. They were interested in their  education. They were glad to be alive. They were glad to be back with  their girlfriends and getting married and starting their families. They  were interested in looking to the future, and they knew that education  was very necessary. So the big things that the student council got into  were nothing, and probably we sponsored or sanctioned two dances over  in the old gym a year   two dances a year, and that was probably the  extent of our involvement. Politics was pretty simple in those days. We  didn   t have all the causes and reasons that kids are raising hell and  wasting time that we have today.  Well, what was Homecoming like back then?  I don   t even remember Homecoming. I don   t think I ever attended  Homecoming. I was a parade marshal some years later for a  Homecoming parade. It was fun to ride in a convertible and have a  cowboy hat, but I don   t think I was (Laughs) much on Homecoming.  Do you remember any campus traditions or even traditions within  athletics?  Oh, not really. I remember some things that with girls I shouldn   t talk  about.  Were you ever thrown in Theta Pond?  Nope.  Oh, my goodness. You avoided getting thrown in Theta Pond?  Yes. That   s one thing that, when I finally joined a fraternity, I made it  clear that I didn   t need any type of corporal punishment nor did I want to  get paddled nor was anybody invited to address my physical being.  Pretty important as an athlete.  Yeah.  Well, what were some popular places on campus students would gather?  Well, I mentioned the   I can   t remember the name of the drugstore,  malt shop or whatever it was up there by the theater. Then the other  place was at Swim   s there. It was right across from Eskimo Joe   s as you  go up. As you walked up toward Gallagher Hall, it was on the right side  and it was a place where you could get a bowl of chili for 15 cents and a  15  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  malt for 20 cents or 15 cents, and we could get breakfast in there for 15  cents, so it was one hang-out. And it had a dance floor that was about     oh, about as big as this area there   and the kids would come in there  and, particularly the soldiers and the WAVES. They had a jukebox and  that was where they danced or they went down on the weekend to the  Rock Castle, but there weren   t that many hang-outs. The bars over there  that   I went back to the campus one year and there was a whole street  of bars and full of beer joints. We never had any of that stuff. We were  too busy, and it was a busy time for people who were just thankful to be  alive.  Well, is there a place on campus that is special to you, that brings back  special memories?  Well, the building   Gallagher Hall itself. Of course they   ve revised the  building completely and the room that I slept in for years was gone. But  I did have one token that I got from Gallagher Hall. The first year I was  there, they recognized the fact that my feet spread out over the end of the  bed, this iron bed with a chicken-wire spring in it. So Mr. Iba prevailed  on the prison down at McAlester to build me a 7-1/2-foot single bed  made out of solid oak, and I had that for three years. When I graduated  from school, Mr. Iba says,    You can have your bed.    That   s the only  thing I ever got from Oklahoma State except for an education and all the  other things that went with it. So I borrowed a teammate   s car, put the  bed on top of the car, on top of the mattress, and drove out of Stillwater.  I had  25 in my pocket that I got from my dad and went to work for  Phillips Petroleum Company. That   s the way I left town.  Do you still have the bed?  Yes. Yeah, yeah. Still do, still do. It   s in the house in Oklahoma.  Now you did join Phillips Petroleum     That   s right.  Did you entertain any offers of playing professionally?  Well, there were two guys at the time that were the outstanding players  from the standpoint of notoriety. George Mikan was one of them and I  was the other one. George and I had offers to come into some pro teams  for maybe  15,000- 17,000, which was no small amount of money in  1946. On the other hand, I was born in a situation that was rather  difficult during the Depression and what I wanted was a job, stability,  opportunity, and a company that had some semblance of promise in the  future. Now Phillips Petroleum Company had a basketball team that  16  traveled around the United States and was used for public relations  purposes, and you understand that the idea of big arenas did not exist.  The arenas didn   t exist, but there were companies like Phillips, 20th  Century Fox, Allen Bradley Company, Goodyear Tire Rubber Company,  a bank in Denver, all of whom had a basketball team that was sanctioned  by the AAU, which controlled basketball in those years in the United  States. They were used for the purpose of spreading goodwill in the  name of the company that they were advertising.  Now, I looked at Phillips and there were two guys   two or three people  who had gone to work for Phillips from Oklahoma A M   a fella  named Harry Easter and another one named Cab Renick, who was a fine  basketball player, an Indian boy   who had gone to work for Phillips,  and they would come over and talk to me.    Why don   t you think about  Phillips?    So as time went by and the offers from cigar companies,  meat-packing companies   came in and they never talked in solid terms  about the exact amount of money or any warranty. If you tear up a knee,  are you gonna get your money   were they solvent, this and that and so  forth.  I finally made up my mind that I didn   t want all that pressure to have to  re-sell myself and what I really wanted, recognizing   and this was very  important   I knew what my personal skills and abilities were in terms of  the game of basketball. The way I played the game, somebody had to  throw me the ball. Now you   re going into a real bear   s den in terms of  going into professional sports where everybody wants to toot his own  horn and get the light to shine on him. If nobody throws me the ball,  what happens? I   m not very effective. Now, Phillips Petroleum  Company   it wasn   t that they had a basketball team that went around  the country getting beaten, but their purpose was not so much to win the  games but to spread the good name of Phillips Petroleum Company. It  was a safer place to go to Phillips Petroleum Company and I also had  friends within the company that assured me that Phillips    future in the  fertilizer business and the chemical business and the plastic business     and they had gotten into aviation fuels as a result of the work that they  did in the war   was a good solid company that had a lot of opportunity  associated with it.  So I went to work for Phillips at a salary that was equivalent to a young  graduate engineer and the company, in terms of the opportunities they  presented to me, was great. I was involved over the years in different  projects that were unique and groundbreaking. For instance, the way you  buy your gasoline today   well, there were three of us that were  instrumental in starting the whole business of self-service gasoline. I ran  a plastics company. I ran a fertilizer company and we developed and  promoted using anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer. I was a general sales  17  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  manager for the eastern United States   so all of those things happened  to me.  There were other basketball players   among them, Bill Martin, Pete  Silas, Paul Endicott   all of whom were Phillips basketball players who  were presidents or chairmen of the board, and the reason was, they  worked harder than I did. They did. I lived a life. I left my work in the  office at six o   clock at night and didn   t bring it home to my family. I had  a good family life and I traveled a lot, but it was a rewarding experience.  I   d do the same thing over again. Maybe if life   one of the basketball  players from Stillwater got  64 million dollars for five years   now, I   d  have to think about that. (Laughs) But in those days at that time with  what was going on with the potential insolvency of the basketball teams,  no big arenas, no TV, it was a dicey thing as to how you went. So I took  the safe road and fortunately it turned out to where I think I had a pretty  rewarding life.  And did you work in Oklahoma? Were you based in Oklahoma?  Oh, let   s see. We started out in Bartlesville. We went to Denver, to  Wichita, Kansas, to Memphis, Tennessee, back to Bartlesville, to  Cincinnati, Ohio, to Atlanta, Georgia, back to Bartlesville, and that   s  where we wound up the music.  And what year did you retire?  1985. So I   ve been retired for   gosh, what is that?    85, that   s twenty,  twenty-two, twenty-four years   twenty-four years? Phillips was a fine  company   had its problems, but their association with ConocoPhillips  today has preserved their company in a manner which fits. I think that  they   ve done a marvelous job.  And did you enjoy playing basketball with them?  Oh, yes. Yeah. We went to South America. Of course we traveled all  over the United States. We played about 66 to 70 games a year and we  played in small towns, big towns. And because of our association with  Phillips, and Phillips    association with AAU  Amateur Athletic Union ,  we were exposed to the Olympics. Had we not been associated with the  AAU, the opportunity to play in the Olympic games wouldn   t have  existed. So it all worked out fine.  Tell me about the Olympics. What was that experience like for you?  Well, the 1948 Olympics, the team was made up of those people who  had won the AAU   Amateur Athletic Union   basketball championship  18  and the NCAA championship. University of Kentucky, with Adolph  Rupp, had won the NCAA tournament, and Phillips won the AAU  portion of it. Then they played a game to see who would be the head  coach   Adolph Rupp or a man named Bud Browning. We beat them,  much to Mr. Rupp   s chagrin because we chose a black man named  Barksdale on our team, and Mr. Rupp wasn   t much of a guy that   well,  he   s a fella who never played a black man in his life.  But in any event, we went to London and we went to Wembley Stadium  for the opening ceremonies and that was one moment, a couple of  moments in the Olympic experience that were memorable to me. We  looked down and there were 3,000 athletes that are from here to that  other side of that telephone pole or further over there, and the war was  over. London was still partly in shambles, and when you flew over in an  airplane you could still see bombed-out buildings and craters and so  forth. You were sick and tired of the world being in a turmoil   so you  looked out there and the music was playing and the people were making  speeches and it just   I personally had hoped that the Olympics would  somehow bring people from all over the world into a common bond and  there would be some contribution toward peace and quiet and  cooperation. Well, that was a moving deal.  We went ahead and won the tournament, which wasn   t that difficult that  particular year. The Russians, however, came over and they didn   t enter  a team, but they brought people with cameras, tape recorders of sorts,  and notebooks, and they went to every game and made notes. Well in  1952, they came over with a bunch of guys that were pretty good  athletes, but were not polished as far as the game was concerned, and  they played a rough-and-tumble game. By this time, politics had entered  into it and Mr. Khrushchev and his buddies were broadcasting the idea  of world communism and so forth. The Russians lived in a separate  compound and we were over here in another one. We played them twice  and beat them both times, but it was well-rumored that their purpose in  life was to whip the United States for propaganda purposes, and it was  our purpose not to let that happen. And as a result, the games were tense  but not enjoyable from the standpoint of a basketball contest. It was a  political demonstration, so to speak.  The Argentineans and the French for that matter, got very upset during  the    48 deal where they accosted the referee and did him some damage.  The Chinese in    48 had a little Chinese guy that pretended to run through  my legs and we had a lot of fun. We stayed at Uxbridge in England,  which was the principal base for the British pilots that defended London,  and all that history was right there in front of us. We slept in the same  beds that these guys had used while fighting the war.  19  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Then when we went to Helsinki in 1952, the ambassador to Finland  invited the basketball team out to his country place and   this is an  interesting story   and everybody had to take a sauna bath. Do you know  what a sauna bath is? A sauna bath is you get in a little cubicle and it   s  heated with hot stones actually, and you get in there and you perspire.  You   re naked and you beat yourself with birch boughs. Then you   re  supposed to go out and jump in the cold water. Well, at the  ambassador   s home, the men went into the sauna bath first and they  jumped in the lake and came out. Then the ladies went in and they were  all in the lake here and they   re nude up to their chins in the water, and  one of them looked up and right there by   see where the telephone pole  is over there   there   s a guy sitting up there in a watch tower with a rifle.  This one lady says,    Oh, my goodness.    She said,    There   s a man up  there with a gun,    and the hostess said,    Yes,    she says,    that   s a  Russian soldier.    And this lady ducked under the water, you know, and  the lady said,    Oh, my dear. Don   t be upset. I hardly think you   ll see  him at tea.    (Laughter) But we had things like that go on.  I had a great time. And you met people that were marvelous athletes and  got to spend a little time with them. You came to appreciate the fact that  there are some wonderful, wonderful, wonderful people that are  involved in sports and most of those that are on top are pretty good  folks.  Now you were the first athlete to win back-to-back     Yeah, yeah.     two gold medals?  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure did. Those things go so fast that it   s too bad. I  took a thousand pictures with a little Argus C-3 in those days. After the  games were over and in London, we went over to Paris for three days  and we did drink a little champagne and a good thing I took the camera.  (Laughter)  You could blackmail a few teammates, I would think. All right. Now  what year were you inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame?  1961, and it was before the present physical facilities for the Basketball  Hall of Fame were erected. And between then and now I was president  of the Basketball Hall of Fame for several years. The Basketball Hall of  Fame was founded mostly by college coaches, but halls of fame and  churches are much alike. It   s easy to build this church out of stone and  have a building and so forth, but that   s not the principal problem. The  principal problem is keeping it going. Where do you get the money and  20  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  the support that you need to keep the church going? Well, putting up  edifices for people that have achieved some fame in a sport isn   t a very  smart thing to do because many of the people that are involved in it have  better use for their money than to continue to blow their own horn, you  know. So what happened was that the Basketball Hall of Fame as we  know it today is now supported by the NBA.  The NBA has gobbled up everything it can related to basketball, and it  isn   t that the NBA doesn   t do an excellent job of running the programs  that are the proper programs for the Basketball Hall of Fame in terms of  selecting people who should, and rightfully, be recognized as  contributors to the game, it   s the fact that they   re gonna do it the way the  NBA wants to do it rather than the    old guard.    But the coaches who  originally founded the Basketball Hall of Fame have all disappeared,  men like Mr. Iba or Adolph Rupp for that matter who   in spite of his  personal likes and dislikes   was a great basketball coach; Phog Allen  from Kansas, Dutch Lonberg from Northwestern University,  Joe   Lapchick from St. John   s, or Harold  Howard  Cann from New York  University   all those men were men who dedicated their lives to the  sport and the game of basketball. They ran the thing, but they had no  way of generating the money necessary to sustain it and to carry on the  expenses that are involved in running something like that, and from your  personal experience, you know that that   s hard to do.  Well, you can   t be critical of the NBA and yet you don   t like the fact  that it is now associated with an organization whose basic purpose is to  make money. You would like to have it on a basis of something that is  not related to money all the time, but it works out well, and it exists  today. If you   ve never seen it, it   s a great tribute to the game and to the  people who have participated in the sport from the coaches down to the  contributors to the people like good announcers who have spread the  gospel for the game. It should be supported from other aspects in the  modern world for what the NBA is doing for it. But the game changes  just as the rules change. We changed the rules on goal-tending and that  type of thing. That   s an interesting story real quick. People say,    Well,  why did they change the goal-tending rule?    Are you a golfer?  No, I   m not.  Okay. Is your husband a golfer?  Yes.  Okay. Is he a pretty good golfer?  No.  21  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Okay. If he   s a bad golfer   good golfer or bad golfer   if you   ll give me  two chances, called    gotcha   s,    I can whip anybody in the world playing  golf. Now, what   s a    gotcha?    A    gotcha    is where the guy stands up on  the tee and he   s right on his backswing and about the time he   s right  about up to where he   s just about to come back, you take your own club  and you jam it up between his legs, and he kind of gets upset. Well,  that   s one    gotcha.    Now the second    gotcha,    you stand behind him  and he gets back there, and he doesn   t know what   s coming   you   ve got  him   a    gotcha    and you don   t have to spend your    gotcha.     In basketball, when they used to throw the ball up in the air with the idea  of it coming down through the basket and you would go get the ball  before it got into the cylinder of the basket   the next time he shot the  ball, it wasn   t the fact that he didn   t shoot it properly, but we knew if he  shot it properly it was gonna be knocked down   he thought. Now, that  made the goal-tending a psychological problem for the players. It was  not fair because only the very tall or agile people could do it. It   s not a  fair rule, it   s not a fair deal, and so it was the best thing in the world to  get rid of it and we perfected that. We got to the point where we ran a  defense that was built around goal-tending, and we had    gotcha   s    all  afternoon (Laughter) or all evening on them. It was a bad rule and so  Oklahoma State, or Oklahoma A M, and Mr. Iba particularly, was one  of those who advocated we not allow anybody to touch that ball coming  down toward that basket. Now today you still see these guys today, and  particularly in pro basketball who are great athletes who can get the ball  going up, so that   s fair because the other guys can still do that.  Then the other thing is that we got involved in the    dunk.    When they  outlawed the    dunk    they really outlawed it because of guys like  Chamberlain. Wilt and Jabar were so agile and big enough that they  could throw the ball down. Some said,    Well, that   s not fair.    But in the  early days, the    dunk    was outlawed not because it was an unfair  advantage, it was because the rims wouldn   t bend when they hit them.  So if you threw the ball down and your hand came down on the rim and  bent it down, you know what you had to do? You had to go back and get  the step ladder with the janitor and bring it back on the court and push  the goal back up so you could finish the game. Now they   ve got goals  that spring back   so the    dunk    can come back, and that   s what you see  with all these guys who are making the crowd happy by doing the     dunk.    The    dunk    is a spectacular thing, but it doesn   t really  contribute to the scoring aspect of the game. But we were involved in  that kind of thing and it made for interest in the game and got your name  spread around the newspapers.  What   s your favorite basketball moment?  22  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  The favorite basketball moment   I mentioned a man named Sam  Aubrey who when I came to Stillwater in 1942 was my first roommate.  He was one of those juniors who was going off to war and he went to  war and he got shot in Sicily, right through the hip. He came back in the  spring of 1945, and he came up the walk toward Mr. Iba   s office and I  was over there. I hung around there quite a bit because I lived there. And  Sam came up   he was married at the time   with his new wife and he  was on crutches, and I was standing there watching him come up the  walk and he came into Mr. Iba   s office on this spring day in    45. Mr.  Iba says,    Come in my office, boy.    So Sam went in there and he was in  there for about, oh, twenty minutes or so. Came out and took his  crutches and waved goodbye and went on down the walk. Mr. Iba was  standing there and he said,    My, God. That boy wants to come back here  and play basketball,    and he   d made him a promise. He said,    I told him  that if he came back, he   d have his athletic scholarship.     So Sam came back and we started basketball practice and we ran  exercises where you ran forward, sideways, and moved your feet and so  forth, and invariably Sam   s hip would give out and he   d fall down. I was  running right alongside of him one day and his leg collapsed and he was  lying on the floor and Mr. Iba came over and in his own gruff way says,     Boy,    he says,    are you all right?    Sam   s part Indian   he   s a Yuchi  Indian   and he says,    Yes, sir. I   m okay.    We played through the  season, and when we were standing on the floor getting the award for  the national championship, Sam was the first-string guard. He had more  guts than any guy I   ve ever, ever seen, and I suspect that I got more  satisfaction out of associating myself with him than anybody else I ever  played with. He   s quite a guy.  Absolutely. Well, Oklahoma State is a very interesting school. The  students and alumni have such loyalty for this institution. What do you  think it is that sparks this loyalty?  I can   t tell you what it is today because I really don   t know, and I don   t  know whether or not we   re going in the right direction in terms of this  constant emphasis on gaining notoriety through athletics and seeking  support, financial support and other kinds of support. I think Mr. Pickens  has a right to do what he wants with his own money, but I don   t know  that we   re   under today   s circumstance in the country and with the  needs of the people, that we wouldn   t be better off finding ways to  guarantee that the brightest have every opportunity to go as far as they  possibly can. If we don   t have a university that works toward the time  when the brightest children and the brightest young men and women that  we can find are receiving as much education as they choose to absorb  and to go as far as they can go based on their abilities, then we   re  making a mistake.  23  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  I don   t know whether or not putting money sources in athletics is right  or wrong because I don   t understand the workings. I   m told that when  they have winning athletic teams, the contributions and support from the  alumni is much greater than otherwise. Because I don   t know anything  about that, I can   t say I   m right or wrong. But I know one thing   that  we make a mistake if we don   t make sure that our students are getting  every   our best students now   our best students and not the hangers-on  or the kids who are going because their folks want to get them out of the  house, but if we don   t take our assets and make better people out of our  brightest minds, we   re making a mistake.  Athletics is a great thing and a great unifier in a university, in building  spirit and loyalty and financial support eventually, if you have  something of which you can maintain a sense of pride in. And I think at  Oklahoma State, there is that feeling that there is still a great deal of  integrity, a great deal of honesty, of independent thinking and self-reliance  that some schools don   t have. They   ve still got it at Oklahoma  State. You can see in the people   s eyes as you watch them when you  come to a game like that. It   s an interesting place, and my two daughters  went to school there   one of them went on and got a MBA degree and  the other one has two degrees from Oklahoma State, so it   s treated us  fairly and deserves credit.  My two sisters wanted to come to Oklahoma A M. I requested an  appointment with Dr. Bennett. His office called me in a day or so, and I  said,    Could you please look into the possibility of getting my sisters     out-of-state fees waived, because they were both working their way  through school?    We didn   t have money. And he says,    Oh, yes, Bob. I  think I can handle that.    But that was the only thing I ever asked for     well outside of a great experience and an education of sorts, (laughs)  which is my fault for not expanding. Oklahoma A M was a great place  to spend four great years.  Well, do you have any advice for students today?  Utilize your time because that   s the only thing that we   re all given. If  you don   t plan to use your time in today   s world and capitalize on that,  you   re not going to win the race.  I was fishing with a man up in Canada, a very successful businessman. I  said,    Why are you a success?    He answered,    Because I use my time. I  use every minute, I plan every minute of my day. This isn   t to say that I  don   t have time for relaxation and pleasure but I plan it. I use time.     Americans have got where their hips are too wide.  (Laughs) Well is there anything you   d like to mention that we haven   t  24  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  Kurland  Nykolaiszyn  spoken about today?  No, no, no, I don   t think so. I could go off in a thousand directions and  tell you lots of little stories, but I think we   ve covered a lot of ground.  What   s your favorite story from your college days? Do you have that  one story you always tell when the family gets together?  Oh, gee. No, I guess, not a favorite story. I met Pete Maravich     you  know Pete Maravich? Pete was a great basketball player. He died when  he was 42 years old, I think, but he was one of the best I   ve ever seen.  He played at LSU. He said,    Oh, Mr. Kurland, it   s a pleasure to know  you. You   re a legend.    I said,    Pete, the thing about legends is that that   s  exactly what they are. You can believe them if you want to, but you  don   t have to. If it makes you feel good to believe the legend, then  believe the legend.     Well, I appreciate you taking time out to meet with me today. It   s been  wonderful hearing your stories from back during Oklahoma A M days.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. There   s a lot that a lady shouldn   t know. (Laughs)  Understandable, understandable.  -------  -------
