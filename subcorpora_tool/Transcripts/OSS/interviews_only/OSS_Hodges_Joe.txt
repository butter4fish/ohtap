 Gill and I   m interviewing Joe Hodges in the  ConocoPhillips Alumni Center on the campus of Oklahoma State  University. This interview is being conducted on September 19th, 2008.  It   s part of the O-STATE Stories Project. Joe, what years were you at  OSU?  I started OSU in September of 1941 and went two years, volunteered for  the service in February of 1943. This was a time that we didn   t stay in  the service very long I was in the service 13 months and I ended up in  North Africa. I spent two years in North Africa and Italy and went  through Sicily and got back. Was discharged from Camp Chaffee,  Arkansas on Thanksgiving of 1946. My mother and sister were still  living here in Stillwater, so I came home and then enrolled in the spring  semester of    47 and graduated at midterm    47-   48. But I moved to  Stillwater in 1937, so I   ve seen Oklahoma A M and OSU grow through  the years.  You graduated from Stillwater High School?  Stillwater High School, yes.  Joe, you   re famous in Stillwater for emceeing a lot of the class reunions.  Yes, up until a few years ago, we had a Stillwater High School class  reunion every five years and somehow I became the designated  spokesperson, we said spokesman at that time, for the class and I was  emcee of the banquet. All the Stillwater kiddos did all the work and I got  to come and do the speech making at the banquet and plan the program.  I had a good time and I   m getting ready to go to another one this  weekend.  Can you tell us a little bit about your experiences, the split experience at  5  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  OSU with the war intervening? I think you were class officer one year.  Well, in Stillwater High School I started taking journalism classes and  ended up writing high school sports for the Stillwater Daily Press at that  time. Stillwater News was weekly and they subsequently bought out the  Stillwater Press and it became the Stillwater NewsPress. But a man  named Otis Wilde was editor of the Stillwater Press and when they sold  out, he became Information Publicity rep for the athletic department. I  graduated, so I went to work for the O   Collegian, writing sports, and  Mr. Wilde got me all acquainted with everybody in the athletic  department. This was when Mr. Henry Iba was basketball coach. Ed  Gallagher was still living and was athletic director at that time. They  didn   t have a golf team, but they formed a golf team during those years.  There was an economics professor named Labron Harris who then  became the golf coach, and I   ve been just amazed and pleased with the  success with the golfing program since that time.  Jim Lookabaugh became football coach. I had the misfortune of not  going through those good football years when Bobby Fenimore was  running wild because (laughs) I was running wild over in North Africa  and Italy. So, I didn   t get to see those winning football teams, but I spent  I guess two years before the war as sports editor of the O   Collegian and,  of course, the entire student press was right over here in a little building  where the post office is now. And that   s where everything was. Clement  Trout was head of the journalism school. I was able to pay my way  through school, and thank goodness for the G.I. Bill when I got that  because that made it a lot easier. I had a little more time to do things, but  I took my degree in journalism and had a minor in economics. Didn   t  know why. But after the newspaper business, ended up being a banker  for almost fifty years (laughs), so it   s been an interesting career for me.  Where did you spend most of your banking career?  When I graduated in midterm of    47 and    48, I went to work for the  Shawnee News Star in Shawnee as sports editor and later became senior  editor of the Shawnee News Star. A bunch of my classmates from here at  A M or OSU that I had worked with at the O   Collegian and the student  publication were Jim Scott, Brad Carlisle, Ross Davis, Tommy Steph, a  photographer named Lofty Mann and then Speck Gammon, Harold  Gammon from down in the Seminole territory here. All ended up at the  Odessa American which was a daily newspaper in Odessa. I went out to  visit with them at a New Year   s party in west Texas and they tried to get  me to join them at the Odessa American. I told them I was working for a  better newspaper than they had and they said,    Well, the chamber of  commerce had a manager resign and they   re looking for a manager.  Why don   t you apply for that job?    So, just on a whim, I did. They hired  6  Gill  Hodges  me there in Odessa while I was there. So, I gave two weeks    notice and  moved to Odessa, Texas in 1948 and spent one year with the chamber of  commerce and the bank which was the First National Bank of Odessa, at  that time. They decided they wanted me more than the chamber did, so I  became a banker in January of 1950. I finally retired when I was 75  years old. In 1998 I retired from the banking business and have been  playing golf, fishing and enjoying life.  Joe, can you remember some of the leadership activities, opportunities  that you were engaged in when you were a student?  Yes, I surely do. I guess as most of us came from pretty poor  background, working was necessary. As a matter of fact, I   ll tell you that  my mother raised five of us kids. My father saw fit to desert us when I  was about six years old. She moved us to Stillwater after my older sister  had graduated and my other sister got married. My brother had  graduated from high school in Chickasha in 1929 and had gone to work  for the new Soil Conservation Services at that time, and was a good  man, but his boss told him,    You can go a long way in this business, but  unless you have a college degree, you   re not going to accomplish what  you have the ability to do.    After that, from 1929 to 1937, he and my  mother and my sister, Sylvia, and I moved to Stillwater. There was never  any question that we were going to go to college. But my brother,  Robert, who graduated from here and also got his master   s from here,  came up and worked on the college farms and we lived on the dairy out  north of town. It was close enough during football games, I could hear  the loud speaker when I was out mixing feed and pumping water for  those cows, but we moved to Stillwater.  It was the greatest thing that ever happened to me because I was exposed  to the college atmosphere while I was still in high school. I started in  ninth grade here and graduated from Stillwater High. But I think  Whitehurst Hall was just being finished when we moved here and that  North Murray Hall was built. I think that there were 3,000 and 3,500  students at A M, at that time. One of my real memories was the  building of the 4-H Club building when they sold bricks all over the  state of Oklahoma and built the athletic center that   s here now.  But on Sunday, the Sunday of Pearl Harbor, I heard the radio at Swim   s  Campus Shop about the attack on Pearl Harbor because we didn   t have a  radio at home. And then on Monday, President Bennett had called a  student meeting at the 4-H Club building and we heard President  Roosevelt   s speech there about the problem at Pearl Harbor.  I watched that building  Gallagher-Iba . We thought it was magnificent  at that time and it was, and to look at it today, I just feel amazed every  7  Gill  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  time. But my interest primarily was in the area of athletics and it was my  privilege to become personally acquainted with those coaches and  athletic directors. It   s been interesting to me over the years wherever  I   ve been that if you run into somebody who has any interest in  basketball or college basketball and you mention the name Henry P. Iba,  they come,    Oh, did you know Mr. Iba? Yes, you know him.    It   s been a  good connection for me.  You were also active in student government. Were you a class officer  one year?  Yes, I got involved in, not the first year, but during my sophomore year I  got into all the political campus politics and representative and the  independent parties and all of those things that went with it, and I was  elected president of the sophomore class. Then I went to the service and  went overseas. I was also president of my junior class and my senior  class. So, I got my picture in three pages of the Redskin. (Laughs)  Which party were you with, Joe?  Oh, I was independent.  Independent, okay.  Yes, I was a hometown boy. They wouldn   t even let me in a frat house.  Obviously, you   ve talked about some very fond memories you   ve had at  OSU. How did those experiences shape you in your life?  Well, just the fact, I recognized I think that I was going to college and  getting a degree just meant so much to you and I   ve seen it play out over  the years because I had three children, lost two of them. I have a son  who is fifty-five years old now and I got him to college, but he never did  make it and he has regretted to this day that he doesn   t have a college  degree. He   s done very well, but he even two years ago was threatening  going back to night school and getting enough hours to get his college  degree. But, it has shaped my life. The people, the friendships I made,  the basic understanding of what counts in life. I had no earthly idea I  would ever end up in the banking business, but I was a banker for almost  fifty years and I wouldn   t pay for the experience. Dealing with people  and those basic lessons you learn, there   s no way you can pay for it.  Are there some special people that made a difference for you at OSU  that you recall?  Well, yes, I really do. I was thinking about the people who were here. I  8  Gill  Hodges  remember Clarence McElroy, Dean McElroy, with a great deal of  affection. And I had the opportunity to meet and know Henry G.  Bennett, not real well, but personally enough to speak to across the  campus. And his career and the legacy he left has been most impressive  to me. I had a professor named O.D. Duncan who was the head of the  department of rural sociology. Now, don   t ask me why I took sociology  courses, but I did and Dr. Duncan was a real influence on me. He took a  personal interest in me and wanted me to become a sociologist and I  said,    No, Dr. Duncan, I   m going to get my degree in journalism.    And  he said,    You mean to tell me that you would rather be a regurgitating  reporter than be a sociologist?    I didn   t really know what a sociologist  did, but he had a great deal of influence on me.  Long before that, I had started carrying newspapers in Rush Springs,  Oklahoma. We lived there for a while, and then I had a paper route for  the Daily Oklahoman here in Stillwater. My route was out in this area of  college and so many of the college professors, teachers, and deans were  my customers. I was their paper boy while I was in high school. Then  being involved in student publications and writing stories and doing  reporting. I would do the makeup, and you meet a lot of people and  interview a lot of people. I   ve said this many times and I wouldn   t  suggest it for anybody else, but I think, probably, to be successful in  what I thought journalism was really about in those days and being a  reporter, it takes a wider range of knowledge and background and  understanding to be a good newspaper reporter than almost anything  anybody ever taught you. If you   re going to write intelligently about  something, you have to know or learn where to go to get the information  to make an intelligible, interesting story. I credit the journalism school  and the classes that I took here at OSU for helping me be a success in  the banking business because it taught me how to get along with people.  Are there any particular special memorable moments you had at OSU  that you can think of?  Oh, many of them. I remember the Sadie Hawkins dances that we used  to have because the first time in my life, and I was   I didn   t date a lot in  my younger days, and I don   t know why, but I didn   t think I had the  ability to do it. They had a Sadie Hawkins dance and a young lady, a  member of one of the sororities, called and asked me for a date for Sadie  Hawkins, and that was a highlight in my life (laughter) to be asked for a  date from somebody. There were so many things that took place.  One, and this is purely a personal thing, but I don   t know whether you  remember Lewis Stadium, how it used to be before they started, but  back in    40 and    41, when Lookabaugh was coach and Bobby Fenimore  was playing here, and I don   t remember all of those football players, but  9  Gill  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  we didn   t very often beat OU. We always said,    Beat OU,    but we were  taking on Oklahoma University here at Lewis Field, and I was sports  editor of the O   Collegian. I don   t remember whether this was before the  war or after, but I had talked to the press man over at the O   Collegian  and we had published a paper that morning that I hadn   t even pulled the  lead story in the headline. I sat up there in the little old press box in  Lewis Field as the football game was going and was able to write the  story of the first three quarters, pretty much just a play-by-play. But  when the game just about winding down we had a one-point lead over  OU, and I had a kid on the bicycle down below the press box. I finished  that story and dropped it down to him, and he bicycled across the  campus and they set up that story and printed it.    A M Beats OU.    Had  a headline and they had them back over there, and we were distributing  newspapers as the fans left the stadium. I consider that to be one of the  highlights of my journalism experience  (Laughs) It was taking the  chance though   but back in those days that if you were ahead with a  few minutes to go, you were probably going to win that ball game. So,  anyway, nobody believes me when I tell them that story, but it   s the  truth.  Do you feel proud about where the university is going? You see all the  buildings and the tech.  I don   t get back nearly as much as I used to. My sister still lives here and  we used to   well, Thanksgiving was always spent in Stillwater, but a lot  of things happened in our lives over the course, and I don   t get back as  nearly as often. Every time I come back, it is just unbelievable to me  what has happened up here. Last night I drove in, it was still daylight. I  can   t believe what has happened on west Sixth Street and all in that area  and all the way across. I live in Lubbock now and I know what Texas  Tech means to Lubbock. I know what a university means to a  community. Stillwater may have been here when Oklahoma A M was  founded here, but Stillwater owes its position primarily to the impact of  OSU. It   s just made a tremendous difference.  Joe, anything we haven   t covered that you   d like to say? Something  special?  Oh, this is sort of a surprise to both of us that in recent years, my  community of interest has shifted so much. I left here and went to  Odessa, and then ended up with a bank in uptown Houston, Medical  Center National Bank right in the heart of Houston Medical Center. That  bank changed hands and I didn   t like the new situation, so I found a little  bank that was available for sale in Abilene, Texas. So, I bought control  and interest of Abilene National Bank in August of 1968 and moved to  Abilene, and Abilene became my town. The banker in the town in those  10  Gill  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  days and   of course, there were three universities or colleges there in  Abilene. Abilene Christian, McMurry and Hardin-Simmons, and being  the town banker, I was involved with the leadership of those three  universities and became interested. Then I sold that bank and still got  eleven years in the oil business, and wondered the first few years why I  spent the years in banking. I made more money in a year and a half in  the oil business than I had made in thirty years in the banking business.  A year and a half later, I was broke and owed a million and a half dollars  after I sold everything I owned, (laughs) and at fifty-five years old I got  a chance to start paying that million and a half dollars back, which I did,  and finally ended up in a little bank in Stanton, Texas just halfway  between Midland and Big Spring. I turned the losing situation around  and built it up, and got to the money making problem, and when I was  seventy-five years old, I sold it and have been able to enjoy life since  then.  You stayed out of the oil business.  (Laughs) Stayed out of the oil business. I wouldn   t think for the time  that I wondered while I was in it why I didn   t get a degree in geology. It  was the most fascinating field I   ve ever been in. But I guess once a  banker, always a banker.  You just can   t get away from it.  Those of us in student publications had our organization was called the  Press Club. Anybody involved in any of the student publications, the  O   Collegian, the Redskin, the Aggievator, any of these could be a  member of the Press Club, and our main event each year was to stage the  Varsity Review. This is Jimmy Baker who was the drum major who had  the first strut and he formed a dance band, Jimmy Baker.  The Collegians.  Yes, they had a Sunday afternoon radio program out of Miles Student  Store that everybody would attend   was Brooks when it started, but  then it became Miles. But as president of the Press Club while I was in  school, I drew the chore of being the emcee for the Varsity Review, and  we always had a real good time at that. As a matter of being involved in  the Press Club, we began to study and we found that Sigma Delta Chi  was the professional journalistic fraternity. So, we made arrangements     a group of us went up to the National Convention of Sigma Delta Chi in  Washington, D.C. I met some of the officials, and we were invited to  request admission and form a chapter of Sigma Delta Chi on the  Oklahoma A M campus. So, we applied and the Oklahoma A M Press  Club became a chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, and I was the charter  11  Gill  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  Gill  Hodges  president on the campus.  Great.  That was something I wanted to remember and I forgot it.  That   s been a long history, a tradition of Oklahoma State, Varsity  Review.  Oh, yes.  Can you tell us a little bit about Varsity Review?  All the different organizations, both independent organizations and the  sororities and the fraternities, would work up an act and we would have  elimination and competition. A group of judges from the Press Club  would select the groups that were going to be in the Varsity Review, and  it was a big affair. We always had a good time with dancing and music  and jokes. I talked to Frank Martin and Cowboy Quartet, all the  entertainers that he was responsible for sponsoring. Some of them did  well and, of course, everybody knows Jimmy Baker   s story after leaving  here and going to Hollywood and producing movies. He was just a good  old Oklahoman boy that did well. But the Varsity Review was a big  thing in those days. I don   t remember whether it still is today or not.  Still is.  Good, good. Okay. Thank you.  -------  -------
