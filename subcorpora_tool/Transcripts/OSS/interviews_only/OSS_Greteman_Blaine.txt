 Gill. Today is May 13, 2009 and I   m visiting with Dr.  Blaine Greteman on the Oklahoma State University campus in  Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-State Stories Project of  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Blaine, thanks for taking  time from your duties as a visiting professor of English at Oklahoma  State to visit with me. I   m not sure if you have all of your finals graded  yet.  I do. The final grades are submitted. It   s a pretty good feeling.  As OSU   s only Rhodes Scholar, you   re very special to this institution,  Blaine, and we   re proud of your scholarly accomplishments. But if you  don   t mind me saying so, your background and education from a small  rural community in western Oklahoma doesn   t seem as likely a path to  academic success and Rhodes Scholarship. So, there   s got to be some  unique stories, and we   ll talk about them. But first, I   ve got to ask you  this question: were you named for Blaine County?  No, I wasn   t. It   s funny because, purely coincidentally, that   s where we  ended up. I graduated living   well, the high school gym was in Blaine  County and the high school was in Caddo. No, I think it was one of  those deals where my mom actually looked around in a baby book until  she found it. It   s funny because it   s a really   a reporter a while back for  the Chronicle of Education described it as a real WASPy  White Anglo-  Saxon Protestant  name. There was a story they did about the trend, or  the funny thing that happened one year, where all of the ivy leagues got  shut out, and some of us won the Rhodes from schools that were sort of  non-traditional Rhodes winners, and he mentioned the only thing  particularly WASPy about my background and me was my name.  Speaking of that, can you share some information about your early life,  where you grew up, your family?  5  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Sure. I was born in Yukon where my dad started as a drama teacher and  then he became a vice principal. Then we moved down to Blanchard,  which is a little town just south of Norman. I don   t know if you called it  southeast or just south central. But at Blanchard, he was the principal  there for several years, and my mom was a special ed teacher in  Newcastle, near there. So, I was there until the seventh grade. Blanchard  used to have a sign outside that said    Toughest Little Town in  Oklahoma.    (Laughter) It could be that way. And then from there we  moved out to western Oklahoma, which is where my parents were from,  to Hydro which was a tiny, tiny town. My dad took a job as  superintendent there, and my mom was a guidance counselor. That was  kind of moving back out to where they were from. Both my  grandparents were farmers in rural western Oklahoma, from the Burns  Flat/Elk City area. They were big German Catholic families out there. I  mean, when the guy said the only thing not WASPy was my name, he   s  really right. We were sort of German Catholic Oklahomans. There   s a  real enclave of Catholics living out in that part of the state. And so, that  is where I came from and that   s where I graduated high school from was  Hydro. My high school class had fifteen in it, I believe. So, it was a tiny,  tiny little school, but it was a good school.  Did you have any brothers and sisters?  Yes, Autumn. My sister Autumn is three years younger and has actually  moved back out to that part of the state now. She   s living out there. She  gave up a job teaching English to work for one of those companies that  puts ankle bracelets on for prisoners, which I think she thought was sort  of easier and more rewarding in some ways than teaching high school  English. (Laughs) I always tell that story to my students when they   re  considering a career in English. So, my little sister was Autumn and by  the time she was graduated, my folks had moved down to Lindsay, and  dad took a job as superintendent there which is where he   s about to retire  this year. So, we moved around a little bit, but we usually stayed a pretty  good stretch in each place. I got to see a few different parts of the state  and live in a couple different parts of the state. Although, except for  when I was little bitty, they were always very small. When I was a little  kid, we lived in Yukon, which was a lot smaller then, actually, than it is  now. Blows my mind when I go by that place now. But everywhere else  we went was very small-town. My dad is one of those people who really  likes to move into a town and sort of take it on as a project. So, about the  time he really got everything running smoothly, we   d move on, usually  to a little bit bigger school. But he   d move around, do a couple big  things, pass a bond issue or two, and then five or six years later, move  on to another town.  Blaine, what were some values and lessons you learned growing up that  6  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  helped shape and influence you as you were growing up?  Well, definitely education was really central, just because coming from a  family of educators like that. And when we were in Blanchard, I   d ride  to school every morning with my dad in the pickup, and then after  school was over, I   d go down and hang out in his office, run around the  school. And the school was really   I was talking about this with Mandi  the other day. It   s a great place to grow up around. I loved having the  run of a school because you   re around books and science labs, and I   d  go bug the high school science teacher and he   d show me the chickens  they were hatching or whatever. So, I think that actually   the more I   ve  thought about it lately, I think growing up in that environment was  formative in terms of wanting to be an educator.  What about the small town values?  Well, the other thing is I think I   ve become a very hard worker. I scrap  pretty hard, I think, for what I   ve got. And that came from both the small  town and from the rural upbringing. I mean, my grandparents were  tenant farmers who eventually got their own land. And my grandmother,  who was alive all the way until   she died when I was living in London,  but I   d come back and stay pretty good stretches with her throughout.  There were two things she would say that they can   t take away from  you. One was land. They   re not making land anymore; they can   t take  that away from you. And the other was education. She didn   t have a high  school education herself. I think she finished in eighth grade. She  believed very strongly in it because of that. It was the path forward, and  it was something that was valuable to work at. So, I always worked hard  at it. And that   s the thing that I think I really got from the small town.  And also   well, the thing that I tell my students here, just the belief that  wherever you come from, there are people of value in all parts of our  country, in all parts of the world, basically. The attitude that really bugs  me more than just about any is the idea that because you   re from a small  town or rural area or something that you   re a hick and you are   well, I  mean, you might be a hick, but the idea that a hick might not be just as  smart as somebody who was born in major urban areas. I mean, I love  urban areas, and the same logic applies to the kids who are born in the  slums and those areas.  It   s just amazing how pervasive that attitude is and how much kids  internalize it. I mean, even the students that I deal with here. I was  talking to my class this semester and I said something to them about how  I was grading them the same way that I graded my students at Oxford or  I graded my students at Berkeley, because I felt like they could achieve  at the same level as those kids or the kids at Harvard or anyplace else.  And they actually broke out laughing. And it   s part of their humility,  7  Gill  Greteman  which I think a lot of us have, as well, from that background. We   re  taught to be humble, but that can be, when it   s taken to an extreme and  you internalize it, sort of not being just as good as others, it can hold you  back. So, anyway, I felt like I needed to work hard and, maybe, like I  had something to prove.  You talked about hard work. What were some things that you did, jobs  you had, as a kid growing up?  I did chop cotton, actually. I   m probably the last kid that chopped cotton,  I think, in the country. They don   t hardly do it anymore because shortly  after, they started this Roundup thing. They spray Roundup, so nobody  chops cotton anymore. But I think my dad took it into his head that  chopping cotton   this is just pre-Roundup   it would be character-building  as a summer job. So, my grandpa was still raising cotton and he  was mostly using, probably, migrant workers, immigrant workers. I went  out with them and chopped cotton for a summer. That was an interesting  job. I think it gave me some insight into my grandmother   s belief system  and the reason it was so important to them that we do get educated and  not waste it. I mean, it was actually good. I   ve got a lot of great  memories, but it   s hard, hard work. It   s very hard work. I remember the  one week we were doing it and it never dropped below a hundred   degrees . That week it was just awful. And so I did that.  I did a lot of manual labor. I always worked in the summer which was  one of the things that I thought was going to hold me back from the  Rhodes, because a lot of the kids who do the Rhodes do internships and  travel and things like that. But I worked for many years as a hot-tar  roofer. I worked a lot in high school to pay for a truck and buy my first  guitar and stuff like that. I also worked in a nursing home. Actually, the  nursing home was the job that I used to buy, well, it was my second  guitar. It was a more expensive guitar than the first. But I worked in a  nursing home, I guess, my senior year in high school in the kitchen. So, I  had a lot of pretty menial jobs and they were all hard work, and I  actually learned a lot from them.  The job as a hot-tar roofer, I worked with this great guy named  Lawrence Hart. He was an old World War II Vet who had, pretty much,  lost his hearing over in   he was firing the anti-aircraft guns. He was  over in Europe; I can   t remember where. I know he was in France for  part of the time he was there. He never used the phone, partly because he  was hard of hearing and partly because he was so laid back. He never  used a phone. So, if he was going to go out and talk to a guy forty or  fifty miles away about doing a job, putting a roof on a school or  something, he   d hop in his old pickup and we would just drive about  forty miles per hour. You know, spend an hour, hour and a half driving  8  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  there. If the guy wasn   t there in his office, he   d say,    Well, I guess we   ll  catch him next time.    We   d turn around and go off in the truck and drive  back. He was at the point in his life where nothing was going to rush  him. It was just fascinating. He was a really fascinating guy. He worked  hard. He worked all the way up, I think, until the day he died. He was  about eighty-eight when he died a couple of years back. And he had that  combination of work ethic and perspective. I think having lived the life  he had lived, everything was in perspective. I remember when I came  here, I CLEPped  College Level Examination Program  out of my  freshman composition classes. The essay question was something about,     describe a person or an experience that has been influential,    and I  wrote about those summers driving around with Lawrence at about forty  miles per hour, watching the countryside go by, and it was sort of an  interesting combination of working really hard and also taking things in  stride. I think it was pretty formative in terms of my personality in a lot  of ways. Or maybe that   s just the reason I put up  with it . Maybe I  already had inclinations that way, and that   s why I put up with working  that. I mean, that was hot, hard work. You do it in the middle of the  summer. I   d come home covered head-to-toe in tar. I   m surprised my  mom put up with that, actually   You were talking about your grandmother a couple of times before.  What generation away from Germany were they?  My grandpa was German. She was actually Russian. She was from what  they called White Russia, and she was first generation. Her mother  spoke Russian.  There was a core family of Lithuanian citizens in that area wasn   t there?  Yes, there were. Lithuanians and German-Catholics, as well, right up in  that area. So, that was her background, and her mom was the first to  come over, her mom and dad. So, she actually has brothers buried in  Lithuania. I   ve always wanted to go over and track down that area. And  I guess when she was a little girl she spoke it, but by the time I knew her  she couldn   t ever remember any of the language. It   s amazing how fast  they acclimated in that generation. It   s unbelievable.  About when did they move to Oklahoma?  I believe they moved here in the teens, sometime in the teens, right  before she was born. My grandpa was born in 1912, and I think she was  born in 1917. I think they got here just right before. Now, my  grandfather   s family actually had settled   they came over from Iowa. I  mean, they came from Germany to Iowa. I just recently discovered  there   s tons of them up there. And then the family kind of split off. They  9  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  got here right about that time period. He was born in Oklahoma in 1912,  and I think he might have been the first kid that was actually born here.  So, yes, they got here pretty early. They weren   t here in time to make the  Land Run, but I think land was still relatively cheap.  I   ve got to ask you, what kind of truck did you have?  I had a    70 Chevy. My dad     Was it hot?  Yes. Well, it was actually an old farm truck. It did not have any of the  fancy wheels or anything.  It wasn   t used to attract a lot of good looking women?  It was an extended bed. You know, long bed, and it still has the original  hub caps on it. But I loved that truck. It was a good truck. I loved it. And  then I bought a Volkswagen Beetle for  800.  What a change.  Yes, it   s a lot better gas mileage. I wanted something a little more  trendy, and it was in my price range. I got it for  800, and that   s the car I  drove all through OSU. Actually, it broke down the week before I left  for Oxford, and I left it on the side of the road. I lived in a trailer park  here in Stillwater, and I was pulling out of the trailer park and it broke  down, and I left it on the side of the road there when I went to Oxford. I  think my dad later came up and pulled it somewhere for me.  Blaine, just quickly, any highlights you remember about your high  school or junior high school experience? Student activities, different  things?  As much as there was to do, I did a lot of activities there. And one thing  that was, in some ways, an advantage of the small schools, your  activities were limited. In fact, there was basketball. We didn   t have a  football team; we were too small for that. But I played some basketball  and baseball. And even though there wasn   t a whole lot to offer, my  father was really good about if kids wanted something, he would try to  make an effort to do it. So, we got involved in this program called  Odyssey of the Mind, which was kind of semi-engineering, semi-creative.  It was a strange competition. Kids built these weight-bearing  structures and you see how much weight they hold, and there was also a  creative component to that. We got really involved in that, and, actually,  it did really well. We won the state competition and went to the world  10  Gill  Greteman  competition with that. And I was involved in other things like National  Honor Society and did a lot of things that got us out, and we did some  community activities and things like that. And then I had good teachers  that hooked me up with other stuff. I had a high school English teacher  who hooked me up with the different writing contests that I would do.  So, the nice thing about a school that   s small is there is enough  individual attention to where people would a) hook you up with things  and b) if there wasn   t something there, we had the sort of people who  would work to make it happen. And I think that kind of gave me a  good   well, one thing that I brought to OSU that I always encourage in  my students is the attitude where they just wait for things to come to  them. You see a need on campus, then you fill that need. If there   s  something you want that   s not there, then you go out and create it. So,  that   s something I learned in high school.  One of the bigger things that happened to me while I was there is I put in  an application for   Johns Hopkins University does this thing called the  Center for Talented Youth, and it   s an intensive research project you do  over the summer. I applied for that, and you had to write an essay and  different things. And I got it. I went up to Illinois and did wetlands  research. When I first came here, I was a science major in bio-systems  engineering, and that was part of what really got me going in that  direction because it was fascinating and it was challenging. It was  challenging in a different level of anything I had done. We actually did a  research paper and published it in a scientific journal, so we were  working at a pretty high level. And, actually, I still have friends from  that thing. It   s amazing. Pretty much everybody who went either turned  out being a medical researcher or a   it   s funny how, I guess, a program  like that can find kids who are either already geared in that direction or  really light them on fire in that way. Anyway, I did a lot of stuff like  that. Oklahoma Biology Institute I did one summer. A lot of stuff to sort  of augment my education, I guess. There   s all these great free programs  you can do. And so, yes, the Oklahoma Biology Institute was just a  week or two weeks. But, again, it was fun. We got to work with real  professors who were doing real research. It was good stuff.  What influenced you to enroll at Oklahoma State University?  Well, there were a couple of things. I was trying to go somewhere  where   I really pretty much applied in-state for one thing. I think being  from a small town, that   s about as big of a leap as I wanted to make. So,  I applied here, OU and, I think, maybe, ORU, OCU maybe. It was  funny. I was kind of na  ve in a lot of ways about the way I went about  the whole process, because one of my main criteria was that I wanted to  go where I didn   t have to pay money. I mean, I don   t know if that   s  na  ve or whether that   s actually one of the smartest things I   ve ever  11  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  done.  Probably the latter.  I became really obsessed by the idea of not owing anything when I got  out. And, actually, that   s   I tell my grad students, too, or kids who are  interested in going to grad school,    You do not want to graduate owing  money.    It limits what you can do, and with the job market and  everything, it   s crazy. It   s worse now than it was then. But I was really  committed to going somewhere where I would get good scholarship  money. I was really impressed with all the universities, actually. They  were all such a big leap from rural Oklahoma that I was kind of dazzled  by all of them equally. I didn   t have the tools to differentiate, in a lot of  ways, one from another in terms of the academic programs, the cultural  life or anything they offered. But when I came up to OSU, people really  worked with me to make sure that I got good scholarships and that I was  taken care of in that way. And, see, it was complicated because I wasn   t  a National Merit Scholar. I don   t think I even did that competition, and I  was about a point below the cut-off on the Regent   s scholarship, which  is the big one.  The Regent   s Distinguished.  The Regent   s Distinguished, which, basically, is a free ride wherever  you want to go. And, I don   t know, I had like a thirty-two composite on  my ACT, and I think it took a thirty-three that year. It would float from  year to year, and I was just below that. So, that was a big disappointment  for me because that automatically did it. But, in hindsight, it actually  worked out really well for me, because I went to the various universities  and I talked to the people in the admissions and the scholarship office,  and I saw who, I think, really wanted me. OU was really fixated, as they  still are, on getting National Merit Scholars. That   s where they kind of  throw all their money. And OSU, through the President   s Distinguished  Scholarship and a couple other scholarships like that. The engineering  department here has good funding, but still they put together this  package that was going to pay   well, but I had the Valedictorian  Scholarship here which is a great scholarship and, I   ve heard, is actually  a better predictor of success than the National Merit. And I totally  believe that. I mean this sort of goes back to what I was saying about  my   I guess it   s really key to my educational philosophy and that idea  that people coming from smaller towns and communities and less  successful schools, if you   re talking about big cities, can achieve at the  same level. I think that, probably, students from places like that are less  likely to get something like the National Merit because we don   t come  from schools that have dedicated programs to teach to that test and  everything. But what you can see with something like that Valedictorian  12  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Scholarship is who, relative to their peers is     Work ethic.  Yes, has the work ethic and has, maybe, a bit of intelligence, but  probably a lot of the work ethic. Increasingly, I   ve become convinced of  that. That   s probably the main thing. That scholarship is a great  predictor. Long story short, what people here ended up showing me was  that they wanted me for who I was, the potential that I had, rather than  what was already attached to me. Now, at the time, all I was seeing was  here was the place I could go and not have to pay money as long as I  kept my grades up. But, in retrospect, what I   ve seen is that was an  indication of the kind of pastoral care that I was going to get at OSU,  which was really important. Not just in education but, I mean, that put  me in contact with people like Bob Graalman over in Scholar  Development who eventually would be really instrumental in me getting  the Rhodes. So, it was really important, even though in some ways it  seemed like a totally arbitrary way to pick a college, it was really  indicative, I think, of the kind of atmosphere that was important for me  when I got here.  Did you have any OSU background in your family? Did you have friends  going here?  No, my parents were both first generation college students and they both  went to very small regional schools. They went to Southwestern  Oklahoma State University, which is out in Weatherford there. And I  think that a little bit of that attitude, like I said, I didn   t even look beyond  Oklahoma. You kind of stayed local and, so, anyway, that   s where both  of them went, and so coming to a big state school like this was a pretty  big leap, really.  When you got here, what were your first impressions of Oklahoma State  University? Do you remember that first semester?  Yes, I really did love it from the beginning. I remember calling my mom  and saying that I didn   t ever want to leave campus. I wanted to stay on  campus forever. That   s when I got the bug that eventually led to me  becoming a professor. I had no intentions of becoming a professor when  I first came here. I thought I would go out and, I wanted to go do field  research, really, is what I wanted to do.  Well, let   s talk about that a little bit. Initially, you were an engineering  major, then you switched to English. That   s an interesting transition in  academic interests. Is there a story there?  13  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Well, a little bit. I always had a really strong interest in English. I had  been really involved in both. Like I said, I had done engineering contests  in my high school and some of these science programs, but I had also  done things like enter the Academy of the American Poet contests, just  had been really interested in writing, in particular. And, so, it really was  one of those things   I wish I would have been brilliant enough to have  been able to do both. But, you know, you find very few who actually do  engineering and a double major in something like English. Every once in  a while, but engineering is such an intensive major that it was sort of  crowding out all the time I had for that sort of stuff, I felt like. And so, I  just decided that   s where I wanted to end up. I actually really enjoyed  my classes, though. I had chemistry and calculus and computer  programming, and I enjoyed all those classes. I really hated to give them  up in a lot of ways, but I really thought like I needed to explore that  creative side. Also, I had taken a class here. That first semester, I took a  class in history, actually. It was really the first real history class I ever  had, to be honest. This is where my high school background kind of fell  short. I had a basketball coach for a teacher and we watched Hoosiers  almost every day. That   s pretty much all we did was watch or talk about  Hoosiers, the movie. I had never really had a real history course where  you actually read these critical books about American history. It was an  American history course and it really was eye-opening for me. And from  that moment, it emphasized to me, I think, that I didn   t want to miss out  on exploring that humanities side. I really had a passion for it. It was  about as simple as that. I had to decide where my real passion was, and it  kept looking like it was going in that direction. I was doing a lot of  creative writing on the side, and I just felt like I needed more of an  outlet.  We   ll talk in just a minute about the Rhodes experience, but beside that,  were there teachers or professors that impacted your life?  Yes, there were a lot. Well, I   ve already mentioned Bob Graalman who  was a big influence and still is. I think, really, I always feel like I could  get good advice from him on anything. Edward Jones who is over there  and who I go running with, I did an internship with him. This is, again,  one of the ways that scholarship stuff really was key to professional  development and academic development. I did a Wentz Scholarship  research project where I was his editorial assistant in Milton Quarterly.  There were so many. Ed Walkiewicz who is in the English department  was a big influence. Linda Leavell, who is over there who is a great  writer. She   s got an  80,000 advance on a book she   s writing on Mary  Ann Moore. Actually, that might be somebody good, eventually, to  interview on this because that   s going to be a major book. It   s going to  be the major book; she was a big influence. In the history department   James  Cooper was an influence. Dr.  George  Jewsbury, who was just  14  Gill  Greteman  this exotic creature. Later on, I saw him living in Paris. Later on when I  moved over to England, I went over and visited him at his flat in Paris.  He gave me a sweatshirt that I wore around Europe because I hadn   t  packed correctly. (Laughter) He was just this strange, exotic   I never  really had met anybody like that, you know. So, there were lots.  Also in the sciences, there was a Neil Purdie; he was my chemistry  instructor. I would guess that he is from a stern Scottish Protestant  background. Presbyterian background would be my guess about Neil  Purdie. He just scared the hell out of me. I mean, he did one of those  deals where we walked in and he said,    Look to the right and look to the  left. By the end of the semester, either one of these people will be gone.  They will fail the course or you will.    And it just scared me. He gave us  this exam, this take-home exam, which we were supposed to be able to  get up to speed on it to know if you should be in this class. You should  be able to complete this exam based on your prior knowledge of  chemistry. It had about 30 questions on it. I knew one. And this is where  my work ethic was kind of suicidal in some ways. Rather than dropping  the course, which would have been the reasonable thing to do, we started  at, like, chapter 10 in the chemistry book. So, I spent the first three  weeks working late nights every night, working chapter after chapter. I   d  work then I   d do the programs. It was kind of crazy, but I didn   t want to  lose any time. So, I became really invested in proving that I could do  that, I think, to myself. I ended up with an A in the class. It was a class  of 160 people and I think there were only about three   I mean, he was  right. He gave very few As. But just by challenging me in the way that  class did, that was a huge influence. I mean, it sort of inculcated, like I  said, that slightly insane work ethic. But that   s something that became  really important. I mean, later on I would have classes that were way  easier that I could have got by on with half effort, I think, or I went into  the final, knowing I only needed a 20 to make an A. There were a couple  like that. But I always really crammed for them as if everything  depended on that final just because it was kind of, I don   t know, that   s  just what I felt needed to be done.  Why don   t we take a couple of minutes and talk about the Rhodes  Scholar experience for you. Then I want to come back and talk about the  rest of your student experience to fill that out. What gave you confidence  to apply for it and to think that you could win?  You know, I have a hard time remembering exactly what that moment  was. And I almost think it was kind of done on a whim. I   m not totally  sure, but I wouldn   t exactly describe myself as having confidence that I  would win. I think I thought of it more like a crapshoot, to be honest.  And I think that might have been key to my success because that is, in  some ways, the real   I   ve told people a lot of times, that   s the realistic  15  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  attitude. If you go into one of those things, you have to know, to some  extent, it   s going to come down to luck and chance, and chances are you  probably aren   t going to get it. If you luck out, maybe you will. So, you  have to be willing to go through the process, hoping to get something  out of it other than just the scholarship to develop yourself and become a  better student, maybe even a better person, through the process, because  it   s a really self-reflective process. You have to write personal essays  and really think about what shaped you, and where you want to go with  your life, and how you can contribute to the greater good, all those sorts  of things. They   re actually pretty hard questions. I mean, you can ask  yourselves those questions at any point in your life, and they can be  pretty hard, I think, especially if you   re doing something like academia.  I think if you were an aid worker in Africa, it would be easier to answer  those questions for yourself. But I think they   re important to ask. I mean,  that   s still a big part of my identity is trying to figure out, I guess, how  does what we do really contribute to the greater good?  Anyway, that   s kind of an aside, but I knew the odds were stacked  against me in a lot of ways. But, you know, I had straight As here. And  maybe just the fact that others seemed to think that maybe I had a shot at  it, like Dr. Graalman and Dr. Jones. Although, I think they were also  skeptical in their own ways, I mean, which was important. I think that  they all had done this thing enough times to not want to give somebody  false hopes.  You bring up a point there that I want to get your thoughts on. There  was a feeling at the time that, because OSU had no previous Rhodes  Scholars and hence no individuals on the selection committee, which is  composed of former scholars, that it was unlikely that an OSU candidate  would be selected. In fact, many people even thought there was a bias in  the selection process.  Yes.  Because there were fairly highly qualified OSU students that had gotten  close but had never gotten the golden ring. Have you heard of this, and  how do feel about it?  Absolutely. And I think there was and there wasn   t. In some ways, the  bias could have worked a little bit in my favor. Somebody on that  committee may have thought,    Maybe it   s time.    And I think that   s  entirely possible. Because there is a sort of feeling in the Rhodes  committee that says,    Well, we don   t always just want to give it to  Harvard.    So, I think that that could have worked in my favor a little bit.  But there is also   you have to clear a goal post that maybe a student  coming from Harvard doesn   t have to clear. They   re assumed to be  16  Gill  Greteman  cultured and academically successful, automatically, that maybe you  have some work to show. I think there   s no doubt about that. And so in  that way, there is an inherent bias. Now, how it plays out in an  individual case, that   s where I think a little bit of luck comes in, and it   s  hard to figure out exactly what all can factor in. There was a famous  story about a student a few years before me. I can   t remember who. It  might have been Brian Begley, but I think it might have been somebody  else, who went up and the day he went up for his Rhodes interview was  the day after Dexter Manley testified to the U.S. Congress that he  graduated from OSU without ever learning how to read. And the first  question they asked him was about Dexter Manley. It was based,  essentially   have you heard that story before? It was basically     I   ve heard about the Dexter Manley story, but the Rhodes Scholar     Okay, well the question they asked him was something to the effect of,     How can you claim that your education is on the same level as these  other candidates when somebody from your university is testifying  before Congress that he graduated without being able to read?     Something like that. If that wasn   t the exact question, it was implied. It  might have been,    What do you think about Dexter Manley?    But  anyway, it was a very hostile environment, and he didn   t get it. And I  think he was one of those that you talked about that was very qualified.  And, so, stuff like that had to have an impact, although it   s hard to  exactly tell what makes you qualified for one of these things. I mean,  sometimes you can think,    Well, this person is totally qualified on  paper,    but part of the test with the Rhodes is how you click when you  get in a room with those people. It   s so hard to put your finger on what  the dynamic is exactly. But I definitely had something happen in my  interview, and I clicked with that committee, and that made a really big  difference.  Of course, the biggest obstacle that we always felt is not only that there  was sort of inherent bias against OSU, but you had to go through the  gauntlet of OU. That   s where the interviews were held. The dinner  before the interview was held, at the time I was doing it, in David  Boren   s house, an old Rhodes Scholar and president of OU. And, so,  that was like going into the lion   s den. Now, in my case, I think that  David Boren was probably my single greatest ally. I think that whatever  it was, somehow or the other, I clicked with him. I started talking with  him about his art collection. I had happened to have gone on a couple of  camping   and this is what I mean. This is weird stuff that you just don   t  know. I had gone on some camping and hiking trips with my wife, and  we   d gone up to Santa Fe and places like that, looking at southwestern  art, which, purely coincidentally, that   s one of his passions. So, he had a  lot of artists in his house that I recognized and I was interested, because  17  Gill  Greteman  I   d never walked into somebody   s house and they   ve got an Allan  Houser statue sitting in their living room. That   s kind of a different level  of culture than what I   m used to. So, I start asking him questions about  him and that might have been what helped me clear that bar. Suddenly  David Boren thinks,    Well, this kid is not just a hick,    or,    If he   s a hick,  he   s an interesting hick.    I feel like he probably became a big ally for  me. Whatever happened with other students in the past, I don   t know.  It   s such a weird process. It   s so hard to predict who is going to do well  and who is not. It can just totally hinge on little serendipitous things like  that.  How did you prepare for the competition?  Dr. Graalman has an established program, so I took that Windows to the  World class over there that he does, which was great. It   s just a little  one-hour class where, basically, you just go in and debate various issues.  I think my class was kind of legendary, not because of me, but because  of other people who were in it. I was in the same class with Shannon  Ferrell, who is now a professor in the college of Ag and who won a  Truman Scholarship, with Chris Stevens, who also was a Truman  winner, later a Marshall winner, who is probably the peer that I  continually remain in awe of. Chris is one of these guys who, if he had  wanted to do an engineering degree and an English degree, he probably  could have done it. Chris was a phenomenon. Was and is, I think. So,  Chris was in there. My wife, who was later a Rhodes nominee, herself,  who Brad Carson later told me was his pick for the Rhodes. Brad  claimed that she was blocked, if blocking does at times happen on those  committees. This is something that I heard from Brad. It might be  something I want to edit out of the tape. I won   t say where the blocking  happened, but supposedly she got blocked. And I was there, and there  were other students who were also really good.  So, we had these great debates every day in that class. And then after  that class, we did some formal interviews where Bob would set up a  camera like this, and we did mock interviews and Edward Jones was on  those committees. Doren Recker from the philosophy department, who  is an imposing figure, was on that. They would fire questions at me and  they videotaped it, and I watched the first video that I did and I was  really dismayed by my performance. It was horrible. I mean, it was bad.  I   m pretty informal in this interview, and I may be doing some of the  same things that I did there, but it probably was worse. I was rocking in  my chair like this while I was doing it. It was all-around a very bad  performance. And, so, I watched that video several times at home, and I  worked on eliminating some tics that I had brought to the table, saying     umm    all the time, and various strange things I was doing with my  hands. And, so, I really worked through that and got a lot better at my  18  Gill  Greteman  presentation. When I felt like I had a hole in my education, I would try  to fill it. I spent a lot of time trying to broaden, read philosophers that I  hadn   t read, catch up on science, just generally trying to be more of an  informed person. That was really the main prep that I did.  Can you repeat any of the process and how you experienced each stage?  Yes. What happens is I took the class and, I guess a semester later, I  must have gone over to Dr. Graalman   s office and said,    I want to apply  for this Rhodes thing that we   ve been talking about,    because we talked  about it in his class. Everybody did. And, so, at that point he gives you  the application process. The single biggest thing that you   ve got to do is  write the personal essay. I probably put that thing through 12 or 15  drafts, even though it   s only a page and a half essay. It   s a 1,000-word  essay, I think. I worked on it and worked on it and worked on it. So,  most of the process was working on that. I guess the other thing that  probably happened is   well, you get your CV together and stuff like  that. You get tons of letters of recommendations for these things. I went  around and got them from both professors that I had had, and I also  made a point of trying to get them from across the disciplines I   d been  involved in, and also out in the community. I did a lot of things like  tutoring kids who were on the border both academically and socially at  the Stillwater middle school for quite a few years. So, I got a letter from  the counselor out there, and did that sort of stuff. You know, that was  really it. It wasn   t that complex of a process.  The most difficult part of the process is in that personal essay you have  to describe what has made you want to apply for this scholarship, and  what you   re going to do with it, and what your career trajectory is going  to be. So, it requires a lot of soul searching and to have your background  basically shape the person that you are, and where you want to go  academically, and why you think that is important. Why do I want to  spend the money on you, basically. So, for me, it really became about  trying to figure out the narrative that led me from my relatively humble  upbringing and my roots out in western Oklahoma to the scholarly work  that I was doing, which was involved with literature. And the big project  that I had done was a research project on The Grapes of Wrath in  Oklahoma. I   d done that through a Wentz, and I was able to use that to  really talk about how in literature and literature research I had  discovered, in a lot of ways, my own history and the history of my  family, and I had learned a lot about myself through these projects. I  learned a lot about the power that literature has, both to reveal and  capture those sorts of things and to shape a people. I had done a lot of  work on why The Grapes of Wrath had big implications for Oklahoma   s  politics and history after it was published. The responses to it     19  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Self image.  Yes, self image. A lot of things I had dealt with all through my career,  all through my life, really. I mean, I talked about the various sorts of  chips that we have on our shoulders sometimes, and the image problems  that we sometimes have. And a lot of that grew out of the response to  that novel which was a very strange history of its own. So, that became a  core part of the essay for me, and it also became a core part of the  Rhodes interview. When I got into the Rhodes interview, it was much  more based on my research and my academic career. I thought it was  going to be a quiz show format where they   d ask me stuff about where     well, I did have a question about the causes of the Russian Revolution,  actually, which was kind of an odd ball question to throw at me, but  most of them were just right on my resume and on my research. We  talked about The Grapes of Wrath and Oklahoma and Merle Haggard. It  was a wide-ranging interview, but I think the key to the Rhodes is that  you can have the committee interested in what you have to say. And  that   s what happened.  Was there any intermediate steps? Did you, simply from the  application   they read it and then you were selected straight to  interview from there?  Well, yes, you send off the thing, and they weed it down to a certain  number that they would do at the state interview. Eventually, you get the  letter that either says you   re invited to the state interview or you   re not.  And I think after that letter came is when we started doing some of the  mock interviews here at OSU. Up until then, it was kind of just a waiting  game. So, you get that and then they pick two people from the  Oklahoma competition. Of course, it   s everybody from Oklahoma. So,  the other guy who went forward with me from there actually was doing  school at Georgetown, but he was originally from Oklahoma City or  something. So, you go from the state level to the district level, and then  after the district interviews you stay there all day, and then at the end of  the process they call you into a room and say,    You, you, you and you  are Rhodes Scholars.     Wow.  It   s a fast process actually, once it starts. What you do is you submit  your essay and all your materials, your letters, your CV, all this stuff.  Then you wait and you get that letter that says on December 12, or  whatever, you need to come to this interview. And two weeks later  you   re either a Rhodes Scholar or it   s all over. You do the one interview  and then whoever wins that, three days later or something, flies off to the  district, which I did in Salt Lake City. That whole interview process  20  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  takes two days. The one day you have a dinner; the next day they do  interviews. They keep everybody there until it   s all over. It   s amazingly  intensive and really fast, actually, once it kicks off.  So, again, the way you found out is     Yes, they literally     It   s not like you go back home and you get this telegram or something.  No, it   s in the room you find out. Yes, I remember I was over at Morrill  Hall when I opened the letter telling me I had the first interview at OU.  And that one was the same way. We went down there   I remember  there were several guys who went down with me for that interview from  OSU. I think we sent   well, maybe it was just me and one other guy  who went down. You have a dinner the night before, which is the  cocktail thing, and then the next day we all went. We waited in the outer  foyer of David Boren   s office, everybody. We hung out out there while  they would call us in one by one to do these interviews and then send us  back out. And as the afternoon wore on, a couple people they would call  back in for second interviews. It wears on into about six, seven. I got  there about nine in the morning. At about eight o   clock at night, they  come out and they say,    Thank you all; you all did great.  Congratulations to Blaine Greteman and whoever else who is going to  go on to district.    And then they took a couple of us who were going on  back to talk to us and told us what was going to happen next, and I mean  it was like,    Your plane tickets will be ready for you. You   ll be flying  out two days from now.    And then Salt Lake City was basically a  repetition of that process. We were there, called a couple of people in. I  mean, it   s a real pressure cooker when you   re waiting out in the foyer, as  people are going out and in and getting called back for second   interviews . But it was also interesting. I met people, especially in the  district, who didn   t get the Rhodes but who I kept in contact with,  actually, because you spent a lot of time with them, and they   re all very  accomplished.  You   re talking in the foyer all that time.  Yes, all that time in the foyer in a very intense, psychically traumatic  time you have with one another. So, yes, at the end of it they called us  all into a room and then told four of us,    Congratulations, you   ve won.     My attitude was, chances were, I wasn   t going to get the thing, so I was  just going to try to enjoy the process as much as I could. I really went  into it determined that I wasn   t going to get caught up in any kind of  cutthroat mind games with the other students who were applying,  because that happens, of course. It starts happening at the cocktail dinner  21  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  the night before, because what happens is that once a table is set up in  the dinner room, and this is in David Boren   s very nice Presidential  dining room in his house, and you all sit at tables and there are about  four people to a table: three students who are applying and then one  person who is going to be on the committee. Then, between courses,  those people would rotate around so you got a little bit of exposure.  How many were there on the committee?  I think there were six. Let me think. There was a guy named Paul Ray  who is a historian over at Tulsa and a former Rhodes Scholar. There was  David Boren. There was Denise Bode, the Corporation Commissioner at  the time. I don   t know where she is now. She went into politics, sort of  higher level than the Corporation Commission, eventually. But, Denise  Bode. Who else was on there? There was a guy who was an  environmental lawyer. Maybe there were just five committee members.  But anyway, they circulated around. Well, of course, that creates a lot of  preening that goes around, a lot of people trying to promote their  accomplishments and stuff during dinner. And, like I said, even some  mind games and stuff. Some people really try to undercut the other  people at the table they were with, and I just thought,    I   m not going to  get into that. I   m just not going to do it.    And I suppose that   s a strategy  in itself, because what I did was ask questions of other people, and ask  them about the projects they were willing to brag about and that sort of  thing. I tried to just enjoy myself as much as I could. And I did the same  thing the next day when we were waiting out in the foyer, just tried to  talk to people and not try to make the stress worse.  Later on, Boren   s secretary told my   and, again, you never know how  much influence someone has. She told my father that she knew from the  moment we were in there talking, as she watched us during that dinner,  that I was going to get it, and that she really wanted me to get it, that I  was her pick. And you know how influential secretaries are  I   ve always  wanted to ask David Boren,    Did she have anything to do with that  selection committee?    (Laughter) because they are influential people.  Anyway, she was observing us throughout the day, and I had been her  pick, I guess, because I think she thought I was a nice guy. And you  know how it goes. People who sometimes you don   t think in a room are  going to be influential are quite influential. So, I   ve always wondered if  she might have had a word with David Boren.  At each stage, how many were there? For example, in the Oklahoma  competition, there were how many?  There were quite a few. I would say there were about fifteen of us there.  22  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  For the interview?  Yes. And there were two  chosen . And a larger pool. Yes, I think OSU,  for example, had put maybe four or five applicants forward, and then  two of us got interviews. And I think that   s the story at universities all  around. So, the thing is, if you   re from Oklahoma originally, you can  apply into the Oklahoma pool. So, if you   re coming from Harvard or  Georgetown or   actually, if you go to school in a different region,  you   re probably going to apply back in Oklahoma because this region,  the conventional wisdom goes, would not have as much Ivy League  competition in it. You don   t have all the east coast Ivy League  competition, so you   d apply back here. And so there were a handful  from OU, a handful from OSU, and then probably ten, the vast majority  were from colleges back east who were in the interviews. So, there was  probably a pretty big pool that applied, a hundred, a couple hundred  maybe. And of course, before that, your institution has to give you their  endorsement, as well. For example, last year I was at Berkeley on their  committee, and we had about twenty applicants from Berkeley, and we  only put forward, I think, three to give the institutional endorsement to.  So, there are several stages in the process where you start off, and it kind  of funnels down.  Your regional or district competition in Salt Lake, how many were  there?  In Salt Lake there were   well, there your odds improve dramatically. At  the state level there were probably fifteen of us, and two went on. Once  we got to regional, I think there were   there were either eight or twelve  of us, and four would go on. I think there were twelve of us and four  went on. So, once you get there, you know you have at least got a shot,  because you   ve suddenly gone from having a 10 percent chance to  having a 33 percent chance. Although, at the same time, you noticed that  the quality has jumped so dramatically that it   s pretty intimidating. That  was an intimidating group of people to be around. Everybody there, it  seemed, had spent all their summers administering AIDS vaccines to  orphans in Africa and stuff like that. These people were doing stuff     they were on the list for sainthood. So, by the time you get into that  level, that   s when it really drives home that there   s got to be a little bit of  luck involved. And I really didn   t think I had a shot. Although, later on I  heard I was the first person they picked out of the four, supposedly.  They had a real debate when it came down to the third or fourth, but  evidently they had picked me within five minutes of their reconvening,  which is what I heard happened at OU, too. Many years later, you kind  of get a little bit of the behind-the-scenes thing, and in both places I had  been picked really quickly. Now, that wasn   t just my performance.  Somebody came up to me after that interview and said,    You should  23  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  thank your recommenders. It made all the difference.    So, I had some  very good letters from people here who had, I think   who knows what  they said but, clearly, for at least one person on that committee, that had  been the deciding factor for them.  What were your emotions when you first heard that you were going to be  a Rhodes Scholar?  I was just totally blown away. I couldn   t believe it. It was pretty   and  partly because I had taken my attitude of    I   m just in this for the fun    so  far, I think, that I had genuinely convinced myself in a lot of ways that, I  mean, I really didn   t want to be crushed. Part of that   s also a defensive  mechanism. I really didn   t want to be crushed, and so I was just kind of  dumbfounded by it. I really didn   t think it was going to happen.  What was your first call?  You know, in retrospect, I can   t remember if I called my parents first or  Bob Graalman. I want to say I called Bob first, but that might not be  accurate. I really can   t remember. I can tell you the three calls I made in  quick succession, and one was to my wife, one was to Bob, and one was  to my dad. And I don   t think any of them believed me. I think all of  them thought I was joking. I know, for sure, my dad thought I was  joking. He thought I was pulling his leg. I had to tell him three times  before he believed that I got it. And it wasn   t just like a big surprise. He  just thought I was playing with him. And Bob was floored. I think he  was happier than if he would have won. That   s the thing that I   ve always  loved so much about him. I mean, he   s just so invested in student  success. It   s really unreal to meet somebody like that, but it   s been great  to work with him this year because you see it over and over again. He  lives for moments when students achieve like that, and so it was a big  deal for him. It was quite a moment.  I went back to the hotel   I didn   t own a cell phone because I was still  living on that  5,000 scholarship. That   s why I lived in a trailer park. It  was really cheap. My wife and I rented that place for  100 a month. So,  we could stretch our scholarships to cover everything as long as we lived  really, really poor. We didn   t have cell phones or anything. So, I had to  wait until I got back to the hotel, and got out my card number and  everything and dialed it in and put in the phone calls. But, yes, it was an  amazing   it was mind-boggling, really. It really, really was. It was just  like being in a fairy tale. It   s funny, because it   s in Salt Lake City and  Salt Lake City I went and visited that summer just because the whole  experience had given it a sort of magical aura. When I went back and  visited, the city didn   t seem   I mean, it   s a pretty nice city, but in my  mind, it was like fairy tale land. But, yes, it was a pretty great evening.  24  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  What does it mean to be OSU   s first and, to this point, only Rhodes  Scholar? Is it special for you?  Well, it   s really special to be the first. I   m about ready to hand the torch  on. I really want us to get another one. Being the only one is  something   well, like I said, as soon as possible, I   d like to get  somebody else in there. Being the first will always be a really big honor  for me. But, yes, I can   t wait until we get another, because I think it   s  time and I think we have students who are ready. I   ve met several this  year. I think it will happen, like I said. There   s just so much chance in it,  in some ways. It   s so hard to tell what   s going to make you click with  that committee when you get in, and then whether you   re going to really  be on top of your game when you do those interviews or not. I mean,  they are probably the two best interviews I   d ever done, those two. I  mean, something happened with me, as well, and I think I did really  good interviews. Yes, it   s been a very big deal. The best for me is that  there   s a picture of me over in Gallagher-Iba Arena. They   ve got  pictures of people who were significant in OSU   s history or whatever.  There   s also the Scholar   s Wall. And I   ve never told Bob this because I  know the Scholar Wall he   s really proud of, but to me, being in  Gallagher-Iba is actually, probably, the greatest honor.  We won   t let him watch this tape.  Yes. That   s the one I actually took my four year old over to see because  that   s, you know. It   s been huge for me. But I   m going to be really  excited when we actually have established a tradition. That   s what I  want to do.  Three or four or five.  Yes, and being the first one, I think, will become even more important  for me once we   ve got that tradition going. I   m ready to see that, and  hopefully it will start soon.  Let   s talk about Blaine Greteman the student, about your OSU  experience, some of the things that shaped you. Can you share some  highlights of your OSU experience, your academics, yes, but  extracurricular, social, as well.  Sure. I was involved with quite a few extracurricular things. Like I said,  peer tutoring   one of the big things that I was involved with was  helping to start this literary journal that we have here called Papyrus,  that was the student literary magazine. It   s actually shifted. I was the  faculty advisor on that this year and they   ve shifted it to   now it   s  called The Oklahoma Review and now it   s accepting submissions from  25  all around the region and not just here. I think the quality might have  improved. Anyway, I was involved in that from the beginning, and  editing it and publishing it, and that was big because I was really  committed to both literature and being involved in the creative life of  campus. We   d have lots of poetry readings and stuff like that, and  writing, generally, became really important. I also started writing for the  O   Colly when I was here and wrote lots of   it was a great outlet. I think  I wrote a column a week while I was there. I improved a lot as a writer.  Got involved in a lot of controversial politics, some of which actually  came back to bite me when I was policy director on Brad Carson   s  senate campaign years later. The Republican National Committee  actually dug up those old columns and used them in advertisements  against us. They sent out fliers and all kinds of things, because I had  written some stuff about gun control and this, that, and the other. I was  and am very liberal, and I think that probably also kind of helped with  the Rhodes thing, because it showed I could be an iconoclast a little bit,  and I think they liked that because it shows that you have initiative and  willingness to try to think outside the mold that you   re in, whatever  mold. I think that   s kind of what the Rhodes is looking for is a predictor  of who can think outside the box, whatever that box might be, because  we have them everywhere. You have them in academia. The guys at  Harvard think inside the box in the same way we think inside the box  here. And the ones who are successful are the ones who can break  outside that and discover new paradigms. And, so, that   s what the  Rhodes is really looking for, I think, is people who can help shape those  new paradigms.  I think stuff like that probably helped, the fact that I was writing about  some very unconventional stuff at times. I had a couple of times where I  was actually   it   s amazing how much this campus has changed  politically. When I first came here, gay rights, for example, was almost  unheard of. There used to be this tradition called Denim Day here to  show support for gays and lesbians. People would wear denim. The first  time that happened when I was here, it was my freshman year. It turned  into this total debacle. People were threatening to beat people up. There  was all this hate speech that was written all over the sidewalks and  everything. I mean, some people were really nasty. I ended up writing a  lot in the O   Colly about stuff like that, because I was sympathetic to  equality for homosexuals and that sort of thing. And there were times  after I would write a column like that, I would be a little bit leery about  walking across campus. I remember somebody yelled at me one time.  Somebody drove in a car and yelled at me once when I was walking  across campus, and I totally thought,    I   m going to get killed now.    And  it was just somebody saying hi. And what   s funny, it   s all gone now. It   s  totally changed here. The students who are here now just don   t care  about that issue anymore.  26  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Some of the issues are still a hot item, like I was a big gun control  advocate. That would still be controversial here. But it   s amazing to me  the way some of the social issues have dropped. I think within the  generation, that   s going to seem like such ancient history because the  students I have here, they just don   t care. But, anyway, so I was really  involved in that. I loved doing stuff like Habitat for Humanity, lots of  that sort of stuff. I was a pretty active student, really. I worked hard  academically and I did as many extracurricular things as I could fit in.  That   s what I can remember. Some things are escaping me.  What were your favorite hangouts on the OSU campus, and off campus?  Well, on campus, I loved the library. I lived in the library. I really liked  the library a lot. Jules Emig   s office over in Morrill Hall, which is kind  of this weird    there is  no other place like that in any university I   ve  ever been. People just collect there. Students sleep on the couches in  there. He is the advisor in Morrill, and he   s kind of an institution. So, I  loved hanging out in places like that. There used to be a place off  campus called   it later became Mike   s College Bar   Washington Street  Grill, it was called. It   s just a bar now. But I really wasn   t much of a  drinker or a partier. I just didn   t feel like I had time or money for it. But  this was a place you could go and see bands for free, and you could  drink coffee or whatever. I was more of a coffee drinker than anything  else. So, I would go hang out, and there was a band called Two-Dollar  Bill that would play there all the time. They were great. One of them  was a veterinarian here in Stillwater. I can   t remember what they were.  Was this Red Dirt?  They were a Red Dirt band, one of the old original Red Dirt bands. Like,  there were them, there was the Red Dirt Rangers, my own band  eventually got into some of that. I ended up playing with some of those  guys later. But when I first got up here, I   d go watch them all the time. I  loved doing that. It   s funny, though. Now I love going over to  Eskimo   Joe   s. Joe   s is like my favorite place in town, and the Hideaway, both.  But we were really poor. We did not go out for pizza. In the summer we  painted houses to live off the money. We needed some extra money to  live. But we just didn   t do much hanging out.  Let   s talk about that    we    for a minute. Did you and Mandi meet here at  OSU?  No, actually, we met in high school.  Okay, so give us the story here.  27  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Well, we met in high school and she was a year below me. She was at  Hydro. She was a Hydro girl, born and bred. That   s where she     Oh, high school sweethearts.  Yes. And, so, we both got involved in drama and things like that. We did  a lot of   this is something I didn   t mention that I did a lot of in high  school was drama and speech competitions. We   d go do  extemporaneous speeches and stuff. Actually, the state contest was here  at OSU. This is part of the reason I think I was drawn to OSU. I came  here as a high school kid, too, and saw the campus and thought it was  incredible. And, so, anyway, we did that sort of stuff. I came up here,  and a year later she came up as well. She was English right from the  start. She was a really talented writer and a good reader. She became the  head editor of Papyrus, actually. I was her underling. Now she   s a first  generation college graduate. Nobody in her family had ever been to  college before. Well, her mother I think had been a little bit, but she  didn   t graduate. Her folks were both blue collar workers and she was a  very driven student. Like I said, she was a Rhodes candidate the year  after. She was one of those that a lot of people thought should have had  it, but for various reasons, being the spouse of the person who   d won it  the year before, I think that probably worked against her a little bit. But  she did a lot of the same things I did when we were here. We were kind  of a team on the Papyrus, and like I said, we lived in a little trailer park  up on North Main there.  What year did you get married?  We got married, I guess, my junior year and her sophomore year. She  was in Wentz. I wasn   t in the honors program when I first came here. In  some ways, she was more tenacious. I don   t know. I was in Willham, the  old dorm over there, when I first got over here. I wasn   t in the honors  program until I met a student in my calculus class who said,    You really  need to get into the honors program because you get smaller classes.     So, then, the second semester I got in the honors program. But Mandi,  she was in from the beginning, and she lived in Parker Hall over there,  which I did not realize until recently that that dorm was named for a sort  of radical Indian chief, Quanah Parker. I met Robert Provine, an  interesting person to interview in this, as well. He   s written a pretty  groundbreaking book on laughter  Laughter: A Scientific Investigation .  He was kind of a radical student here in the sixties and he was behind  the naming of that dorm. I didn   t realize that that was part of the sixties  counterculture movement. Anyway, she was over there, and we had a lot  of fun. She stayed here, of course, to graduate after I finished, but then  she came over to Oxford with me and she taught. She taught at a little  middle school named Isis Middle School there at Oxford for several  28  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  years, taught special ed kids, and then she did her graduate degree in  London.  Before we get you out of OSU and move into your Oxford experience,  are there some favorite memories that you have had at OSU?  There are a lot. It   s hard to pin down. There are so many. Like I said,  when I first got up here, the culture of the place, the academic challenges  blew me away. The fact that I was meeting people from other countries  and cultures, especially when I was in engineering   I was making  friends from Korea and from the Middle East. That was totally new for  me. It was really, really interesting. That was a huge experience for me.  So eye-opening. I was one of those students that really blossomed in that  way. So, every experience I had that first year seems like it was one of  my favorites. Then, later on, I don   t know.  My number-one experience, after I won the Rhodes   the Rhodes was a  big deal, but I really knew I had arrived when I was walking out of a  restaurant here in town; it used to be called Stillwater Bay, now it   s  Aggie   s Big House. I was walking out of that after having had sort of a  celebratory lunch with my family who came into town, and Eddie Sutton  drove by and honked and waved at me, like giving me a thumbs-up   (Laughter) I   m a big basketball fan; basketball is my thing. Football I   ve  never been as big on, but basketball, I love basketball. I always will  contend that OSU is really a basketball school that occasionally is  mistaken for a football school. We   re really a basketball school. For me,  that was bigger than meeting Bill Clinton several years later, I think. It  was huge.  There were so many things. Meeting with the students, open mic night.  The first open mic night that I went to where I heard students reading  poetry, that was a huge thing for me. And those nights sitting around  listening to some of that early Red Dirt music were big. I still remember  picking particular books off the shelf up here in the library that changed  my life, like Woody Guthrie   s biography. I remember when I found that  upstairs. And then I just totally remember the moment I pulled it off the  shelf, and then I read everything I could find on Woody Guthrie over the  next couple of years in my spare time. So, there are lots.  Following graduation in    98, your Rhodes Scholarship took you to  Oxford University in London. What was the transition like for you?  It was comparable to coming here from Hydro in terms of good culture  shock, although academically I felt like I was really prepared. I thrived  at Oxford. It wasn   t a huge leap in terms of academics. Now, what was  the leap was the academic culture. Students meet at the pub every night  29  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  and talk about politics and philosophy and literature. And, I will admit,  that doesn   t necessarily happen here. (Laughter)  Meet-at-the-pub part happens, but then after that     Yes, the pub part of it happens here. But that was amazing. Just the  general cultural experience was fantastic. The thing I really remember  about Oxford was   well, first, before leaving for Oxford, all the Rhodes  Scholars convened in New York for this departure weekend, and that  was pretty fantastic. I had been to New York. My father had driven me  up there once, but it was a very whirlwind trip. And on that trip we  hadn   t really done the big cultural things, but on this one we went as the  group of Rhodes Scholars that were   .  Is this the first time you   d been collectively together?  Collectively, we   d never been together. So, yes, just meeting them all  was interesting. It was amazing, really, to see all the people from the  different backgrounds and to start sizing each other up, which I think we  were all doing. And as the group of Rhodes Scholars that was getting  ready to depart, we basically had all-access to anything in New York.  We went to the public library where the librarian took us back and  showed us the manuscript that Mark Twain had written Huckleberry  Finn on, the box that he had specially built for it, took it out, let us look  at it. We went to the Lotus Club where Mark Twain and many other  New York   that   s where we had lunch, and big figures of state were  coming in and talking to us about our careers and our future. I mean, all  of a sudden we were like   yes, it was real and we were dealing with     The only person who didn   t show up to that one   a lot of times they  meet the President. We didn   t see the President. But we were seeing  people on the next level down, pretty serious statesmen. Madeleine  Albright, people like that, were dropping in to say hello and to wish us  farewell. We went to the opera and it was amazing. It was a totally new  experience. We all flew over together, and I took my cowboy hat. I was  determined that I was going to stay   I was anxious about losing touch  with my roots, because it was such a new world and an exciting one. But  I was sort of anxious about it. So, I made sure I took my cowboy hat and  wore it. I took my guitar and my cowboy hat and a bag of clothes, and  went over to stay in England for, it ended up being, the next six years of  my life.  What was student life like at Oxford? You described a little bit at the  pub. What was a typical week like?  A typical week was pretty intensive. It was on the tutorial system. I was  doing a master   s degree and what it was like, you would have these  30  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  tutorials where you would go in and the typical format would be, your  professor would say,    Okay, I want you to go, and this week you   re  going to write about this issue,    in Dunn or something.    So, here   s three  books you should read, and come back with a paper next week.    You   d  write a paper, ten-page paper, and bring it back next week. So, you   d go  off and read these books, work really hard on the paper, and the next  week you   d come back and he   d sit across from you and you   d read your  paper out loud to him, and he   d take notes on it. Then he   d give you a  critique.  You had to read it to him?  Yes, read it to him out loud.  Wow.  It was really interesting. And intimidating. It was a good way to do it,  actually. I wish I could do that with students here, because you develop,  in a lot of ways, as a writer, as a thinker, as someone who is presenting  materials to somebody else. Now, in addition to that, the way Oxford  works, to get your general courses on Milton and Shakespeare, you go to  just big lectures. So, you go and there   s a guy at the podium, one of the  professors there, and there   s 100 people. And this is a lecture series, but  you don   t do papers or anything attached to it. You go, you take notes,  and you use these notes, supposedly, when you take your final exams at  the end of a time. So, I went to those. I did a Latin course that was done  in a similar way. You   re taking a Latin course, but your professor is not  actually giving you any kind of grades or anything. It   s just you. This is  where having good work ethic and being individually motivated is key,  because there   s nobody looking over your shoulder. You   re never  turning anything in in any of those big lecture classes. It   s just you and  what you get out of it. So, you   re doing lots of those sorts of things. It  was really stimulating because that was the academic side.  We also had things where our course   we were on the master   s course,  and there were about ten of us on that course, and we would come  together and do seminars, basically, where we wrote papers and  delivered them for one another under the supervision of a professor. So,  those are the three academic components of the degree. And then in  addition to that, several Rhodes Scholars had formed a reading group.  So, each week, one of us would suggest something to read and we   d get  together and we   d debate it and talk about it. Rhodes House would  frequently have dinners where speakers would come in and talk.  You had some special activities as a Rhodes Scholar you wouldn   t have  had     31  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Exactly. Rhodes House is its own institution. A big dining hall   I mean,  Nelson Mandela would come in and give a talk, or Bill Clinton would  come in and give a talk. You met some pretty remarkable people over  there. Antonia Fraser, who was married to Harold Pinter, I had dinner  with her one night at Rhodes House, just sort of a small, around a table  like this. She was a pretty famous historian herself. I shouldn   t just make  her the wife of Harold Pinter, but the reason I said that was Harold  Pinter was supposed to be there but he ended up getting sick and  couldn   t come. But there were regular events like that, where you would  meet these figures and chat with them and have these very stimulating  dinners where you also had to learn to balance eating and drinking a lot  of wine with having conversation, which was hard because you had  these servers who would keep your glass full. And the way an Oxford  dinner typically works, you have champagne and hors d   oeuvres before  the dinner begins, and then you have wine with your meal and then  there   s always dessert wine or Port. And, so, by the time it   s over,  you   ve drank a lot. So, you have to learn how to pace yourself. It   s a  pretty serious part of the learning process, I   d say, is learning how to  participate in dinner like that and still function at the kind of level that  you need to function to get invited back.  Did you have to be invited to them?  Yes, a lot of them, what they would do   well,  at  some of them, all the  Rhodes people would come, and it would be a big banquet. And those  were always fascinating, because they would invite all the Rhodes  people and then there would be a key speaker like Clinton or something  like that, and then lots of other eminent people would come that would  be invited. You met a lot of fascinating people, from Lords and Ladies to  people who were researching diseases in India and stuff like that. They  were at the top of their field. It was amazing, the people you would  regularly meet at these things, always people who were at the top of  their field.  A lot of the learning really took place outside?  Absolutely. I mean, I learned a lot, especially about global issues, which  the Rhodes House is really engaged in outside the classroom. And, then,  there were also these smaller dinners that were invited affairs. So, if the  warden of Rhodes House was having Antonia Fraser or somebody like  that in, he might invite several Rhodes Scholars who he thinks would be  interested in or interesting for her. So, you have sort of a select group.  And there was a lot. Your social calendar stayed pretty full. Between  that   and, then, see, you   ve also got your college. I was at Merton  College and Merton College has its own social calendar too. It has balls,  it has speakers, it has dinners. There   s High Table. So, there   s a big  32  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  dining hall where everybody eats. You have to put on your robes and  then you   d go in and you   d eat your regular dinner in there.  It   s like a daily occurrence.  Yes, it   s a daily occurrence, but you had to wear your robe and you   d go  in, and it   s a good meal. And then at the top, they have what   s called  High Table at the end of the hall, and that   s where the professors sit. It   s  actually an elevated table that   s up so they can look down on the  students. But periodically, your supervisors would invite you to go to  High Table with them. So, then you sit at the big   it   s like sitting with  the adults, basically. So, you learn how to do that stuff pretty quickly.  And High Table is like a mini version of the dinners with the Rhodes  House. It starts with sherry in your don   s office or living quarters before  the meal. And then wine was poured very freely, and then afterwards  you would adjourn to have Port and chocolate and fruit with the dons  back in their, what is called the, Senior Common Room. It   s like  something out of the Victorian era.  Or medieval.  Or medieval. It   s sophisticated, and it   s bizarre and it   s decadent in a lot  of ways. So, this is part of the reason, I think, that a lot of people over  there, especially in Rhodes, have a lot of conflicts about, I mean, trying  to balance the decadence that goes on in those sorts of settings with the  idea that you   re supposed to be working towards changing society for  the better. And it   s interesting, because the Oxford student body is by  and large pretty wealthy. But they are actually, politically, I think partly  because of the liberal guilt that they have over that, it   s a pretty radical  student body. They   re very committed to various social causes. I found  the students to be really, probably, more engaged at Oxford than  anywhere else I   ve ever been, ironically, and that   s including Berkeley  which has a reputation for being a socially radical campus. The students  at Berkeley were not nearly as socially engaged as the students at  Oxford in terms of working on third world issues and things like that.  Maybe it was just guilt. I don   t know.  Are there any particular highlights at your time at Oxford you want to  point out?  Well, when we first pulled into town and I saw the cobblestone streets  leading up to Merton College, I   d never really seen anything like that.  So, that first entry, just driving into Oxford, everything was so green and  pastoral and bucolic. It made a big impression. Again, there were a lot.  Meeting Bill Clinton was a highlight, actually. He was interesting. He  has a different aura about him. I don   t know if all presidents do or if it   s  33  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  just him, but you always hear people say that about him, and it was true.  Even people who were skeptical were bowled over. He just totally  disarmed everybody. So, it was interesting, and there were a couple  times I met people like that. It was a definite highlight. And pretty much  every one of my tutorials, which were with John Kerry who was one of  my scholarly idols and Tony Nuttall who was as well were highlights.  They were really informative. All those things were fascinating. I mean,  amazing. There was countless trips down the river, and things like that  that were   the whole period was pretty fantastic. Fourth of July was a  highlight. I got a reputation   I would always host the Rhodes Fourth of  July party when I was over there.  Would you invite the Brits?  Yes. So, I would always get fireworks somewhere, Mandi and I would.  We had a flat on Iffley Road right where Roger Bannister broke the  four-minute mile. So, we   d go out to the track and field area out there  and set off our fireworks. Those were always pretty fun. There were lots  of moments like that where the Rhodes community would come together  more informally, outside the big fancy dinners. Those were the things  that I actually, really, probably enjoyed the most. But, yes, the whole  thing was like one big highlight. In the summers, we would travel  around Europe and see the cathedrals and the museums. I mean, for me,  it   s very hard to pick anything individually because the whole thing was  just like a sort of fairy tale. I   d never been out of the country before  going there, so it was a big deal.  So, you completed your master   s degree in philosophy in 2001?  Yes. Well it   s called Master   s of Philosophy, although it was actually in  literature.  You matriculated at the University of California, Berkeley in 1994. Can  you share what you were doing in those three interim years there?  Yes, it was an interesting time. After I finished at Oxford, I decided I  was going to   well, we really liked London. We decided we wanted to  live in London. So, Mandi actually started a graduate degree there at the  University College London. I wanted to write. I wanted to do journalism  or some other kind of writing, so I decided that   s what I was going to do.  Well, there were two things. Simultaneously, I applied for the PhD at  Oxford and started applying for options as a writer. I got accepted to  start the PhD at Oxford, but it was right after I actually got offered a job  working at Time as a writer for Time magazine, and I wanted to write  more, at that time, than I wanted to do the PhD, so I ended up going to  work for Time. Actually, in the period between that, I found out how  34  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  hard it is to be a freelance journalist. It is a tough life. So, I looked  around a lot and it was really   I put in, probably, fifty applications to  The Economist, to all kinds of different journals looking for stuff.  I finally ended up landing this really strange job working as a researcher  and a writer for the World Nuclear Association which is run by John  Ritch, who   s an old Rhodes Scholar. This is where the Rhodes  connections actually come in handy, I think. It was funny because I had  always been against nukes, abstractly. I had never really thought about  them that much. But as I talked to John, he kind of convinced me that  they were a potential green energy with some of the new nukes because  they could cut down on CO2 emissions and some of the other emissions,  and I started getting really into it. I   ve always been involved in  environmental issues. And, particularly, I started getting into the idea,  which I still write about this in my journalism, the world needs a lot  more power than it has right now. It needs a massive amount more  power in order to provide basic services to the third world. There are  millions of people without access to running water or clean water, and  it   s the leading cause of death in undeveloped countries, dysentery from  not having proper water supplies. You need good water; you need  electricity to get it.  So, I became really involved in this idea that perhaps micro-nuclear  plants, which are a different kind of nuclear plants, could provide that in  a clean way. We ended up taking a presentation to the UN World  Sustainability Summit in Johannesburg based on the research and  writing that I did when I was working for them, and this was in, about,  2000. It   s interesting because, subsequently, this has kind of become one  of the hottest debates in the environmental community, as you   re  looking at alternative resources and trying to move away from a carbon-based  economy, whether to include nuclear in that paradigm. It really  heated up a lot during the past couple years here. And, so, it   s been  interesting to me, because we kind of laid some of that groundwork in  Johannesburg in 2000 at the Sustainability Summit, whether for good or  ill, I don   t know. I guess the jury   s still out on that.  Stirred the pot, anyway.  Yes, we did stir the pot. But, anyway, then I got a job working for Time.  I worked for them for about three years as a writer. It was really a  fantastic time in my life.  What kind of articles were you writing for Time?  I did business and economics which by then had really become a key  interest for me. And, then, I also did culture stuff. Every week I wrote a  35  page on business, trends, what was happening, interesting stories I  would find. I had a regular beat in business and economics. And, then, I  did lots of stuff on politics and culture. I also did music reviews. This  was during the buildup to the Iraq war, and there   s a big Iraqi exile  community living in London. So, I spent a lot of time interviewing Iraqi  exiles and going around to the different mosques and things in London  that were centers of the various Iraqi exile communities, and getting  their perspective on Saddam and the war, whether it was a good thing or  a bad thing. It was an interesting time for me because I had a glimpse  into a   I don   t know, I had a different perspective on it than what you  were typically getting on the news. So, I wrote about that. I also talked  about it a lot on   I did a lot of TV commentary during this time, so I  was on the BBC quite a bit. I was on several of the other channels that  they have over there. Channel Four is one, and a couple of cable news  shows. I used do TV constantly. Probably two to three times a week I   d  do TV broadcasts. So, it was a really interesting time for me.  Just, generally, being a journalist during the buildup of that war was a  fascinating thing. And what was most fascinating for   well, there were  all kinds of things, but one of my old friends from Time was visiting  Stillwater the other day and we were talking about it. A lot of us became  really conflicted, because most of us were personally against the war.  The more we researched it, the more we felt like the causes that were  being given weren   t accurate or weren   t sufficient. I think in a lot of  ways, that   s kind of been borne out by what we   ve found out  subsequently. We know that there were no weapons of mass destruction,  and when you talked to a lot of people in the intelligence community,  even then, they would tell you there   s not. I mean, we had links through  a lot of people in Time to a lot of really high-level people in the  intelligence community who were saying,    It   s just not there.    Even  Colin Powell, before he gave his UN presentation, he had angrily  demanded that they cut the material that they had given to him down to,  like, a quarter of what it originally was, because he only wanted to give  the stuff that could be verified, and most of the intelligence that had  been given to him was bad. And, so, a lot of us were against it.  But there was this really interesting moment where the editor of Time  actually came into the office and said,    Look, I know that a lot of us are  opposed to the war, but the magazine is behind it.    And that week   I  can   t remember the date, but the magazine we came out with that week  was called    When Mom Goes To War    was the headline and a picture of  a female soldier. And it was part of the beginning of our promotion of  the war, basically. And it was both the most fascinating time that I could  have been a journalist and one of the most frustrating times. There were  a lot of people who had been journalists for a long time that really were  soured by that experience. And I was a pretty young journalist, so it was  36  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  especially tough for me because I would go on the BBC, and they would  ask me to give the American view and things like that, and I always felt  like I really had to be walking a line between what I wanted to say and  what I knew was the magazine line on the war. And, so, it was really  interesting. I can   t think of a more interesting time to have been a  journalist in London. It was fascinating, because, especially, if you  remember, the British populace was really against the war. It was, like,  90 percent in the public opinion polls against the war. So, Tony Blair  really put his neck on the line by joining   that was part of the reason he  got destroyed when it didn   t go well. So, it was really pretty fascinating  to be in that environment and to watch what was going on back home  where public opinion was slowly changing towards the war. Although, I  went back and watched the tapes recently, and when I first started  talking about it, public opinion was, basically, the polls they were doing  was people didn   t want to go in without UN approval. So, there was a lot  of change that had to happen before we actually went in the way we did,  and it was interesting. I was right in the middle of that, and I wrote a lot  about it. It was interesting in both good and bad ways, but it was a great  time. We almost settled down and stayed there permanently, but,  ultimately, I kind of had a nagging. I wanted to do this PhD. And my  wife also; she decided she was going to do a law degree. So, she applied  to Berkeley and got into Berkeley   s law school, and I applied to their  PhD program and Stanford   s and got into both. I decided I didn   t want to  commute back and forth to Stanford, so that   s where we ended up.  Can you tell us a little bit about your experience at Berkeley?  It was really good. I mean, that   s where we had kids. Well, we had our  first kid in Tulsa when I was working on Brad   s Senate campaign. And  then, after the crushing, humiliating defeat of that campaign, we headed  off to Berkeley. We had deferred our Berkeley degrees for a year so we  could work with Brad. Mandi and I were co-directors on that campaign.  And, after that, I thought,    Man        This was the    04 U.S. Senate campaign?  Yes, this was the one where Tom Coburn ultimately defeated us. So,  after that, we were ready to get back to Berkeley  We headed back and it  was great. It was a very stimulating place, academically. It was just the  capstone in a lot of ways. I was finishing up the PhD, and so it was  great. I worked with great people. The thing I was most proud about, I  think, with Berkeley and my whole career academically is I managed to  go to top schools but always stay in the state school system, including at  Oxford, which is a state school. People kind of forget that at times. But  if you   re an English student and you can get in, tuition   s cheaper there  than it is at OSU, actually. The first time ever they imposed fees on the  37  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  students when I was there, and students were chaining themselves to the  buildings in protest. I mean, they took it seriously, fee increases. So,  anyway, that   s the thing I was most proud of, because Berkeley   s  typically rated with Stanford and Harvard as one of the top three and has  stayed tied for number one in English, in particular. So, it was a great  place to be. It was really stimulating.  But you know, most importantly was probably the family stuff that  happened there. We raised Finn for a few years and we also had our  daughter while we were there. It   s a great place to have kids. So, we  really enjoyed it, and they enjoyed it. I, hopefully, got some good  research done there. And it was a good launch, I think, for my scholarly  career. I also kept a hand in journalism. I still write   actually, working  with one of my old editors from Time, I still publish some stuff. I  published a couple of articles on green energy and environmental issues  this year. I hooked up with him again when I was out there at Berkeley.  And I also did more political consulting stuff, working with a firm that  we had previously hired when I was on the Carson campaign. So, I kind  of kept my hand on several different things while I was out there.  V.R.?  V.R. Strategies, yes. They are a research firm; they do all kinds of  research for politicians. For example, when Tom Vilsack, who was the  Governor of Iowa, was preparing his very short-lived presidential  campaign, he was one of their clients. My job was to try to get him ready  for the presidential stage. So, each week I would write a briefing on this  or that issue in the news and send it to him. Then we would bounce  things back and forth so that he could get used to debating some of the  issues that he was going to be called upon to debate when he moved  from the state stage to the national stage. So, it was fascinating for me. I  wish he would have become the president because then, who knows,  maybe I would be Secretary of Education or something instead of a  professor   Is he in a cabinet position now?  He is. He   s Secretary of Agriculture, which is a pretty good fit for him, I  think. But we were pulling for him. We really hoped that he would get it,  for self-interested reasons. But, hey, I never thought Obama could win. I  just did not think the country was going to elect an African-American,  and I didn   t think it was going to elect a woman. I did not have enough  faith in Hilary Clinton, so we said,    Okay, well, we   ve got to have a  boring white guy. And that   s Tom Vilsack     So, nobody in our firm  gave enough credit, I think, to the American people. We were really  wanting to play it safe. We thought that was the only way the Democrats  38  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  had a shot. I   m still kind of in shock that that wasn   t true, and happy. I  mean, it   s always good to see that people are more open- and broad-minded  than you think they are, and that   s what this election, I think,  proved to me.  So, you graduated from Berkeley in        08, really. Yes, just before I started this job.     with a PhD in English. And then you and Mandi and the family came  back to Stillwater as a visiting professor. What influenced you to come  back to OSU and Stillwater at this time in your career?  Well, there were lots of things. Mandi was about to have twins, twin  boys, and so we wanted to be close to family. But, I also wanted to come  back. We migrated back to Oklahoma every few years, it seems like. We  did several years before to work on the Carson campaign and then this.  Yes, professionally, it was a really good move for me. I didn   t want to  stick around Berkeley and teach comp which is probably what I would  have  done . What I did, basically, is I had more time left on the degree.  And, then, when this position came open, I just really put the pedal  down and wrote the dissertation really fast and got it finished in time to  come here and start teaching, because I thought this would be a lot more  fun for me than staying there and doing another year of grad school.  And, so, it was one of those things that I thought,    Well, I   ll have to  really rush, but I think I can write it.    I had to write a couple of chapters  pretty fast, but it was a good opportunity to continue to grow as a  teacher, in particular. OSU is a really good teaching school, I think. I  had a great education here. I think professors take their teaching really  seriously here, maybe more seriously than they do at a place like  Berkeley even. Not that they neglect it there, exactly, but you know,  OSU is kind of unique in the intensity and the dedication that the  professors have to their students. So, it was good to me. I got to work  with some of the people who I   d really admired as teachers. I could walk  in and get advice from them whenever I had a problem in the classroom  or something.  So, that was your idea, to kind of see the other side of it?  Yes, absolutely, and we thought we might stay. There was a potential to  stay here permanently, and we almost did, but a position also came open  in Iowa, and there I am able to work in their non-fiction writing program  and then their literature program. I thought, for me right now, that   s a  better fit in terms of developing my own writing and getting my first  book out, which I   ve been working on. I thought it was just a little bit  better launching pad for that, partly because I   d be able to work in a real  39  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  focused way on writing with students. They have the number one  writing program in the country there. So, anyway, we thought,    Well,  let   s go give it a try for a couple of years.     And that will also be a tenure track position for you?  Yes, it   s a tenure     At the same time, you   ll be learning, as well.  Yes, exactly. I think ideally that   s what happens is that you keep  learning. And I was almost afraid of becoming too comfortable here,  having been a student here. I mean, I   m really comfortable here and I  was afraid that maybe I wouldn   t learn as much because of that. I might  be tempted to relax a little too much. And people think a lot of me here,  being the first Rhodes Scholar and stuff. I was a little bit afraid they  might give me a pass in some things where I needed to be challenged,   to have  people not know who I was, as much, and really hold my feet  to the fire.  Do you ever see yourself coming back to OSU in the future at some  point?  I hope so. I really think I will if something opens up. I have a feeling  that we will. I mean, who knows what will happen, but we still have a  lot of family here, too, and I think we   ll want to be close to them. So,  yes, I thought we had a window to make a move, then we could make  another move down the road. But, yes, I suspect that we will. Who  knows because, long-term, I   m kind of interested in getting into  administration at the university level. This would be a really fun place to  do that, I think.  I was going to ask you, back to some of the questions that you were  asked as part of your Rhodes interview experience, talking about what  you want to do for the rest of your life, what do you want to contribute?  Along those lines, what do you want to achieve for your life? Have you  thought about it?  Well, it   s interesting. What they asked me at the Rhodes was   I  remember the last question Boren asked me was,    What are you going to  be doing ten years from now?    This was in 1998. And I said,    Well,  hopefully, I   ll be teaching at a university and I   ll also be doing  journalism. I want to be able to combine those two parts of my persona.     So, I   m doing journalism and public advocacy, and I   m in the classroom.  And that was the other reason I thought it was great to be back here,  because I got to come back ten years later in 2008. I was in the  40  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  classroom and I was doing journalism, writing about some issues that  I   m really into. And ten years from now, well, hopefully, I   ll have a  couple of books under my belt. And I wonder   I don   t know. Either I   ll  be still working, basically doing the same thing: still teaching, still  researching, and really working on that journalism, public advocacy  side. I would like to move my journalism a little bit more into the realm  of cultural critique, if that doesn   t sound too vague.  In England there   s this tradition of the public intellectual that we don   t  quite have to the same degree here. My supervisor there, John Carey,  was somebody who wrote lots of academic books, and on the Sunday  news shows he would come on and talk about trends in culture. What  movies were out in the box office and what it implied about the way the  country was moving, and the recent books that were coming out, and  how it showed various shifts in culture. I think that   s a fantastic  phenomenon and a fantastic career. I   d love to be involved in something  a little bit more like that. I   m really invested in the idea that   there   s a  big debate right now about the future of academia and, particularly, the  humanities in academia, and I really want to be part of that debate. And I  think it   s important that people who are doing the humanities     academics, generally, but humanities in particular   have to prove their  relevance in the broader world. And, so, I want to make my career in  journalism be part of that, I think. I think it   s really important for the  humanities to survive. So, hopefully, I   ll be doing that. Although, like I  said, I   m also kind of interested in administration. I think the idea of  working with people from lots of different departments on campus  would be really fun.  What would you think ideally? Become a dean?  I don   t know, maybe something like a dean.  Vice-President? Academic     Yes. Ten years from now, let   s say that anything dean level or below  would still be plenty ambitious. I   m not going to shoot for president in  ten years, I don   t think. But, you know, who knows, long-term, I think  that would be   I mean, I can   t imagine. I used to watch Jim Halligan.  What an ideal job, working with students. The fundraising part would be  brutal, I   m sure, but also, I don   t know if I could ever do it. You see  Burns Hargis and he   s so good at it. That   s the problem. I don   t know if  I could ever be that good at doing that, and that   s such an important part  of the job. I might have to stick down a little more at the academic level.  But it would be fun, out there making your case with these people who  are very influential and trying to get them to invest in what you believe  passionately in. That would be a fantastic thing to do with your life. So, I  41  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  think somewhere in that big cosmos of university administration I might  ultimately find a place. But what typically happens is you work until you  get tenure, and then you kind of have a moment where you step back and  evaluate your career and figure out where     And then, of course, for you, I   m thinking the four kids are all about  three years apart. In ten years then, in about fifteen years or so, we   re  talking university, we   re talking about weddings, we   re talking   it could  be interesting.  Yes, it   s going to be very interesting. I may have to move to a school  where I get   there   s a private university that offered free tuition for your  kids if you   re a professor there. I almost took it just purely thinking  about that.  You can make that change later.  Yes, that   s what I figured: Later. I   d really rather stay in the state  schools, and who knows? We   ll figure it out.  Well, Blaine, let me ask you some philosophical questions, like who is  the real Blaine Greteman? I think of the small-town Oklahoma boy,  Rhodes Scholar, but let   s explore some of your diverse and, perhaps,  eclectic interests.  Yes, alright.  Let   s go back to the band. So, were you a vocalist? Did you play an  instrument?  Yes, I played guitar and harmonica and I sang, wrote songs. And I still  do that.  What was your genre?  We did a genre called alternative country, which was kind of Red Dirt-inspired.  I guess I don   t know what was alternative about it. It   s actually  become a pretty big genre of music now. There are a lot of bands, like  Wilco, who are big who do it but, of course, we weren   t big. It was  country music, but we would also write songs about literary analysis and  I don   t know. A lot of our songs were kind of funny. Tongue-in-cheek  sort of stuff.  You made a couple of CDs but you didn   t ever hit the big time?  No, it never hit the big time. We did get played quite a bit on the radio,  42  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  actually, especially college radio. We got played a lot on college  stations, college radio, all around the country. We got some international  play. Like, I remember, we got played on Radio Shanghai International  which was kind of strange.  Now, you played the guitar?  The guitar, yes.  The lead guitar?  Well, mostly rhythm. I   m more chords and, like I said, I listened to a lot  of Woody Guthrie.  You did some of the vocals?  Yes, I did quite a few vocals. We did two CDs    worth. It was pretty fun,  and we had some pretty interesting stuff. Like I said, we got played and  got a few reviews that were pretty     What were your gigs around?  Well, actually, we went and played   it was Washington Street Grill and  later became Mike   s College Bar. I don   t know what it is now, here in  Stillwater. And then we played a couple of campus events on campus.  But what was weird about it is that we never actually cut a record until  the summer after I graduated, and I was about to leave to go to England.  And so, pretty much, as soon as we got together and wrote all the songs  and recorded them, I took off. And then just when I came back from  England, we   d get together and play. Sometimes we played a gig, and  sometimes we wouldn   t. That   s part of the reason we never did a tour or  anything, because we were very quickly scattered all over the place. And  every once in a while in the summer we   d get   that   s how the second  CD came about. Two of the people were professors at different  universities by then, and I was at Oxford. I was working at Time. So, we  came back and recorded another CD. Now I write mostly children   s  songs for my kids.  So, now there   s Blaine Greteman, the policy consultant, there   s the Brad  Carson U.S. Senate Campaign in 2004.  Yes, I wrote a lot of political songs, too. One of the songs I performed in  London that I remember that everybody from Time   it   s actually  become kind of a legendary song; it   s called    Communist Girl.    It   s  about the anti-capitalism demonstrators that were in London around  2000, 2001, and it   s got a lot of policy blocks. Yes, from the time I had  43  Gill  Greteman  been in journalism, I   d always been writing a lot about political issues,  and, actually, my literary research is pretty political. I write about   what  I do with my study of 17th century, I   m studying the way various literary  figures construct the idea of consent and government by consent in some  of their both literary and political writings, because that was the period  when you moved from government based on birth to government based  on consent. So, it   s a wholly new concept that they have to basically  create whole-cloth. So, that   s the academic side, and I   ve always had  this other side where I   ve been engaged in lots of real issues.  When I heard that Brad was going to run for Senate, that was supposed  to be a really big year for the Democrats. There were several unknown  Democrats that were picked as the rising stars of the party. There were  four. The only two of them that I can remember now were Brad Carson  and Barack Obama who were two unknown young guys who were trying  to run for Senate. And, supposedly, the Democrats had a shot at taking  the Senate during that year. We didn   t. We ended up losing it pretty  badly. The only person who won out of all those four was Obama, and  it   s amazing what can happen. And of course he only won based on a  fluke. His opponent self-destructed in a big sex scandal. And, so, talk  about something with a lot of chance involved, politics has a lot of it. So,  yes, I did policy for Brad. We wrote a lot on health care. We actually  wrote an entire book called Renewing Oklahoma   s Frontier. It was sort  of a comprehensive political plan to try to revitalize rural Oklahoma  through a series of health care education, technology, and business  initiatives. It was a really bold plan. I still think it   s a shame that it didn   t  go anywhere, because what Brad and us started talking about, he   s an  interesting politician. He   s more of an intellectual than he is a politician,  I think. He thinks he   s a politician, but I don   t think he is. I think he   s an  intellectual.  Would probably have trouble getting elected in Oklahoma.  Yes. And we started talking about it. There are fewer people living in  western Oklahoma, in particular, now than there were at the turn of the  20th century. In 1900, there  were  double the number of people living  out there, almost, than there are now. It   s because people have left to try  to find work. There are just not enough opportunities. And, so, we sat  down and just said,    Okay, what would you have to do to create those  opportunities?    It   s interesting, just thinking about it as a blank canvas  and trying to come up with a comprehensive set of policy initiatives that  could create them. That   s why we made it totally broad-based; there  were five sections. It   s interesting. Like I said, it didn   t go anywhere, but  it   s actually become a blueprint for several other pretty big campaigns.  V.R. Strategies, the research firm out in Oakland, they   ve showed it.  I   ve worked with probably five or six other politicians who   ve used  44  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  variations of this plan in their own races. So, who knows? Maybe there  will, someday, be hope for it. I don   t know. But, yes, I   m dedicated to  that. Basically, our theme in that campaign is that Oklahoma has a lot of  politicians on the national stage who   ve done very little for this state.  That   s true.  It is true. Now, there are exceptions to that. The intermodal facility over  here is one of them that I   m pretty impressed by. Senator Inhoffe, I  think, was very involved with that, and that was kind of out of character,  because we haven   t got a whole lot out of our national politicians. And  that is tragic when you   re living in a high poverty, underdeveloped state.  I mean, the reason that you send those people should not be so they  could be obstructionists, but so they can bring stuff back. And, you  know, hopefully, eventually that will happen. We   ll see. We thought we  could be a part of it. In the end, I was ready to take a break.  What did you learn from the campaign about the political process?  It was disheartening in a lot of ways. It was a disillusioning process. You  learn how much it   s all about money, and that   s kind of depressing. You  learn to compromise a lot. Well, Brad is more conservative than me,  anyway, but to win you know that there are certain things that you have  to do that you can do, certain views that you can take and can   t take. So,  passionately advocating views that, actually, your beliefs run completely  contrary to is an interesting experience. It   s hard, but it   s something that  you learn how to suck up and do through politics. I mean, I did a lot of  it. So, I learned how to do that, and I learned how key money is for  better and worse, and how much access it provides. The system seems  intractably tied up in it. The bad thing is I don   t really have a lot of  optimism in terms of changing that, coming out of that campaign. You  would have thought,    Well, maybe it showed you something, and you  think that there   s a way to change it.    But for me, I have to admit, I kind  of pulled back a little bit from politics, because I saw how much, if you  really want to have a voice in political affairs, you have to pony up the  money. That was pretty depressing in terms of thinking about the vast  majority of the population who by implication doesn   t really get much of  a seat at the table. I   m going to continue to be engaged with   that   s  what my research in the literature is about: how the voiceless can have a  voice, basically. Maybe at some point I   ll feel like I know enough about  that to come back to contemporary politics.  Find that voice again?  But right now I   m just at the position that I hope the people that have the  money to buy access are good people. And a lot of them are, but I lost a  45  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  lot of my illusions about politics.  Some idealism?  Yes, definitely.  Well, Blaine, back to a silly question, but hopefully you   ll take it as a  sincere question. Who   s the real Blaine Greteman, because you   re such  a diversified renaissance kind of person? Who do you see yourself as?  Yes, but it   s really tough.    Psycho-math    is a term somebody used once.  Yes, it   s tough, because when you ask a question like,    Where will your  career be ten or twenty years from now?    I have a hard time  conceptualizing that. You know, that   s where family has, actually,  become so important. And having kids is the thing that made me feel  confident that I could settle in on academia more than anything else that  ever happened to me. Until we had our son, I was never really  convinced   I had a lot of discontent, actually, about doing the PhD,  because I felt too hemmed in. I don   t know. I may very well be off in  Africa doing aid work or something at this point if we hadn   t had kids.  Now, having kids, I gained a whole new appreciation for the academic  lifestyle, just the whole existence. The kind of environment you   re able  to bring them up in, the hours you can work, the way your research  allows you to put them to bed and then go off and do a couple more  hours of work if you want to. The fact that you aren   t working 24/7, like  you are in journalism. I mean, journalism, I never stopped when I was  working with Time. I would get up in the morning and just eat, breathe,  sleep journalism. Even when you   re doing things that are supposedly  leisure, like parties. We went to lots of big high-flying parties where  people like Bono were there. That   s work. I mean, you   re not actually  just relaxing ever.  So, I think the family thing really helped focus me in some ways. I think  who I am, hopefully, I   m somebody who will make a contribution to  society, whether that   s through    The other thing was teaching. The first  time I got in front of a classroom after being away for several years I  thought,    This is the link that I   ve been missing between the life of the  mind and making an impact on kids    lives.    People often talk about  universities as being the ivory tower.    Oh, you   re just off in the ivory  tower.    But when you   re dealing with a classroom of kids, you   re  dealing with people who are living real lives with all kinds of real  problems. They   ve got academic problems, sure, and you   ve got to work  with them on that. They   ve got career anxieties, and you   re working  with them on that. They   ve got personal disasters often going on. A lot  of times they   re working forty hours a week, and they   re coming to  school, and they   ve got kids and they   re balancing problems with their  46  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  Gill  family. And you start to realize that when you   re in the classroom,  you   re really not in the ivory tower. If you   re doing a job, you   re  engaging with them in a way that is engaging you with the world. And  that   s the main thing. When you ask who you are, that   s all that I can  narrow it down to is that   s who I want to be, is somebody who is  engaged with my society in a productive way. So, when I   m gone at  least a couple people have something good to say about me.  You know, I   ve watched my dad over the years, and he   s been a real  model in that way, just because whatever he   s done, it has not even  necessarily been about the job, but just the interpersonal relationships  within the job, that I think have left the most lasting impact. And, you  know, he   s getting ready to retire this year, and there are people from all  over the country that are sending emails and calling and writing tributes.  And it   s not because he   s won a Nobel prize or anything, it   s really  because he   s had personal integrity.  Touched a lot of lives.  Yes, those personal interactions. That   s what, at this point, I   m aspiring  to, I think.  Well, my last question is along the same lines, but how do you hope OSU  people will remember you?  Well, that   s a good question. I guess I just hope that they will remember  me at all  If they remember me at all, that will be good. What I hope  students who are willing to follow this path remember about me is that  what I   ve tried to do is do the things that I was passionate about and  interested in. That   s what I always tell students who want to do the  Rhodes. Don   t try to craft yourself into a particular sort of person; just  follow your passions. Go where your instincts and your passions lead  you, and then work as hard as you can. So, I hope that people will  remember me as somebody who was genuine in doing that, I guess. And  I hope that people will remember me as making a positive impact here.  But I think I might still have some work to do before I can sincerely lay  claim to doing that. Long-term, I hope that I   ll make a big contribution  to OSU that will continue. Whether I   m off at a different university or  here, I intend on continuing to work with students who are coming to the  program here, which is something I   ve done. I   ve talked, read emails,  read essays and stuff from afar for a lot of years. So, if they   ll remember  me as having a positive impact at all, then that will be better than what I  could have reasonably expected when I, probably, was a sophomore or a  junior.  Speaking of a sophomore or junior, any advice you   ll give to new  47  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  students coming to Oklahoma State?  Yes, I would say to be a full-time student. That   s your job, is to be a  student, and to really work at it like a job. I have so many students  who   I know a lot of times they have to, it   s a monetary necessity, they  go to work or whatever. But, at times, that becomes their whole identity  and they are trying to work their school around their work. If you   re  having to do that, then you need to reevaluate. Get rid of the cell phone;  don   t buy those shoes. Live as simply as you can so you can work as  hard as you can, because that   s the number-one thing that they don   t do.  They get fixated on the grade and think,    Oh, if I can make a B then it   s  okay,    but that   s really not the point. The point is what you personally  make of it. And OSU is one, actually all schools that I   ve been at are  one, of those. But OSU is a lot like that. Your education really is a lot of  what you make of it. I think almost anywhere you are, if you want to,  you can make it through. But if you really work hard, you can make  your education into anything you want it to be and work at whatever  level you can imagine. So, that   s really been the key, I think, is just  working hard and engaging. And if they do that, that   s fantastic. Those  are the kind of students that are like a gift when you get them in your  class.  You mentioned earlier in our conversation OSU changes. What kinds of  changes do you see in the last ten-year period since you left Oklahoma  State to now? Do you like what you see?  Yes, I really do like what I see. Like I said, I feel like some of the small  bigotries that we did have on campus a few years back   and actually  were broader in society, it was not just a problem with OSU   those  things have shifted. I certainly think in terms of, like I said, definitely in  terms of gay students. Nobody would have come out of the closet at  OSU unless they really wanted to be a social pariah. That   s just not an  issue now. Hopefully, that   s the case with race too. So, those things have  changed for the better.  The campus just seems very vigorous to me. There   s been all this money  that   s come in, and buildings are built. I   m excited just looking at  campus and how it   s changed. It looks good. It looks good and big and  vibrant. It   s just an exciting place to be when there   s a lot of stuff going  on like that. All those changes have been fantastic. I   m very pleased  with them. I really have a hard time identifying anything that   s changed  for the worse since I   ve been here. It really seems like it   s gone from  strength to strength for me. The only thing that, maybe, has changed for  the worse is not the campus, but I do notice a big trend of so many of my  students are working so much. And I don   t know if that   s because tuition  has gone up or because their priorities have shifted, but that   s something  48  Gill  Greteman  Gill  Greteman  that I would like to see. I think education should be cheap or free for as  many people as it possibly can be, and I think that we   re doing a better  job of that at OSU than most places are. But in doing that, we   re really  swinging against the tide and fighting a real uphill battle, because  everywhere you go, I mean, the common story is that it   s getting more  and more expensive. So, that   s something not just here but everywhere  is, I think, going be probably the biggest struggle going forward, is  keeping it affordable and I don   t know how. Hopefully, the economy  improves. I think that the leadership we have here is about as good as we  could get. Really, I   m very happy with that, too. I feel like the place  seems to be in very good hands, and that   s really gratifying to see.  Blaine, it   s been awhile, but is there anything you   d like to share that we  haven   t had a chance to touch on?  I can   t think of anything much. It   s been fantastic. It   s been fun to talk  about this stuff. I had a really great time here. Like I said, it   s a great  school. I feel like I really was blessed in my choice of coming to OSU.  There was a lot of crazy chance and things involved. I   ve always felt  like I would have had a hard time doing as well just about anywhere  else. I really do think I could say I owe my success to OSU in a way  that   if I would have, say, been a little more cosmopolitan, then I would  have applied to all the big top Ivy League schools and everything, and  would have gotten into one, and ended up at a Princeton or Harvard or  something. Aside from having a lot of debt, I would have graduated  with   I have a hard time believing that I wouldn   t have just, sort of,  fallen into the mix there in a way that I didn   t do here. I think here,  maybe partly because it   s not Harvard, I   ve had this experience with  students. You get somebody who   s really passionate and interested, and  you   re going to make time to work with them. That   s what happened to  me. So, I really had that fantastic experience here that I think it would be  pretty hard to replicate just about anywhere else. So, it was definitely  formative, let   s say. And that   s about all I have on it.  I appreciate it, thanks.  No problem.  -------  -------
