 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at the OSU Library. Today is Friday, October 19,  2012, and I am in Stillwater, Oklahoma, interviewing Patrick Wyers as  part of the O-STATE Stories Oral History Project. Thank you so much  for joining us today. Welcome back to OSU. We   re so happy to have you  with us.  Well, thank you, Juliana. Now, just for your information, I   m going to  take this coat off later.  Okay.  I wanted to get all these pins in because the top one is of the Lions Club  with the American flag, and the second one is, of course, Life Member  of Oklahoma State University, and the last one is Pistol Pete with a  Stillwater Lions Club emblem on it.  Patrick, let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Could you  tell us the year you were born and where you grew up?  Okay. I was born in Quinton, Oklahoma, June 8, 1934. Lived there just  briefly to gain a little strength and go with my mother back to our home  because she was spending time with her sister during this childbirth. We  moved from there to my father   s farm near McAlester, Oklahoma, and  stayed there several years. At the age of about three, I decided I was  going to capture Santa Claus and waited at the chimney for a long time.  Checked that chimney near every fifteen minutes to see if he was  coming down it, but I fell asleep, and when I woke up, he   d already  come and gone. (Laughs) So we moved from there to an aunt   s home  because of economic times, Jean Smith, and lived there for a brief period  of time and then on to my grandmother   s home in Stigler, Oklahoma. It  was there that I started first grade, and it was there that I quit first grade.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Very few people know this, except immediate members of the family.  I   m probably the only college graduate that dropped out of the first  grade. (Laughs)  How   d you drop out? Why   d you drop out?  I didn   t like the teacher. Therefore, I just played with my good friend  Charles Stevenson. I   d leave the house like I was going to school. My  mother knew what was going on, but she didn   t take me by the hand and  take me back to school. Anyway, after that, Charles and I entered the  first grade together and went right on through. It wasn   t until I was in the  fifth grade that a fifth grade girlfriend was asked where she was going to  school, college. She said,    I   m going to Oklahoma A M. That   s where  my brother is going.    Little did I even give any more thought to it that  later in life we would move from Stigler in 1950, starting my sophomore  year, to Stillwater.  I must give credit (which I   m leaving this DVD with you) to my brother,  Paul T., who because of his success in high school was given by a home  demonstration club one semester of books and tuition to Oklahoma  A M because of his outstanding work and success as a high school  graduate from Stigler High School. So in the fall of 1950, through a  friend of my brother   s, all of our furniture was loaded on a cattle truck  and was headed for Stillwater. In the truck cab was my mother, my  young sister, LaQuita, an uncle of mine, Douglas, and the driver. In the  back was my younger brother, Scotty, who felt he was safe enough from  shifting furniture that his life wasn   t going to be in any danger. But Paul  and myself, knowing that that could shift and injure a leg or arm or  whatever, we hitchhiked from Stigler to Stillwater. Spent the longest  time of getting a ride in Perkins, Oklahoma, only ten miles from  Stillwater, from the Oklahoma State campus, but we did get a ride in and  arrived about five o   clock in the afternoon.  My mother had leased a home on McElroy Street, so that   s where we  lived the first few years we were here. From that point, then we moved  because this older brother, Sam, lived in Veterans Village due to his  World War II service. There was housing coming available for people  that needed inexpensive housing, so we moved to Vets Village and lived  there while I attended school and Paul finished, and my younger brother,  Scotty, enrolled and finished, and my young sister, LaQuita, finished. In  that interim time there, my mother decided because she had had one year  of college at Oklahoma University, she would enter the OSU School of  Education. So three of my relatives, Mother, Scotty, and LaQuita, all  became school teachers. Paul received a degree in industrial engineering,  and I received one in mechanical engineering. That   s why it   s so  important that this person be given credit.  6  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  So when Paul got the scholarship and he had his mind set on going to  Oklahoma A M, how did the family decide,    Well, we   re all moving to  Stillwater   ?  It was a decision that my mother and my brother made.  And I see in the photograph, did Paul play sports?  Oh, yes, yes. Here   s a picture of the football team with only two people  identified. I didn   t  remember the names of  the others, but for this  interview I decided I   d just use that. Also, I have documents of his  obituary along with statements from my brother, Sam, and his wife, as  well as the statement I made at his funeral in Lakewood, Colorado,  February. It was a little later that we had the services. It was February  19. He passed on February 1 of this year. His wife of fifty years is buried  in Arlington National Cemetery, as is he.  So you were a couple years younger than Paul.  Three.  Okay. So when you came to Stillwater, you enrolled at the high school?  Yes.  What was that experience like for you?  Well, here I   d grown up in a 3,000-population city, Stigler, Oklahoma,  and knew everyone from first grade on up, so it was a big transition for  me to move into a new school that was much larger, not knowing  anyone, except the day I arrived, a friend, Bob Williams, befriended me,  and we became good friends for many, many years. As far as I know,  still are, but he lives in Colorado. I don   t know if he   s in the Denver area  or the Boulder area. I did get to talk with Bob last year or two years ago  and asked how he was doing and everything, but because so many years  have passed, you could tell that bond was not as strong as when you  were in high school.  First year, I didn   t play sports. I just felt I needed to concentrate on  getting adjusted to the school and the lessons that were being given, but  my junior and senior year I did play and had good acceptance and good  success. Unfortunately, in playing a contact sport, I lost half of my front  tooth in one of the games against Tulsa Central in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on  the Skelly Stadium football field. (Laughs) Mr. Bob Timberlake of the  Tulsa football team wanted to see if I could take a bite out of his helmet,  7  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  but it was intentional movement by his head to my face that caught the  tooth and lost the half of it. Fortunately, the only pain, immediate, was  because when you   re playing sports you breathe a lot through your  mouth, and I could feel the cold air passing over the tooth that had been  broken. Saturday morning I went to the dentist, and he put a cap on it.  That lasted for twenty years.  Wow.  Twenty years, exactly. In my football career at Stillwater, I was very  fortunate in a football game in Blackwell, Oklahoma. The team was,  according to our coach, not doing too well. (Laughs) It seemed like he  got the impression we were just having too much fun on the bench as  well as out on the field. In those days, football was like a job. It was  serious. A few of us who seemed to be having more fun than some  others were on the bench for a while, and then near the end of the game  he put us in.  The only game wherever I was able to score a touchdown, the opposing  team quarterback threw a ball that had been partially blocked, and it  wobbled in the air, and I ran for it and got it. I was headed like I was  going to the bench of our team. I didn   t really put on any speed until one  of the opposing players said,    He   s got the ball  He   s got the ball     So  then I increased my pace, and about the ten yard line before I reached  the goal line, he was moving to tackle me from behind. I was able to put  my hand behind my back and push his helmet down to where I was able  to go across the goal line and score the touchdown. However, the  announcer in the booth misidentified the player and gave Jim Remy the  credit for the touchdown, (Laughter) but we did win the football game. It  wasn   t due to that touchdown, though. But anyway, it was a big  highlight for myself as a football player.  When you were in high school, did you have a part-time job?  Oh, yes.  Where did you work?  I worked at a drugstore right across from the fire station here on the  campus. It was a drugstore owned by a good friend of mine   s father, Mr.  Fiscus, and a partner of his. I was a soda jerk, I guess is what they called  them     Okay, yes.     but we also fixed sandwiches and soup for people and got acquainted  8  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  with some of the students who were in the fire department here as  educational purposes. I learned from the fireman that if the coffee was  too hot, he would put his spoon in it and let it cool down to where he  could then drink it safely without burning his mouth. That, possibly, was  the first introduction how, in one way, to cool, slowly, coffee.  Interesting.  By putting a cold spoon in it. It was just the normal temperature of the  room, but it was still colder than the coffee. I don   t remember the  student   s name, but he was a very talkative and sociable fellow. Prior to  that, though, in Stigler, Oklahoma, I had many jobs. The first one, I was  about eleven years old, selling garden seed to neighbors so I could earn  money if I wanted it or I could earn a Red Ryder BB gun. Then later, I  worked in the theater taking tickets. This was in Stigler, of course. Then  I became a soda jerk for a pharmacy there in Stigler, and after school I  would work there. This was all before I started playing sports.  I also worked in a dry cleaning business, pressing pants and shirts and  doing necessary stuff in the back, washing pants and pre-washing them,  as well as working for a Chevrolet company on the weekends, working  in the body shop, working on cars that needed painting and repairing so  they could put them on a used car lot and sell them. The dirtiest job I had  for that company was washing down the grease rack, which at your age  you probably don   t ever see any of those anymore because they were a  very highly contaminating procedure in that you use kerosene to loosen  up the excess grease that dropped down on the floor. Then you used a  high-pressure hose to wash it into the drain where it went, as you now  know, into sometimes streams and valleys.  You didn   t have a lot of free time.  No. It wasn   t terribly bad. I guess the easiest money I ever made was  going to the fairgrounds after a big football game and going beneath the  stands and finding coins as well as sometimes a dollar bill that had fallen  out of people   s pockets. I still recall today my first experience with the  Roosevelt dime. At that time, your dimes had Mercury on them, picture  of Mercury, but this was a new coin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt coin  that had his picture on it. I had to wonder if that was going to be  accepted by merchants, but it was. Anyway, I would go, like I say, on  Saturday morning over to that football field, and I couldn   t believe it  when I found that Roosevelt dime of where I found it. I found it out near  the goal post where young people had gone out at halftime and they   d  wrestled and played and lost some money.  Well, let   s get back to Stillwater. We took a little detour, there.  9  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Oh, yes.  So, in high school, time is probably coming for you to graduate     Oh, yes.     and was attending Oklahoma A M the plan all along?  Oh, yes. It was the dream of my mother and my brother, Paul, to enable  us to enter Oklahoma State University and finish school.  And so, your freshman year, did you know what you wanted to major in  already?  Well, again, brother Paul says,    I   m an industrial engineering major, and  I think you   ll be a good mechanical engineering major.    So I said,     Well, I guess I   ll work in that area,    but it was a struggle for me. I  persevered, as most of us in the Wyers family have done over the years  and was able to complete my schooling, of course, with the assistance of  my wife that I married in 1959.  Well, how did you meet your wife?  Well, as I said, I did struggle with my subject matters here at Oklahoma  State, and in 1957 the Stillwater Draft Board said,    You   re eligible to  serve your country for two years.    So I was drafted and left for Fort  Eustis, Virginia, latter part of December of    57, en route to Fort Eustis,  Virginia. I   m happy to tell you that en route, I was able to go see this  older sister of mine, Oteka Johnese, who lived in Willoughby, Ohio, and  spend a few days with her and her family and then on to Washington,  DC. Train had about an hour and a half layover there, so I, for the first  time in my life, left the train station, Union Station at Washington, DC,  hiked up to the Capitol of the United States of America, all the way up  the steps, many, many steps. I didn   t count them. I looked out over the  city on January 1 of 1958. I didn   t see anyone moving at eight a.m. that  morning around the city of Washington, DC, from the Capitol steps. I  later reflected on how Napoleon must   ve felt when he arrived in  Moscow and nobody gave him the keys to the city, but he was much  more disappointed than I. I was just en route to serve my country for two  years at Fort Eustis.  On July 25, 1958, I went on a blind date with the lady who later became  my wife. Her name is Mary Ellen Abell, who lived in Crozet, Virginia,  which is just west of Charlottesville. She and three other of her friends,  nursing students at the University of Virginia School of Nursing, were  10  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  on spring break at Newport News, Virginia, staying at the home of Mary  Alice Price. They had met some of my friends from the service a few  days earlier, and this one friend of mine says,    I can   t make it to go on  this date with Mary Ellen, so why don   t you go? I have Guard duty.    So  I went, and that   s when I met Mary Ellen. We dated from then until I left  Fort Eustis, Virginia, in the latter part of 1959 to come back to OSU,  finish my study. I must say that because we had been so fond of each  other, that in October of 1959 I called her and asked her to marry me,  and she said,    I   ll have to get back to you on that.     Wow.  (Laughs) Three days later she called and says,    The wedding is  December 20 at four o   clock at Mount Moriah United Methodist  Church, and you best be there.    I did because that was the winter break  in classes. We were married on December 20, 1959, honeymoon in  Washington, DC, and was able to, each of us, watch then President  Eisenhower light the national Christmas tree. Later on in    60 when our  first child was born, September 22, Mary Ellen said,    My friends of my  mother   s are back there counting on their fingers the number of months  from the time we were married until our baby arrived.    They finally  concluded that he was a honeymoon baby, which he was. That   s  Randolph Zane Wyers, who   s now fifty-two years old.  So that   s the background on her, but she has a longer story because her  interest was education. Her mother was a teacher, but she wanted, one,  to be a dean of a school of nursing and earn more money than her  mother had ever made, which she did. She became the Associate Dean  of the School of Nursing at University of Texas in Arlington, Texas. An  interesting story about that, Juliana, is that as she completed her  doctorate work, our daughter who was probably twelve or thirteen says,     Mom, do I still call you Mom, or do I have to call you Doctor?     (Laughter) Now that daughter, Suzanne Abell Wyers (York is her  married name) is forty-eight years old and has two sons, which I have  documentation on one of them that I want to leave with you. The  youngest one of her sons, his name is Connor Patrick York, and he was  on an Argyle Eagle basketball team his senior year to win the state three-  A championship in basketball. I   ll be leaving a picture of him with that  information that was submitted to the Chickasaw Times paper.  Well, I   m glad you brought up your Chickasaw heritage. Was it always a  big part of your life growing up, being Chickasaw?  For my mother, it was. Her lineage was from the Chickasaw Nation, and  my father   s was from the Choctaw Nation. When we applied for enrollee  membership, Choctaw and the Chickasaw Nation had kind of proposed  11  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  that you couldn   t hold membership in each, even though the father was  Choctaw and the mother was Chickasaw. You had to just be a member  of one. So, as you do, you follow the lineage of your mom since she was  the one pushing and wanted each of us to always be a Chickasaw  member of that nation.  When you came back to OSU to finish up your degree, where were you  living at the time?  My wife and I rented a one-bedroom, one-bath apartment on 404 Elm  Street here in Stillwater. I would go to class, but prior to going to class,  because we had the child, Randolph, I would take him to the babysitter,  early morning, take her to her work which started at seven a.m. at  Stillwater Municipal Hospital, then I would go to class. Then I would go  pick him up, take care of him, then go pick her up, or pick her up  because her shift ended at three.  Was it different coming back to campus after your service in the  military? And now you had a family. Were your priorities a little  different?  Oh, yes. Yes, you mature. Yes, very much so. The only way we were  going to really move ahead was me finish school and go to work, which  I did for the Boeing Company in 1962. The first assignment was the  Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, where Dr.  Werner  Von  Braun and his team was working to perfect the engines for the Saturn V  program. I worked there for four and a half months, then on to New  Orleans, Louisiana. Actually, it was Chalmette, which is a little  community south of New Orleans where the Michoud plant was located.  It had been a plant that had been built by the Kaiser people to build  wooden aircraft because aluminum was so rare and getting very much  more scarce. However, the successful ending of the war, it was  mothballed and kept as part of the military establishment until  something better came along or there was some higher purpose for it to  be used. It was then activated to house rooms to build huge first stage  and second stage of the Saturn V program.  Fortunately, that program was very successful, and on July 20, 1969,  Mr. Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon along with the  second one, Buzz Aldrin. I was fortunate after moving to Fort Worth to  meet and shake the hand of Alan Bean, who graduated from Paschal  High School in Fort Worth. I don   t remember what year, but he also was  fortunate enough to be in that program and walked on the moon. It was a  very good time for me because I approached him and asked him if he  would be kind enough to sign his autograph for my son, Randolph, and  my son Randolph   s good friend, Brian. He said he   d be glad to, so he  12  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  gave me a little slip of paper with his mission number on it and his  name. It was one of the highlights for my success in that program.  After that came to a close in    66, I was hired by General Dynamics in  Fort Worth to work on, then it was called, the controversial F-111  airplane. It was pretty advanced aircraft in that the wings would swing  back as the speed increased and then swing forward for landing  purposes. That, again, was a successful program. I worked in the  Structural Flight Test Program there because, currently, our good  Australian friend is still flying that aircraft, and they think it   s one of the  best ones they   ve ever had. General Dynamics, I guess, has certain  facilities, or licenses them, to make the necessary repair parts for the  aircraft.  Well, at what point did you get into real estate?  Well, my experience in the federal government was working for, I  coined it, the Federal Buffalo Program, and that was moving about the  country on various defense programs. It became very tiring and  upsetting for my family to move, so in    72 I left the engineering field  and learned the real estate business through a broker there. A part of  that, though, my wife and I had already bought some investment  properties that were fortunately income-producing properties. In    69 we  bought them, late    69, and she   d gotten advice from her father that says,     Mary Ellen and Pat, if you have any excess monies, I suggest you  invest it in real estate.    So that   s what we started doing.  I then later opened my own brokerage company in 1974, and from that  point, I was in up to my ears in rental property and also selling  properties. I had very good success in that until 1987 when things just  started deteriorating badly in the real estate business due to the  government regulations and programs that were set up to, in one sense,  protect the buying public. They felt that the government needed to  protect individuals (Laughs) from making bad decisions and being taken  advantage of. Then I went to work for a company that I   d been with the  company of investors who were buying commercial properties because  they were so cheap and they had the money to buy commercial  properties. Right in Fort Worth, I started in June of 1987. I closed my  business May 31, 1987, and went to work for them in June 15, 1987.  Worked for them, managing a pretty large complex of commercial  buildings in Fort Worth until 1993.  Then I experienced my first serious health problem. My wife, being a  nurse, knew what probably would happen if I didn   t get early treatment.  Fortunately for me, I had a wonderful primary physician who followed  me every year, physical time, and then said,    You need to go to a  13  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  specialist and have that prostate gland checked.    So I did. I went to a  doctor, Sidney Worsham, and he followed me from 1989 until 1993  when he said,    Mr. Wyers, I   m going to have to take some samples of  that because it doesn   t look good.    So he did, six samples, three on each  lobe, and five of them came back pre-cancerous. He said,    You have  some options,    and he gave me all those options.  My wife and I went to Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and got a  second option, and I   ll never forget the doctor   s name:  Arthur   Sagalowsky. He says,    You can have the gland removed, and at your age  I suggest that,    which was at that time, fifty-nine and a half. He said,     I   ll put you in touch with a radiologist, and he   ll tell you what they can  do for you. If it were me, I   d have it removed.    That   s what was done,  and a very successful work by Dr. Worsham in that at that time he was  doing what was called nerve-sparing method. In that sense, he was most  successful in sparing the nerve so that I wouldn   t be incontinent or  impotent. That was    93, and that   s when I left the management of that  and then just worked on my own. I managed my own residential rental  properties and buying a few others.  So are you retired today?  No. I am carrying notes on four of the properties that in twelve more  years, three of those properties will be paid off. One of those four will be  paid off in about another seven years. Fortunately, all except one of  those properties, all except one, are right on time in payment. The fact of  the matter is my son-in-law calls those checks I receive each month     mailbox money.    I tell you just one of those, though, is always  struggling to make that payment, but he makes it. (Laughter) He says I  have too much money invested in that property to lose it, so as long as  he keeps thinking that   and that   s true. He does. He has approximately,  right now,  33,000. He paid a down payment of  7,700 because I wasn   t  going to accept a 5 percent or a 3 percent down payment because I   d  seen too much bad things happen in the rental business.  I   m guessing it   s also a tougher business today than it was twenty, thirty  years ago.  Well, it must not be because my son, Randolph, has approximately  forty-three to forty-five properties in Longview, Texas, that he handles.  He has also other areas of interest of making money, like owning a  commercial building, owning a car wash, a self-service car wash, a  laundry service, not a laundry, but a washateria.  Sure.  14  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  I don   t know what other areas he   s involved in because he   s very busy.  He has three boys that he has to   he   s already put one through  university, and he   s been successful. That   s Riley Randolph Wyers. The  second one will be graduating. Nicholas Zane Wyers will be graduating  from Texas A M, December 14 of this year.  The third one, Jackson  Wyers, is a junior at Texas A M . Then my daughter   s two boys,  Carson, the oldest, will be finishing Texas A M in business in May of  2013, and his younger brother, Connor, the state championship  basketball player, will be going into his sophomore year in 2013 at  A M. So I have four grandsons at Texas A M currently.  I won   t hold it against you.  Well, in-state tuition is very reasonable.  That   s true.  However, my daughter brought Carson up here to OSU to see the  campus, and he was offered a scholarship by OSU to come here, but  because he grew up and his cousins had gone to Texas A M, that   s  where he wanted to go.  Well, I guess they   re in the SEC  Southeastern Conference  now, so not  a big deal. If they were in the Big Twelve, then maybe it   d be fighting  words.  Yes. (Laughter)  Well, you look back on your time here at OSU, are there any key  moments that just really stand out?  Well, a professor, L.  Ladislaus  Fila, was not my advisor, but I had a  number of classes with him. He knew where I lived in the Village, that I  could probably use some work, so he said,    We have a wind tunnel that  needs to be removed from a room. Would you be interested in  disassembling it?    I said,    Certainly.    I took his direction. He coached  me along, being very careful with the particular parts of the wind tunnel.  I disassembled it, and then it was stored in one of those huge storage  buildings around here. Later, he said,    My wife and I are going to be  moving. I   m going to go back to get an advanced degree. Would you be  good enough to   I   ll pay you,    he said,    to help us pack stuff and move  and load it.    I said,    Well, certainly.     When he sat out some of the things that he was going to let the garbage  people take, I asked him, I said,    Professor Fila, are you going to discard  this nice radio, this wooden cabinet?    It had broadband in it. He said,  15  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers     Yes.    I says,    Well, if you don   t mind, I   ll just take it and check the  tubes and see       Sure enough, just one tube needed replacing, so I  replaced it. I lived with that radio until about four years ago when I had  an estate sale, and, oh, maybe my son took it. My daughter said,    I   d like  to have that radio.    I said,    You can take it just any time. You take it,     but she never did. I think my son took it. Anyway, Professor Fila was  very good about working with me on helping me earning money here at  OSU.  I met a number of other young students, one of them, Dr. Gerald Parker,  who was a friend of my brother, Paul. He said,    You know, Pat, we   re  having a Toastmasters meeting here, and I   d like you to come.    I says,     Okay.    Went to the Toastmasters speaker and listened, and he had a  very humorous speaker that evening who read an article using sounds to  emphasize certain parts of his talk. It was very humorous and  entertaining. Dr. Parker said,    You know, it would probably help you if  you joined the Toastmasters.    I spent many, many hours here in this  library studying for my classes, and so I didn   t join the Toastmasters. I  did participate in a few of the other events that happened, primarily  basketball games at Iba Stadium over there.  At that time, Coach Iba had a son, Moe Iba, that was at Stillwater High,  same class as my younger brother, Scotty. I got acquainted with Moe.  Just knew who he was, and he knew who I was, but never did have any  real firsthand acquaintance with his father, Hank Iba. OSU has always  had a good wrestling team, and the top wrestler at the time I was here  was Myron Roderick. It   s the only time I   m aware of, and possibly the  only time it   s ever happened, that the basketball stadium was filled the  night that Mr. Roderick was wrestling. I yet don   t really truthfully know  if he won his match or not, but I strongly suspect he did.  I was also in attendance at a football game where a football player from  the opposing team was deliberately incapacitated by an Oklahoma State  A M football player named F. A. Dry  While F. A. Dry was a player on  the Oklahoma A M team, news reports note Wilbanks Smith delivered  the blow in this incident , in that Dry had delivered a forearm to the jaw  of the man and caused him to leave the game. Mr. Dry and I had a later  meeting at a Lions Club in Fort Worth when he was asked to be a  speaker at our club. I had to ask him if he really intentionally broke the  jaw of Johnny Bright at the time, and he wouldn   t reply.  Really?  No, because at that time he was coaching Texas Christian University in  football. I was able to enjoy those sporting events at Oklahoma State and  many of the other areas, but those are the memorable ones and enjoyable  16  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  ones.  What buildings would you have most of your classes in?  Engineering building, not any particular classroom number or anything  like that, but I do recall Professor  Edwin  Soderstrom in the shop area  teaching us how to use a lathe and heat-treating materials. My brother,  Paul T., had the same experience with Mr. Soderstrom, and Soderstrom  was quite a jokester in that he often would instruct a student to pick up a  piece of material that he knew was hot, instead of the student using what  my brother, Paul T., said was common sense, like putting his hand above  the material before he grabbed it. (Laughs)  That   s one way to learn. (Laughter)  I can   t recall the name of the professor that taught surveying, but that  was an experience, too, when we were walking over those transits and  other tapes and stuff, measuring. Students walking by, wondering what  was going on, and we just told them,    Oh, we   re going to build a  railroad right through the campus.     Did you spend any time in the Student Union?  Well, this picture says I was. (Laughter) I was spending some time  there   You apparently were taking a little break there.  That was before classes started.  Before you went into the service, did you attend any dances?  Yes, yes, a few times. Bob Williams and I had   the Student Union  would have dances, and we would attend those. Young ladies at that  time were very interested in school, and we young men needed to get an  education in the areas that possibly we could make a living at, so we  didn   t socialize too much with the young ladies on campus. Although, I  will have to say that, remember the young lady in the fifth grade that I  said her brother was going to Oklahoma A M?  Yes.  Well, she later enrolled here, and we reacquainted. Sadly, and I don   t  know, I guess so much time had passed that we just had one date. Prior  to her enrolling, she had been involved in a serious automobile accident.  She hadn   t been disfigured or anything. She just had some mobility  17  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  problems to a degree, not anything really bad.  What year did Paul T. graduate?  It was    54 or    55.  Okay, so you had some time where both of you were taking classes at the  same time on campus.  Oh, yes. Like all of us, in going through high school and on into college,  he was very fortunate to get to work for one of the labs here, doing  drafting work for some of the engineers that were working on research  projects. He did that for several years, so very seldom did I see him or  talk to him because he was very busy with his studies, as well as  working that particular job. He did advise me on   he enrolled in the  ROTC program, and when asked if he wanted to continue to get a  commission, he continued. As he learned what was going on and how  serious military service was, he suggested to me that I not participate in  advanced ROTC, that I complete my first two years and let it go, spend  my time studying. So I did that. Like I say, he was a very big influence  on my life.  As a result, I attended services of his in Lakewood, a suburb of Denver.  Then June 15, when he was buried at National Cemetery in Arlington,  Virginia, I made the trip to represent our family at his burial. All of his  children were there, some of our cousins from my oldest sister   s family  were there. The family was well represented, more so than the  immediate family of my brother. This younger brother, Scotty, says,    I  attended his service in Lakewood, and I   m not going to the National  Cemetery in Washington, DC.    My older brother, Sam, had fallen and  broken his hip, so he said he couldn   t attend. So I made the trip, and I   m  very happy and thankful that I was able to do so.  As I got off the metro there in Washington, DC, another couple got off,  and the lady walking real fast ahead of me looked familiar. Sure enough,  it was one of my  nieces  from my older sister   s family, Debbie Turner,  that I recognized and spoke to. Her husband was walking a little bit  behind me, and he said,    I thought I saw you get off that metro.    So,  sure enough, we got to walk on to the reception area where we waited  until all the family assembled and then went to the cemetery for the  burial site. I must add that other members of my family, my mother and  my father, are buried at Fort Gibson National Cemetery near Muskogee,  Oklahoma. He was buried there in 1965, and in 1998 my mother was  buried there. She lived to be ninety-eight. My father, sadly, only lived  for sixty-seven years. Like I say, those two members of my family are at  national cemeteries.  18  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  I   ve signed all the documentation and sent it to the funeral home of  where I   m to be buried, and I   m to be buried at the National Cemetery in  Grand Prairie, Texas. My wife, Mary Ellen, is buried in a cemetery  behind the Mount Moriah United Methodist Church in Crozet, Virginia.  What   s interesting about that, Juliana, is that on July 25, 1999, my  daughter Suzanne, her two boys, Mary Ellen, and I were visiting her  mother at her home in Crozet, Virginia. After church services, Mary  Ellen walked over to my daughter and said,    Suzanne, when I pass  away, I want to be buried right here.    And right here where she pointed  is where she is buried because she passed away on July 29, 1999. If you  recall, I met her on July 25, 1958. On July 25 she had a massive heart  attack in 1999 and passed away.  She was on life support for four days.   She was born at the University of Virginia Hospital, and she died at the  University of Virginia Hospital. She was born May 15, 1938 and died  July 29, 1999.  I want to go back to your mother for a second. Before you went into the  service, you all lived in Vet Village together?  Yes, sure did.  Was that different? I mean, was that a different type of family setup than  other people around?  Well, at the time, of course, yes. I would say that possibly we were the  only family in Stillwater High School that lived in Vet Village. I didn   t  know of any others. In the home we had there, it was on the first floor,  fortunately. There was an upstairs, but another family lived upstairs.  They were veterans. Living in that home was brother Paul, myself,  Scotty, LaQuita, and my mother.  How big was it? How many rooms?  Oh, must   ve been three bedrooms, at least, and one bath. When I was in  high school I can recall, or I experienced, anyway, as I was getting ready  to sleep, the drone of the B-36 aircraft that flew its missions out of Fort  Worth, north. Just the most different sound than you   ll ever hear other  than from the B-36 aircraft. That was our base of living and operation  until we moved from there over to (I don   t remember what year it was)  the apartments on Elm Street. Of course, brother Paul had already gone  into service, Air Force, and very seldom returned home. I do recall him  sending money to my mom when he, Paul, was still single, so that was  very helpful.  Was your mom working in town?  19  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  No, Mother had a full-time job with her children, full-time, cooking,  cleaning, and washing. I mean, she was very much a stickler on  cleanliness and personal hygiene. She just wasn   t going to tolerate dirty  clothes or dirty children. (Laughter) I   m sure because of that is the  reason that we stayed, I think, very healthy: very healthy conditions.  And you said she went on to teach school?  She, after receiving her degree, taught for at least fifteen, maybe even  longer, years. She was a very determined and wise mother. She knew  that the only way that we were going to really better ourselves was get  as much education as we could, which has proven to be very, very true. I  must, again, go back to being able to convince Mary Ellen that she made  a wise choice when she married me. Because of her support and interest  in acquiring assets with her working and me working and our children  not making big demands and also not participating in questionable or  unreasonable activities, we were able, Mary Ellen and I, to accumulate  possibly more assets and wealth than we ever dreamed we would.  It   s hard work.  Oh, yes, but also opportunities that come and if you can take advantage  of them, you can be very successful.  Well, when you look back on your life, how would you want to be  remembered?  Well, in honor of Mary Ellen, in the year 2000 I established a  scholarship for deserving high school students who are members of  Mount Moriah United Methodist Church. I have literature here of the  church, and I must say that my mother-in-law mailed me a plate with  this picture on it. It said it was established in 1834. I told Mary Ellen that  they were very forward-thinking people because I was born 100 years  later in 1934. In this packet are letters from the two ministers who were  in attendance when these young people were given scholarships and  letters from students who received scholarships. One of the very  interesting things about the female pastor was the statement that some of  these students have finished school and have now contributed a  scholarship.  That   s a good legacy.  I have another handout from the Mount Moriah United Methodist  Church. It says,    Next Sunday, Mount Moriah Church will celebrate  holy communion and the award ceremony of Mount Moriah  20  Scholarship. This scholarship was set up by Patrick Wyers in memory of  his wife, Mary Ellen Abell Wyers for students who are applying for  higher education.    I set this up, like I say, year 2000 with a gift of   25,000 to be used for a scholarship, but also for assistance to families  who were having difficulty with electric bills or food. Then Mary Ellen  set up her own scholarship at UTA  University of Texas at Arlington ,  and I can   t recall the year. Over the years, my children and I have  contributed to the scholarship. I have letters from students who have  received these scholarships, and all this is to go into the material.  One other area of service that I   ve really been instrumental in is with the  Fort Worth Southwest Lions Club. I   ve been a member there for thirty-five  years. In that time, our club, because of the dedication of the  members   they have been very hardworking members in the sense that  we currently have a program for raising money from Bingo. We work  Bingo, and it   s a system that was set up by the state legislature for  charities who want to participate. It   s the biggest fundraiser for our club.  One of the big programs is the eye exams and glasses for children who  need eye exams and glasses, but of late, in the last five years, we   ve  received requests by adults who need assistance. The most recent one is  from a lady, the name of Josephine Kitz, who is a very hardworking  single lady that has had eye problems for a number of years. It just got  so bad that she needed some operations. In researching her situation and  speaking with the individuals that would furnish us documentation as to  her condition and the cost, I was asked to follow up with her request.  When we finally got the request of  5,350 it was going to cost for all  this work, our club began to wonder if we could meet that. I checked  further with the individuals involved and asked them to send us  documentation. In finally pursuing that, they decided that, first, they  would do the operation on August 3 of this year, and then they would  submit all the information to what insurance company she had and I  guess any federal program that was available. To date, we have not  gotten a statement from any of those departments about the cost. If we  do get the cost, finally, of  5,350, our club has voted to help her in that  sense, and I   m submitting these documents for use for it.  The final cost  was approximately  2,800 and we paid the bill.   This is one of the publications that our club put out called The Shaggy  Paw back in 1985, and I happened to be president of the club at that  time. It has members and information. Another area that I want to be  remembered is my work with the advisory board of the Salvation Army.  They are an organization in Fort Worth that assists men (in the area that  we work, anyway) in solving their drug problems or economic problems.  I   ve been on the advisory board for eleven years for the Salvation Army.  21  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Just for information, a very dedicated minister in England in 1865, name  of William Booth, he was somewhat discouraged by the Methodist  church in the way they were not working in helping individuals who  were really needing assistance in food and shelter, so he and his wife,  Catherine, formed the Salvation Army in 1865. Do excellent work with  the areas that they are involved in. So that   s, in the sense, the areas that I  truly want to be remembered.  Although, I do want to be remembered (and my children have indicated)  that I am and have been a good father, a good husband to their mother,  and a good grandfather to their children, the grandchildren. I must add  that I was approached by OSU Foundation to set up scholarship, and I  told them I   d be glad to do that, I   d be glad to make a contribution of   50,000. However, I wanted to break it up into two scholarships:   25,000 to my mother and the School of Education and  25,000 in the  name of my brother, Paul T., in engineering. The young lady I talked  with says,    We can   t do that. We can   t do that. It has to be  50,000 for  your mother and  50,000 for your brother.    Therefore, I have yet to  establish a scholarship at Oklahoma State University in my mother   s  name or my brother   s name.  Well, hopefully they   ll work with you.  Juliana, I must add a very important fact, and it   s going to be something  that I am going to be remembered by because I have a brick in the  alumni walkway over there in 1960 that has the first names of all  graduates of Oklahoma State University. The first one being my mother,  Ruth, the second one, Sam, the third one, Paul, the fourth one, Patrick,  the fifth one, Scotty, and the sixth one, LaQuita, and the last name W-Y-E-  R-S. So, for seven names, I got a bargain of seventy-one dollars and  something cents for names for that   600  dollar brick.  It   s a good family legacy.  Well, like I say, I haven   t talked to Alumni Association, but I am going  to go over there sometime today and check to see if the names are still  legible. If they   re not, I   m going to ask them,    What does it take to get  another brick? Is it going to be another   600 , or is it going to be    300 ?    I   m looking for discounts  (Laughter) I believe in getting my  dollar   s worth. Also, I want to leave this document of my first grandson  (and it looks like the only one) that is going to get a degree in  engineering from LeTourneau University. It has all the information in it.  As well as that is a Chickasaw Times paper that has on the front page     Veterans of the Elders Trip to Washington, DC, in November of 2011.     22  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  It   s a wonderful decision by Governor  Bill  Anoatubby to honor the  elder veterans, and they do this not just for this group, but for others as  time goes on. So you   ll see myself with the hat on in that particular  publication.  And this is a wonderful article on the place my second wife and I live in  Crowley, Texas, that is the best-kept secret in that area. Saint Francis  Village is the best-kept secret in town, and we   ve been living there for  three years now. My wife just loves it because as far as I know we   re the  only retirement area that has its own deer herd and wild turkeys. Wild  turkeys just parade in the backyard, and deer come up. Because my wife  feels that they   re not well-fed, she buys deer blocks and also takes any  cuttings out to feed them. Anyway, that   s my story and I   m sticking to it.  As we start to wind down, we notice that Oklahoma State alumni have a  great loyalty to this university. Why do you think that OSU alumni are so  loyal?  Well, I believe it   s because, one, they   ve had a wonderful experience as  students at Oklahoma State, and I hope and pray they feel they   ve  received a wonderful education. As a result of that, I know that their  priorities have been and will be, hopefully, that they can contribute  further to the success of Oklahoma State University by emphasizing the  need that Oklahoma State University has for scholarships and then  participating in it.  From hearing your story today, it makes me think that for your family  OSU was a good doorway for helping lay the groundwork for, really,  success in your family. I think that   s very important to the legacy that  your family leaves behind here. Thank you so much for sharing your  story with us today, Patrick. Is there anything else you   d like to add  before we close on out?  No, other than it   s wonderful that the Alumni Association has set aside  and arranged for this type of historical effort by its graduates.  Well, we appreciate you participating today.  When I told the clerk at Fairfield Inn, where I stayed, today I had an  interview, he said,    What   s your interview about?    I said,    Well, this  satchel, I   ve been carrying around seventy-eight years of history right  here, so I   m going for a historical interview at Oklahoma State  University.    He said,    Well, good luck and good success in it.    I said,     Well, thanks.     Well, we do appreciate you giving us a little snapshot into you and your  23  Wyers  Nykolaiszyn  family   s life here at OSU.  Well, thank you, Juliana.  Thank you.  -------  -------
