 Gill. Today is January 14, 2010. I   m visiting with Lela  Bennett Sullivan in her home in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. This  interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program.  Lela, you   re a member of a family that is very special to Oklahoma State  University, the Bennett family. Dr. Henry G. Bennett is your  grandfather, president of OSU from 1928 until his death in 1951. He  served under President Harry Truman as his director of  the  Point  Four Program. Dr. Bennett and his wife, if you can help me here, Vera,  had five children: Henry Jr., Phil, Liberty (known as Libby), Mary and  Thomas. Your father was Phil.  Right.  Okay, grandchildren we were talking about earlier. How do you rank in  there with the grandchildren?  Okay, there are eighteen grandchildren and I   m the fourth oldest. The  oldest grandchild was Jacqui Bennett Holmes who lives in Florida now.  Her younger sister, Nancy Noxon, who is in Edmond, those were my  Aunt Josephine and Uncle Henry Bennett   s two daughters. Then, the  next son was my father Phil and I   m one of three children. My older  brother, Henry G. Bennett III and then myself and then I have a younger  sister, Corabelle, who is a psychiatrist in Maine  and a  graduate of  OSU. Then, the next child was Liberty and they had four girls. The  oldest was Vera Alma and so we have, Jacqui, Nancy, Henry, myself  and then Vera Alma. Then there were three younger sisters. The twins of  my grandparents were Mary Bennett Delozier, who was married to  Uncle Mack, and Uncle Tom who was married to Emmadell Swim.  Emmadell and Tom had four children, two girls and two boys. Then  Mary and Mack had five. Little Mack and Mary Bennett   Mary  5  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Delozier Harris, who married an OSU golfer   s son   well, he was a  golfer, too, Labron Harris, Jr. They had three younger sons, Henry, Phil,  and Tom. There were eighteen of us altogether. The ones that really  knew my grandparents were born before 1951, so there were like seven  of us, I believe.  How old were you     I was ten when he died.  I wanted to discuss, obviously, your grandparents, particularly your   grandfather  Dr. Henry G. Bennett. Could we discuss a little bit about  your immediate family  first  and can you tell me a little bit about where  you grew up and about your father?  My father, Phil was born in a home in Hugo, Oklahoma when my  granddad was superintendent of the schools in Hugo. He was the second  son. He met my mother, Francis Corbin, in Stillwater, in junior high.  They got married and then World War II came along. I have an older  brother that was born in 1940, Henry. He teaches ( he   s  nearly retired)  in New York State University system out of Corning. He went to MIT in  Boston two years and then came back and graduated in philosophy at  OSU.  He was a graduate     Of OSU.  And he was also a graduate teaching assistant for a year or two?  Yes, he was. I went to OSU with him, following, and graduated in  political science in 1963. Then my younger sister, who is eight years  younger than I am, she graduated from OSU and then married an  Episcopal priest and went to medical school in Dallas. He was in a  church in Dallas and they live in Maine.  Now  where did you grow up ?  After the war was over and I was four or five, when my dad returned  from service in the war   World War II   we moved to Oklahoma City  and that   s where I   ve grown up.  Okay. Where did you go to high school?  I went to Edgemere Grade School and Harding High School for six  years and loved it.  6  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  You enrolled at Oklahoma State in the fall of     I went to New York for the first year and came back as a sophomore to  Oklahoma State University.  What school did you go to in New York?  Briarcliffe  College .  A private School.  Yes, a girl   s school.  Then you came back in 19   ?     60. Yes.  Can you tell me a little bit about your major? You were talking about  that a little bit earlier but for the record.  I loved OSU. Partly, I was much closer living near my boyfriend who  was at OU, even though I was at OSU. I started taking courses I liked,  like political science, and then I had a bunch of economics and then I  had a bunch of history. I loved school; I couldn   t take enough of it.  Can you tell me a little bit about your OSU experience? Something  about the activities and organizations that you were a part of?  At school?  Yes, ma   am.  I joined a sorority and made friends that we still see to this day, in  California, doesn   t matter, Arizona.  Pi Phi?  I was a Pi  Beta  Phi.  I   d heard.  You   d heard  (Laughter) Our family has lots of Pi Phi   s in it. Except I  will tell you, we have two of my Bennett cousins that are Kappa Kappa  Gammas. Nancy Noxon and Vera Alma.  I   d talked to Vera. She said she   s the first one that wasn   t a Pi Phi in the  7  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  family. (Laughter)  That   s right. Well, Nancy really was, but she was just there a year.  Are there any activities you remember being part of while you were on  campus? Student activities, organizations?  Just having lots of fun. I loved it.  So you lived in the Pi Phi house while you were there     Yes.  Did you have some favorite places on campus, hangouts?  One of my good friends was editor of the O   Colly, Anne Larson  Schneider. She has now gone on, PhD and the first woman to have an  executive post at Arizona State University in the corps, but every  morning about seven-thirty or eight, we would meet at the O   Colly  coffee shop and work the crosswords and talk about what the editor was  going to do that day. That was lots of fun. I was kind of behind the  scenes in all the politics. I just loved it all.  Did you write some articles?  No. I got my studies, got good grades   loved it.  Did you hang out at the Student Union very much?  Student Union was a popular   and I will tell you, The Hideaway it  seems like was just starting down on that Washington   is it Washington  Street or is it Monroe?  Washington, better known as the Strip.  Yes, now it   s the Strip. It has certainly changed its looks. We just had a  good time.  So there were Swim   s in the family. Did you hang out at Swim   s some?  Not really. If you know, when I was there, my sorority changed houses.  They were right across from Theta Pond for years. Then my senior year  we moved to the new house, which was really far away from Swim   s.  We walked. People didn   t have   we had like, four cars in the whole  house when I was there. We just had a great time;  I got a  great  education.  8  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Speaking of education, were there some professors you remember, Lela,  that were particularly helpful?  Dr. Hanson, Dr. Darnell, Dr.  Homer  Knight; I would say those were  great     Bertil Hanson in political science and     I thought he was old, but he was young. (Laughter) I saw him recently  and I thought,    Oh       One of the funnest things that   s happened to me,  the connection of OSU, is my son, who did not go to OSU, read in our  newspaper a copy of letter to the editor about the Middle East situation  and he wrote this professor and the professor said,    When you   re in  Oklahoma, I would love to meet you and your family.    Through my son,  who did not live here, we were guests of Dr. Raymond Habibi and I got  to know them. Then about a year later, he called and wanted us to have  dinner. He had some of my old professors that were still around over for  dinner. I thought,    This is what it   s all about.    We just loved it and kept  up with him.  Lela, can you share a little information about your life after you left  Oklahoma State? You graduated in    63     I graduated in    63. Then, I was fortunate enough to teach for three years  while my husband finished medical school in the Putnam City Schools.  And this is Mark. What school did he go to?  He went to the other university. (Laughter) I just wish we had gotten  him for track up at OSU    it would have  been a lot more convenient.  But anyway, we got out of medical school and it was the Vietnam call-up  for all involved in medicine. We were fortunate again to be stationed  in Nashville, Tennessee, where we had two children. Then after that, he  decided he wanted to practice in Oklahoma City in dermatology. So we  moved back to Oklahoma City and have been happy here ever since.  Lela, you were talking about your two children. Did either of them go to  Oklahoma State?  No. Our daughter, when she was a junior, decided she wanted to go to  USC  University of Southern California  and major in cinema-theater.  We told her that was just great. I mean, that was such an outstanding  school. If she could get in, that would be great. Well, she got in. The  next year, our son   who is one year younger   went out to visit her. He  is quite academically inclined and he said,    This is just a great place.     So we had two graduates from USC. Needless to say, it is a fabulous  9  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  school, academic as well as in the sports arena. That wasn   t easy money  for a Sooner to spend, going out of state to that school. They loved it.  They had a great experience.  You   ve been active in the community as a volunteer. Can you share some  of your activities through the years here in Oklahoma City?  I have been fortunate to get involved in the city in different things. I   ve  chaired Allied Arts Leadership Area, which supports all the art agencies.  I   ve been president of the YWCA  Young Women   s Christian  Association  and was involved, during my time, building the battered  women   s shelter for the Y. For three years now, I   ve been chairing the  Oklahoma AIDS Care Fund, which distributes money to agencies to  educate and for medical supplies. It   s kind of diverse. Oh and how could  I forget Red Earth, the Native American Institute. I was chair of that for  three years, too. I loved it. I thought it was fun.  Those are all wonderful causes here in  the  Oklahoma City area.  We enjoy getting involved in the causes where there   s a need.  Could we change direction just a little bit and talk about your  grandparents a little bit, what you remember about them?  They left us quite a legacy.  First of all, start with your grandmother, Vera. Were you able to spend  time with her growing up?  Okay, in thinking of this, especially in the last month about my  grandparents, there are lots of wonderful stories from my parents, their  generation, from professors I   ve known at OSU, from friends I   ve  known, where they truly made a difference in their lives. However, my  grandparents left   well they both left us a legacy that has made an  imprint on my life and consequently on my husband   s life because we  have known each other all our lives. He knew how important the spirit  of my granddad was. There   s two or three very personal instances that  maybe no one knows except Mark and I or my parents. To start off,  occasionally, I got to spend the night at Grandmother and Granddaddy   s.  Now that is nothing like spending the night today.    What do we want to  do for dinner? How are we going to entertain the grandchildren?     This is in the president   s home on campus?  This is when I would be four years old, five years old, eight years old. I  don   t remember the last   but anyway, we would have dinner, not with  10  Granddaddy because he was usually busy. He would come home and we  would visit awhile and then he would go to his study that was a quiet  room. My grandmother and I would read or talk   remember there were  no televisions   if there wasn   t an activity going on. It was very  inclusive. The funnest thing was, since Granddaddy studied until all  hours of the night, I would get to spend the night in their bedroom with  my grandmother. We could read or go down and get water late and bring  it up and I could comb her hair. These were young instances.  Then, playing back on that, often at Thanksgiving or Easter or a family  time, we would all have dinner together or lunch together in the dining  room. It was very important that all the family be there   Aunt Liberty,  Aunt Mary, Uncle Tom and Uncle Henry. There was a table for the  adults and this time there were five, six, eight grandchildren and there  would be little card tables along the side for the grandchildren. One  time, we came in and they were a place setting short. There weren   t  enough forks for the children. Of course, I was the one that was coming  in late and my Granddad, I will never forget this. Rather than saying,     Dora,    (who helped in the kitchen)    would you bring in another place  and a chair for Lela?    He said,    Honey, I want you to sit right here with  me at the front of the table.    Now, to play off that, I thought,    Look at  me.    And he said,    Now, it   s our job to make sure everybody is included  and has everything they need. You   re going to help me make sure this is  a fun party.    It immediately was inclusive of everybody rather than     Look at me.    So that was a lesson. I was lording it over my brother and  Jacqui and Nancy that I was sitting at the head of the table with  Granddad.  Then another time, which was really shortly before they died   like a  trip, they had come home from Latin America or something, and they  were going back to Ethiopia, Egypt for the final trip. We had the lunch  and then we all went into the living room and he called all seven or eight  of us up and we were sitting around because he had something for us. He  had silver dollars that he wanted us to put in our banks. Of course, he  was short again. I didn   t have my hand close enough. He took me  upstairs. He said,    Come on, Lela. We   ll go upstairs into the quiet  room.    That was a thing where he   d study or read or plan the next  visionary project. And he opened up his drawer and he said,    I just  brought this back from Ethiopia. I want you to have it because you were  so nice and didn   t push and shove to get that dollar.    I was just  over joyed    I still have it. In fact, right now for Christmas, my husband  has a necklace being made to put it on. He knew it was so special  because he said,    To all, there is an opportunity if you take your time  and aren   t pushy.    I will never forget that, because when I went down, I  had the prize. Loved it.  11  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Twice.  Twice. (Laughs) But he was always inclusive. No one was going to be  left out. I can remember he kept saying,    You took advantage of that  opportunity.    He wanted to make sure everybody had an opportunity and  he was inclusive. That   s what I remember.  Your grandmother, I understand, was a pretty strong influence on  everybody and I understand that she was a very strong Christian. Did  she share her faith with you and the grandkids?  Yes, one night it was a Saturday night   it must have been a Saturday  night. She taught the women   s Bible class and he taught the men   s and  we went to church.  First Baptist Church?  First Baptist Church in Stillwater. I got to be a guest at her Bible class  and I never heard so many scriptures in my life, since or before. She  lived her faith. There were some women that she was helping get their  education, get through school. That afternoon, there was a big tea at her  house. The women   some of the college students that were in her Bible  class came and washed the dishes (there was not a dishwasher) to work  for money or credits to go towards their tuition so they could graduate. I  got to sit and watch them. They were very impressive about what they  did, their faith, their belief, their wanting to provide opportunities for  others.  Did she ever read the Bible to you?  Oh yes, every time we spent the night we would select a verse or select a  book in the Bible.  And Vera Jaeger said she remembered   I   m trying to think of the name  of it   the famous children   s Bible stories book that she read Bible  stories from.  Yes, but she charged me with learning the books of the Bible because I  did not know them. Every time she   d say,    Now, let   s start,     because  in  the Baptist church, you memorize all the scriptures in the Bible. It  was quite   I do cherish that, because to me, that was them. When they  went to the Holy Land on one of their trips, they brought back   it   s  sitting right in our living room   the Bible they brought me, inscribed.  Was she instrumental in helping organize Falls Creek summer camp?  12  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  I do not know that. I do not know.  Vera had talked about that a little bit.  She lived in Stillwater and she might have gone, because when my  family moved to Oklahoma City, then we became active in the  Methodist Church here in Oklahoma City. I was not aware of that and I  don   t remember when I was younger.  Do you have some special memories of your grandmother, some special  times that you spent with her?  Watching the girls work in the kitchen, so they could go to school to get  their education; combing her hair; her reading the Bible. I got to select  books, too. And always making sure Granddaddy was respected in the  home for his horrendous schedule he did have to keep. She was very  praiseworthy of him.  What do you remember most about her personality and her  characteristics?  Strength. She was quiet in many ways. She had a wonderful laugh. They  had a harp in the music room and she would come in and   I had no idea  how to play the harp but I loved the music tones and she would sit and  take her time and listen and praise. That   s what I remember.  Do you remember some stories that you heard about your grandparents  from your father, Phil, and some of his brothers and sisters that would  give us some insight into Dr. Bennett and Vera?  She was the strength of the family unit, because his life was enveloping  needs of others. From the time he was a teacher   well, actually, I was  told that he delivered the mail in rural Arkansas when he was sixteen  because the family was poor. His education in Arkansas was free,  because if you were the son of a Baptist minister, you could go to the  Baptist Church College in Southern Arkansas. This is what he did. Then  he got his teaching certificate. He was always helping others, organizing.  He taught a little bit in Durant and then moved to Hugo as  superintendent of schools. He was busy. My grandmother   they married  before he went back to Hugo   was the strength and the loyalty to the  family. The needs of the family, she sort of helped persevere. That   s  what I   ve been told. All the time I was able to spend the night or be with  them, this is what I remember. It was Grandmother that was organizing  and then Granddad would come in. But when he was in, he was 100   involved with us all.  13  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  I understood that he even helped cook sometimes?  I don   t remember that, but he would be nosing around. I don   t remember  the cooking (laughter)   as I remember he enjoyed food.  I understood they had a lot of overnight guests and people would just  show up and they   d invite them in to spend the night.  I think they were very inclusive. I thought the house was big. It really,  evidently, wasn   t as big as I remembered it. But I can remember that.  And then, besides just spending the night there, I do know an older  friend of ours in Oklahoma City now, when we moved back from  Nashville, we met him and he said,    I just want to tell you something,  your grandfather       and Mark and I looked at him,       was one of the  three greatest people that ever lived.    We just said,    What?    And he  said,    Jesus Christ, FDR  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  and Henry  Bennett.    (Laughter) And we laughed and we said,    Oh, what are you  telling this tale?    And he said,    I want to tell you. I was from Southeast  Oklahoma. I thought I had to get to college. I went and told them I could  play basketball and Mister Iba had Gene Smelser tell me,    You   re never  going to make it as a freshman.       (Laughter) And he said,    But Mr. Iba  called me in after I was told I wasn   t even on the tryout team and said,    I  want you to go over to Whitehurst and see Dr. Bennett and he will figure  out how we can keep you in school.       He did and while he spent a night  at their house, the next thing he knew, he had a place in the old field  house. They were putting up people back from the war to house until  they could move into a dorm. And my granddad told him   this is the  tale,    If you make straight As, there is a place for you. We are inclusive  of everybody who wants to learn.    He said,    I graduated in three years in  education with a Master   s,    because that   s all he did. He knew if he  could keep the As coming. Now he is a very successful businessman and  loyal to OSU.  So give me the trilogy again. Your grandfather was number three on his  list. Number one     It was Jesus Christ, FDR, and Henry Bennett. (Laughs) And we went,     What?    Because he had been inclusive to him when   and this was a  very smart man. He wanted to go get an education and really isn   t that  what the land grant school is about to this day?  It  should be. You  should find a way for everyone to have that opportunity.  Lela, kind of going back to a couple of your comments about the  presidential home     I thought it was real big.  14  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Tell me what you remember about it.  Playing tag in the front yard, clear down to   it was called College   Avenue  then.  College Avenue.  Yes and just loving it. And going under   they had a car port or  something where you drive through, for their one car. (Laughter) It was  fun.  Now the first floor had the kitchen and a large dining room.  The real large dining room. It probably seated ten or twelve, I think. But  to a child under ten and everybody   s in there. Okay, then you walked in  the door and then here is the living room that was   I always thought  long and skinny and had a fireplace at the end. Then behind that was  kind of a porch closed in or something. Then there was a music room.  Aunt Mary played the harp. They had a piano and a harp and then big  cupboards with things. Because truly the last three years of their life,  they did a lot of traveling. I can remember it was fun because they had  chests   tall, old bookshelves and chests where they   d    Grandmother  loved to shop when she was with his company. That   s what she did. She  never went on these missions to see or be a part of the program and she  used to write us postcards,    Well, today I shopped.    And she did. They  had beautiful things brought back, crafts of other countries.  Great story. So now, there was a basement?  There was a basement. It was spooky.  Washing machine with a laundry chute that went down into the  basement?  I don   t remember the laundry chute; I bet they did. I remember we ate  breakfast in the kitchen kind of with a little table. It was all white with  linoleum floor. Then after they died, they tore it down.  The bedrooms were up on the second floor?  Yes. Everything was up on the second floor.  Then there was a study     The study was probably really   and one bath. I mean you see     15  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  This was sort of Dr. Bennett   s area     That could have been a bedroom but it had a big desk and then those  bookshelves with glass   old kind of bookshelves behind. That was what  was in there   and his study and a little light. They had one, two   rooms  were not as big, certainly not closets, as are demanded today. I mean,  I   ve often thought the president   s house now   there was talk of a new  president   s home for the Hargis    and from now on   which, there  probably still is, but he  Dr. Bennett  wouldn   t have believed how big  the grounds were and the home if he were alive today.  Lela, what are your feelings about the home  being  torn down and then  the Bennett Memorial Chapel     I couldn   t believe they tore that wonderful home down. Because to me     I mean, I was a child. I was what, twelve, thirteen when they did that? It  was empty. I don   t think the Willham   s   when they followed, they  stayed in their home, as I recall. And then maybe towards the last they  built the new home of Dr. Willham. I can   t remember the years.  Uncle Henry and Daddy would say the vision of Granddaddy was so  futuristic because he was alive for the Student Union and the library  plans were in place, but it was all to go together and it was very  important to him   the horticulture, the look, all those magnolias that     That was his favorite. He had those imported.  Brought with him from Korea, right?  He loved the magnolias. That was all important and the architecture was  all important. Then that was really my first thing. I thought,    What is  going on up at my school?    It was because they tore it down and had a  very contemporary   it looked like out of the architecture school     chapel. And while religion was very important, I understand all that, to  them and they would move out to a space away from campus. I just wish  they could build a house for the president right where it was with all  those fun memories and have it look like the rest of the campus.  How did your father and the children feel about the   ?  I can   t speak for the other aunts and uncles but I know my dad was sort  of disappointed in the look of it.  Not that they built a chapel but just didn   t design it to match the campus.  No, in the look of it. To him that was very important because it was so  beautiful. But I can   t speak for the others. Maybe they had a part in  16  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  designing it. I don   t know.  You were mentioning earlier, Lela, your granddad   s experience of  traveling and what he brought back (kind of moving to Point Four). Do  you remember anything about his tenure at Point Four? How old were  you when he was appointed Point Four Director in 1950?  Well he was appointed forty        49 or    50     Yes. I was like, nine years old. I knew it was very important because at  the time that made our newspapers here, because it was good for  Oklahoma   I mean it was a star in Oklahoma   s hat. I remember a  discussion with my dad and my Uncle Henry. They would be together  every weekend and they were surprised Iowa State University, which  was the prima donna agricultural university at that time, was not an  appointment. I mean, it would go to somebody in agriculture but they  were very proud. And others were very proud. It was all in the papers.  That was a star.  You were old enough to know how special and how important your  grandfather was.  Oh, yes  Yes. Right.  A great source of pride to you, then, as a grandkid.  Great pride. I was just proud, because they were my grandparents. I  mean, I just loved it.  You talked a little bit about his philosophy, do you remember any about  his philosophy as director of Point Four, how he felt about helping  emerging nations and individuals?  I remember him telling that   really they were going to Latin America,  to the underdeveloped countries. He was going to help teach teachers to  teach. I can just remember,    I   m going to teach teachers in other  countries to teach their people how to grow wheat, how to make a better  life.    He was going to teach others to teach. That   s how he explained it  to me. He was so inclusive. That   s what I remember from the dining  room table.    Everybody needs to make sure they have a good time.    He  was just inclusive of everybody.  So that philosophy started at the dining room table and extended across  the world.  17  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Yes. I mean, that   s what they left us and they really left me and then my  husband   it was special to him, too.  Lela, it must have been just a shock to the family, the tragic accident.  How did you first learn about that?  It was like three days before Christmas and my father was sick with  hepatitis, in bed, I can remember. The door bell rang late at night and it  was Vernon Snell, who was a friend of my parents that was a writer for  The Daily Oklahoman. Knowing Mother and Daddy, he had seen this  come across the AP Telegraph, the wire service, and he came to the  door. That   s how we found out. It was horrible. It was such a shock.  Do you remember how your father reacted?  He cried. He was sick and he cried. It was just hard to   you   re grateful  for friends and family.  Did you anticipate having so many more years to enjoy them?  Well, right.  Did you attend the funeral services in Gallagher?  The one in Gallagher Iba, it was overwhelming. It was just  overwhelming because it   how do you say? It was so public. It was just  a big thing in Gallagher Iba.  It was packed?  It was packed. That   s what I remember.  Do you remember anything about any of the memorial comments or  anything about the service?  No, my   no. I remember Senator Kerr was there, I believe, because he  came up and was hugging my dad. I hardly remember. You   re sort of  overwhelmed at something that big for something so personal. I mean,  their lives to me were very special as a grandchild. Then to have the  whole   you don   t realize how many people care, even to this day.  Speaking to that, you touched on it a little bit earlier, but from your  perspective and your personal knowledge of your Grandfather Bennett,  what, in your opinion, is his legacy, all of his life   s work   what is his  major legacy?  18  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Opportunities he has given others. By his leadership, by the atmosphere.  In fact, I will tell you something really cute. My mother died  unexpectedly in an accident. The week before, Mark and I took her to  Stillwater. She was ninety-one. We put her in a wheelchair and went all  over the campus and ended up eating at the Rancher   s Club in the  Student Union, which she had not been to. You park and you have to go  down that tunnel. I mean, it   s not very conducive to going to a nice  dinner. We had her and she was having the time of her life and two or  three times in the tunnel, going up, we met people working in the Union  or students. Every one of them,    Is there anything you need? Can  we   ?    Just happy, and she said,    It   s the same as it was when Dr.  Bennett came.    The inclusiveness and the friendliness    He gave others  an opportunity and they have taken it to heart. That   s what I think he  left, opportunity.  Lela, how important was education to him? I mean, obviously he was an  educator but     I think, he realized that he had been told,    Get to that college where you  can better yourself. Learn.    I think that just developed more and more.  With that came the belief,    We   re all here to be better people and this is  how. And it should be an opportunity for everyone to be better.    That   s  the learning part of it. He believed to mentally be a better person makes  you a better person. He was always learning. Like mine wasn   t a silver  dollar. Mine was a Maria Theresa from Austria that the Ethiopians were  using. See, there   s always learning, to make you a better  person . His  mission was to provide opportunity and I believe really the land-grant  institutions across the country are supposed to do that.  He worked just unbelievable hours and then     He did. I can vow to that.  What do you think was his motivation? What was really important to  him in life that he was able to give so passionately of his time and his  life?  He just did.  Do you know where that comes from   that motivation, that drive?  Growing up in Arkansas poor and his father became blind. I don   t know  what that means in today   s standard. They didn   t have money and he  carried the mail to the neighbors to be paid for the family. I don   t know  how somebody is so pushed and shares that desire. Maybe he   he went  to Columbia University when he was   I think he was at Durant at  19  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Southeastern.  He  took a year to get his Master   s and PhD, as graduate  work. I don   t know what pushes you when you have children, a wife  that   s just taking care of your children   and yet, he was very loyal to  family causes. I don   t know where that comes from. I just know he  thought everyone should be included in the opportunities available,  which is kind of an interesting concept.  Lela, what do you remember about your Grandfather Bennett in terms of  his office? Did you ever go to his office?  Whitehurst. To pay tuition when I was a student. I knew it was at  Whitehurst. I don   t remember that. I don   t remember his office.  Vera had told some stories about actually going over and he allowed her  to come to his office as long she   he said just be quiet, I   ve got work  today. She   d just play in his office, which is pretty unusual.  I would bet that, because you could always be with him.  Getting back to his characteristics, you indicated that he really didn   t  need a lot of sleep. He worked late into the night; he would get up early  and leave. Can you attest to that?  I can attest to that soundly because we   d go in and tell him good night  and then he   d come in and give us a kiss but his light was on all the  time. He could focus on things just in conversation and you thought he  was real interested. (Laughs)  I heard that he had a lot of nights he might average two or three hours  of sleep and that   s all he needed.  And get up the next day and go on. That   s right.  Wow. I heard he was excellent at remembering names.  He always knew my name. (Laughter) I don   t know, I never saw that but  I wouldn   t doubt it. He was very personable and more than that, he was  aware of everything in the room.  Wherever, took charge and     Took charge in making that okay. Same thing as the silver dollars. He  did it; he makes it okay.  Like his wife, Vera, he was strong Christian.  20  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  He was.  As you indicated earlier, he taught the men   s Sunday School class at the  First Baptist Church while Vera, his wife, taught the women   s class. I  heard that he would be sort of a lay preacher. Did you ever get a chance  to hear him teach or preach?  I was in the women   s  No. (Laughs) I was listening to Grandmother. No.  We talked an awful lot, trying to get a feel for Henry G. Bennett, the man  and the family person. The non-public part of him. Do you remember  hearing any personal stories about him from your father and aunts and  uncles that resonate with you?  No, I can just tell you    One semester   and I thought I always made  good grades and I did. But one semester, I had a 3.93 because I got a B  in bowling. My dad said,    Why did you let that happen?    (Laughs) I  fired back something like,    I thought they were good.    Or something  like a twenty year old would do. And he said,    Your grandfather would  want all As.    (Laughs) So I   m sure Granddaddy wanted his children to  have good grades.  In fact, said the very same thing to him.  That   s exactly right. (Laughs) So that might give you a little idea.  You alluded to him having a delivery route. Are there any stories from  the early family stories from Arkansas?  He had two sisters, I believe, Aunt Stella and I can   t remember. He rode  horseback or something. I mean, it was just like, you hear these things.  Delivering the mail and then I guess he fell off his horse and broke his  ankle and couldn   t continue. The next year he went to college and then  he got a job in    I think he taught a year in Arkansas and maybe that   s  where he met Grandmother. Then he moved to (I   m just trying to think  what I   ve been told) to Durant to teach and then Hugo needed a  superintendant and he applied and got that. That   s where my dad was  born. Then, they moved back to Southeastern. He was there eight or nine  years. That is one thing I can remember, a family discussion of why he  was so outstanding for   Mother would really toot his horn because  before he came to OSU, there was president after president after  president depending on   we were a young state and they would fire the  president and the Board of Regents would tell the governor,    We want  so and so,    and they   d last six months or two years and it was unstable.  When he came, he stayed and that   s where it started growing as a major  university.  21  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  For twenty-three years.  Yes.  That   s a pretty good tenure, isn   t it?  Yes.  You were talking about his father, Thomas, or Tom.  Thomas      He  was a Baptist Minister.  Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson was his name. Isn   t it funny how they used  to name after   Thomas Jefferson.  He moved to Stillwater with him. He was still alive when they moved, is  that right?  Not that I know of. I never heard that. You mean that he brought him  there?  I wasn   t sure if he was still alive or not.  I don   t remember him at all. I was born in    41. That would have    I  don   t remember that at all.  Did Dr. Bennett, your grandpa, ever give you any practical advice?  Have a chance to sit down with you and a little bit about philosophy,  how to live your life   practical advice?  No, he never was formal like that. By his example, you knew it. From,     Now it   s our opportunity to make sure everybody has what they need  and is having fun,    from the dining room. That   s how he lived it. I  remember that, and to be inclusive.  One of the things that has come to me from Granddad through my dad  was he was so proud of the Student Union and I think that must have  been like    47 or    48. There was an Indian artist (I never knew an Indian  at that age, when I was seven or eight) named A.C. Blue Eagle and my  granddad had commissioned him, quote,    for his education to paint the  murals all along the walls inside    no paint, no wallpaper but A.C. Blue  Eagle did it. As gratitude, A.C. Blue Eagle went on to be one of our  foremost Native American artist   s in the middle twentieth century and  made an enormous painting for him. My dad has one of the pictures  22  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  from A.C. Blue Eagle and now I have it.  You have that now?  Yes. I   ll show it. But he said,    Always be inclusive. Everyone       I  mean, he lived what he really felt. I don   t remember any sit down talks, I  just remember    It takes a lot of work to be a great person.  Does any of the Bennett family ever get together? The extended members  of the family? Any reunions you have occasionally?  Four years ago they had Thanking Paul Bass. Kind of a gathering in  Arkansas together and probably half the family came.  The Bennett Statue that looks over the mall and kind of     I love it.  It is said it is where he could see the library and the Student Union both.  I love that. That   s awesome.  How does the family feel about that?  Very proud. Very proud. I just wish they had them of all the presidents.  That gives you really a connect. Grandchildren have their pictures made.  It   s just very much of a connect.  Were you there at the ceremony when they unveiled it?  Yes. But it   s a connect. There   s also something else very proud at the  Historical Society over here by the Capitol. They have an area.  History Center?  History Center. Yes, the new History Center. So that   s kind of fun.  Then of course there   s the Bennett Memorial Chapel, Bennett Hall     Yes. Bennett Hall   s still there.  Have you had a chance to remain connected to Oklahoma State  University through the years personally?  Well, yes. Your loyalty is always there. Your love is always there. I will  say our family   Mark feels very strongly that he has a wonderful  23  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  education given to him by Oklahoma University. And he is very loyal.  However, he is very proud of OSU. Our children chose another  university and to all universities we are life members just because we  think, like Granddad, education is the way to take advantage of  opportunities in life. Now, I feel real connected because Burns and Ann  are such close friends.  We have enjoyed being a part and think   one of my granddad   s first  things he did, you might not know this, when he became president in the  late twenties, there was a professor there in art. He just came to teach art.  There was no art department. His name was Doel Reed. He made him  chairman of the Art Department and said,    Build one.    They still have  this art department. The legacy is now that Doel Reed, the daughter has  given the estate in Taos, New Mexico for students across the board at  OSU. So that   s a fun thing for us to watch, because it   s a cycle. OSU  grabs you by your cowboy boots.  You spoke of this earlier, Lela, and I   ll ask you one more time   how did  Dr. Bennett influence your life? You said earlier that he was a very  important influence in your life.  Truly, Mark and I love to be involved in the community and that   s one  way we feel we can be inclusive to those around us and maybe in some  way provide opportunities for a good life. Besides the shelter, we know  that works, the haven for people in trying situations. We feel the  encouragement AIDS has made over the last few years. My husband is a  chairman of the trustees at the Oklahoma City Zoo. That is a wonderful  thing for all Oklahomans. It   s a nationally ranked zoo. And my  granddad, that legacy, the spirit left us to be better people. My husband  and I are very, very proud of having a little bit of that spirit in us. Things  in our house remind us, things that have come to us.  You referred to yourself earlier as a silent member of the Bennett family,  meaning?  I would rather live that legacy than talk it. His legacy is definitely there.  I just feel a lot of people   he was a visionary. He didn   t do or talk about  what he was going to do or saw. He lived it. He actually was motivated,  directed and focused on what he wanted to do; provide opportunities for  people to be better people. I think so many times people do things for a  certain reason, egotistical or motivated by other influences. His was a  belief in a better life. He didn   t think,    Is this going to play this way or  this way or that?    as far as I   m concerned. He believed in what he was  doing. I think that is the key to why he lived it. Maybe that   s why he  could get along without sleep, maybe. I think others, as it goes down  generation to generation to generation, you look and think,    Oh, he was  24  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  Gill  Sullivan  so special.    Their stories become, not diffused but maybe a little  different.  Embellished a little bit.  Embellished and they still think of themselves as being touched by him  or a part of him rather than doing things themselves to make things  happen. I just think he lived what he truly believed. People say he was a  politician.  Maybe picking up on this, I have heard that in the good sense of the  word    politician.     He knew how to get things done. But there again, if you believe in  something, you   re not afraid of what will people think.  He has been described as a    practical dreamer.    He envisioned, maybe  is the better word. I think I hear you saying he was able to put those  dreams and those visions and those goals in to a plan.  Right. Create an opportunity through the land grant institution. I keep  saying that but the land grant is inclusive. It   s not supposed to be. Then  he would figure out a way to make it happen. That was through the state  legislature, through going to every county and getting to know the  school superintendants to tell those kids they need a better plan. They  need to go along with their education. He traveled a lot even before the  national  recognition . As the school grew, it became recognized.  I   d heard of him on his trips go out in the fields with the farmers and  have on his overalls and then change and make a city club speech that  night     And the next day be in church preaching. (Laughter) But he was focused  on how to connect with those people. He didn   t rely on a newspaper to  get the word out or the radio to get the   I mean he did that but he also  went personally and befriended everybody, saying    The opportunity is  there, you need to come.     That   s what we were talking about Lela, earlier, when you said what  drove him. This is what you   re saying is this way he had this vision to  improve people   s lives through education and opportunities and that   s  what directed and drove him.  I think it drove him and I think he enjoyed it. I can never remember     maybe I was too young   him being stressed out. Well, like Vera Alma  getting to play while he worked. While he works, he focuses. Or having  25  Gill  Sullivan  me spend the night. I mean, he knew what he was about. It would be a  better world if everybody was like that.  Knew who he was and whose he was. (Laughter)  Yes, that   s right. Oh, my gosh.  -------  -------
