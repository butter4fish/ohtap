 Neurohr  Taylor  Today is October 16, 2009. My name is Karen Neurohr and I   m a  librarian for Oklahoma State University. I   m here at the ConocoPhillips  Alumni Center with Dr. Glenn    Cat    Taylor and Mr. Taylor is going to  participate in an interview for O-STATE Stories, an oral history project  of the Oklahoma State University Library. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, for  participating in our interviews today.  Thank you for having me. It   s good to be here.  How did you hear about the interview?  Just a few moments ago downstairs.  You were recruited.  I was recruited, yes.  Well welcome back to OSU for your 50 year class reunion. Are you a  frequent visitor back at OSU?  I am an occasional visitor, at the present time. I don   t live very far from  here down in big Perkins, Oklahoma.  Home of Frank Eaton, Pistol Pete, right?  Home of Frank Eaton, yes. And we   re very proud people down there to  be the home of the original Pistol Pete Eaton. And we   re also proud to  have us a traffic light in Perkins, Oklahoma.  That   s wonderful.  We   re so proud of that traffic light.  5  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Did you grow up around Perkins?  I grew up in the hills of eastern Oklahoma in Sequoyah County. The  capitol of Sequoyah County is Sallisaw. I had the opportunity of going  to high school in Sallisaw and being a Sallisaw Black Diamond. It  wasn   t until I graduated from high school that I found out what a black  diamond was. I found it   s not a watermelon, it   s not a snake. I found that  it referred to the coal that was strip mined in that area of the country.  So did you think it was a watermelon or a snake when you were  younger?  You know, I was so na  ve I really didn   t think about it, to tell you the  truth.  Well I know a lot about Sallisaw, Oklahoma.  Uh-oh.  We lived at Poteau for 21 years.  You were a Poteau Pirate?  Yes. I taught at the high school there and I was at the junior college.  Both of my sons came to OSU and my older son married a Sallisaw girl.  Oh?  Lydia Weeden. Her mother was a Farmer, one of the Farmer girls.  Carrie Beth.  I know the Farmers very well.  Okay, so it   s a small world here.  Sallisaw is infamous for two major things. One is that Sallisaw is the  home town of Pretty Boy Floyd, one of the ten most wanted back in the  Dillinger days. And the author John Steinbeck made Sallisaw rather  famous as it was supposedly the beginning of The Grapes of Wrath in  his novel.  Yes, and he didn   t get that right, did he?  Not quite. But     He was a little too far east on that story. Well that   s some good country  6  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  down there. Okay, so you   re living at Perkins now. I see from looking at  your sheet here that you came to OSU from    57-   59.  Yes, I started my college endeavors at a junior college in Warner,  Oklahoma called Connors State College. I went two years there; the  college survived me for two years. And then I came to Stillwater in the  first semester that it was OSU, I came in the fall of 1957. We became  OSU instead of Oklahoma A M, at that time.  What made you decide to come to OSU?  Oh, I had come to OSU with 4-H events. I came to 4-H Roundup on  campus so it just seemed like the natural thing to do, being interested in  agriculture.  What was your major when you were in the undergraduate program?  In my undergraduate program, my major was Animal Husbandry   now  that dates you. It has another title now. Animal Husbandry is not one of  the names of that particular endeavor.  And then you went on to get your master   s degree here?  Yes, I did, I went on to get my master   s degree at OSU in the  Department of Horticulture.  Are there any particular classes or professors that stand out in your  memory?  Well, I guess I was really enjoying those undergraduate years. I think I  enjoyed many of the professors. They were nicer to me than they should  have been, for the kind of character that I was. Of course, I guess I  remember Dr. Bob Totusek as one of those that took care of me.  Was it hard to get into graduate school at that time? Do you remember  what kind of a process you had to go through?  I don   t remember that it was especially difficult. It must not have been. I  got in.  Which building were your classes in?  Most of my classes were in what is now Ag Hall and the old Animal  Husbandry building, which is no longer in place.  How did you feel when they took that building down?  7  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Well, I lost a lot of memories there. I was a member the Block and  Bridle Club. Of course, we had our Block and Bridle rodeo there, plus  all the classes that I had in there. Some very good times.  Did you have any classes in the Quonset huts? Were they still here?  Yes, I did. I remember the Quonset huts and I remember taking some ag  engineering classes in there.  Was that a good learning environment?  Well, we survived it. It got a little warm from time to time, as I  remember.  So you came here right after the name changed. Oklahoma State joined  the Big Eight Conference. They became the Cowboys, they were the  Aggies. Did you have any feeling about those kinds of changes that were  going on?  No ma   am, I didn   t.  And you mentioned living in Perkins now. When you were a student  here, did you ever see Frank Eaton?  Yes, I did. I remember seeing Frank Eaton riding on a stage coach in the  Homecoming parades. He had his big hat and his long handlebar  mustache. And he had a shot gun across his lap and he was riding on a  stage coach in the Homecoming parades.  Do you have any pictures of him from then?  No, I do not. I wish I did have.  That would have been quite a good picture, wouldn   t it? Where did you  live while you were going to school here?  Well, my first year when I was in undergraduate school here I lived with  my older brother and his wife and two little girls up in old Vet Village, a  little cardboard like Vet Village that used to be up the way. He was on  the GI Bill so I was able to scrape enough money for tuition and he let  me stay with him that year, with he and his family. And then the second  year he went back to eastern Oklahoma and I lived out on North  Washington. A man and woman let me sleep upstairs in a very warm  attic. To pay for that room, I took care of a bunch of chinchillas out in  the little garage. They had it air conditioned and they grew chinchillas  for their fur. And I had the chore of taking care of those chinchillas for  8  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  my room there.  How many did they have?  I cannot remember. We had a garage full of cages though where we  grew the chinchillas. I remember cleaning after those chinchillas and  then I would take the cleanings down to the neighbor and put them on  their garden. They wanted those cleanings. I also remember one night I  decided I was going home with a bunch of boys the next morning, I  would go back to Sallisaw. So I cleaned those cages at midnight or later.  I also remember taking the wheelbarrow down to the neighbors. And I  also remember they called the law on me because they thought I was a  prowler in the back, you know. So I talked my way out of that.  What activities were you involved in when you were a student here?  Well, I was a member of the Block and Bridle Club and I remember  going through the initiation and carrying a paddle around and getting the  signatures of all the members. Those were very good times. I really  enjoyed the other members of that club. I guess one of my activities that  I spent most of my time on was on the fourth floor of the Student Union  where we had juke boxes. We had places to dance on the fourth floor.  And popular music back then, Ma Presley   s boy Elvis had arrived on the  scene and Jerry Lee Lewis    The Killer    was there with a lot of good  music. There was a lot of time spent there, more time than there  probably should have been there on the fourth floor of the Student  Union.  Did you play any sports when you were a student here?  I did not play sports as a student here at OSU. When I was in junior  college I played some baseball for Connors.  What do you remember about Homecoming?  I just remember it was a big deal, even back then. I don   t guess I have  any special memories but I just remember it was a good feeling always  on campus. Everybody seemed to be upbeat. It was a lot of fun.  Do you come back often for Homecoming?  You know, I don   t participate a lot in the Homecoming events, but yes, I  do come back occasionally, especially for the Walk Around.  Has that changed?  9  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  It hasn   t. It hasn   t changed a lot to me. It   s great. It   s great.  How many students were in the Block and Bridle? Was it a group of  male and female students?  Yes, there were both and I   m just not sure the number that was in it.  Was it a large group?  It was a rather large group. Mostly animal husbandry majors at that time.  And you all put on a rodeo?  We put on a rodeo and had a very nice rodeo. And then they would have  steer wrestling and calf roping jackpots afterwards. It might go    til two  or three o   clock in the morning before we would get those over with.  And members of the Block and Bridle worked those jackpots and  worked the rodeo, brought the cattle back. In the Animal Science  building, down in the basement area there were two wings where we  brought the cattle back to the chutes at the front end. So it took quite a  few members to work those events.  Was this a fundraiser for the organization?  Yes, a lot of it was. Yes.  Were there other activities and events that were traditions for Block and  Bridle?  There were some related events that were very common. One of them,  we had Western Week. Everyone dressed western and it was the western  atmosphere all over campus. We would set up on the campus some big  posts in the ground, four big posts. And suspended between those posts  we had a barrel, a 55-gallon barrel. And on that barrel we put a riding rig  like bareback, bronc riders use. Then we would allow the people coming  across campus to ride that bucking barrel and we would charge them so  much to get on and maybe just for fun we would have guys on the rope  to make that barrel buck. What was real interesting is that we would  allow maybe some unlikely person to ride that barrel, ride it the full  eight seconds. And then we would catch some hero walking across  campus with a girl on his arm and we might entice him to show his  prowess at riding the bucking barrel. And then you put four guys on the  ropes and that barrel would almost switch ends. There was no way a  human being could stay on, essentially. We could usually stick his head  in the ground from the bucking barrel. It created a lot of excitement.  10  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Also during Western Week, we would have music, western music down  in the ballroom after the rodeo. And one particular year we had Hank  Thompson and the Brazos Valley Boys playing western dance music  down in the ballroom. It was that year that I became associated with an  event that happened. The clown at the rodeo had a Brahman bull that he  had trained and after the rodeo going up to that dance in the Student  Union, that bull was located in the elevator. And for some reason or  another, I was associated with that event. The bull was pretty docile. In  fact, he was probably the most docile animal in the building that night.  In case you   re ever interested or you   re going along in a big building  sometime and you find someone that   s having trouble getting their bull  on the elevator, I might give you a few pointers. The first thing you do,  to load a bull on the elevator, whether it   s a student union or any other  building, you take the lead rope with a firm grip and you get his  attention. And then you must understand that you cannot lead a bull into  a dark hole, so you don   t lead the bull into the elevator forwards. Instead  you turn him around and put him in reverse. You gently nudge on his  shoulder and you cluck to him a little bit.    Bully, bully, bully, bully.  Come on Bully. Come on Bully.    And you back him into the elevator.  You put the rear end in one corner of the elevator and you more or less  drape the body of the bull around the elevator so that there   s room for  anybody who might want to ride the elevator with the bull. And it works  pretty well. You can load a bull pretty easy if you   ll follow those  pointers.  And will an elevator go up and down with a bull in it? Can you reach  the buttons to make it move?(Laughs)  On this particular evening, the bull did not have the opportunity because  the campus police showed up.  Well that must have added another level of excitement to the experience.  Oh, it did. It very definitely did.  And did you say you had to miss the dance that night with Hank  Thompson because of that experience?  I made the last part of it.  That is quite a story. Did the clown know about what was going on with  his bull?  He was there.  11  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  He was there, alright. Well I was going to ask you about personal  leadership growth, I don   t think that qualifies. (Laughs)  Maybe we should skip that part.  And the next question is what did you do for fun and entertainment?  Does anything else come to mind about that? (Laughter)  I can tell you where the bull spent the night. (Laughter) The bull spent  the night in a barn down in the southern part of the town. And I think  one or two involved in the incident spent the night in the county jail, I   m  not sure.  Oh. It was a serious incident then.  Pretty serious incident, yes.  Well do any other incidents stand out in your memory?  Yes, ma   am. (Laughter)  Were there any that were opportunities for personal leadership growth?  Is this the way you intended for this interview to go?  No, it isn   t. You do have some storytelling skills, I must say.  I remember eating at a boarding house my second year. The boarding  house was located at the corner of Bennett Hall and Gallagher-Iba. I  believe that   s a parking lot now. I usually took one meal a day at that  boarding house. A lot of the old farm boys that were in school here, ate  there at that boarding house. I can remember while we were waiting on  the meal to be ready for that evening, a very popular event was going on  in the hula hoop. And we   d have guys with hula hoops, some running  two and three at a time standing out in the middle of the street and  waiting on the meal.  It also became a popular thing that year to toss somebody in Theta Pond.  And sooner or later it came everybody   s time to be thrown into Theta  Pond. I can remember a bunch of big ole farm boys that ate there. I went  in one evening and I just had the feeling that it was going to be my time.  There was a bay window in that boarding house and I had ridden with  my roommate. I   d ridden in his pickup down to eat that evening and he  had his pickup parked outside that bay window. And I just felt it in the  air that as soon as I got through eating that this gang was going to get  me. I finished as rapidly as I could and I made my way over to that bay  12  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  window and then I dived through it. I jumped in the pickup and I was  about to make a getaway except for the smallest man there, he stuck his  foot in the door and I couldn   t get it shut and they messed around and  got the keys out. So they tied me up with a lariat rope and a picking  string. They tossed me on the shoulders of that mob and we marched to  Theta Pond. And I can remember the gang marched through Cordell  Hall which then was a residence hall. They were a hollering and a  whooping and a crowd was gathering to see what was going on. I had  my hands tied behind my back and my feet were tied and I was on their  shoulders, they were holding me up. We went through Cordell Hall, we  turned south. We went down beside the library and then we headed  toward Theta Pond.  I remember getting to Theta Pond and I asked them, I says,    Before you  throw me in Theta Pond, would you take my billfold out of my back  pocket. I kind of hate to get everything wet.    And they obliged me. They  took my billfold out and they gave it to my roommate. My roommate  had just bought a brand new pair of boots. Oh, he was so proud of them;  got them out of El Paso. My roommate was standing there and they let  him hold my billfold. They seesawed me back and forth. They untied me  first and they threw me out into Theta Pond. But you know what, I beat  my roommate back to shore. They threw him in further than me with my  billfold, as I remember. That ended that evening. And I believe that was  the only time I was ever thrown in Theta Pond.  Well that   s the best story I   ve heard about being thrown in Theta Pond.  You mentioned hanging out in the Student Union. What about off-campus  places to hang out?  You know, I never got off campus much, I have to admit. I stayed on  campus most of the time.  What about dating, places to go, social events, things like that?  Yeah, dating was   my courting was mostly done on campus. As a  matter of fact, that   s where I met my wife, over in Murray Hall. The  halls at that time had dance hours certain nights of the week and I met  my wife there. My first and only wife. We met there and we spent a few  hours on the fourth floor of the Student Union also.  I heard something about submarine races around town. Were you  familiar with that at all?  No, not really. I heard about it.  Did you attend sporting events?  13  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Yes, I attended a few sporting events and I remember one of the biggest  events was wrestling. And I can remember if you went to a wrestling  match, you had to get there early to even get in. It was a very crowded  activity, I tell you.  Were there any particular games that you attended that stand out for  any other sports?  No, but for some reason I remember coming up one semester when I  was still at Connors College and I remember seeing my first major  college basketball game in what is now Gallagher-Iba Arena. I  remember a particular game, Oklahoma A M was playing Kansas. And  I remember seeing a long tall string-bean of a young man playing ball  for Kansas. Later on I found out that his name was Wilt Chamberlain.  Did you make it back home to Sallisaw very often while you were in  school?  I went back occasionally. I would usually carpool with some other  students that were from that area of the country. We   d carpool back and  forth.  Do you have any memories of the library?  Most of the memories I have of the library was that I would take my  books over there and set them on the table and I might leave them there  while I was gone to the Student Union fourth floor.  Were there any key events or developments at OSU that stand out in  your memory while you were here?  No, no key events. But I was impressed by the former president of this  university, Mr. Oliver S. Willham. I remember he was on campus during  those years. And I just remember how friendly he was to us no-name  students. He   d come across campus and he   d spend time in the Student  Union with us just visiting. I remember that. I think highly of it.  How was it different working for OSU than being a student at OSU as  far as the leadership or just your sense of how things were or how things  had changed?  I   m not sure that I ever gave it any thought.  What is it about Oklahoma State that sparks such loyalty in students and  alumni?  14  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  I guess the friendships. I just wouldn   t take  anything  for the  friendships that I   ve made here. Just being so close to the people. I   ve  really enjoyed my times spent here on campus.  How did attending OSU impact your life?  Well, I guess it gave me some confidence. Growing up in very, very  modest conditions in eastern Oklahoma and the fact that I could come to  school and the fact that I could make it through school, you know. At  that time, it wasn   t all that popular for students to go to college from my  part of the country. I guess the confidence I gained.  Coming from eastern Oklahoma, and there weren   t many students from  that part of the state here, was there ever any time that you experienced  or felt like people wondered about that part of the state or anything?  I don   t believe I did. We joked about it. And I talked about someone  coming out of the woods over there in eastern Oklahoma. But I never  did feel intimidated or insulted really.  My son kind of had the same experience when he came here.  Is that right?  Yeah, he did. There weren   t many people even in    98 that were coming  from our hometown. So, it   s kind of interesting. After you graduated  from OSU, you went on and got your master   s degree, can you tell me  briefly about your personal life and your career?  Well, I went into the extension service. I started out as Assistant County  Agent in Columbus, Kansas. I went back to school for a graduate degree  at Kansas State and then I became the state pecan specialist for the  Extension Service of Georgia. Georgia is the number one producing  pecan state in the nation. From Georgia I came to Texas, same position.  And then I had the opportunity to come back home to Stillwater. I did  some rodeoing during those times.  What was your event?  I usually hauled two horses to contests. I   d usually haul a steer wrestling  horse and a tie down calf-roping horse. I remember particularly when we  were in Georgia, that rodeo was becoming rather popular down there  and in Florida. I was surprised when I got into Florida and make rodeos  down in that area that Florida is also a big cow state. We think of it as a  tourist place but down in those meadows there   s a lot of cattle raised in  there. And then later on as I came back to Oklahoma State, I spent a lot  15  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  of time playing the senior softball circuit, which I do to this day.  What is your position?  I usually play the hot corners. I play third and first. We have a great time  playing senior softball. I just got back from Georgia a few weeks ago.  We played in a national tournament out there. We usually play across  the retirement belt. Arizona, get into California, south Texas and into  Florida playing senior softball tournaments. Senior softball tournaments  start usually at age 50 and then you graduate every five years into  another age bracket. Today I   m playing in a 70-75 age bracket. Having a  good time. Senior softballers are a lot like little leaguers. We get all  excited just like little leaguers do. And the sounds that come out of the  stands when you are playing tournaments are a little different. When I  was growing up my daughter might holler for daddy and my wife might  holler for me. But today the sounds that come out of the stands are,     Come on, Papaw  Come on, Papaw     It   s a lot of fun.  Is your team comprised of people from this area of Oklahoma?  Yes. I play on the team   in fact I helped organize it in    93 and we  selected players across the state of Oklahoma. We might recruit across  the border occasionally, one or two out of Arkansas according to the  particular year.  So you are our ambassadors for Oklahoma for senior softball then.  Yes. And when we get to tournaments they all know all of us as Okies,  particularly in California and Arizona.  Does your team have a name?  No, we were just simply the Oklahoma Seniors. And then as we  graduated, we started out   we might be the Oklahoma Senior 60s. Then  we became the Oklahoma Senior 65s.  I bet that   s a lot of fun. How did you get your nickname, Cat?  You know, that   s a name that was given to me back in those college  days. I tried to outrun it. And I thought I had. I acquired it at Connors  and I retained it here at Stillwater and then when I worked in Georgia  and Texas, I thought I had outrun it, until I came back home. And then  everybody I saw, they didn   t know who Glenn was, it was Cat.  That   s pretty good. How have you remained connected to OSU?  16  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Well I guess one of the ways I   ve stayed connected is I work out at the  Colvin Center two or three times a week.  That   s a pretty good connection. (Laughs)  But I   m a member of the Alumni Association, both OSU and  Agriculture.  What advice would you give to OSU students today?  I   m not sure that I have any particular advice that   s different from what  their mother or daddy might tell them.  What would you tell high school students who might be thinking about  coming to OSU?  Well I   m partial. I just think it   s an enjoyable homey atmosphere here on  campus.   Can you tell  me a little about your family, your heritage from eastern  Oklahoma?  Yes, I was born and raised in eastern Oklahoma. I   m of Cherokee  descent. My great-grandmother, as a little full-blood Cherokee Indian  girl twelve years of age in 1837 and 1838, walked the Trail of Tears as it  became known because so many of our Cherokee ancestors did not  survive the trail. She walked from southeast Tennessee to what is now  eastern Oklahoma. It was Indian Territory back then. My great-grandmother   s  name was Lizzy Groundhog. She came to be left at a  camp east of Stilwell, Oklahoma, right on the Arkansas line. She  married a white man named Joe Taylor who also came west with the  Cherokees. And from that union my grandpa John Taylor was born.  Lizzy Groundhog died at a young age when Grandpa John Taylor was  just a young lad and he was raised by an Indian named Caleb Starr.  Caleb Starr would have been related to Belle Starr   s husband. The  Starr   s were known as outlaws in eastern Oklahoma. A lot of the outlaws  would gather at Caleb Starr   s house where my grandpa John was being  raised. He tells a story that when the outlaws came they would come  maybe hide out or come by the house and spend the night, that Caleb  would remind them,    You all leave John alone now. I   m going to raise  him straight.     Grandpa John grew up running some cattle in those hills in eastern  Oklahoma. He married a young lady that bore him six children. She died  in childbirth with the sixth child. He remarried and married a woman  17  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  that bore him twelve children. So Grandpa John had eighteen children  by the two wives. Fourteen of them reached adulthood. My dad was of  the last twelve. So we appreciate our Cherokee heritage. I   ve spent some  time in southeast Tennessee and north Georgia trying to trace some of  my ancestral footsteps and it   s been most interesting.  Was it a part of your life growing up as far as participation in the   Cherokee  traditions?  Yes. As I said, we grew up under very modest conditions. We had very  few modern things. We did not have an automobile in our family. Dad  raised us by farming with teams of horses. We had no electricity, no  running water. We had a path and an outhouse. No telephone. And each  year, twice a year there would be what we call the Cherokee Stomp  Dance. And I can remember the last time we went to the Stomp Dance.  We went up into the hills in what was customary where the Cherokees  might dance all night around the fire. Those are some memories I have  of growing up around Cherokee influence in eastern Oklahoma.  And your family stories were passed down?  Yes, they were passed down.  Are they written?  Not enough. My older brother who passed away this spring was our  family historian. And unfortunately, we don   t have enough written  down.  What was it that influenced you to pursue higher education coming from  the sparse background that you did?  I   d have to give some credit to 4-H club. I went to school in a little two-room  grade school up in the woods between Sallisaw and Vian. We had  a coal stove in each little room. We had a very good 4-H club there. We  had a man and wife teacher those last years I spent there. They drilled us  very well in 4-H club and in public speaking. And they instilled a lot of  pride in us. We had a very, very successful 4-H club. And then I got to  make long trips working through 4-H club and as I said before, came to  Stillwater campus for 4-H club Roundup. Gave presentations.  Was Roundup an event that you had to earn to be able to come here?  At that time, you did. You had to win some event in the county, whether  it was a timely topic or demonstration or schoolwear or some event, you  more or less earned it.  18  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  Taylor  Neurohr  So your area was public speaking?  And I came and gave some presentations.  Did other young people who were in your 4-H group who had the same  teachers, are they like you in what they   ve done with their lives in that  way?  As a matter of fact they are. You know, when I got away from Sallisaw I  tried to spread on the dog a little bit, you know. I might tell somebody  that I was salutatorian of my eighth grade graduating class. And if my  wife   s around, she likes to play the part of the late Paul Harvey. She  likes to tell    the rest of the story    that he was so famous for. She has to  remind whoever I   m talking to,    Yes, he was salutatorian. There were  three in the class and the two girls tied for valedictorian.    But those two  girls went on to have very successful careers in education themselves  and I   m very proud of them.  Did you receive scholarships to start out at Connors?  No, I did not. I happened to have some wonderful siblings that helped  me. They were all older than me and they helped me. I can remember  the tuition at Connors when I started. It was  38, take all that you can  stand. I got a job working on the farm. They gave me a place to sleep out  there at the farm the first year. I did chores out on that college farm and  paid for my room and board.  Did you work when you were going to school there?  The only work I did here was taking care of those chinchillas.  Do you have anything else about your family heritage that you would  like to include?  No, I guess that pretty well sums it up.  Well, thank you very much for participating in the interview. We  appreciate hearing your stories and we   re glad that you   re a part of our  project. I also want to wish you a wonderful happy Homecoming  weekend and anniversary weekend. I think they have some special events  planned for you all.  Thank you. I   ve enjoyed it very much also.  Good. Thank you.  -------  -------  19
