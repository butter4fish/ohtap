 Milligan with the Oklahoma State University Library, with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. I   m interviewing Callie  Connolly. We   re in Muskogee. We are in the building for the Northeastern  State University campus in Muskogee, and today   s date is June 26, 2015.  This is an interview for the Cowboy in Every County project, and we are  going to be talking with Callie a little bit today, just about her time at OSU,  her life since, and all the adventures she   s gotten into before, during, and  after her time there. (Laughs) Just tell me a little bit about yourself. Start  wherever you want. Tell me about you and your family and whatever you  feel comfortable.  Connolly Well, I am one of three kids. I   m the youngest. I was the belated baby when  my mother thought she couldn   t have any children anymore, and then, all of  a sudden, in her forties, here I came. I am sixteen years apart from my  nearest sibling, so that   s been interesting. I tell everybody I   m the oldest,  youngest, and middle child, and they all look at me like I   m crazy. I say,     Well, I   m the oldest out of all of my siblings    children, the youngest out of  my actual siblings, and in-between the two.    (Laughter)  Milligan I think there   s probably a lot of truth to that. I   m not sure where you fall on  the child graph, though, you know? Personality   .  Connolly Yeah, it   s   I don   t know. I   m somewhere. (Laughter)  Milligan Where did you grow up, and where   s your family from?  Connolly I went to elementary school in Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, and then, my  grandma   s health started deteriorating a little bit. My parents moved onto a  piece of her property, which is actually our original Indian land allotment  from Trail of Tears to today, that we still live on, so that they could take care  of her. Now, she   s ninety-six, and she   s still got more energy than I do some  days. We have a lot of fun.  5  I graduated from Porum High School. Then, I continued on to OSU-Okmulgee  and had an awesome time there, received my associate   s in  business management. Then, I continued to OSU-Stillwater, and from  Stillwater, I went to OSU-Tulsa. I kind of just ran the OSU circuit. (Laughs)  Milligan You tried three out of the four campuses, main campuses. (Laughs) Tell me  when   well, let   s back up a little bit, actually. Let   s go back to the land  allotment because I think that   s really interesting. Maybe talk a little bit  about what you know of that history. How big is the allotment? When did  your family first come over? Anything you know about that.  Connolly There are actually two separate Indian land allotments, and they are on two  different sections. They   re less than a mile apart. One was given to my  great-grandmother, and one belonged to my great-great-grandmother. Had to  think about that for a second. Anyway, they   re both eighty-acre parcels, so  there   s, you know, it   s a hundred and sixty acres in between. My family, for  ages and ages, until my grandmother got into retirement age, had always  farmed cotton and soy and lots of things on that. It   s always been something  that the family returned to to keep sustenance and to also kind of keep their  culture alive. If we didn   t have such strong ties on both sides of my family  to our Cherokee heritage, I think I would be a very different person. My  father   s family   my great-great-grandmother was actually Sally Manning  Ross, which is Chief John Ross    daughter-in-law.  One of my first interesting cooking experiences was my mom pulling down  this really, really old cookbook. I started flipping through it, and the pages  were starting to fall out. They had gotten yellowed. All these women,  throughout the years, had written things into this cookbook, and there was  actually a little note that Sally had put in the cookbook. On one side, it was  her cornbread recipe, and on the other side, it was the Cherokee legend of  the corn. It was just kind of neat how she did that. Other people kind of  caught on to that, and they would add a little story next to their recipe  through the years. Just little things like that in the family has been  interesting for my perspective and my personal growth, I think, over time.  Milligan That   s an amazing thing to find  Was it a home-written cookbook, or was it  a mixture between a commercial cookbook and a   .  Connolly It had been rebound. I don   t know what the original binding had looked like,  but really, it looks almost like a three-ring binder, only a really, really, really  old three-ring binder. They had covered it with leather, so I don   t what the  original inside of that looks like. It   s very interesting.  Milligan Besides the cornbread, what were some of the ones that you were drawn to,  the recipes in there you were drawn to?  6  Connolly Well, one of my favorites has always been   my grandmother makes  blackberry dumplings, which are the most wonderful things ever, and then,  we would make homemade ice cream and serve it with them. It looks like,  you know, you think a chicken and dumpling kind of thing, only it   s with  blackberries, and it   s creamy. The dumplings are like cobbler pieces, and oh  my gosh, one of my favorite meals ever. (Laughter)  Milligan I think I just drooled a little bit. (Laughs) That sounds really good. I   ve  never had a blackberry dumpling.  Connolly She put in there a story of the reason why we never mowed or brush hogged  a certain part of the pasture. It   s because there is a trail of berries or different  types of berry bushes that we always kept. As kids, everybody went out  there and picked berries forever, and we would come home purple. We  would have so much because we wanted those dumplings so bad. (Laughs)  Milligan Nice. Covered in chiggers and all, I   m sure.  Connolly Oh yes.  Milligan (Laughs) Is that one that you make often, or is there one that you like to  make yourself, in that cookbook?  Connolly There have been different things that I   ve thought of adding, but I still  haven   t found the one perfect recipe that I want to put in there. There   s not a  whole lot of space left in there because there   s probably twenty or thirty  women who have written in it over time. I   m like,    Hmm. What   s next?     (Laughs)  Milligan Exactly. I   m glad you   re going to add to it, though. It sounds like it   s really  important, but holy cow, that   s amazing. You   ll have to let us know when  you decide what the recipe is. We   ll have to add it into the file for this  interview because I   m sure people listening to this are going to want to  know at some point, or at least I do. (Laughs)  Connolly It   s really interesting. When I was fourteen years old, I competed for a  Native American Women in Agriculture to be the national representative for  them. I wrote an essay, and the title, you know, they gave you a title for your  essay. Then, you were just supposed to write the essay. It was    Native  American Women in Agriculture: Past, Present, and Future   . I thought,     Well, how do I do this?    Because I had recently just learned about the  cookbook and had been going over it, I actually wrote the story of the corn  in there, and I wrote some of the things that women had put in over the  years.  7  I got toward the very end. I thought about it for a really long time.    How do  I wrap this up about all these different women in my family and all the  things that we   ve learned over the years?    I just put,    I   m thankful for the  gentle, steadfast, feminine gene pool I come from. It   s truly American,     because I couldn   t come up with words to describe so many different  people, and some of them, I   ve never even met before. It was kind of tricky  but fun. I won.  After that, I actually got to spend   I won the competition multiple times,  and I actually got to spend the next seven years as the national  representative for Native American Women in Agriculture. It was neat to  travel to different tribal events and speak to women and learn about their  concerns for their tribes. I actually got to meet women from over thirty  different tribes, and I   m still friends with a lot of them to this day. It   s been  really interesting to see how people have grown and changed, since you   re a  young teenager to today, and how different things have happened  throughout the different states.  Milligan How old were you when you became the representative for that?  Connolly Fourteen.  Milligan Oh, so it was when you were fourteen when you won that.  Connolly From the time I was fourteen until I was twenty-one.  Milligan That   s amazing. Where all did you go?  Connolly The first one, I got to go to Hollywood, Florida, and that was super fun. I  learned several things on them, one of which was to always read the signs  on the beach before you go. I kept seeing things on the beach, but I didn   t  know what they were. I was just with my mother, and it was just the two of  us. I had went out, and we were swimming in the ocean because I had never  swam in the ocean. I looked back, and I was like,    What are those things on  the beach?    Finally, we went to get out of the water, and we realized they  were jellyfish. There was a sign that said,    Caution: British  Portuguese   Man o' War. No swimming.    We were like,    Oh  Oh my goodness. That   s  not very good.    (Laughs)  Milligan I can   t believe you didn   t get stung.  Connolly I was just like,    Thank you, God. I promise I   ll read next time.    (Laughs)  Milligan Lesson learned. Hollywood, Florida. What did you think about that at  fourteen, being appointed to be the national Native American Women in  8  Agriculture spokesperson or representative? What was your job? What were  your thoughts about it, and what was your actual job to do?  Connolly Part of it was just learning the different issues that women were lobbying for  throughout the different states, things that were really affecting women in  their different types of employ. A lot of treating tribal rights issues were  brought up, but one of the things that just amazed me was (I know this  sounds terrible) learning to get out of my comfort zone and get out of the  box. That meant I had to give speeches. That meant I had to go and present  myself in a professional manner to other people I had never met before. It  also meant that when I walked into the Navajo Nation and I smiled and  shook everybody   s hand and they looked at me,    You   re the  representative?     My opening line eventually became    Hi, my name   s Callie Minnie. I   m red-headed  and freckled-faced, but I am your national representative. Let me tell  you why.    Then, I would talk to them a little bit. It was never an issue, but I  thought, in my perceptions, I thought,    Oh, maybe that will be a big issue.     It never was a problem just because everybody was united in so many  common goals, and everyone wants the best for their family and their  children and their state and their country. Facing those issues and trying to  come up with ways around different challenges united everybody in a  common goal. It was really neat.  Milligan What were some of those issues? Do you remember some that stuck out to  you?  Connolly We had a lot of water rights issues. Some places, you know, California,  Arizona, places where there   s a lot of drought, you   re not allowed to catch  rainwater in a lot of states. There are restrictions on using certain cultural  things. Here, in the state of Oklahoma, if you want eagle feathers and you   re  going to use these in a tribal way, you have to contact somebody. The  feathers are sent to you from an observatory. There are a lot of little details  that people don   t think about. One of the things that I, just blew my mind  was women who had to learn so many new technologies to cope with the  sheer amount that people are expected to produce in today   s agricultural  market. There   s not a lot of opportunity for them to keep small farming  operations going in traditional ways unless they start incorporating some  technologies. Then it became    Well, how do we get grants? How do we get  funding to get these technologies to these women so that they can expand  their operation and continue with sustaining the family   s livelihood?    That  was a lot of the challenges.  Some of it was just   there are a lot of issues with trees, and you had to work  with the government to figure out where a boundary of a property actually  ended. On one document, it would be completely different than another  9  document. It was very interesting to see what came of those situations. It  was really nice to see how much people grew in their thinking on all sides as  they dealt with issues that they had never even thought of before. There  were issues that, not even on the tribal side, on the government side, that I  didn   t realize some of the things the government had to go through to be  able to help people and some of their officials. It was really interesting.  Milligan That is really complicated, too, it sounds like. I   m trying to imagine you as a  mid- to late teenager being confronted and having a lot of these situations  described. What was your role, or what was your capacity to try and affect  change or find solutions? What were the expectations?  Connolly Mostly what I did is I came in and presented myself as a sounding board.  Sometimes, it   s neat to just have someone who has had no experience with a  particular situation come in and give an outside perspective, and sometimes,  it helps people find common ground if there   s a lot of frustrations or feuding  in a situation. A lot of the things that I did was really just to promote  leadership in communities, to go and give speeches, and then also give  people resources of, you know,    This is where you can go to find help  building your resume    and    This is what you could possibly do to plug a  gap. I know that you   ve been farming this entire time, and you want to also  show that you   ve got another job    or    You   ve done this    or    You   ve done  that   .  It was neat, especially people who have lived on reservations (they have a  very different set of things) or a tribal town, depending on whether or not  they are interacting a lot with the environment outside of that, how they  have to transfer to different cultures, the way that they word things even,  sometimes. Something as simple as not making eye contact when you go to  college as a student would blow somebody   s mind. A professor might be  aggravated or think a student   s not paying attention or someone   s not really  giving them respect, but culturally, a lot of Native Americans not making  eye contact is actually a form of respect. That means that they are listening  to you and they   re being very attentive. There are a lot of neat things that I  stumbled upon that I had never even imagined, because every culture was so  vastly different.  Milligan I   m still just thinking about being a teenager and absorbing all of that. It  sounds like you did a really good job. Obviously, you took away from a lot  of it, so you were being a good representative and thoughtful. Were there  anything that, from those experiences, that you came across that you felt like  you were able to help find a resolution for?  Connolly Yeah, there were several different things. Also, there are a lot of tribal  resources that people may not utilize or even know exist. There are  wonderful land grant opportunities. There are wonderful things that you can  10  do that I just had no idea were out there. My biggest deal in what I do now is  I publish a monthly newsletter of all the scholarships that are coming up in  the next two months. I try to get as many of those together as possible, not  just for my Native American students but for everyone, because people seem  to not realize the resources that they have available to them.  When I was in high school, my mom had said over and over again,    I know  you want to go to college. I want you to be able to go to college, but I don   t  have the ability to send you there.    When I was seven years old, my father  had a stroke, so he was unable to work. Eventually, because he was such a  large man, we were unable to transfer him. He had to spend most of his time  in the nursing home. Then, we would come and pick him up and go places  and stuff. In the evening, because of his medical issues, he had to have  nursing care around the clock.  That was interesting, but that also made my mother have a lot of single mom  challenges. I knew I had to figure out some way to get scholarships. I wound  up just going from associate   s to bachelor   s, and completing that part, I  wound up with over sixty thousand dollars in scholarships and grants. I was  so blessed with that. I just had to learn if you look hard enough, you can find  something for anything. I think one of my first and silliest things that I ever  got, I got a two hundred and fifty-dollar savings bond because I went to the  Arkansas-Oklahoma State Fair and blew the biggest bubble at the Hubba-  Bubba booth. (Laughter) There   s some silly things out there, but believe it  or not, whatever interest you have, there   s usually a scholarship for it.  (Laughs)  Milligan Did you go to the Arkansas-Oklahoma State Fair thinking,    I   m going to  blow the biggest bubble at the Hubba-Bubba booth   ?  Connolly No, I went there thinking,    I   m going to get out of class today.    (Laughter)  Then, I stumbled on that, and then, it got me thinking,    Huh, I wonder what  other kinds of weird things are out there?    I got to find lots of interesting  things.  Milligan That   s what I was going to ask, if there was someone that helped direct you  towards those resources or if you felt like you were doing all that by  yourself.  Connolly My school was in transition, so our counselor was new at our high school. I  did not have a lot of people to pull on for resources, so I just made friends  with Google. That   s how, I think, I eventually wound up with librarians  because I got to be awesome at search engines. (Laughs) I started keeping a  list because I realized how many other people around me were having  serious issues, and friends, when I was going to college, with financing their  education. I thought,    If I can keep all this information, if I can get it to  11  people as much as possible, it would be awesome.    Something as simple as  the Make Me Laugh Scholarship where you come up with a joke and you  video it and send it in, you could get two thousand dollars for that. There   s  some interesting things out there.  Milligan Yeah, that is really interesting. Were you keeping that list and starting a  distribution list when you were starting your associate   s degree then?  Connolly I would normally just send stuff around to my friends if they had asked  about it. Then, it grew, and I   m so glad that Oklahoma State lets you keep  your login, your email for life, because that   s allowed me to keep in touch  with so many people that I probably would have lost their email addresses  over time. I still have people that I haven   t seen in three or four years  contact me and say,    Hey, my daughter   s getting ready to go to school    or     Hey, my sister is switching from this campus to this campus, and suddenly,  the financial aid   s run dry. Do you know what   s coming up?     Once I actually started working for Connors State College, I kind of took  over an organization that had been kind of dead on campus for about twenty  years. Some people say thirty years. I don   t know for sure. I still haven   t got  the solid number on that. It was the Native American Student Association,  and that was something that I had participated in when I was at OSU. I  thought,    This is a very, very important thing, since we have, 40 percent of  our students are Native American at Connors.    I talked to some people, and  we worked on that. We got that revived on campus. The students that  participated in that, that self-identified as Native American, I made sure I  got as many Native American scholarship opportunities to them as possible.  Eventually, I wound up doing a financial aid workshop and partnering with  the financial aid department at the college. We had people come in from  area high schools, just anyone who   s willing to learn a little bit. We walked  them through the FAFSA and some tips and tricks on that. I gave them  handouts on how to make essay writing as easy as possible. Then, I also  gave them a lot of handouts to scholarship search engines, and then, I asked  them when they came in,    Would you fill out this card with what major you  plan on going for?     Then, after the workshops were over, I would go back and look up  information in my ginormous Access document that I   ve created of  scholarships, and I would look up everything for those students who had  said they had certain majors in mind. If it was nursing, I would look up  everything that I had about nursing, and I would email it to that student. It  kind of gave people resources. I don   t feel like we have a lot of time and  energy put into that, at least in my small area. I really try to make sure that  our students, that are coming in from the high schools and other areas have  as much available to them as possible, when I can.  12  Milligan I   m really impressed that you have an Access database with all this  information in it. (Laughter) I just think that is amazing. It sounds like it   s  par for the course for your personality, having, in your teenage years, taken  on this role as   you called it a sounding board, but it sounds, it   s also that  information connector, right? You were taking information you learned from  all your travel, and when you found a problem, trying to connect that person  with that other information. It sounds like that   s something that you   re  really committed to doing. I wonder a little bit about your   I   m trying to  decide where to start with OSU, because I think now   s a good time to sort of  back up to that. Maybe let   s go all the way back to your associate   s degree  at OSU-Okmulgee, right? What made you choose OSU-Okmulgee? What did  you do while you were there? All that good stuff.  Connolly At that time, I had originally planned to go straight to Stillwater, but at that  time, my father was in bad health and I wanted to be closer to home. He did  wind up passing away my freshman year, so I wanted to be closer to home.  It wound up being one of the best choices, I think, I ever made. I stayed on  campus. Believe it or not, they have an amazing population of international  students there on that campus, and there were such a diverse set of people in  the dorms that we had so much fun. I mean, from silly things to Saturday  nights sitting out in the foyer and playing poker, and we were playing poker  with our card money, you know, because you   re putting money on a lunch  card or whatever. Whoever lost that day, the worse, had to buy pizza for us  the next go round. You know, that was the way that we did things, and we  had a lot of fun.  From the great activities that were on campus to the awesome professors  that we had there, I was so impressed. So many people had come in from  working in the field, you know, whatever field that they were teaching. I had  an accountant teacher who worked at a big eight accounting firm for ages  and ages, and now that he had retired from that, he was teaching at OSU.  Originally, I could not even imagine taking his class. I knew I had to for my  major, but everyone was completely terrified of him. It wasn   t because he  was mean or gruff or anything like that. It was because his class was really,  really hard, but because he had all that experience behind him, he was able  to give people very real life scenarios. He would give us real companies     books, and you would do everything by hand on how to, you know,    What   s  the ROI  return on investment  on this investment?    It would be very  detailed.  Not everybody usually passed Accounting I to get into Accounting II, but by  the time you left Accounting II and you made it to any other classes or into  life, it was the easiest thing ever. By the time you could use Excel and  different spreadsheets, you were like,    I   ve got this  No problem     (Laughs)  There   s a lot of great professors and a lot of people who are really dedicated  13  to what they were doing and really, actually were invested in the students  there. Really, that was the story across all of OSU campuses, and I think  that   s what really made me a    Poke    for life. When my child eventually  comes into this world, I will try to indoctrinate them to be an OSU graduate  one day. (Laughter)  Milligan They   re in the family now, anyway. They don   t have a choice. They have to  have lots of orange. Your baby, I   m sure, will have plenty of orange.  Connolly Oh yes. (Laughter) I   m over four months pregnant, and I   ve already had  people buy me OSU baby stuff. It happens. (Laughs)  Milligan It   s a good thing. It   s a good thing. Why did you choose OSU then? You  were looking at this from a, you were sort of actively funding this yourself,  through scholarships and grants that you were accumulating. In theory, you  could   ve chosen anywhere you wanted to go, so what was the draw to OSU?  Connolly I did a couple of interesting things. OU, at the time that I was a ninth grader,  they were still doing a camp that was on Lake Texoma, which is actually  where I met my husband. I   m a little dork like that. I met him at a science  camp. He was there because he had to be. I was there because I wanted to  be, you know, that kind of thing, but I had a lot of fun and I met a lot of  wonderful and interesting people there.  I also began going to different events with FFA  Future Farmers of  America  when I was in high school. As an aggie, FFA is very, very  intricately intertwined with OSU. I made so many connections and had so  many friends that were just amazing people going to OSU that I thought,     I   ve got to go up there and be with these people.    I had been to so many  different OSU camps and summer camps and things throughout high school  and junior high that I thought,    This is just the place for me. This is where it  fits.    I had thought about going to other colleges in other states, but that just  seemed the right thing to do. It just was comfortable.  Milligan Let me think how to phrase this as well. What was your interest in FFA?  Connolly Well, originally, I had taken too many classes. I started doing concurrent  enrollment when I was a sophomore, and I had taken too many classes. I  could   ve graduated early, and so, I needed to take more things to fill my  day. I had talked to a teacher. The FFA teacher is the person who actually  had me originally do the essay for the Native American Women in  Agriculture and all that. He said,    Well, come on in here. I know that you  did an area speech for our VFW  Veterans of Foreign Wars  last month.  Why don   t you come in and try to do speech? We don   t have very many  people who compete in speaking here.    I went in, and I started doing public  speaking.  14  Eventually, I wound up doing a little bit of everything. I was horticulture,  floriculture. I was showing. I was judging. I was in everything, and I was an  officer. My junior and senior year, because I had taken so many classes, half  of my day was spent, both junior year and senior year, as the aid for the Ag  teacher. (Laughs) I had, you know, my freshman and my eighth grade and  sophomore boys that I loved to death, but oh my goodness, I thought,    Oh,  it   s like being with my nephews all the time.    I had a lot of fun. Learned a  lot of things about eighth grade boys I didn   t want to know. (Laughter)  Milligan I   m sure it didn   t take very long, either. (Laughs) You ended up, that was  more your senior year and how you spent the last year?  Connolly Yeah, my junior and senior year.  Milligan Did you show anything during that time?  Connolly Yes, I showed lambs and learned a lot. Oh my goodness, I thought I  could   ve been a hair stylist by the time I learned all the different ways to  shear a sheep. (Laughs) By the end of that, I thought,    I   ve got this. I can do  this     (Laughs)  Milligan You never know when that talent   s going to come in handy.  Connolly Yeah, you never know.  Milligan (Laughs) Did you ever win anything?  Connolly Yes and no. On the showing the sheep, I got a couple showmanship awards,  but my sheep, when I finally got to the regional competition   I did okay in  the district competition. Got to the regional competition my senior year and  got sifted. It was like,    Oh shucks   , but at that point, you know, I didn   t  really care. I was in love with my animal, and it was just almost a pet at that  point. My nieces and nephews who were five, six, seven, some of them, they  walked it around with its little harness like it was a dog or whatever. They  would give it treats, and it would follow them around. It was just, somehow  became a pet more than a show animal at that point.  Milligan I like it. I   m sure that   s how I would do, too. Just curious, (laughs) just  trying to picture that FFA Callie and what animal was next to you so that   s  helpful and that makes sense.  Connolly In 110-degree weather, I can do anything in high heels and black hosiery  after FFA. (Laughter) I learned a lot, and that was one of the strange things.  I also learned to carry a sewing kit at all times because no matter what  happened, someone always lost a button or had a problem or this or that or  15  the other. Eventually, everybody started calling me    Mom   , so much so that  I dreaded it a little bit. Finally, one of the students from a Newcastle FFA  chapter said,    Okay. Whatever is in your purse    (because I carried a huge  purse)    Whatever   s in your purse, I   ve got it this time. You can   t beat me.     I   m like,    I can   t beat you on what?    He said,    I bet you can   t pull a rabbit  out of there.    I fished around, and I found a little rabbit earring. (Laughs) I  was just the survival bag purse lady the whole time.  Milligan I love it. I think that   s probably extended to, as a metaphor, has extended  onto you in your career, as well, I think. I like it. You went to OSU-Okmulgee  for two years and got your associate in business, correct?  Connolly Yes, ma   am.  Milligan Then, you decided to go onto the Stillwater campus. Talk me through that a  little bit.  Connolly Well, when I went onto the Stillwater campus, originally I was going in for  Ag business. Somehow or another, I kept winding up taking marketing  classes, and I took a lot of economics classes. Finally, my advisor said,    Are  you sure that Ag business is what you want to do? I know that you already  have an associate   s in business.    I said,    Well, yeah.    He said,    Well, look  at all the classes that you   re choosing. In your opportunities, you could   ve  chosen this or this or this or this or this. All the time, you are always  choosing marketing.    I said,    Well, those are my favorite classes.    He said,     Well, what do you think about changing your major to a marketing major?  It   s everything that you have been interested in.    I talked to him for a little  while, and I went and talked to someone from the Spears School of  Business. At that time, I was in the Ag College. I wound up making the  switch, but not before he got to put me into one last class.  Oh my goodness, I   ve told a hundred people and then some about his last  class. Aboriginal Studies was the name of the class. That was a weekend  class, and so I thought it was going to be kind of a history type class. I  thought,    Oh, I just need one more hour to be fulltime for my financial aid.     We decided to do this class on the weekend. It was brand new to OSU, and  it was the first time that it had been taught. He enrolled me in it. I loved him  and hated him and teased him for it forever after that. I showed up at the  classroom building that I was supposed to be at in a pair of heels because I  thought,    At lunch, I   ll go meet with somebody else.    I was trying to get an  internship and have an interview that day and all this other stuff. I show up,  Aboriginal Studies. I didn   t understand why you had to pay an extra fifty  dollars for an unknown object. It was for a knife. You got a knife, and then,  they took us out to the OSU camp, you know, where you can swing down  the stuff on the bungee cord and all this other stuff. It was a survival class,  so there went the heels. It was lots of fun.  16  Milligan You were in a dress?  Connolly Yes, I had on a skirt and heels, and I went out there. I was like,    I   m going  to kill this advisor. I can   t believe he did this to me. I   m going to have to  give him a hard time, at least.    I got out there, and it was two days of being  out at the camp and learning how to find clean water and learning how to  start a fire and learning how to build your own shelter and all these things. It  was a wonderful and awesome class. I was so glad that I had taken it, but on  the flipside of that, I thought,    I wish I was warned   . (Laughter) Of course, I  came back and gave him a hard time. He was like,    Well, you   re the only  one who has ever taken that that I   ve had before, and I didn   t know. I   m so  sorry.     Milligan What did the person in charge of that class, did they act strangely to you  when you showed up in interview clothes?  Connolly Well, he could have cocked his head and crossed his arms. I wasn   t the only  one who had no clue what was going on, you know. There were three or  four other people that they were in flip-flops, or they were just in a tank top  and shorts and flimsy flip-flops or whatever. They weren   t really prepared or  dressed for that particular event, but we had fun. Hey, and at least I still had  my survival kit with my purse so I still had my wonderful little handy-dandy  sewing kit that I pulled out. I actually turned my skirt into kind of shorts, a  skort or something like that, when I was out there because I could not move  or run or do anything. (Laughs)  Milligan Of course you did. (Laughter)  Connolly It was fun.  Milligan Oh my gosh. Oh, I can totally see this  That   s the thing. I   ve known you for  no time at all, and I can picture you doing this.  Connolly The teacher thought that was one of the most hilarious things that he had  seen. (Laughs)  Milligan Do you remember who taught that class?  Connolly Oh, I can   t remember.  Milligan It   s totally okay. I   m just curious.  Connolly He was awesome.  Milligan Do you remember who your advisor was?  17  Connolly Yeah, but now, I told a story on him. (Laughs) I better not name his name   He might get onto me   Milligan I suspect he doesn   t mind that story. That story is just fine. (Laughs)  Connolly It was awesome.  Milligan Did you get the internship you applied for during your lunch break?  Connolly No, because there was not a lunch break. It was a continued thing. I had to  actually call someone, and they made us leave our cellphones at this little  stop at the beginning. I had to call someone and get ahold of them and say,     I cannot believe what has just happened.    Thankfully, it was someone who  was very understanding. I eventually got the internship. I just had to apply  for it and come and interview two weeks later after that.  Milligan That   s good that it worked out that way  (Laughs)  Connolly It was interesting.  Milligan That was your last as an Ag business major?  Connolly Yeah, that was my last class.  Milligan (Laughs) That   s the way to go out. Then, you moved to what?  Connolly I moved from the Ag College to the Spears School of Business there at  Stillwater and started working on my marketing degree. Then, I found out in  a little bit later after the next semester that I had got the internship, and it  was actually almost, it   s a building that   s right beside the Hard Rock Hotel  and Casino in Tulsa. It was working for Cherokee Nation Businesses as a  PR intern. I moved to Tulsa, at that time, and started working down there  and switched over to OSU-Tulsa. The semester right there before I left, I  also had another amazing class. There is a lady. I will never, ever forget her  face, but I cannot remember her name. I   m horrible with names. That   s why  I always have all these lists and things, so that I can go back and find out.  (Laughs)  Milligan You see my pile of notes here, yes.  Connolly Anyway, she taught a sociology class, and the sociology class was amazing.  For whatever reason, we wound up with a really, really diverse group of  people in there, and the whole class was about pushing boundaries. People  were able to ask questions of other people from other cultures or other  ethnicities without any repercussions, and we were able to get into some  18  very in-depth discussions. It was the earliest class ever. Who offers a seven-thirty  class? It was a two-day-a-week, but it was at seven-thirty in the  morning. It was horrible for being at seven-thirty, and then, it became one of  my favorite classes that I will never forget. The group of students became so  close in that class, because we were in such detailed and in-depth  discussions that I   m still friends with some of those people to this day. We  were so connected in so many personal opinions and things that we actually  got to be friends. It was really an interesting and controversial class at the  same time. Sometimes, she   d have you take a, you know, if your opinion on  one subject was one thing, your job was to represent the other side. She did  all kinds of fun things. I loved it.  Milligan This leads me to want to explore something, so bear with me. You mentioned  when you were the Women   s Ag representative that when you would go to  different tribes, the first thing that you could tell by their first reaction to  you was that you weren   t what they expected visually, right?  Connolly Yes.  Milligan I wonder if in your sociology, probably sociology of race or sociology of,  whatever the class was titled, I wonder if that experience, your personal  experience with that, took on a new dimension or was representative in that  class at all.  Connolly I was actually the only Native American student in that class. First of all,  you can never ask any Native American to be representative of all tribes  because there   s over five hundred federally recognized tribes and countless  others that are not currently recognized. I can   t represent the thousands of  cultures across a huge continent, but I could relate what my personal  experiences were. That was kind of an eye-opener for some people because  people often thought that someone in California or Texas or New York that  were Native American would have the exact same perspective as me. I   m  like, no, because everybody   s got their own life experiences and culture that  they bring with them. It was really interesting to hear what people   s  perceptions were and to also realize that some of my perceptions about other  people were completely wrong, completely off. It was a lot of fun.  Milligan Sounds like a beneficial class. How big was it?  Connolly I cannot believe how big it wound up. I want to say it was seventeen or  eighteen. I know that was small, but that seemed huge to me for a seven-thirty  in the morning class. Most of them (I   ll be honest) were basketball  players. I don   t know if their coach got mad at them or their advisor did or  something, but somehow, they wound up in the seven-thirty in the morning  class. (Laughs) It was a bunch of basketball players and then a few other  people who happened to take the class. It was fun.  19  Milligan Interesting. Do you remember some of the examples of some of the people  that came in as guests that you were allowed to ask questions to?  Connolly We actually didn   t have any guests come in. There was enough   let   s just  say most of the races were covered, at least from that campus, and we had  several international students in there. Somehow or another, it just wound up  the perfect mix of people. I don   t know if any of the advisors had any idea  that they had done that, but it was one of the most interesting classes I think  I   ve ever had.  Milligan Interesting. That was one of the last classes you took before you moved to  Tulsa.  Connolly Yes.  Milligan How long were you in Stillwater?  Connolly I left Stillwater beginning of   no, it was the end of 2010. I couldn   t  remember if it was spring 2011 or fall 2010.  Milligan When did you enter OSU-Okmulgee?  Connolly Right after high school in 2008.  Milligan Then, you were in Stillwater in 2009. Is that right?  Connolly Yep.  Milligan Then, 2009 to 2010 in Stillwater. Did you work anyplace on campus while  you were in Stillwater?  Connolly Yeah, I worked what they called the equipment room or whatever. It was  intramural equipment manager, I think, was the actual title. It was a work-study  position. Oh my goodness, it was a very hilarious thing to be able to  be there for all the   sometimes, I was a referee and stuff, but it was very  interesting to be there for all the different intramural events. Oh my  goodness, the competitions were so fun.  Milligan What were some of the examples of that?  Connolly I think one of my favorite moments was when there were two different  teams and neither one of them had any idea how to play the game. The  referees were out there teaching them how to play the game before they  started the game. Then, it was just, it was chaos and lots of fun. (Laughs)  20  Milligan Do you remember what game that was?  Connolly It was wall-ball. Someone, at one point, got aggravated, and then, it became  people-ball. (Laughs)  Milligan Were they playing   what   s the really   there   s one that   s really hilarious to  watch on the lawn in front of the library now. It   s like bubble soccer. Were  they doing that then?  Connolly They had just started that, and I never was a ref for one of those. I got to  check out equipment and watch that. It was very interesting. (Laughs)  Milligan I   ll go stand at the window to watch that one. (Laughs) You moved to Tulsa  then, and you   what was your OSU-Tulsa experience? Talk me through a  little bit of that.  Connolly OSU-Tulsa, because I was having real-world experience during the daytime  as an intern, and I was   what was so awesome is I had the most amazing  bosses in the world, one of which I actually begged to come down and do  one of our programs recently at the library. She came down and did our  Women   s History Month presentation. I was working under the people,  directly under the people who were the heads of Cherokee Nation  Businesses and the marketing department and the PR. They also dealt with  all the crisis management. Anytime something crazy or random happened, I  got to see how people dealt with that and how speeches were written, how  different things were handled both politically and professionally.  It was just so neat to be able to sit under people who had so many different  things going on. I was just the girl who, my job was to go through all the  newspapers in the state of Oklahoma every day and cut out all the articles  about Cherokee Nation to decide whether it was positive or negative or  neutral press. Then, I went through a bunch of blogs, and I   d go through all  these different things. I was just there to record how much press we got each  day, what it was, and send out a report. That was pretty much my whole job,  but I also got to do some interesting things.  There was a wonderful program that they were doing off of the Hard Rock,  which was in the building right next to mine. Cherokee Nation businesses is  the holding company for Cherokee Nation Entertainments, which has all the  casinos in it, but at the Hard Rock, that   s what I was so impressed with the  cameras for. I got to spend one afternoon on the thirteenth story of the Hard  Rock, hanging off of the building upside down and backwards with a  harness on and holding a camera and videoing Chief and other people as  they rappelled down the side of the building. It was to raise money for the  Special Olympics. Yeah, I was very lightheaded when I finished that project,  but I had the best time. Then, they allowed us to rappel down afterwards.  21  I had some really fun experiences. Then, when I would go into marketing  classes and I would go into business classes, and they would talk about crisis  management or media relations or all these different things, I was able to  relate that to my job experience. Having a great internship made that so  much more important to me. I was able to learn so much more, I think, just  because I had relatable experiences that I could turn it around to.  Milligan It sounds like that   s true. How did they present this opportunity to you, to  hang upside down and out from a building?  Connolly Well, there was the person who was originally doing the camera, and she  had shot several people. Then, it was her turn to go down because she had  raised money for the Special Olympics, and it was her turn to go down and  bungee down the side of the Hard Rock. They turned around, and they   re  like,    She   s doing this. She   s doing this. You need to do this    and all this  other stuff. They   re like,    Callie, come here.    That was what it was. It was,     Callie, come here. Do you think that you can do this?    I   m like,    If I get  sick, I   ll let you know     (Laughter) Then, the next thing I know, I was  strapped in a harness and hanging upside down and backwards and trying to  video people as they rappelled down the Hard Rock.  Milligan That   s something for your resume  (Laughter) Good job. I have a question  about your work with the Cherokee Business. Sounds like it did provide that  sort of real world founding that you always hope an internship does, right?  That basis of really understanding. I wonder two things. The first is did you  have a lot of interaction with the Cherokee tribe before working for them as  an entity?  Connolly Yes, and also because I am Cherokee. I   ve always went to heritage days, and  my mother was a Head Start teacher for Cherokee Nation for a bajillion  years. Since then, she has worked for Choctaw Nation. All of my job  experiences so far, before I started working at Connors, has always been  working for a tribe. It has been really interesting going into this public  library program. After I left Cherokee Nation Businesses, we kept extending  the internship. It was only supposed to be a six-month internship, but it  turned into almost a three-year internship. It went on for a long time. Then, I  started working actually at the Hard Rock.  They eventually transferred me down to Cherokee Casino, Fort Gibson,  which is how I got back down in this area. I was managing Players Club.  We had a lot of fun, and I got to learn a whole new field of interest there and  some of the neat rules that casinos and different places go by. What I loved  is they also had  inaudible  and entertainment venues, and The Joint, where  big name bands would come in and play. I just got to see, on the marketing  22  aspect of that, how they were able to reach all these people and how they  were able to grow a business. I learned a lot overall.  Milligan That was my second part of the question. What made up your job there?  What were some of the day-to-day functions? It sounds like it was varied.  Connolly Yeah, I   m kind of the    figure this out    person, (laughs) usually, wherever I  wind up.  Milligan What made you make the leap from working for the tribal business to  Connors State?  Connolly One of the things that made me decide, well, I always thought   I   m  currently pursuing my master   s degree at OSU, of course. (Laughs)  Milligan Tulsa or Okmulgee or   .  Connolly Tulsa. (Laughs) As I went back, I thought,    I want to be a teacher at the  college level   , and Connors was a nearby place. It just happened to have a  position in the library open. I was looking at area jobs and trying to get a  little bit closer to home. I loved working where I was working, but at that  time, my husband and I had been talking. We wanted to start a family. In the  environment that I was working in, I probably didn   t need to be working in a  heavy-smoke environment and trying to conceive. We talked about that, and  I decided to get another job that was a little bit closer to home. There was a  position open at Connors State College in the library as a library technician.  I read entirely too much (I may have an addiction), so much so that I blog on  several different review websites. I get free advance copies of books from  Amazon and different things for an honest review and all that other stuff.  I read entirely too much, and I thought,    Well, you know, this may be a  good way to get into academia.    I applied, and that took off. I have had the  most wonderful time ever since. I went through the Oklahoma Department  of Libraries and got my certification as a public librarian. I learned a lot  through that. I also learned how to reach so many more resources than I  already had. It allowed me to collect more information, more things, that I  could pass onto people that would contact me every now and again of     Where can I find this?    or    How do I do this?    or    How do I do that?     While I was there, I learned we had a bunch of archives, but no one ever  accessed them. That became a part of my project. I started doing, basically,  social media management for the library. Now, we   ve got to where we reach  over ten thousand people every month through our different social media,  with informative articles and things out of our databases.  Also, the archives, I would, I tagged   Connors State College has a  wonderful alumni page. I would tag the alumni page, and then, I would take  23  the old Connors State yearbooks. They   re, you know, 1967, 1966, these  really old yearbooks where they used to have a full Connors yearbook. I  would copy the class pictures, and then, I would post them on our social  media so that people could go back and see some of the things that Connors  have done through the years. So many people got to find things about their  relatives or their mom or dad or sister or friend. Then, I started getting a lot  of requests for archive information, so that became an interesting thing. We  started really digging into our archives more and getting information out to  people.  We would have people call sometimes from other states.    One of my best  friends just passed away, and we   re trying to find some information about  when they were younger and some pictures    and this and that and the other.  We would find as much information as we possibly could and get to people.  Some of it was just fun stuff. Somebody would say,    My parents met at  Connors, and they   re having an anniversary dinner, thirtieth anniversary  dinner. We thought it would be awesome if we could find pictures of them  when they were still in college.    We   d go back, and we   d find pictures of  them in the different clubs and things that they were in. It was a lot of fun.  Milligan You were doing social media, archival reference, and just standard library  tech duties.  Connolly Yeah, I do cataloguing. I   m a little bit of everywhere. (Laughs)  Milligan That   s a lot of skills. Really quick, before I forget, when did you graduate  from OSU-Tulsa with your undergraduate?  Connolly In 2012.  Milligan What was your   was it just straight up business? That   s where you landed,  business marketing, right?  Connolly Yes, I got my degree in marketing, my bachelor   s in marketing.  Milligan What are you going for your master   s?  Connolly Right now, I   m currently working on my data mining certificate, and then, I  am juggling. I   m trying to decide on the master   s, where that   s going to  land. I was looking at my MBA, and then, I thought,    Well, maybe I   ll do  this, and maybe I   ll do that.    Then, I was looking also at   because I spent  so much time at the library. My heart was broken because I found out there  was not an ALA-accredited librarian   s degree at OSU. I thought,    Well, I  could go to OU, but I could try another degree instead     (Laughs)  24  Milligan Doesn   t say OSU  A lot of our OSU librarians have had to go to OU to get  their library degree, their MLIS.  Connolly If anybody out there is listening and you can nudge them toward that, it  would be nice. (Laughs)  Milligan I think there   s some museum-leaning things, but that   s about it. Is your data  mining certificate though OSU-Tulsa then?  Connolly Yes.  Milligan You   re still deciding on your master   s degree, though. You   ll pick a good  one. I know it. I can feel it. Coming back to starting to work at Connors  State as a library tech, talk me through how you got from there to where you  are in the position you   re starting now.  Connolly I don   t know how it happens, but usually, I wind up doing, starting at a job  doing one thing. Then, it just evolves into something completely different. I  started there as a library tech, and I had so much fun assisting students. I  learned that a lot of the students (I was a tutor while I was going to  college)   the tutoring center closed early, but the library would still be  open. Then, we had students that would come over for tutoring. I would help  them to the point that I could, and then, I would have to find other resources.  I dealt with that a lot.  Then, someone just happened to mention one day in passing,    Well, we  have a Facebook page. That   s all that we have, but we only get twelve or  twenty people that get on there a month. We would really like to do  something to get people to access our databases more and try to help people  learn how to even just use our search engine and our browser and know  what resources we have available.    I created an entire social media  marketing plan. Every day of the week has its own little thing. We   ve got  Segway Sunday, Motivation Monday, Trivia Tuesday, What   s New  Wednesday, Thinking Thursday, Funny Friday, and Flashback Friday  because it   s got our archive information. Then, because I was collecting all  the scholarship stuff, we did a Scholarship Saturday and a Silly Saturday.  There   s two posts a day, but it was a way for us to highlight all the different  library resources that people had available to them. What   s New  Wednesday, what are our new bestsellers? What were our new things that  we had just come in?  All of the sudden, people started realizing more and more often. You know,  a lot of people may not come into the library, but they may be on their  Facebook or Twitter or some of these other social media methods when they  see,    Oh hey, this is available to me, and it   s free.    I always tell them,     You   re paying for it. You   ve got your tuition. You pay for it in all your  25  fees, so come and use as much as you can.    After they started seeing all of  the things that were accessible to them, they started getting interested. Our  numbers started going up on a lot of things. Social media has been a really,  an interesting tool. A lot of alumni have come back and asked questions and  needed help with things.  Milligan It   s always amazing to me how you can make those little connections just  through photographs and some of that flashback stuff. It   s a great tool. Talk  to me about the program you   re starting with NASA  Native American  Student Association . Walk me through how you ended up   .  Connolly I had been working for Connors less than a month, and somebody had  brought up the fact that we still didn   t have anything for Native Americans  on campus. I had noticed that, but that we had had a Native American  Student Association in the past. Someone found an old quilt that they had  made, one you lay over a table or a booth or something so that you have the  pretty quilt. Someone had made a beautiful quilt. I don   t know who it is, but  thank you for making such a wonderful quilt. They had a student  organization fair, and it was the beginning of the fall semester. I thought,     Well, I   ll talk to some people   , and some other people were interested in  this getting restarted on campus.  I just made a booth and draped the quilt over the top of the booth and  showed up at the student organization fair and had a signup sheet where  people could leave their information and join the organization. We didn   t  charge any dues. I did not want finances to be a hindrance for the program.  A lot of people don   t realize this, but there are a lot of tribes that have  certain blood quantums and certain requirements that someone may be  Native American but they might not fit the particular requirements for their  tribe. They may not be people who are in possession of CDIB  Certificate  Degree of Indian Blood  card, but they are Native American. They do have  the culture, the roots, the ancestry, and they still have the same problems  when they come into a college campus that the other Native American  students do.  I just made sure that it was something that they got to self-identify as  Native. It was not a requirement that you had a CDIB card or any of this  other stuff. The group kept growing, and then, we actually had a couple of  students that loved so many of the activities that we were doing that we kind  of adopted them. They   re now official NASA members, but they are not  Native American. What they did is they   ve come to our beading workshops  and basket weaving, and they got to see some of the different activities that  we had done and things that we had planned to do. They got so involved and  having so much fun that they said,    Can we just stay and keep coming?     They would show up to our meetings every month, and we just adopted  them in. It   s been a lot of fun. Connors has received the Title III Native  26  American grant, which is awesome, and they received the full five million,  which is only a handful of colleges in the nation actually received the full  grant. A lot of people received a partial grant, but we received the full grant.  Milligan Maybe describe what that is.  Connolly It is a grant where we are going to renovate one of our buildings on campus  at Warner, and we are going to turn it into a Native American cultural  center. We are also creating online classes and different things that are going  to help Native Americans with their different learning styles. We have  partnered with other nations to try and get as many new scholarships and  many new opportunities as possible available to our students because, you  know, we   re 40 percent Native American. It fluctuates by a percent one way  or the other, thirty-nine sometimes, forty-one sometimes, but I just say 40  percent Native American. We started gathering resources, so we are going to  have wonderful resource rooms, wonderful things that, over the next few  years, will be available to Connors students.  One of the things we   re doing in the upcoming semesters, we   re going to  start having online classes that are available. We   re going to have different  Native American language classes, as well. We   re going to teach Cherokee I  and II. We   re also going to have, I don   t know what the appropriate term for  it is, but I   ll just call it a sensitivity training and talk to some of our teachers  about some of the issues that I   ve talked to you about, like a student who  doesn   t meet them in their eyes when they   re talking to them. That does not  necessarily mean that they   re not listening. That   s a way of showing respect  with certain students.  There are a lot of little cultural things that people don   t pick up on. Since we  are really pushing to reach our Native American population because we  have such a large Native American population already at Connors, we really  wanted the teachers and the staff to be aware of some of the cultural  challenges that they will be facing when they start teaching these students.  We   re working on coming up with a program where we get to talk to our  faculty about some of these things and make them aware.  There   s just a lot of amazing things coming up with this grant, but what I  personally am going to be doing with the Title III is I will be a Native  American student advisor on our Muskogee campus. I will continue to be  the advisor for the Native American Student Association. We will continue  with our monthly activities, except now, we   ll actually have more funding  for it because we grew to over forty students. Even on such a small college  campus, that was kind of interesting on one campus. Now, I   m sure it will  grow quite a bit more now that we   ve expanded to our other campus.  27  We will continue to have cultural activities. We   re going to do things like  visit the heritage center here, and we   ll go to the Five Civilized Tribes  Museum, things like this. We are going to try and create an environment  where people can thrive and people can come in. A lot of our Native  American students are first-generation college students. They might have a  lot of fears, a lot of worries coming in, and maybe have a little problem  getting out of their shell and becoming more involved in campus. We want  to present activities to people in such a way as to allow them to be  comfortable, to be happy, to make friends, to make connections for life. We  are having a lot of fun with that. I will be working on programming and  continuing to work with NASA, and then, I will also be helping advise these  students to get them into all of these neat, new classes and help them find  their place here at Connors and, hopefully, give them some direction on  where they might be going in their future career and some of the things that  are available to them.  Milligan That   s a lot of things that you   re able to start moving towards. It   s a lot of  planning. I think I   ll want to come back to some more details on that for a  second, but let me back up a second and try and understand a little bit  better. From that initial role as the Native American Student Association  advisor, were you doing that as an employee of the library, or was that  something you were doing on your own?  Connolly That was something that I was doing on my own. They always try to have an  adult employee that is an advisor for any organization, but it was not  something that I was getting paid for or anything else. In fact, I wound up  putting a lot of my own money into it getting things started, but because our  students, we had wonderful students that always made sure they showed up  at the student meetings where all the organizations gathered together,  student council meetings. Anyway, when our students made sure we  never   there was always a representative there from our student  organization. Because of that, the student council actually granted us some  funds.  I was able to use that with fundraisers and some of my own money to be  able to continue to do these different activities. One of the things that we  did   ladies may like the beading workshop. Ladies may be really into the  basket weaving, but our male students may not be completely thrilled. When  I bought the looms and we got everything in, I had someone come in who  was one of the other students, who   s one of our wonderful, adopted students,  that   s amazing at beading. She makes hat bands for cowboy hats and stuff.  She came in, and she showed the guys how to make hat bands. They started  working on making their own hat bands. We talked about making belt  buckles our next go-around. A lot of different interesting things that would  take care not just of the female interests, but the males.  28  We would come up with different topics.    What do we want our activity to  be next month?    We   d have some interesting ideas. One of the things that  we talked about with the guys that there is a wonderful man in Muskogee  who makes hunting vests out of buckskin. He makes hunting vests that he  actually puts the   I don   t know what else you would call them. They   re not  fluorescent. Whatever the bright-colored strips on the back of the hunting  vests so that you can wear them to any activities and it will be legal while  you   re hunting and everything else. That was one of the things that we had  talked about doing next semester with the guys is having somebody come in  and show them how to make different styles of Native American hunting  vests and make them also legal to wear while they   re hunting. That was  neat.  Milligan How did you go from that role   who applied for this grant, and what was  either your awareness or your participation in that process?  Connolly I had no participation whatsoever with the grant writing process that had  already been begun long before I started at Connors. Connors received the  grant after I had been here. They were in the beginning stages of receiving  the grant when I came through the doors. Finally, one day, as the grant  progressed and they got ready to hire some more staff and get everything  going (Title III was really not on campus until recently), I got a call, and I  came into an office. I said,    All my bosses are here. What did I do? Am I in  trouble?    (Laughs)  I kind of looked around nervously, and they were like,    Callie, we need to  talk to you about something.    I thought,    Okay. What did I do?    (Laughs)  They told me that they were going to have some positions open up in the  Title III grant, and because I was the Native American Student Association  advisor, that they would like me to at least look at applying for some of  them. They thought some of those things might be of interest to me. I  looked, and I asked questions about Title III and got to learn a little bit of  information about it. I applied for it and got the job, and now, that   s what I  guess I   m going to be doing. (Laughs)  Milligan Congratulations. It sounds like it   s a really good fit. You also mentioned that  you were a part of the NASA group in OSU. Was that in Stillwater, while  you were Stillwater or Tulsa or all three campuses?  Connolly I was in it in all three campuses. Believe it or not, I know I   m not an  international student at all, but when I was at OSU-Okmulgee, they had a  wonderful international student program. They would do a potluck dinner  once a month or whatever, and they would bring different cultural foods.  One of my roommates said,    You know, you   re always making weird stuff.     I   m like,    Making weird stuff?    Whatever you   re raised with when you   re at  home and you cook, you don   t think about something being odd. They   re  29  like,    You make cultural-type stuff. You should bring a dish to the potluck.     I   m like,    Okay. All right. I   ll try it.    I brought something, and then,  somehow, that became a thing.  I   d bring a dish every time they   d have a potluck. I got to be a part of that  group, even though I was not an international student, just because I showed  up with food. (Laughs) I had a lot of fun with that. Then, I met a lot of  wonderful people while I was at OSU-Stillwater. I was not as involved once  I moved to OSU-Tulsa as I was at OSU-Stillwater simply because I was  working thirty hours a week. It was hard to juggle all the events, but I still  got to swing a few of the events. I really enjoyed some of the things that  they offered in just meeting up with people from different backgrounds. It   s  really always interesting to see different perspectives and how people view  things.  Milligan Are there some of the things that you participated in in those NASA groups  from OSU, things that you carried over when you became the NASA advisor  here at Connors?  Connolly Definitely. A lot of times, if I would go and speak, it was not always  specifically as a Native American woman in agriculture ambassador that I  would go to someplace. Sometimes, it was just, I would have a friend who  was from a certain tribe, and they just wanted me to come and talk with  them or bring some resources or at least help them get into contact with  certain things. I would go somewhere and meet with them. A lot of times, if  I would go somewhere and speak, they would give you a gift basket for the  speaker or whatever. I wound up getting a lot of different beadwork and  different pottery and different little things while I was in high school that I  stored and all this other stuff.  Then, as I transitioned into the NASA advisor, I was able to start bringing  those things and showing them as examples to my students of different  tribes. I would do a little display of different types of beadwork and say,     Okay, is there a specific thing that you want to learn in this meeting?    We  would talk about it, and they would decide whatever was their next project  for the next meeting. We would come up with fun things. Because I had so  many different knick-knacks and wonderful tribal gifts, I was able to present  them with a lot of things. Then, I also had the experience with OSU-Stillwater  and their NASA events and was able to see, you know, I had these  things to draw from. Somehow or another, it all meshed together. (Laughs)  Milligan Is there a predominant tribe that the 40 percent of students here tend to be a  part of? Is there, with the mix?  Connolly Well, because we are Oklahoma and we are the wonderful end location for a  lot of people from the Trail of Tears, we have a vast amount of tribes. We  30  have a lot of Cherokees, a lot of Creeks. I think Cherokee Nation is still  working very hard to make sure they get all the slots in our nursing program.  We have a wonderful, wonderful nursing program and a lot of tribal  members in our nursing programs because so many tribal hospitals in the  area are in need of nurses and different medical professionals. It   s really  neat to see how people come in to fill a need, to meet a need in our  communities.  There are people who are in everything. They may come down to Connors  just because they want to be on the rodeo team or just because they really  are wonderful at shooting things, and they want to be on the shooting team,  or they want to come down and work with our wonderful horticulture  teacher and learn all kinds of wonderful things about floral arrangements.  There   s a lot of things that we offer, but we have a very, very diverse set of  tribes at Connors.  Milligan Understood. I may have one or two more questions going backwards, but  let   s   is there anything else that you think you want to add about this, sort  of what you   re doing now or what you have framed for the future?  Connolly I am just really interested in finding resources that I can get to the students. I  know that we are going to look for sponsorship from different area tribes for  activities that we   re going to do. We certainly would never, ever want to  host a powwow on our own because a powwow is a very sacred thing.  However, if we find that a tribe is willing to allow my students to come and  go to one of their powwows or have a speaker from different tribes come in  and talk to them about how to make a certain cultural thing when we have  our different workshops each month, that would be amazing. I   m really  trying to look into resources for our students to see what they can find and  just give them as much of a home away from home as possible. I feel like  my mind was broadened so much, especially when I did study abroad at  OSU. It was broadened so much working with   .  Milligan Where did you go for study abroad? Tell me about that.  Connolly For study abroad, I actually got to go to France. I stayed in Dijon, France,  and I got to go to the University of Burgundy in Dijon for a summer. Each  weekend, I   d go to a different country. It wasn   t necessarily a part of the  program. You just got to do, your weekends were free when you weren   t  going to college. We would get together with whoever were our friends, and  we would go somewhere else. Each weekend, I   d go to a different country. I  got to see so many wonderful things that I   ve always wanted to see and do  things that I wanted to do.  My favorite thing, I was actually in Normandy on the anniversary of D-Day.  They were honoring several soldiers from that, and there were many, many,  31  many, many soldiers and family members of soldiers that were there. That  was an exceedingly   at the D-Day Memorial Museum there. It was an  exceedingly emotional event, but it was amazing. Just to see so many people  from so many countries come together, not just in grief but in celebration,  was awesome.  I learned something in my travels. So many times, I didn   t speak any of the  languages to some of the countries that I would go to. I would have to pick  things up as I went along. I learned that people are very much the same. It  doesn   t matter where they   re from or how they   re raised, as far as just  wanting to be curious, to learn things, to grow and develop. We all care  about our families. We all care about our culture, our religions, our different  things that make us individuals. When you can kind of connect with people,  even without being able to speak their language sometimes, is just an  amazing human feature.  Milligan I agree.  Connolly During that period, it was international business that I was studying. It really  tied into some of the stuff that I would do later on.  Milligan That makes a lot of sense. Really quickly or briefly, I guess, after you   re in  the rest of your story, I just want to go back a little bit towards your time as  the Women in Ag representative. Maybe flesh out a little bit more of the  details of how that worked. That is a long time to be that representative.  Were you the first one?  Connolly I was the first one. The first time they ever had a competition is when I was  fourteen, and I won. I went to Hollywood, Florida. The next year, they had  the same essay competition. It was a different topic, different everything. I  wrote in, and I won again. That time, I got to go to Las Vegas, Nevada.  They were talking to   there was another girl who did return who had  written an essay for a different thing. They were having big conferences at  this time. We would go to the conference, and then, we would speak a little  bit. We would talk to everybody and receive our rewards and get to visit. I  got to speak to Janie Hipp and some of the other representatives from  different organizations and different tribes when, you know, the first time  around.  Then, when it came to the second time around, I was so interested in going  to so many of the workshops and things that they were holding for the  women in there that someone asked me,    Well, would you like to come and  talk with me further?    It was one of the speakers at one of the workshops. I  said,    Well, yeah, that would be wonderful   , and I actually wound up going  and meeting with her later on in Arizona. It was kind of a progressive thing.  I don   t think it was ever intended that the winners   they were going to be  32  national representatives for Native American Women in Agriculture, but it  was never really intended that they would do a whole lot of travel or  anything. It was they were going to represent at the particular activities and  conferences that we had and learn as much as possible. It was an opportunity  for youth. Then, I think I just kind of made enough connections that it grew  from there.  Milligan That makes more sense to me. I was trying to fit in how that continuation  happened, so that, I understand. You mentioned that you won several of the  writing competitions for that. Did you have to resubmit, and did you win for  seven years consecutive? How was that   .  Connolly I only won for two years consecutive. The third year, I don   t know if it  was   I never really figured out if it was funding or what it was, but they  didn   t hold it the third year. They did later on, but because I was already so  involved, they said,    Well, how would you like to continue to be involved  with our organization? How would you like to continue to come to these  meetings and meet with these people?    I talked to them about that, and I  said,    I would very much like that.    The people that I had met there gave me  opportunities:    Would you like to come next time we do a workshop when  we   re closer to your state?       Yeah, I   ll go to Texas and go to this workshop.  That would be awesome     I   d get to go to different places and meet with  people, and it was something that just developed as I went along.  Milligan Did your mom go with you, or did you go by yourself?  Connolly My mom usually went with me because it started when I was fourteen. Even  at sixteen, there was no way my mom was going to let me drive through  Austin, Texas. She   s like,    No. No, no, no, no, no. That doesn   t sound safe.     A sixteen-year-old alone in Austin, Texas, and she   s like,    Honey, I love  you, but your sense of direction is not always due north. I don   t want you  getting lost in a huge city, calling me,    Mom, I don   t know where I am         Mom   s not tech-savvy, and Google and GPS were not really part of our  household at that point. (Laughs)  Milligan (Laughs) Understandable. Okay, that makes more sense. I kept thinking on  that and going,    There   s more to the logistics of this.    Then, you  resubmitted a few times after that? No, you just applied those two times, and  then, you continued that relationship.  Connolly I finally just asked somebody. I said,    I   m here, and I know that you guys  keep saying that I   m the national representative or whatever. How long does  this last? How do you want me to do this?    They said,    How about we just  continue this until you   re twenty-one?    I said,    Okay   , and that was kind of  all she wrote on that. There was a lot of times that I didn   t do a whole lot  specifically with just the Native American Women in Ag. It was just  33  meeting people at different events and people saying,    Hey, would you  come and speak?    or    Would you come and help me with this project I   m  working on?    If I had the money and I could do it, I would go, which was  another thing that FFA helped with so much. I actually was able to make  money in the different little projects and stuff that I had just enough money,  when I wasn   t playing softball and other sports, to be able to go to some of  these other things. Of course, when you actually get to get out of school to  do events as a teenager, you   re all for going to these events. (Laughs)  Milligan Especially if they   re bubble blowing contests, end up in a bubble blowing  contest.  Connolly Oh yes.  Milligan I think that about does it for the questions. It   s sort of the timeline I was  looking for. Gosh, you   ve given me a lot of time already. We   ve been talking  about an hour and a half. Can you believe that?  Connolly Oh wow.  Milligan I know. (Laughs) Is there anything else that you want to talk about? One of  the standards, I think, with this project, people always want to know is are  there ways that you show your OSU pride? Is your car orange or your  favorite t-shirt, those sorts of things?  Connolly I have a Cherokee license tag, but around the Cherokee license tag on my  license plate is, of course, the OSU sticker. I   ve got the little OSU dangly  things from my rearview mirror and all that good stuff. My husband, who  did not go to OSU, his truck is blinged out with OSU. (Laughs) I have an  orange room in my house, and yeah, I have quite a bit of OSU memorabilia.  If you go to the football games or some of the other events, eventually,  you   ll get shot a t-shirt from a t-shirt gun and some of these other things.  Things just piled up, so I finally come up with, I said,    All right. We have an  office in our house. I   m making it an OSU office.    (Laughs) That   s what it  turned into.  Milligan I like it. (Laughs) I   m always amazed at how people show their brightest  orange pride. (Laughs)  Connolly I have many, many nieces and nephews, and many   I don   t know how it  happens, but somehow, my family seems to adopt people. I   m not talking  about in a legal sense. It   s just we have wonderful friends that become close  friends, and they   re almost like another sibling. Our family grows. I have  friends whose children call me    Aunt Callie    even though I   m not their  actual aunt. Because we   re around them so much, it   s just a natural  extension for them. I   m sure my kids will do the same thing with them.  34  All of my nieces and nephews and my nieces and nephews that are not  technically my nieces and nephews, let   s just say I   ve given them all a very  strong nudge to become a Poke. (Laughs) Anytime there   s a camp or there   s  something offered via OSU, I   m always like,    Hey, you know what   s great?  You know what you could do this summer so you   re not bored?    (Laughs)  Milligan Sounds like it worked for you. (Laughs)  Connolly It worked.  Milligan Keep at it  Now that I know where your orange is not hidden, where it   s  loud and proud, is there anything else that you want to touch on, on your  general life or career, anything you just want to add?  Connolly I think that I have had really good role models, and I found them in very  unexpected places throughout my career and throughout my personal life. I  think anytime you have an opportunity to do something, even if you   re not  an extrovert, even if you   re very introverted   you may not believe it, but at  one point, I was. If you have knowledge or skills or abilities that you have  possessed, a lot of things that we learn, believe it or not, are passed on  through oral tradition. That   s not just a Native American thing. That is a  worldwide tradition. If you do have certain knowledge or skills or abilities  and you come across a young person or someone who seems to be really  interested in something that you are really good at and you have the  opportunity, I would encourage anybody and everybody to try and pass  those skills on while that person is interested and wants to know.  There are a lot of dying arts out there, and you may not realize it. You may  be the best scrapbooker in the world and no one can scrapbook like you can,  but your granddaughter, somewhere down the line, may think,    I don   t have  any pictures of my family, and I don   t know what I   ll do.    You may be able  to teach her a thing or two. If it   s blowing bubbles, scrapbooking, or maybe  you have a really other awesome talent, just remember that that is something  that can be passed on, and a lot of things, traditions die without someone  passing them on.  Milligan I think that   s good advice. All right, then, I   m going to call it at an hour and  thirty-three minutes.  -------  -------
