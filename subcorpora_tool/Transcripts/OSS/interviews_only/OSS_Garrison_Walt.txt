 Gill. Today is September 4, 2010. I   m visiting with  Walt Garrison at the Oklahoma State University Campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Walt, you   re on campus for  a ballgame today. We know you   re busy and we appreciate you taking  the time to come by and visit.  Gill, as I   ve always said, everything that has ever happened to me started  right here at Oklahoma State, so anything I can do for you, especially, or  for the school, I   m more than happy to.  Thank you, Walt. Let   s back up a little bit and ask about your early life.  Where you grew up, your family, your mom and dad. Can you share  some of that information?  Well, I grew up in Lewisville, Texas, born and raised there. My dad was  a Fighting Farmer. That was the mascot at Lewisville High School. My  mom and dad were both graduates of Lewisville High School. I grew up  right there about, probably, five blocks off Main Street, which at that  time was in the country. I went to school there my whole first grade  through graduation in the twelfth grade and played football there. We  never had a good team in Lewisville, and I always said if we won the  coin flip we had a celebration. We didn   t win a lot of games when I was  playing, but had a great time, great childhood, great family. I had two  brothers and a sister, and my brothers both played football.  What position did you play in high school, Walt?  I played linebacker in high school. In fact, I came to Oklahoma State as  a linebacker. (Laughter) You were a year or two behind me, so you don   t  know, but yes, I played linebacker. Well, I only played two games then.  We played Arkansas here and OU down there, and those are the only  5  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  two games that we played. The rest of the time we were kind of  dummies for the varsity, but yes, they moved me to fullback when  Coach Cutchin came. Phil Cutchin came from Alabama the second  semester of my freshman year, and if you played linebacker on defense,  you played either fullback or center on offense. I was too little to play  center, so they moved me to fullback and I hated it  I   d never carried the  ball in my life until then.  Let me ask you quickly, growing up, what did your dad do for a living?  My dad was a machinist. He worked for General Dynamics, which was  Consolidated to start with, then it was Convair, and then it was General  Dynamics. He was a machinist. He made parts for airplanes for about  thirty-something years over there in Fort Worth.  Walt, anything else you did other than football? Any school activities or  community activities?  Well, in a small, small school like Lewisville was at that time, because  there were 2,150 people in the town, so it was a small school, if you  were a boy you played all events, football and basketball, baseball, track.  You played everything, because there weren   t enough kids to go around.  If everybody didn   t play, you didn   t have a team, hardly. Then I was in  FFA, vocational agriculture, which thank goodness I was. I learned how  to weld and how to do some other good things. You went to a small  school, so most of us enjoyed that environment.  How many kids were in your senior class? Do you remember?  I think there were thirty-seven, thirty-three, something like that. We had  a pretty large graduating class because before that there weren   t that  many. (Laughter) I think my sister, who was three years behind me, they  had the largest graduating class in Lewisville history, and I think it was  like eighty or something like that.  But your class was only thirty-something?  Thirty-seven, I think. I   m not sure exactly.  I   ve heard some stories about your recruiting experience at Oklahoma  State, how you got to OSU. Can you share with us about that?  Oh yes, I mean, it was one of the greatest things that ever happened to  me. I worked for the American Nut Company, which was a peanut  factory in Lewisville, Texas. They made commodity peanut butter for  ships afloat overseas, PXs, and welfare. We made gallon cans of  6  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  peanuts, and I worked on Friday and Saturday nights. I worked a  midnight until eight in the morning shift, and so I never really got to go  to a school dance because after the football games I   d have to go to work  at the peanut company. The guy that owned the peanut company was a  guy named Zan Burroughs, and I worked there three years, I guess. He  told my dad, he said,    That boy needs to go to school somewhere.     Daddy, of course, couldn   t afford to send me to go to college.  Zan Burroughs had a brother who was the lieutenant governor of New  Mexico and he said,    Well, I   ll call my brother and he can get him a  scholarship to New Mexico State because it   s a land-grant college and  the government funds it, and we can get him a scholarship out there.     So, he called his brother and his brother said,    Well, that would work,  only New Mexico State   s on probation. They don   t have any  scholarships.    So, his brother called the governor of Oklahoma and said,     There   s a kid down there in Lewisville, Texas, I want you to give a  scholarship to.    So, Neill Armstrong came down to recruit me, but  really, he   d never seen me play football, but they sent him down to  Lewisville to recruit me to Oklahoma State. He didn   t know if I had one  leg or weighed a hundred pounds, or two   he didn   t have any idea.  (Laughter) But they gave me a scholarship, and that   s the reason I got  there, not because I could play football, but because I could unload  boxcars of peanuts.  Walt, in high school, were you all-conference or did you have any  honors or recognitions?  My senior year, I was second team all-district honorable mention, which  is what, third team or fourth team? (Laughter) Something like that in a  real small district down there. I made all-district in basketball, is the  only sport that I made all-district in.  That   s a great story. (Laughter)  It   s a true story. It   s not a good story, but it   s a true story.  So, it was Neill Armstrong that came there. Did you ever make a  recruiting visit to the campus?  After he came down, they had me come up and do a visit because I  didn   t even know where Oklahoma State was. In fact, I thought it was  OU. I mean, actually, I did. Mother brought me up here, and Billy Tillet,  from Whitewright, Texas, who was a receiver (he didn   t last long up  here, he wasn   t here the year that I came) showed me around, showed  me the Student Union, showed me a lot of pool halls and beer joints, and  I liked it. (Laughs) So, my first introduction to Millie   s, but I liked the  7  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  school. When we drove in and all I saw out there were horses and cattle  and barns and fields, I said,    Man, this is a great place     And really, I  mean, I love Oklahoma State, but it isn   t close to anything. It   s right out  in the middle of nowhere, and that   s the part I liked about it the best. The  campus, of course, I   d never been in a football stadium that big. And  what does Lewis Field hold? Thirty thousand? Twenty-five-something?  I don   t know what the heck it holds. (Laughs)  Yes, thirty, thirty-five.  But it was the biggest stadium I   d ever been in, so I was sold on  Oklahoma State from the first visit.  That   s great. Well, when you got on campus, what were your first  impressions of the campus itself?  I didn   t have a clue where I was. They put me in a room, and my  roommate   I don   t even know what his name was because he never  showed, so I was rooming by myself and I didn   t know a soul. I mean,  Neill Armstrong   s the only guy that I knew, and then I ran into Rusty  Martin and found out that he rode horses and stuff. So, we kind of  formed a friendship that has lasted forty-something years now. He was  rooming with a guy and they didn   t get along real well, so Rusty moved  in with me because I had an extra bed. I   d never been on a college  campus in my life. I didn   t know where anything was, and it took me  like three days to find out where my classes were. I   d have to ask  somebody,    Okay, where   s the Animal Husbandry Building? Where   s  this? Where   s that?    (Laughter) But it was an experience.  What was your major?  Veterinary medicine.  Pre-vet?  So, yes, pre-vet. You had to go with either arts and sciences or animal  husbandry, and of course, I went with animal husbandry.  So, you enrolled with the intent of being a veterinarian? Was that your  intention?  Oh, yes. My intention was to be a vet, and I never made it. (Laughs)  You were talking about your linebacker experience. Is that the position  you were expecting to play when you got here?  8  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  That   s what I did play. I started as linebacker in those two games, and  we did beat OU that year. We killed them. We beat them   I don   t know  what it is. I know our senior year we beat them sixteen to seventeen.  Beat them as bad as we could? (Laughs)  But we beat OU down in Norman   the freshmen, of course. It wasn   t  varsity. It was freshmen, and I played linebacker. Our head coach as  freshmen was Sammy Baugh, Slinging Sammy Baugh. He was a friend  of Neill Armstrong   s, and he was between jobs with the New York  Titans and the Houston Oilers. So, Neill talked him into coming and  coaching the freshmen, and what a great experience.  Oh, my gosh   What a great experience to play for him.  Now, for those that might not understand it, in that era, freshmen  weren   t eligible to play with the varsity team.  Correct.  So, the freshmen had a separate team.  Right.  What do you remember about Neill? Neill has come down and recruited  you. He was pretty special to OSU, too, wasn   t he?  Yes, a great guy, great guy. I mean, he made you feel comfortable and  he always told me, he said,    Walt, now, if you need anything, you call  me. If you need information, if you need whatever, call me.    Neill, of  course, coached for varsity, so we didn   t have a lot of interaction once I  got here, but he was a great man. I mean, I thought the world of Neill.  And he worked in the Dallas Cowboys organization, didn   t he?  Right, he worked in the Dallas Cowboys organization, so I got to reunite  with him down there. In fact, the last time I saw him, I think, was at  Coach Landry   s funeral. He was at Tom   s funeral, but what a great asset  to the university he was.  Walt, what do you remember about Coach Baugh? I mean, it must have  been pretty special playing under a guy like that.  The one thing that I remember, my dad and mom came up when we  9  Gill  Garrison  Gill  played Arkansas. When we played them it rained, so they wouldn   t let  us play on the varsity field, in Lewis Field. We had the game on the  practice field so we wouldn   t tear it up for the game that week. I  introduced my dad to Coach Baugh, and I said,    Dad, this is Sammy  Baugh, our coach.    My dad, who was six three and weighed about two  hundred pounds, was a giant to me. He looked like a little kid when he  met Sammy Baugh because Sammy Baugh was his hero.  Coach Baugh, I tell you what, was the funniest coach in the world, and  he led the NFL a couple of years in a row in interceptions, punting, and  passing. So, he was a pretty good athlete and he could still punt the ball.  Of course, then, he was probably fifty-four or fifty-five when he came  up here, and he could still punt, he could still pass. He was a funny man.  He was fun to play football for. I asked him one time   we were going to  OU, and I was one of the freshman captains, so they said,    What are we  going to wear down there?    We took a bus to OU, and I went and asked  Coach Baugh, I said,    Coach, what do you want us to wear to travel to  OU?    He said,    I don   t give a damn if you come naked.    He said,     Come ready to play football.    (Laughter) I mean, he was just a funny  son of a gun  I loved him. I went to his funeral. What a great guy.  Super. So, at the end of your freshman year, as you indicated earlier,  OSU hired a new head coach, Phil Cutchin. What do you remember  about his coaching background and his coaching philosophy?  I remember the first meeting, and there were a lot of us in there, a  hundred-something, in the first meeting. I remember one line he said,     There are some of you guys here that don   t want to play football.    He  said,    I   m going to find out who you are.    As you know, he did. He ran  off I forget how many. It was like the Junction Boys. Of course, he was  one of the Junction Boys with Bear Bryant at Texas A M, and they  made a movie about the Junction Boys. He made the workouts really,  really, really hard.  Well, where the practice field is, they had that old chain link fence  around it and the hedge around it, and they had those two gates there  where you went in. Cutchin would stand there and open that gate, and  he   d let all the players in, and he   d shut the gate, throw a chain around it,  and lock it. He had the only key. If you quit during practice, you had to  crawl over the hedge, over the fence to quit. I   ve seen fifteen guys at one  time leave. (Laughter) I   ll tell you what, at the end of my sophomore  year, which was the next year, I think we suited out thirty players or  something, twenty-seven or thirty players, when we played OU my  sophomore year.  And you started with about a hundred guys, over one hundred?  10  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Yes, a hundred, hundred and thirty, something like that.  And you wound up with thirty-something?  Yes, well, he   d cut most of them, or a lot of them, during that spring.  Then, the next year during two-a-days, they slowly dwindled down to I  forget. We had thirty or thirty-five players on the team at the end of the  season.  Now, he had been at Alabama, is that right?  Alabama, and A M before that, and Kentucky before that. He   d brought  in a lot of people that he had coached with or played with. Willie  Zapalac, who was my coach my second semester of my freshman year. I  was still a linebacker, and Willie Zapalac was a linebacker coach, and  Elwood Kettler, who was one of the Junction Boys also, was the  backfield coach. When they moved me to fullback, then he was my  coach.  Was Jim Stanley on that     Jim Stanley was there. Jungle Jim was there. He sure was, and he   s a  great guy, but Leon Fuller, who was the defensive backfield coach that  played at Alabama, he was only like five years or six years older than us,  so he could still run and tackle and show you stuff.  You probably still remember his wife, too, don   t you?  I remember her very well. (Laughter) She was a pretty lady, and they  lived over in the dorm with us, in Bennett, in an apartment over there.  Carol was her name, and she was a little red-headed lady. She was  beautiful. We were all in love with her.  Walt, there are a lot of stories about that first spring? Typically, how  long was the practice? What was it like? It must have been pretty brutal.  Practices were probably two hours, two and a half hours. There were a  lot of physical drills. We did that barrel roll, that three-man barrel roll  for what seemed like forever. We ran wind sprints. I don   t think we  actually played that much football, to start with, my freshman year.  Tackling practice.  Tackling practice, I mean, running, yes. We did all kinds of physical  drills, a lot of one-on-one stuff, pushing and shoving and fighting. If you  11  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  got in a fight, you just got in a fight. They never broke up a fight. Then,  you finally found out that if you got in a fight, you   re still going to have  to practice. All you did was wear yourself out, so there weren   t a lot of  fights after the first four or five.  Walt, obviously, you had an outstanding career at Oklahoma State  University. As I recall, you started all three years, All Big Eight. At least  one year, maybe two years, you led the Big Eight in rushing.  I led the Big Eight in rushing one year, and I was second the next year, I  think. My junior year, I think, I made All Big Eight, and my senior year  I didn   t, or vice versa. I don   t know. I was like second team All Big  Eight one year.  Well, thinking back on your career, were there some special games that  stand out in your mind, special plays that you   d mention?  Well, probably the biggest game, we hadn   t beat OU in like thirty years,  and my senior year we beat them seventeen to sixteen in Norman. That  was a special game, and I don   t think I played that well in that game, but  at least we beat them. The game I remember most and the one that  people remind me of, we played Nebraska and they beat us, I think,  seventeen to fourteen. I got stopped on the last play of the game on the  two yard line or something, which was my fault for not scoring. That  was my senior year.  Nebraska  Coach  Bob  Devaney came out and  shook hands with me, and he said,    I   ll see you in a couple of months,     or something like that, because I played in the All American game and  he was the coach. Bob and I were friends from then on. I know, working  for US Tobacco, we did college rodeo, and I went to Nebraska one time,  and I went by and saw Coach Devaney. He took me out to eat and  showed me around the campus. What a great guy.  Walt, so to state the obvious, you weren   t blessed with great speed or  great size. (Laughter)  That   s to say the least, Gill. No, I couldn   t outrun Rusty Martin, and he  was a defensive tackle.  I just wanted to put that out there, but     It   s true.  You had a great career, and, of course, went on to the NFL. So, I mean,  this is a serious question. What do you attribute your success to? I mean,  looking at you, size and speed, you   d say,    This guy wouldn   t be All Big  Eight. He wouldn   t be NFL material.     12  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  True. (Laughs) I don   t know. I mean, running backs should, and I  always do, attribute whatever you do to the offensive line, but a lot of it  has to do with, I think, growing up not poor because I didn   t think we  were poor when I was growing up. We never had a lot, but I think  determination is   I wanted to do well, and I wanted to do well because  of my teammates. OSU didn   t have a winning record in the last I don   t  know how many years before I got here. I think Cutchin, by weeding out  the players that really didn   t want to stay, he brought us all closer  together. Winning doesn   t bring you closer together. Losing brings you  closer together because everybody else hates you. The guys I played  with, everybody else on campus hated us, I think, so, you had inner  strength of team. I think that   s what helped us win some games later on.  Were there some particular teammates that you remember playing with,  coaches, or some memories you have of stories you can tell?  Well, Rusty Martin, of course, we were friends, and we   re friends now.  He comes back to Oklahoma State games. But there are so many. Gosh   I played with John Ward. Leon Ward, his brother, was a great linebacker  and defensive end for us. Of course, he got killed in a boating accident,  fishing accident, drowned, and a great guy. Hugh McCrabb, another guy  and that   s an interesting story. See, Hugh McCrabb was an all-state  fullback and I was second team all-district honorable mention  linebacker. Then they moved McCrabb to nose tackle when Cutchin got  here, and he hated it. They moved me to fullback, which is what he  should have been playing, and he was a great running back. But he was  bigger than I was, so Cutchin moved him to nose tackle, and he was a  great nose tackle. But that   s not what he wanted to do. He moved me to  fullback, and that wasn   t what I wanted to do. But it turned out okay.  Well, I   d heard (this is a rumor) that he put the best guys on the  defensive side of the ball. Is that     That   s probably true. (Laughter) That   s why he probably moved me  from linebacker to fullback is to get me off of that side of the line.  Well, kind of switching subjects a little but still at OSU, just your student  experience, outside of football, what do you remember about OSU?  Well, I enjoyed going to school up here. Of course, I was in, like I said,  pre-vet, so I took a lot of animal courses, meats. Probably, the best thing  that I remember was genetics. I took genetics and advanced genetics,  and I loved it. I made an A both years. When you can take two animals  and figure out what the offspring   s going to be based on their genetics, I  don   t know, it gives you kind of a happy feeling. I enjoyed the western  13  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  side of Oklahoma State, which there   s a Big West in Oklahoma State,  thank goodness. I enjoyed going to the old Dairy Building there and  getting milk and donuts in the morning, or going over to the Animal  Husbandry Building, which is no longer there. I hated it when I came up  here and it was gone because that was my landmark. We had a lot of  classes in the Animal Husbandry Building, but I enjoyed the western  lifestyle of Oklahoma State. I wouldn   t have fit in at OU or Texas or  anywhere else, but I fit in at Oklahoma State.  Were you involved at all with rodeo?  Well, I didn   t rodeo here. Oklahoma State had a rodeo team, but I  couldn   t because of NCAA rules. In college rodeo, they win money, and  you couldn   t do both. So, I didn   t rodeo on the rodeo team until the  second semester of my senior year after my eligibility was up.  What about some of your favorite hangouts, on campus and off? Can  you share some of those?  Well, Deek   s, and that turned into Spav   s,  Jim  Spavital, one of the  coaches bought it after he retired and that was one hangout, just because  of Coach Spavital. Then the favorite one for the western side of  Oklahoma State, the rodeo, western type cowboys hung out at Millie   s,  which most people now know it as George   s Stables. I still call it  Millie   s because that   s what it was. It   s still just like it was. It   s a little  western bar, and that was a good place to hang out. Of course, I didn   t  drink beer then or anything. I just went down there and hung out with  the big guys.  Now, there   s a story that I remember about     I never rode a horse in Millie   s, okay? I   ve heard that story. People have  said,    Oh, yes, I remember you riding a horse in Millie   s     I didn   t have  a horse up here until my senior year. Me and Rusty rented a little place  out east of town that had a little roping arena on it. I never brought a  horse in town in my life, but I   ve heard that story over and over and  over, and it   s a lie. I never rode a horse in Millie   s. (Laughs)  We got it out pretty straight now. But I think there was a story about,  somebody did ride a horse into     I think a lot of people rode horses in there, but I wasn   t one of them.  All right.  Well, they used to have Western Week here. All the fraternities, the  14  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Sigma Nus and Sigma Chis, that one week, they all dressed up in  cowboy outfits and they had the big Frontier Ball, was that what it   s  called?  Sigma Nus?  Sigma Nu had the Frontier Ball, because Click was a cowboy for a  week. (Laughter)  That   s a stretch, isn   t it?  Jim Click. Let me get the whole name out there.  From Altus, Oklahoma.  Altus, Oklahoma.  Walt, you talked about some of the special things you had about OSU.  Were there some special memories you have of your time at OSU that  stand out more than others?  Most of it is athletic related. Like I said, beating OU. That was a big  milestone for Oklahoma State, and it was the last game I played here.  That is a very special meaning to me, but really, the guys I played with  are   just because all our occupations changed when you get out of here,  your friends don   t. The Jim Flurrys and Larry Elliotts and McCrabbs and  Rusty Martin and Leon Ward, and Charlie Harper, who was another guy  that went on to play for the New York Giants, they don   t change. I know  I   m missing a lot of guys that were very dear friends of mine, but the  people I met here at Oklahoma State, not only in athletics but around the  Farmhouse fraternity over there, these guys, most of them, came from  small ranches and small towns, and so we fit together.  They also had rodeo and vocational agriculture as a common bond so, it  was another group that I fit in with. I   ve got to mention one other thing,  too: Yojiro Uetake Obata, the little Japanese guy that won two gold  medals at two different Olympics. He hung out with me and Rusty and  the rodeo side of the campus, the western side of the campus, because he  liked it better than anything. He would go to Millie   s with us and stuff,  and what a great guy. When I was inducted into the Oklahoma State Hall  of Fame, he flew from Tokyo, Japan, to Stillwater to be here.  Is that right?  Yes.  15  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  You must   ve felt pretty special for that.  Oh, yes.  So in 1966, spring of    66, you were drafted by the Dallas Cowboys?  Yes.  And was it exciting for you, Walt, to be going back close to your  hometown and playing for Dallas?  Well, see, back then, Gill, they were still in the AFL, NFL. That was the  last year before the merger. I was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs and  drafted by the Dallas Cowboys. You probably never knew that.  Did not know, no.  But I was drafted like in the fifteenth or sixteenth round by Kansas City  and was drafted in the fifth round by Dallas, and it wasn   t even a choice.  I mean, if the money had been different, but it was about the same  money to go to Dallas or Kansas City, and Dallas was thirty miles from  home, so it was like going home.  I imagine your family was pretty excited.  They were, and my mom and dad never missed a football game at  Oklahoma State. They couldn   t afford to drive to Lincoln, Nebraska, or  Ames, Iowa, or anything. Daddy would get off work on Friday, Mother  would have the car packed, and they would head out. They   d drive all  night and get there in time for the game, and then after the game I   d get  to see them for about fifteen minutes after we showered and fixing to get  back on the bus to get on a plane to come back, and they   d turn around  and drive all day and all night to get back home.  So, they would go to all the away games as well? I mean, all of them?  Every game, every game. They never missed a game when I was in  college, so I   ve always appreciated that.  Wow. You were talking about the two offers being about the same. Do  you mind sharing what your initial salary and your bonus was?  Well, I talked to Kansas City briefly. They sent a guy down, and their  offer was about the same, but Dallas offered me a  15,000 signing  bonus. I said,    What the hell am I going to do with all this money?    My  first salary was  15,000 at Dallas, and again, I thought,    My God  I   m  16  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  rich     And they gave me a new Pontiac Grand Prix and a new inline  horse trailer, which people made a big deal out of that, about the horse  trailer being part of my signing bonus, but I asked them for it. I said,    I  want a Miley inline trailer.    They said,    What is an inline trailer?    It   s  where two horses are head to butt behind each other, and it   s a long  trailer, and I said,    I want one.    They said,    Okay, we   ll get you one.     So, they did, but people made a big deal. I got more print out of wanting  a horse trailer than anything else, but I   d never had a new horse trailer in  my life, so it was a big deal for me.  Did you trade your Pontiac in for a truck, eventually?  Well, that   s the only car I   ve ever had in my life is that 1965 Pontiac  Grand Prix. I kept it about six months and then I traded it off for a truck  because I don   t fit in a car. It   s not my personality.  See, I   m trying to imagine, too, a Pontiac pulling a trailer. (Laughs)  Yes.  It just doesn   t fit. So, you played, of course, under Tom Landry, a  legendary coach.  Great man.  What do you remember about Coach Landry?  Coach Landry was probably one of the smartest guys I ever met because  you think about all the things that he invented that are still prevalent in  pro football: the multiple-set offense, motion, divide, where they put  people in motion across the backfield and stuff. He invented the flex  defense.  Wow.  He put in the shotgun offense.  Really?  Oh, yes, because Eddie LeBaron, who was the original quarterback for  the Dallas Cowboys before  Don  Meredith got there, was like five   foot  eight, and he couldn   t see over the line, so Tom put him back five  yards and snapped the ball to him. Tom invented the shotgun offense,  too. (Laughter)  That was the reason for it, due to a short quarterback?  17  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  That was the reason for it.  That   s a great story. (Laughs)  But he was a great guy. One thing about Coach Landry is you were  graded on how you did in games. If you graded good, you continued  playing. If you graded bad, you knew that somebody else would take  your place, and that   s the way he ran the team. If you were good enough,  you got to play. If you weren   t, you didn   t. He was fair because he  would sit you down and talk to you about,    Walt, you need to do     You   re not doing this. You   re not doing this. This is okay, and this is  okay, and none of it   s great, but it   s all right, and you   re going to have to  improve here and here.    But he was a great guy and a very fair man. He  didn   t hold grudges. He was as honest and as fair as I   ve ever met  anybody.  Wasn   t he real strong in FCA?  A big Christian, FCA, Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He was an  honest man. He was one of the greatest people, probably three or four of  the great people I   ve met in my life, including John Wayne. Tom   s right  up there with the Duke.  That   s pretty strong.  That   s a big compliment right there. (Laughs)  It really is. Highlights, there sure are a lot of them in your career with  the Dallas Cowboys. Can you think of some special seasons, some  special games that you won?  Well, winning the Super Bowl, of course, was probably the highlight,  against the Miami Dolphins.  You   ve got your Super Bowl ring there?  Yes, yes, and I wear it. I don   t wear it all the time, but every time I come  to, like, Oklahoma State or a Dallas Cowboy event, I try to wear it  because if I don   t, people say,    Where   s your Super Bowl ring?    The  year before, I think probably the biggest game I remember playing in  was against San Francisco in the playoffs. The year before we won the  Super Bowl we beat San Francisco, and that meant that we were going  to the Super Bowl, finally. Dallas had been close. We   d been in the  playoffs.  18  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  They made the playoffs my rookie year, and I thought that was because  of me, but it was the first time they ever made the playoffs, and they  made it every year until my last year. We didn   t make the playoffs my  last year but made the playoffs for eight years in a row, and we got  beaten by San Francisco the year before to go to the Super Bowl. We  played San Francisco again, and we beat them, and so that was a big  milestone for Dallas because it was the first year they went to the Super  Bowl, even though we got beat sixteen to thirteen by Baltimore in the  Super Bowl in Miami. Then the next year, we played Miami in New  Orleans and beat them twenty-four to three, so we were finally the world  champions.  So, you played in two Super Bowls?  Two Super Bowls.  That   s a great feeling.  Two Super Bowls and two Pro Bowls. Pro Bowls were great. It was a  great honor. It was a bad game to play in because all you   re trying to do  is not get hurt. You don   t want to get hurt.  You   ve got to look like you   re trying, but you don   t want to     (Laughter)  Yes, well, they changed the rules a little bit. There   s no blitzing. There  are no cut blocks. It   s a different game. It   s an honor to get picked  because the coaches and the players in the league pick the Pro Bowl  and   well, they have some of the sports writers, too, but most of it is  based on the players you played against. You can   t vote for anybody for  the Pro Bowl if you hadn   t played against them, which makes it even  better.  Walt, what years did you play?  I played from    66 through    75. I played nine years.  Nine years. I understand an injury outside of football shortened your  career?  Well, I went to work for US Tobacco. I started doing commercials for  them in    71, the year we won the Super Bowl, and I worked for them in  the off season. We did College Rodeo, which was a special event that we  did, a promotional event we did. They got an idea. They said,    Hey,  Walt, you bulldog. Why don   t we have you bulldog against the regional  champ and have a match bulldogging at every rodeo you go to?    I  19  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  thought,    I   m there, and I bulldog, so it   s not a big deal.    So, at the  college finals in Bozeman, Montana, in    74, after the season, they  matched me against the guy that was ahead for the year in steer  wrestling.  I caught the steer and turned him a flip, and it hyperextended my knee  and tore a ligament. So, that is probably the greatest thing that ever  happened to me, Gill, because in football, as you know, you have skills  and they   re good, and then they start getting less and less and less. You  know where you need to be, but I was slow and this made me slower.  You can   t get to the holes as quick as you used to, and so I retired. US  Tobacco offered me a job when I retired, and we started a promotional  department which they didn   t have at the time, and I started doing  special events for them, and that lasted thirty-two years.  I want to come back and pick up there, but I want to ask you a quick  question. There are a lot of Pro Bowlers and some really outstanding  players. Are there guys that you remember especially?  Well, the Bob Lillys. Bob Lilly was a great guy and a great player.  Roger Staubach, I got to play with him for five years. Don Meredith,  who was probably one of the greatest Dallas Cowboy quarterbacks ever,  he just didn   t have the other elements of the team around him. He didn   t  have enough good players around him, but he was an excellent player.  Dan Reeves, who went on to be the coach of the New York Giants, the  Denver Broncos first, then the New York Giants and then the Atlanta  Falcons. He was my roommate for four years. Charlie Waters was my  roommate for four years. Lee Roy Jordan, who was an All American at  Alabama and All Pro, was my roommate for a year. Cliff Harris, who  came from Arkadelphia, Arkansas, as a free agent, was probably one of  the greatest free safeties in the league. Ralph Neely, who went to OU,  was an outstanding offensive tackle. John Niland was another one that  was drafted. He was the number one draft choice the year that I came in.  Chuck Howley was All Pro many times. The only player to be picked  for the MVP of the Super Bowl on the losing team was Chuck Howley  when Baltimore beat us, but I played with some great   Mel Renfro, he  was many times All Pro. I   m going back through stuff. Duane Thomas,  Calvin Hill.  Drew Pearson.  Drew Pearson. I played with Drew. I thought he was going to get killed  his rookie year because he   s a little ol    skinny thing, and I thought they  were going to break him in two, but he turned out to be a pretty good  receiver.  20  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Walt, what was it like to play for Dallas? That   s    America   s team,     especially then.  Yes, and what a stupid title. Green Bay is not in America? Or San  Francisco is not in America? I don   t know where they came up with that  title, but all the players hated that title because you always got some  ridicule from the fans when you were playing on the road. Dallas did a  great job of promoting, like all teams should. Tex Schramm started the  Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. He was an innovator. He started all kinds  of stuff, and one of them was the cheerleaders, and now every team has  cheerleaders. Back then, Dallas was the only one that had cheerleaders.  Dallas did a great job of promoting their image, and their image was a  nice-guy image. They kind of hid some of the outlaws we had, but they  didn   t have any real bad guys. They really promoted the clean image of  the Dallas Cowboys,    America   s Team,    which, like I said, I didn   t like  the title, but it kind of worked. And Dallas is still popular. Dallas is  popular. They sell more merchandise than, probably, just about any  other team in the league, even in losing seasons.  The organization has changed a little bit, though, with the change of  ownership.  It has changed quite a bit, and now they   ve got that big stadium down  there, and it   s a heck of a stadium. It   s not as good as the one we   ve got  here, but it   s close. (Laughter) It   s too big. It   s dang near too big, Gill,  I   m telling you. I mean, it   s huge. It holds 93,000 or something like that.  They   ve got the first Super Bowl in Dallas, and if Dallas were to make  the Super Bowl that would be the first time a Super Bowl team has ever  played in their own stadium.  Wow.  See, the two I played in we played in New Orleans and one in Miami.  So, really, no team has ever played on their home field, but Dallas has an  opportunity this year to do that.  You talked about after you left and the years working at US Tobacco  Company. Can you talk a little bit more about that? You probably  gained almost as much notoriety from your commercials     More. (Laughs)     as you did for your playing. Can you talk about that a little bit?  When they called me to do the commercial, NFL Films did a film called  21  Gill  Garrison  Gill  The Hunters, and it was on three pro football players that had weird off-season  occupations. Like Carl Eller with the Minnesota Vikings, he was  trying to be an actor, so they followed him around to acting schools and  stuff. Ben Davidson with the Oakland Raiders, big defensive guy with  the Oakland Raiders, he rode motorcycles. I don   t mean the jumping  kind, but he studied topography, and he   d get on his motorcycle in  California, and he   d drive to Maine and back and just toured on a  motorcycle. I rodeoed, and they came out to Mineral Wells, Texas,  where I was entered in a rodeo and filmed me bulldogging. They did  some interviews and stuff.  During the interview, I was dipping snuff, and they didn   t take it out or  anything because you could advertise at that time and it was acceptable  on TV. One of the guys with US Tobacco saw that film, and they said,     Hey, we   ve been looking for a guy to do commercials for us. We found  him.    So, they called Warwick, Welsh and Miller, which was the  advertising agency in New York City, and they said,    Talk to this guy.  We need to do a commercial.    They came down and talked to me and  offered me a lot of money to do a commercial, more than I was making  playing football.  So, I went to Tex Schramm, who was the general manager of the  Cowboys, and I said,    Tex,    I said,    I   ve got this deal to do a  commercial.    He said,    Walt, I don   t think you ought to do it. It   d be  bad for your image.    I called them back and I said,    I can   t do it. I don   t  want to do the commercial.    So, instead of getting somebody else to do  it, they waited a year and they called me back the next year and they  offered me more money. (Laughter) So, I went to Tex, and I said,    Tex,  let me tell you something. I can make more money doing one  commercial than I can playing in the Super Bowl, and my image you   re  worried about, y   all are the one that have created that. The rodeo, the  dipping snuff, the roping, riding horses,    I said,    that   s how y   all bill me  everywhere:    the Cowboys cowboy.       I said,    If there are no rules in the  book anywhere with the NFL, I   m going to do the commercial.    It   s one  of the greatest things I ever did because    just a pinch    became my  household word and        Just a pinch between your cheek and the gum.        Just a pinch between your cheek and your gum.    And people actually     see, football players, you don   t ever really see them. You see them, you  see a number, but you don   t ever see their face. For the first time, I was  on TV without a football helmet on. So, you   re right. It probably did  more for my popularity than whatever I could do on the football field.  Let me back up and ask you, though. So, you were rodeoing in the off  22  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  season?  Yes.  In this era you can   t do that. They   ve got contracts, but at that time, you  could do that?  Well, there were contracts then. Coach Landry talked to me. See, and  when I was a rookie, I was playing on a kamikaze squad. I was returning  punts and kickoffs and covering punts and kickoffs, and so Don Perkins,  one of the greatest fullbacks Dallas ever had   and if he hadn   t retired,  I   d still be sitting on the bench because he was unbelievable, but I knew  I wasn   t going to play unless the game was out of hand one way or the  other. The night before a game, we stayed at the Holiday Inn on Central  Expressway in Dallas, and we   d have a meeting, and then we   d have a  little, light supper, and then you were off until eleven o   clock, when the  curfew was. I would get this buddy, Bill Robinson, this buddy of mine,  to carry the horses to a little amateur rodeo over in Mansfield, and then I  would get up during the rodeo. I would drive after the meeting over to  the rodeo, bulldog, and then drive back by eleven o   clock. (Laughter)  That worked good for about three weeks, and then somebody called  Coach Landry and said,    Tom, we think that   s great. Y   all let Walt come  over here and bulldog the night before a football game,    and that was the  end of that. He called me in his office and said,    There won   t be any  more of that.    He said,    Walt, if you get hurt rodeoing, we don   t have to  pay you. There   s a clause in your contract about doing stuff outside of  football that   s dangerous, and we do think that   s dangerous.    I tried to  tell him that ignorance is what makes a sport dangerous. I said,    The  more you know about it, the less dangerous it becomes.    I said,    Tom,  I   ve been bulldogging since I was in high school. I wouldn   t ride a  motorcycle for anything in the world, but people that do think that   s one  of the safest sports in the world.    But he said,    I   m just telling you.    He  said,    I   m not telling you not to do it, but if you get hurt, we don   t have  to pay you.    So, I kept bulldogging. (Laughter)  In the off season did you bulldog pretty regularly?  Bulldogged all the time in off season.  Were there any other events other than bulldogging that you     Well, I started out, Gill, in high school I rode bareback horses and bulls.  Then I got too big. Even though I wasn   t real big, I got too big to ride  bulls because most good bull riders weight one hundred forty or one  hundred fifty pounds. Your upper body weight throws you off balance,  23  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  and so the littler you are the better it is, really. There have been a few  that were big and tall, but not many. I quit doing that, and I started  bulldogging. This buddy of mine, like I said, Bill Robinson, he  bulldogged and roped calves. We   d go to these high school rodeos, and  he   d say,    Get in the bulldogging.    I said,    I don   t know how.    He said,     It doesn   t matter,    because back then, they charged you like twenty  bucks. You could enter one event or six events, whatever you wanted to,  and it didn   t cost any more money. He said,    Hell, won   t cost anything.     So, then I started bulldogging some in high school and roping calves.  So, you   re talking about your friend, Bill Robinson. Is this in your home  town, there in Lewisville, when you were growing up?  I qualified for the Texas State High School Rodeo in the bareback riding  two years and I ran into him down there. He lived in Irving, which is  about fifteen miles south of Lewisville, and after the high school finals,  he said,    There   s a rodeo next week in Bryan, College Station High  School Rodeo. You want to go?    I said,    Yes,    and so we went and were  friends until he passed away twenty-seven years ago.  So, you started in high school?  Yes, we had a high school rodeo team in Lewisville High School. You  couldn   t win money. You won ribbons and trophies and buckles and  stuff like that, but yes.  I think we were talking off-mic earlier about how you got interested in  horses since you actually lived on the edge of town and didn   t live out on  a ranch or a farm. How did your     Well, I   ve always loved animals and I   ve always wanted to be a cowboy.  I mean, everybody wants to be a cowboy. I think there   s a song like that.  But my uncle had a farm outside of town and he had a couple horses,  and I   d go out there and ride. There   s one lady, a lady named Tommy  Nowlin, that lived about, I don   t know, half a mile from us, there in  Lewisville, and she had about a ten-acre ranch. She had ten acres and  had five or six horses, and she ran barrels at the rodeos. She hired me  when I was like, I don   t know, eight or nine years old to clean stalls. She  had, like, six stalls to clean and for cleaning stalls, she didn   t pay me.  She let me ride for an hour. She taught me the correct way to saddle, to  bridle, and what pieces of equipment did to a horse and why you used  them and stuff. She really taught me how to ride.  Nice.  You out of questions or is it getting boring, Gill? (Laughs)  24  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  No, what was coming to mind was your woodcarving. I think I said one  time    whittling,    and you corrected me. But seriously, you do a lot of  woodcarving. Can you talk about where that came from and a little bit  about your hobby?  Well, actually, the difference between a whittler and a woodcarver, a  woodcarver doesn   t have to tell you what it is when he gets done, and a  whittler does. In training camp when I was a rookie   and I missed most  of training camp when I was a rookie because I played in the All  American game, and the Senior Bowl. But the first year I was in camp, I  would get bored during the day. We had two workouts, morning and  afternoon, but you   d have about three or four hours in between there  where you go back and rest. I couldn   t sleep, so I   d be walking the halls  and stuff.  This friend of mine, Bill Robinson, that I rodeoed with, that summer  after football season was over, we went to a little old place, Harvey   s  Barbeque in Irving, Texas, and we went in there, and this guy had  whittlings everywhere  He had been whittling for, like, fifty years. He  had all kinds of whittlings, man  I thought,    Gosh  It   d be great if I  could learn to whittle a chain or a ball in a box or       I said,    Hey,  Brother Harve, how do you do this?    He said,    Nah,    he said,    You do  this.    He wouldn   t tell me anything. I kept going down there, and I   d sit  over there. He had a place in that barbeque building to whittle. He had a  bench sitting over there, and all these old timers came in there to whittle.  I got this whittling, and so finally he came over there and he said,     Come back here in the back. Let me show you something.    So, he went  back there and showed me how to cut out a chain, how to mark it off,  and how to start whittling.  When you say    cut off a chain,    can you explain what you   re talking  about?  Well, a chain links together, and it looked impossible to me when I  started, but there   s a correct way to block it out, or rough it out, where  you take off all the excess wood that you   re not going to use to start  with, draw out the chain links on there, and then start whittling it. I  asked him, I said,    Brother Harm, why didn   t you show me this a month  ago when I was in here?    He said,    Because if I showed everybody that  came in the door that thought they wanted to whittle how to whittle,    he  said,    I couldn   t cook barbeque. I wouldn   t have time.    He said,    You   re  going to whittle.    He taught me a lot, and of course then the next year  when I went to training camp, I had me a tackle box full of knives, and  that   s when you could carry a knife on an airplane. I carried a whole  tackle box full of them and checked a bunch of wood, a bunch of pieces  25  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  of wood to whittle on. So, I started whittling in training camp, and I still  whittle.  What are some of the things you do?  I   ve done some stuff for Oklahoma State. I did a cowboy limo, which is  a horse that looks like a weenie dog. It   s got four saddles on it or three  saddles on it. I do people. I do caricatures of not anybody in particular  but cowboys and horses, and I whittle chains and puzzles and all kinds  of stuff.  Texas Hold    Em boxes?  Texas Hold    Em. I   ve done some card boxes, but it gives me a lot of  pleasure. I donate a lot of stuff to Oklahoma State. I did a cowboy limo  that brought like  5,400, and then there   s another guy at the Brighter  Orange deal that said,    I   ll give  5,400 if you   ll whittle me one.    So, I  whittled him one. My stupid whittling helped raise a little over  10,000  at one of those deals, but I donate stuff at every Brighter Orange that  they ask me to.  And I know, Walt, you brought about  5,000 one year for a Texas Hold     Em box.  A card box, yes. I enjoy doing it, and I enjoy doing it for Oklahoma  State. I   ve got a bunch of stuff whittled at the house. Don   t tell the  Alumni Association, but I   ve got a bunch of stuff in reserve right now so  I won   t have to whittle it overnight. (Laughter)  That   s great. Now, you cite poetry occasionally, too.  Sometimes.  Tell me about that. Where did that come from?  Bill Robinson, this buddy of mine, we used to go to rodeos, and he had a  car and a trailer, and so I rode with him because I didn   t have a car or a  trailer or a horse and he did. We   d be driving, like, to Livingston, Texas,  which is down in east Texas, to a high school rodeo, and he started in  just reciting    The Cremation of Sam McGee,    which is a poem, and I  thought,    God dang, that   s neat     He knew a whole bunch of them. Then  I got interested in it, and then I got interested in cowboy poetry with  Baxter Black or Red Steagall, Waddie Mitchell, some of those guys that  are really, really good that write funny stuff. Then I started using the  poetry in some of the speeches I had. I would always keep one of those  things in the back of my mind because when speaking, sometimes you  26  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  draw a blank. You don   t know what else to say. I could always fill in,  and while I was doing the poem, I   d be thinking about what I need to say  next, so I just started doing them.  Now, have you got a favorite you could recite for us?  Sure. Baxter Black, I heard him do this one time, and then I called him  and had him send it to me, but it   s like people are funny critters. He said,     People are a lot like animals. The herding instincts of people are like  the herding instincts of animals.    And so he wrote this little short saying  about people being funny critters, and if you listen you   ll hear yourself  in here. This is an audience participation saying, so you have to be part  of it, Gill. When I say,    People are funny critters,    you say,    What do  you mean?     Okay.  That   s all you   ve got to remember:    What do you mean?    And every  time I say,    People are funny critters,    you say,    What do you mean?     And you   ll hear yourself in here. People are funny critters.  What do you mean?  Well, there are apple pie bakers,  and crooked book makers,  and blondes and brunetters,  and birthday forgetters,  and chicken fry lovers,  and blue eyed soul brothers,  and drinkers and boozers,  and winners and losers,  and elephant trainers,  and tireless campaigners,  and fixers and menders,  and paperclip benders,  and goers and stayers,  and pinochle players,  and handkerchief users,  and tissue abusers,  and interstate bikers,  and wilderness hikers,  and joggers and addicts,  and handball fanatics,  and kissers and tellers,  and friends with the fellers,  and lovers and fighters,  27  Gill  Garrison  Gill  and fingernail biters,  and mayonnaise dippers,  and Miracle Whippers,  and newspaper readers,  and drivers and speeders,  and overweight hookers,  and magazine lookers,  and people with answers,  and bottomless dancers,  and quivering flunkers,  and basketball dunkers,  and readers and thinkers,  and double scotch drinkers,  and soda straw manglers,  and barn napkin stranglers,  and teasers and criers,  and high-rolling flyers,  and uncles and sisters,  and passive resisters,  and virtuous girlies,  and sillies and squirlies,  and weirdos and sickies,  and five dollar quickies,  and xylophone pickers,  and popsicle lickers,  and yawners and nappers,  and one-handed cappers,  and zippy old-timers,  and lunatic rhymers.  People are funny critters.  What do you mean?  All right. You didn   t forget your line. That   s good. (Laughter) That   s  good.  Thanks, Walt. I appreciate that. That was great. We were talking about  your poetry, and I appreciate your reciting that. (Laughter) One thing I  want to share a little bit, I know you still have a strong bond with your  former teammates, and you   ve talked about it, with OSU. You   ve  mentioned some of the guys you stay in contact with, and now (I want to  say this if I can, frankly) a lot of former high-profile athletes really don   t  remember where they went to school. They kind of forget after they   ve  gone. Through the years, you   ve maintained a close working  relationship with OSU. You   ve helped us, as we indicated earlier,  particularly in the Dallas area, a lot of our events there. You   ve helped  28  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  the athletic department over the years with promos. You   re here this  weekend to help with the Alumni Association. My question is, why have  you been so loyal to OSU? Why has it been so important to you to stay  connected?  I wouldn   t be where I am today without Oklahoma State. People say,     Why did you go to Oklahoma State?    That   s the only school that  offered me a scholarship. When you   ve only got one to choose from, it  doesn   t take you long to make up your mind, but Oklahoma State gave  me an opportunity that nobody else would. I got to be friends with   University of Texas  Coach  Darrell  Royal, and I said,    Coach, didn   t  y   all look at films on me?    He said,    Yes.    He said,    You were a  linebacker in high school.    He said,    You weren   t worth a crap.    I said,     Okay.    (Laughs)  Oklahoma State took a chance on me, no matter what the reason. I think  they took a chance on me because they had to, but they gave me an  opportunity. Once I was up here, I don   t think I wanted to let Oklahoma  State down for taking a chance on me. Like I said, my beginning in  football actually started at Oklahoma State. My learning how to get  along with people, all kinds of people, at Oklahoma State was a great  attribute that I   ve used for the last forty or fifty years, and so I guess the  easiest way to say it is everything that I am today I owe to Oklahoma  State.  Appreciate that. Walt, you   ve seen the campus recently. Looking at it  again today, what do you think about all these building project  expansions? Has it changed a little bit? (Laughter)  Josh  Pulver  was bringing me over here, and I   m looking, saying,    I  don   t recognize any of this     because the one thing that I remember  about the campus of Oklahoma State was the way it was laid out. It was  so simple to get around. You looked for the library and got your  bearings off of it or the Student Union or Old Central, and you could  find your way around. It has grown, and that   s not a bad thing because  the good thing   the girl I   m dating, her daughter   s a senior up here, and  she started last year. She wasn   t even going to Oklahoma State. I mean,  she had a scholarship to the University of Hawaii, which I don   t ever  understand why she didn   t take that, but anyway, I said,    Have you  thought about going to Oklahoma State?    She said,    No,    because she   s  in communications. I said,    I heard they have a great communications  department up there, media communications.    So, she said,    Well, I   d  like to go up there.    She came up here, and she was just like I was.  When she got on campus, she was home. But it has changed a lot, Gill,  since we were up here. Theta Pond   s still there, thank goodness. They   ll  29  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  probably fill that in one day and build a building over it. (Laughs) It has  changed a lot, but it   s still a small-feeling campus. It   s not a small  campus anymore, but it   s got that small-town feel that people like me  appreciate coming from a small town. If you go to the University of  Texas, nothing against them, or Texas Tech   well, Texas Tech is kind  of hid out   or SMU  Southern Methodist University  or TCU  Texas  Christian University , they   re in big towns, and not that Stillwater is  small, but Austin doesn   t have a small-town feel. I never felt  comfortable there, and so I   m glad Coach Royal thought I was a bad  linebacker because I wouldn   t have fit in there. But here, I think  everybody fits in, whether you   re from a small town, a big town, a big  high school program, a small high  school program    everybody fits in.  There   s a niche here at Oklahoma State for everybody.  Walt, what do you think about the direction of the football program at  Oklahoma State?  Well, I love Mike Gundy. I think he   s a great man. I think he takes up  for his players, which I appreciated when he stood up for them, and I  think he   s a great coach. The stadium, of course   God bless Boone  Pickens. The stadium is a great asset in recruiting. Lewis Field was a  great asset in recruiting when I came up here because it was the biggest  thing I   d ever seen, but the stadium is state of the art. I   ve been to the  University of Texas. I   ve been to the one at Texas Tech. I   ve been to  SMU and TCU. This stadium, by far, is the greatest college football  stadium that I   ve ever been to. I   m not saying it   s the best in the United  States because I haven   t been to all of them, but it is the best one I   ve  ever been to.  They   ve got some special amenities under that West End Zone for the  players. They don   t eat at microwave dining halls. (Laughter)  They took me on a tour of the stadium and the coaching facility, the  coaching offices and everything, and the weight rooms and the dining  rooms and the suites, and I mean, it   s absolutely   the way they  positioned everything   Gallagher Hall is there at one end and, of  course, then the end zone, the rounded bowl at the other end. It   s just a  great stadium. It   s got a great feel to it. We would have loved to play  here, wouldn   t we?  Well, tell us a little bit about where are you living now and what are you  doing now.  I live in Argyle, Texas, which is about eleven miles northwest of  Lewisville, where I grew up, and about seven miles south of Denton,  Texas, and I   m unemployed. (Laughs) I retired December 31 from US  30  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Tobacco this last year.  And, Walt, you   d worked with them since     Since    71. I went to work for them part time in    71 and started work for  them full time in    75.  After you retired from the NFL.  Right, after I retired from my bulldogging accident with the Dallas  Cowboys. I was with them full time up until about eight years ago, and  then I was a consultant in their promotion and marketing department for  the other eight years I was with them, and then I retired there. So, I don   t  have a job, Gill. You need an assistant? I started a restaurant in  Lewisville. It   s called Walt Garrison   s, an odd name.  Well, where   s it located?  It   s a steak place in Lewisville. It   s in Parker Square, which is west of  Lewisville in a big shopping area. It has been fun getting back into  business, and I still whittle a lot, and I still rope. I   ve got thirty-two acres  outside of town there. I   ve got horses and roping steers, and we   ve got  hay.  You   ve got an arena there, I think, don   t you?  I   ve got an arena. I   ve got a lighted arena there and a barn and my house.  Now, you have some events there at your place, I understand, roping  and     We have a couple. Bill Robinson, the guy I talked about earlier that  passed away, we started the Bill Robinson Memorial Scholarship fund,  roping, and this   ll be our twenty-seventh year that we   ve done it. The  money goes for scholarships for college rodeo, which, that   s one thing I  wished Oklahoma State would get off their dead butts and do something  about because they   ve got no rodeo program here.  I talked to other schools, like Stephenville,  Texas  and I said,    How do  y   all give scholarships?    because I was asking Oklahoma State,    Why  don   t you give a scholarship?       Well, we can   t under NCAA rules and  stuff.    I said,    Well, how do these other schools do it, then? I mean,  Texas A M does it. Lincoln, Nebraska, does it. Nebraska University  does it. How do they do it if we can   t?    I don   t get a straight answer.  But why wouldn   t Oklahoma State Cowboys have a rodeo team and a  31  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  good one? When I rodeoed up here, we had a team, but we funded our  own stuff. The school didn   t help us a bit. I mean, if you went to a  rodeo, you paid your own way there, and you paid your own motel bill.  You paid your own entry fees, and what you won you got to keep. They  never had a coach. Most of these other schools have rodeo coaches just  like football coaches.  We just practiced. Like I said, Rusty and I had a little old arena outside  of town here where people would come out there and practice, but they  don   t have a coach. When I was here, they would take one of the  agriculture instructors, and once a month we   d have a meeting. So, a  different guy was there every time just to oversee the meeting which  they didn   t have anything to do with. I don   t know. It still puzzles me.  They   ve got the equestrian team, I guess, but they don   t     Equestrian team is great, and that   s what I asked  OSU President  Burns   Hargis . I said,    Burns, let me see here. Y   all don   t want to do anything  about rodeo. The last team to win a national title for Oklahoma State  was, let me guess, the girl   s rodeo team. Ah, isn   t that amazing?    And  the equestrian team is great, and I think they help the equestrian team,  but they don   t help the rodeo team. So, I don   t know. I   m done. I   ll get  off my soap box, Gill. (Laughs)  Now, you   re still participating competitively. Are you doing roping?  Did roping, team roping.  Team roping?  You don   t have to get off your horse with team roping. (Laughs)  Which one are you in the team?  I head. I heel some, but I head better. We   ve got that roping coming up  at the house, the last of September. We do it every year at the last of  September.  Is that your memorial that you do for Bill?  Yes. We raise money for scholarships, yes.  That   s great. Walt, you   re special to Oklahoma State University. You  truly are. A lot of our alumni still remember you, and you   re appreciated  for the things you did at Oklahoma State and the things you   ve done  since. I just want to leave you with this question, and it   s a serious  32  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  Garrison  Gill  question, Walt. How do you hope people remember Walt Garrison?  That   s a good question, Gill. I think I would like to be remembered not  as a football player, maybe as a guy that played football, but not as a  football player. I would hope that I would be remembered as a good  friend to my friends, a good friend to Oklahoma State, of course,  because I always will be. I think I would like to be remembered as a fair  and honest individual that believed in doing the right thing at the right  time.  I appreciate it. Walt, we covered a lot of things, and your stomach   s  probably growling, but have we left anything out, seriously, that you   d  like to talk about or mention that we haven   t brought up about OSU or  anything, as an opportunity to think of someone twenty years from now,  fifty years from now, with a chance to hear you on this recording?  No, Gill, if we didn   t cover it in all this so far, then we   re not going to  cover it now. (Laughter)  All right.  I appreciate Oklahoma State. I really do, and I meant what I said. I  wasn   t trying to sound gallant or anything, but everything that I have I  owe to Oklahoma State because that   s where it all started is right here.  I appreciate it.  -------  -------
