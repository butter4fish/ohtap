 Gill. Today is April 6, 2010. I   m visiting with Amy  Weeks on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Amy, I appreciate you  taking the time to visit with us today. I know you   ve got a lot going on.  Thank you very much Jerry.  First of all, if you don   t mind me complimenting you just a little bit, or  embarrassing you, but you   re very special to Oklahoma State University  intercollegiate athletics. You served as an outstanding student athlete  and a highly successful head coach and as Associate Athletic Director,  Senior Woman Administrator for the past six years. Is there anything  you haven   t done with the OSU athletic program?  Oh, there   s a lot that I haven   t done but     I thought maybe somewhere you might have swept the floors or some of  that as well.  If I need to, I certainly will, absolutely.  First of all, can we step back, though, and talk a little bit about your  early life, about where you grew up, about your family? Can you share  some information about that?  I grew up in Abilene, Texas. My dad is from Texas, born and raised. My  mother moved, was a military kid, born in California, grew up, spent  most of her childhood in California, and then her dad retired from the  navy in Fort Worth. She ended up graduating high school in Fort Worth,  and then had lived in Texas the rest of her time. Still lives there now.  Grew up in a family that did a lot of stuff together and was able to grow  5  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  up on a golf course, played a lot of golf with my father, and decided to  come to Oklahoma State University.  Amy, do you have any brothers and sisters?  I do. I have a little sister, Sara Jane Weeks-Dima. She lives in New York  City. She is highly accomplished at anything she does. She   s the smart  one of the two. She went to University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.  She also went to a private boarding school in Georgia on full scholarship  and then was able to have a better chance to get into an academic  institution that she felt suited her from that position. Went to Chapel  Hill. She graduated in three years. Worked for Southern Progress in the  magazine business for a little bit. Moved to New York City. Received a  culinary education. She worked as a general manager of a very well-established  restaurant for five years in New York and then decided to  quit the rat race of the food business. She joined her husband   s  production company, Dima Productions in New York City. They have a  child, Elizabeth, who   s seven months old now. They work their  production company and their business every day.  First of all, you grew up in     Abilene, Texas.  What did your dad do?  My dad is an attorney. He   s now a state district judge in the Forty-second  District court in Texas. His father before him was an attorney,  and they   re all graduates of the University of Texas. My mother   s a  graduate of the University of Texas. I guess being third generation, I was  the first person not to go to the University of Texas. I   m the oldest  grandchild on both sides of my family, and I was the first person not to  go there. My mother had three brothers. Two of them had degrees from  the University of Texas. My father had three brothers, and two of them  have degrees from the University of Texas. My grandfather went to the  University of Texas, and his sister, who   s still living and is ninety-six  years old, went to University of Texas and has a degree from there.  I want to get back to that story in a little bit. There   s got to be a good  story there. Your mother, did she work in the home or did she have an  occupation?  Yes, she has a degree, like I said, from the University of Texas. She  worked in the fashion industry when she first got out of school at  Sakowitz in Houston and then they moved to Lubbock when my dad  went to law school at Texas Tech. She worked at another, it was like a  6  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  fancy ladies    store there in Lubbock. I can   t think of it right off the top  of my head, but worked there for years as a buyer. Then, when my dad  moved into private practice in Abilene, she stayed at home with us, and  she sold some clothes out of the house. My parents divorced when I was  about eight years old. She worked in an office for a little bit after that,  and then started selling Mary Kay cosmetics. She sold Mary Kay  cosmetics, I   m thirty-five, so since I was about nine or ten, so at least  twenty-five years and  she  has driven a pink Cadillac almost every one  of those years. Does up to about a half million dollars in cosmetic  sales   every year out of her unit.  To get the pink Cadillac, you have to sell a lot of Mary Kay cosmetics?  You have to sell a lot of mascara. (Laughter)  That   s great. Growing up, Amy, were there some principles and values  that you learned from your family that influenced you later in your life  and influenced your success?  Yes, I think so. I mean, we grew up and were always expected to work,  but you were also expected to have a really good time and really enjoy  what you do. My father   s parents   very, very close to them, and they  were always right there with us, whatever we did and really encouraged  us and supported our athletic careers, our athletic endeavors. Our  academic endeavors were very important to them. They wanted us to  bring our report cards home. I think they instilled the expectation of  success in us. Everything was very out on the table. How did you do in  school today? What did you do in school today? There were no secrets. I  didn   t want to disappoint anybody, so there was a level of expectation of  success and then the pride that came with that. I think their positive  reinforcement really helped shape my sister and I both.  Thank you. Were there school and community activities that you  participated in, in addition to golf?  Oh, yes, sir.  Would you share some of the things you did growing up as a youth?  Sure, just about everything. (Laughter) I danced growing up, ballet and  tap. I   ve picked tap back up recently, which has been really, really fun. I  played soccer until I had to start making choices about competitive  sports. I played basketball well into high school. I threw the shot put in  track in the off season. I went to a 3A school in Texas, and so everybody  participated in everything. If you played basketball, you were required to  run cross country. If you played basketball, you were required to run  7  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  track in the off season to try to stay in shape. I played golf, so I tried to  do a little bit of both. I played tennis at the country club growing up. I  played golf, obviously, with my family growing up. We went to summer  camp every summer for three weeks. It was a sports camp, so we learned  how to water ski, we learned how to play badminton, I mean,  everything.  Now, as you mentioned, you were an outstanding golfer. Was it Wylie  High School?  Wylie High School.  In Abilene.  I don   t know how outstanding I was, but I did it.  As I recall, looking at your background, you won the medalist honors in  Class 3A your junior and senior year at the state tournaments.  And my sophomore year, I think I lost in a playoff. That stunk.  Oh, my goodness. You still remember that loss?  Yes, I still remember that.  You   re a pretty competitive person. You were talking about your dad  and golfing. Can you talk a little bit about your background in golf, how  you became interested in golf and some of your youth golf experiences?  My dad and his brothers all played golf. I was privileged when I was  about five. My parents built a brand new home on a golf course in  Abilene, Texas. It was called Fairway Oaks at the time. I think it   s  changed names recently. We were one of the first homes on the back  nine, and the house was on the   was it the twelfth green? Ten, eleven,  twelve. Sorry, I haven   t been there in a while. Yes, ten, eleven and  twelve   twelfth green, and so I grew up with, literally, a golf course in  my backyard. That golf course was started by some guys in the oil  business in the early    80s and late    70s in Texas, so they had a lot of  money, and they built a very nice golf course. Well, they brought in a lot  of big golf tournaments. They brought in big junior golf tournaments,  big amateur golf tournaments. They brought in a PGA  Professional  Golfers Association  tour event as well. From a very young age, I was  able to sit on a green and watch. I mean, anybody that played the game  in the early    80s watched them come through and play professional golf.  I literally was able to sit there and watch them. And they   d throw me  golf balls and give me visors and the whole deal. I think I was  8  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  influenced by that early on.  We did a lot of private housing at our home so when they had junior  events and amateur events, who knew that ten years later, I would be  doing the same thing. Going to people   s houses, staying in private  housing. So, we would house junior golfers from around the country in  our home, and you kind of got to know them a little bit, and it was very  inspiring. Then my father   s brother, Jimmy, who died when he was  about thirty-three, he was a professional golfer, a club pro, a PGA pro.  Didn   t play the tour, but ran a shop and played all through high school.  That was a strong influence on my family, as well. So, it was really kind  of a family thing. It was a family game, a family sport, something that  my dad did in every bit of his spare time, my grandfather did in his spare  time, and something we could do as a family. They never pushed me to  it because I was very motivated to play team sports at that time in my  life. I   d much rather go play soccer than go practice hitting golf balls,  but they certainly exposed me to the game. I had private lessons with  Charles Coody  1971 Masters    Tournament Champion . He gave me my  first golf lesson and I just kind of blossomed from there. It was  something that my dad and I spent time together doing.  When did you first start playing competitive golf?  Not really competitive until in middle school, but I mean, I certainly  dabbled in it, hit golf balls with my family or went out on the course. I  was very aware of the game and very in tune to the game from a very  early age. Probably about five.  You talked about some of the golfers there, Amy. Did you have some role  models, both men and women, on the tour that you followed?  I don   t really think role models. I never really followed them that  closely, but we   d watch them and you just knew that it   s a pretty cool  game. They would be around or come over for barbeques in the night.  They had a caddy program for local people that knew the golf course to  caddy for the pros, and so we got to know people in our family. It was  pretty interesting. I wouldn   t say that I remember any one icon being a  role model. To me, it was just more about the environment of the game  and the social aspects of it, and that was really special to me.  How well were golf and other women   s sports supported and promoted  in your school and in your community at that time?  Very well. Extremely well. It   s something I talk to, right now with my  friends here in Stillwater. I think that the high school where I grew up  even in the mid-   80s was better supported, in my opinion, with quality  9  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  coaching and organization then than it is today in Stillwater.  Was your high school coach influential?  Absolutely. No question. I mean, the golf part was kind of gravy. It was  just a football coach that helped us, so I wouldn   t call him    influential     really in my golf career, but certainly in attitude and work ethic, and  then my basketball coach was extremely, extremely influential.  And you played basketball up     Up until my junior year, yes. I finally had to start playing in golf  tournaments during the school year, and she didn   t think that was a very  good idea, to not practice basketball at that level, which made sense. I  understood, so I chose to play golf because I knew that it had a future for  me.  Speaking of that, Amy, when did you know that golf was your game?  That was where you were going to excel and try and play at the college  level?  Well, I think probably my sophomore year because I didn   t do very well  my freshman year in high school golf. I had some good rounds but not  anything outstanding. In my sophomore year, I spent a little bit more  time on it and practiced a little bit more in the summer, and then realized  the opportunities that I had ahead of me. I think things just started to  make sense, that this is something I can do that I   m so much better at  than my peers locally, and I   m starting to possibly compete at a state  level or a national level. I think the possibility of that success really  changed my mind. I didn   t jump high enough to really be a basketball  player. (Laughter)  Well, this would have been in the early 1990s when you were in high  school. Were college scholarships pretty standard or pretty available at  that time for women golfers?  Yes, yes they were.  I   d like to visit with you a little bit about that recruiting process. You  were recruited by, would have been then, Coach Ann Pitts?  Yes.  Do you remember much about the recruiting process? What do you  recall? How influential was Ann on your decision to come to Oklahoma  State? Now, I want to couple that question with why OSU and not  10  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Texas?  It   s easy. But no, the recruiting process   I gained some national  attention. I won a national junior golf tournament and was more  competitive in some other areas in the American Junior Golf Association  which is still very prominent in recruiting today. Actually, Ann recruited  me but also Bruce Heppler recruited me, who was an assistant coach for  the men   s team as well as the women   s team, and he was out doing  recruiting. He and I built a relationship as well. So, that was really  important to me. There was a young man that played for Mike Holder  named Jaxon Brigman from my high school. Jaxon played for Oklahoma  State. I think he played on two national championship teams for Coach.  There was kind of a tie with what we knew as familiar, and so that   s  when the Oklahoma State prospects really came up. It became a very  real prospect for me. I mean, they would come out no different than I did  when I was a coach and watch you play and show interest and  communicate and set up a visit to come up here and look around.  What was your perception of OSU   s program at that time?  They were ranked, I think, second in the country that fall when I signed  my letter of intent, so it was a really special opportunity. I think when  you couple that with the success that the men   s program had had and the  young man that I knew very well that was on the men   s team, it just  made a lot of sense for me and for our family.  Did it make sense to your family with all their Texas grads?  Yes, and that   s been one of the greatest things about my family is that  they   ve never once in the recruiting process   and I remember being at  my dad   s office and sending out letters to all the top twenty-five schools.  I remember getting a letter back from Stanford, and I was recruited by  Wake Forest, and I had some nice opportunities. I wouldn   t say that I  was actually recruited by Stanford, but I did get a letter back from them.  I remember doing all that, but my dad was just very much   he had told  both my sister and I,    You can go to school wherever you want to go to  school,    and he was going to pay for our undergraduate degrees whether  we had scholarships or not, and so if we got into   I don   t know how  much it costs to go to Harvard, but if we got into Harvard, then he would  pay for us to go there. And if we wanted to go to Stanford and go to  California, if I wanted to go to UCLA, if I was going to go to Texas  A M, he wouldn   t like it, but he would   ve supported me.  And it would   ve been tough, wouldn   t it? (Laughs)  Yes. Both my parents are extremely open-minded and extremely  11  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  supportive of the decision-making process, and I think that that just  compliments them and the way they raised us to make decisions.  Speaking of the scholarship, did you get a partial-aid scholarship?  Yes, I did. I did. The first two years, I was on partial. I had fifty percent,  and my junior and senior year I had a full scholarship.  Which, to put that in perspective, for incoming freshmen, regardless of  how good you are, it was almost impossible to get a full scholarship at  that time wasn   t it?  I think if you had been a little bit better than me, then it was certainly  possible. I certainly played with people that had full scholarships, but  that   s where they felt that I ranked in the pecking order. I think that that  was pretty accurate, actually.  So your scholarship probably was pretty fair?  Yes, I think it was very fair. Very fair.  How did that compare with, say, the men   s golf program? Were most of  those full scholarships, or were there some partials there as well?  No, I think almost all of those were partials, but men   s golf has fewer  scholarships to work with than women   s golf does. They actually had  more people on their team than we did. I think theirs were even  apportionments.  You entered OSU in the fall of    93?  Yes.  What were your first impressions of the campus and Stillwater?  I just felt like it was a really comfortable place. You could kind of be  yourself here, and it felt easy to get around and it felt a lot like home to  me. Obviously being from Abilene, Texas, it   s generally conservative  west Texas. It   s kind of a country kind of town. It   s 110,000 people, so  they like to think that they have a little bit of metropolitan, but really  there   s not that much there. I think that Stillwater suited me for a college  environment.  Now, you had an interesting major, if I recall: cultural and historical  geography. Can you tell me about that?  12  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Yes, I can. I had no idea what I wanted to do, and I think some days I  still don   t know what I want to do with my life. I   m just lucky to have a  great job that I try to work hard and do. College was very exciting for  me. I could study so many different things, and they make you take all  the basics, and I have a strong interest in social sciences. I always did  have a strong interest in social sciences and in history, and so when I  took my World Regional Geography class as a required humanity, I left  that class thinking,    Well, this is the greatest thing in the world. You get  to study the rest of the world, and it   s legitimate.    I just found it  extraordinarily fascinating, and I had been able as a child to travel  internationally. We had taken some family trips to other places in the  world, and I just thought,    It doesn   t get any better than this.     I remember my dad saying,    What are you going to do with that  degree?    and I thought,    Well, I don   t know, Dad. I can do research, or I  can travel, or I can teach.    I said,    I don   t know. All I know is that I love  to go to class and talk about the rest of the world and learn about the rest  of the world.    He said,    Well, okay. If that   s what you want to do.     Looking back, it probably wasn   t the smartest thing to study because it is  a very specialized area, studying demographics of human behavior and  different populations. It still excites me to think about it today and if I  decided that I   d leave athletics, then maybe I could go back and study a  little bit and try to get a job in that area.  Were there faculty members and staff who were influential in your  student development?  Actually, I think his name was George Carney.  George Carney?  He was a really good teacher and very outgoing, and he was very  heavily into the cultural side of studying human demographics and did a  lot of study with music and how different music regionalizes around the  United States. Then, also spent a lot of time with, I think it   s Dale  Lightfoot, who is still on campus. And then there was another guy that  did a Central America class that I really enjoyed. I can   t think of his  name off the top of my head, but then I think Michael Smith, also, out of  the History Department. I don   t know if he   s still on campus or not. He  did all of our Central and South American, Mexican histories, Hispanic  histories, early and it was very, very, very interesting to me. I really  enjoyed that.  Did you take the Geography of Sports class?  You know what   s funny is that I don   t know that I ever did. I think I was  13  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  kind of keeping sports at an arm   s length. At that time in my life I was  more interested in trying to go towards the historical side of that area,  but I do know Dr.  John  Rooney very well, and he   s been very  supportive of my career, and I   ve obviously talked to him. If I had  stayed in geography, I would   ve ended up in that area, obviously just  because of what I learned in athletics. It   s too good of a mix. Obviously  has a strong business with golf, and worked with Golf Digest on a big  demographic project. I have friends that were in graduate school at the  time that worked on that project, so I knew a little bit about it at the  time. I   d be remiss if I didn   t mention Bill Ivy as my advisor because he  was very supportive of my curiosity and of my interest in other areas. He  gave me a lot of confidence to study whatever was interesting.  Amy, with the demands on your time as a student athlete, were you able  to participate in student organizations or activities outside of golf, or  was that pretty much it?  That   s it. I did some stuff with geography, just within the department,  but no other student organizations. Just played golf and probably had too  much fun, and then tried to do well in the classroom.  Speaking of fun, aside from golf, which I hope was fun as well, but do  you have some favorite student memories of Oklahoma State University  outside of golf?  Yes, I don   t know if I can talk about them on camera, though. I don   t  know if I want them to be remembered in an oral history project.  (Laughter)  What would you be willing to share with us?  I had a lot of fun teammates, and we spent a lot of time clowning around  and doing silly stuff in our spare time. Frequent the Strip too often and  having a really good time. I remember sometimes when it would snow  occasionally we   d get the golf team together and we   d find a place to go  sledding or go on great adventures. I mean, we had fun. Nothing  specific, because it   s occasionally incriminating, but we had a really  good time.  Where did you live as a student athlete?  I lived in, Willham.  The one they tore down?  That   s right. Second floor. Lived there my freshman year, and then I  14  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  moved off campus.  Speaking of your lack of, probably, social life with golf, could you  describe a typical week of practice and preparation for the Cowgirl golf  team under Coach Pitts? What was it like? What was your schedule?  Could you walk us through a typical week?  Okay, for our strength and conditioning at the time, we would walk  stadium stairs. Ann was a big believer in lower-body strength and to try  to do interval training because it obviously matched very similar to  walking a golf course, and so we would do stadium stairs at 6:00 A.M.,  three times a week. We did that, and so for seven years, four as an  athlete and three as an assistant coach, I walked the stadium stairs three  times a week. I need to be doing that still, but I don   t, and that was  actually the first thing I changed when I became head coach. (Laughter)  Anyway, we walked stadium stairs 6:00 A.M., and then we did some  other weight training after that. Some upper body and some stretching.  We would have practice five or six days a week, or we would qualify  and play eighteen holes for a ranking position on the team. Easy from  two to six, twice a week, we would have short-game practice, or from  one to six, we would play eighteen holes twice a week. Then we would  often play and have qualifying on the weekend where we would go out,  play eighteen holes and then practice a little bit afterwards and then be  done.  Could you describe a little bit the strength and conditioning program,  particularly, that was just coming in, I guess, really for women athletes  and particularly in sports like golf where traditionally they didn   t do  that? Could you talk a little bit about some of the kinds of exercises you  did?  Back then when I was an athlete, they weren   t very specialized. Ann did  some research on her own and would try to put a program together for  us. We had a staff member here that kind of helped us, but not really.  When I was a coach, it was a much different, much more integrated  program. We had the new facility downstairs in Gallagher-Iba Arena,  and we had a lot more expertise and a few people putting their mind  together to get a performance plan for our athletes, so it   s much  different. When I was an athlete, I can   t really say that it was anything  special, but as time progressed, the three years that I was an assistant, we  spent more time integrating a more comprehensive flexibility program,  also, the core strength for your trunk when you turn, and trying to  increase the level of power and impact when you hit a golf ball.  When I was a head coach, it was a totally different deal. We had a  strength and conditioning coach downstairs that worked with us three to  15  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  four times a week, actually. We spent a lot of time on flexibility, a lot of  time on core balance, a lot of time on left/right brain integration, so  making sure you use the left side of your body as much as you do the  right. You want to be flexible in both ways, but you want to be flexible  both ways in your head, too, with the way your muscles react.  Moving to where you were as a coach and picking up from your  conversation, how many times a week and how many hours did you  spend in that kind of training?  When I was coaching?  Yes.  We would probably spend an hour and half, three to four times a week  depending on our schedule. You only are supposed to   and I say  supposed to because it   s very hard in golf to get only four hours a day of  training in. It takes four hours to play a round of golf and qualify, so we  would not have strength and conditioning on the days we would qualify.  We just had to arrange the schedule so that the athletes could work out,  go to class, go to practice, have time to study and try to have some  semblance of regular life, as well.  Was there a coach designated to work with you on those?  Yes, a strength and conditioning coach.  And what I hear you saying (this is sort of interesting) really, in just  about an eight-year span, that changed quite a bit in women   s golf.  Yes, dramatically. Yes, it did.  So strength and conditioning programs are very much a part of women   s  golf programs today?  Oh, absolutely. And for the young ladies to be able to build their  strength, the core conditioning, the coordination, the footwork that we  would integrate, I mean, people would watch our team work out and  they   d wonder what team it really was. But it   s very important for me as  a coach to raise the athleticism of the player, so that you get a total  package on the golf course and not just someone that can hit a golf ball  to a certain place. You need stamina, you need confidence, you need that  mental toughness that a tough strength and conditioning program can  bring out in someone. Just because someone can hit a golf ball down the  fairway at a reasonable length and can putt and chip doesn   t mean they  could spend eight hours on a golf course in a competitive setting and be  16  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  as sharp at the end of it as they were in the beginning. The thing about  college golf is that it takes the entire year, and you   re away from school  for five full days, and you have to be able to keep everything together.  You have to be able to travel, you have to be able to sleep and rest at a  hotel, you have to be able to have proper nutrition and hydration, and  you have to be able to perform on the golf course. The things that you  learn in the weight room, running a ladder drill, no different than a  soccer team was to me, translates very well into a golfer, into that  competitive edge. When I was coaching, my philosophy was to try to  really work on the things I knew I could control. If I could affect the  fitness level of our team, then I knew that I could beat more than half the  field almost every week.  I want to come back and pick that up. That   s interesting, and I want to  pick up on a little bit more of that, Amy. I appreciate you sharing that. I  wanted to ask you about Ann. In what ways did Coach Pitts contribute to  your development as a golfer?  Tremendously. I think with the four years that I was with her as an  athlete, I was still probably very much just like any eighteen-, nineteen-,  twenty-year-old. Thought I knew it all, and thought I had it all figured  out. I did not perform as well in my junior and senior year as I should  have, and that was very disappointing. I had a shoulder injury that  affected me a little bit that I did have to have surgery on, but during that  time, I think I also realized that I had a lot of growing up to do. I would  say that the more impactful years between she and I, when she was  really coaching me the most, were the three that I was an assistant coach.  We literally spent day in and day out together, and I was able to take my  experience as an athlete, compare it to what we were doing then in the  program as a coach, and then figure out a model of success going  forward. I think some of my shortcomings as an athlete helped me be a  much better coach. I used to tell my team (and Annie Young and I talked  about it last week and they used to laugh at me and think I was joking,  but I   m serious) is that I wouldn   t have been able to make my own golf  team. I would   ve kicked myself off, because I just didn   t have that extra  edge that I think is really, really, really imperative to be a top-five or a  number one team in the country. I learned a lot those three years as an  assistant coach from her.  What about facilities? Where did you work out, practice?  As an athlete or as a coach?  I   m not sure when you made the transition to Karsten  Creek , but first  of all as an athlete.  17  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Yes, well Karsten opened in 1995, and I was here then. It was still a very  young golf course, and so we played out there a little bit, not as much as  they do now, which is 100 percent almost out there now. But we played  a lot at Stillwater Country Club, and we were able to practice and play  out there, but then also, I don   t know if you remember or not, but on  Nineteenth and Sangre, there   s a corner lot there where there   s duplexes  now, across the street from the Conoco. There   s a ConocoPhillips right  there. There   s a brand new Stillwater National Bank there now. Well,  there was a man that owned that section of land named Dale Ringwald,  and the men   s and women   s golf teams practiced out there for years on  his land. He would mow the land, prepare it. He had flags set up all over  his acreage where we could go take our own golf balls and practice and  play. He and Mike  Holder  were long-time friends. He and Ann Pitts  were long-time friends. We had shag bags that we were given every year  full of golf balls. We were responsible, obviously, for hitting our golf  balls in practice, but for picking them up ourselves, as well. It   s a great  way to target practice, and it really gives you a lot of ownership in where  that golf ball goes because you treat it just like you do on the golf  course. There   s a whole other area   driving-range practice really  doesn   t mean anything. It   s when you have to be 100 percent responsible  for every single shot, just like you do when you play competitive, in  your practice that actually mirrors a better integrated approach.  So you play like you practice?  Right. That   s exactly right. Dale Ringwald was his name, and I don   t  think he   s still alive, and he was actually related to Molly Ringwald, the  actress. He lived there for years and years and had a home there on that  land. Had a water cooler out for us every day, and we practiced and  played on his land, men   s and women   s golf.  Amy, when you transferred to Karsten, did the women   s program have  full access to the facilities like the men did?  Not exactly at first, I   ll be 100 percent honest with you, but after a  period of time, then yes.  Possessive part of it wore off, and it changed a little bit?  Yes, absolutely.  Did you have your permanent locker room assignments there in  Karsten?  We didn   t have locker rooms there for years because there was no  clubhouse. Coach Holder built it where you paid with cash, and he  18  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  raised money and built the golf course, step by step. He raised the  money for the golf course, built the golf course. And then there was a  small parking lot with a double-wide trailer out there, and there was no  locker facility. There were bathroom facilities. And so we practiced and  played out of that for years. It wasn   t until I was a head coach, I don   t  think, that the clubhouse was built.  Where was the team locker room, so to speak? Where did you dress out  and keep your uniforms and equipment at that time?  There never was one until he built the big clubhouse at Karsten.  Each team player would just keep your equipment at your apartment?  Absolutely. There   s never been a locker room for women   s golf other  than what he built at Karsten Creek.  They do have now, though?  Yes. I wouldn   t think they   d keep their uniforms there though. They   d  just keep them in their closet because golf clothes are a little bit  different.  What do you remember about team travel and lodging?  (Laughs) That   s fun stuff. A lot of fun stuff. A lot of great trips all over  the country, both as a player and as a coach. I spent eleven years playing  or coaching with women   s golf here at OSU, and crazy, fun stuff all over  the place, whether it would be from driving or flying or   all over the  place. I mean, Jerry, that   s a whole other   that   s a very broad     Well, let   s take off with some of it, Amy. For example, how many  tournaments did you travel to  in  a year when you were a player?  You   d play twenty-eight dates a year and so you break that up into about  seven events. You played about four in the fall, four in the spring, plus  the post-season events.  Did you fly to most events?  Well, it was a mix of both. We   d go to Albuquerque and fly, or we   d  play at Prairie Dunes in Kansas and we   d drive.  Take a team bus? Is that how you usually went?  Yes. It was a van, like a fifteen-passenger van. The ones they don   t let us  19  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  drive anymore because they   re dangerous. (Laughter)  That   s great. What kind of lodging   I mean you weren   t staying at the  Taj Mahal, but then where were you staying?  Sometimes it felt like we did. I mean, with Ann, we always stayed at  very nice hotels. She always fed us really great. We went to really nice  restaurants and she would let us go to the mall and do some fun stuff or  when we went to San Jose   s tournament in California, we   d go to  Carmel and walk around downtown and get to absorb the culture and the  atmosphere and go to a dinner. Just a lot of mix of different stuff. Same  thing in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I remember when I was a player,  we   d always go down to Old Town and eat Mexican food one night and  really enjoy that and get a glimpse of what the local area was.  Was Ann pretty strict on what you ate or did you just pretty much eat  whatever you wanted to eat?  Yes, she kind of let us eat whatever we wanted to eat.  By that time she figured you were mature enough to know what you  could handle or not?  Yes. That was probably a mistake. (Laughter)  We   ve talked a little bit about the women   s program, kind of how it  intersected with the men   s program. What do you remember about the  relationship between Mike Holder and Ann Pitts? Was there a synergy  there? Did they work together well?  Yes. No. They weren   t best friends by any stretch of the imagination, but  I think that that was because of some outside factors and influences. I do  know that there was always probably an underlying mutual respect. I  wouldn   t say that that was a warm and fuzzy time for Ann. She was  going through her lawsuit for equal pay with the university. I think that  there were some hard feelings around the whole department regarding  that. But she never ever once let it affect the way she treated us, or she  never once said one negative word about anybody in the entire  department. She just tried to rise above it, do what she needed to do for  herself and for other coaches around the country and at OSU, and move  on down the road.  You had two outstanding programs, both nationally competitive  programs. Did the programs help each other?  The players hung out together all the time. The players were great  20  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  friends. The players practiced together at Dale Ringwald   s house all the  time, or played golf together on the weekends or whatever.  Did the success of one program help really influence the other one?  Yes, I think so. We were definitely overshadowed by the men. They  were winning. I don   t know what years they actually won national  championships when I was here, I think two out of the four, so  significantly better than what we did at the national level. But at the  same time, it definitely helped mold my mindset in the future of what we  needed to do as a program. It definitely, definitely affected me more,  looking back, than I realized what it did then.  In what ways did it impact how you coached and what you did?  I think the whole time when I was in college and when I was an assistant  coach, I paid attention to what the men were doing. I paid attention to  how Coach Holder approached things. We didn   t talk about it so much,  but I have pretty big ears, and I   m pretty observant. So, I would watch  some different methodology about the way they practice. I mean, just  picking up your own golf balls is something that just now other  programs have started to do, and that   s something that he did in his  program forty years ago. That was a huge thing. People used to make  fun of us that we had to pick up our own golf balls, like it was a negative  thing. Well, that   s like one of the greatest practice tools of the game.  There were just things like that, and then the mindset of that, and how to  translate that type of hard work into a positive as opposed to it becoming  a negative, because in recruiting that could quickly have become a  negative.    Oh, you have to pick up your own golf balls. That   s a terrible  place to go to school.    Time out. That   s one of the reasons you need to  come to school here is because of what that does for you as an athlete  and a golfer.  There are so many things that I picked up along the way   the discipline  that he instilled in his team. The way that he actually required   I mean,  it was a necessity that you manage your emotions properly on the golf  course, that you approach everything one shot at a time and really  effectively, or attempt to effectively manage your emotions and how you  react to things. He was much more verbal about that than Ann was. Ann  was a little bit more subtle in the way she approached things. I think  that   s just a form of their personality. Ann certainly believed in the exact  same things, but she was more subtle in her approach. It took her  probably more time to affect people   s personalities. He actually, I think,  required it a little more firmly. There   s a good and a bad to that. I think  you have to learn to blend both of those together to find how it   s going  to work with a player. I think that I gained that from both of them,  21  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  especially when I was an assistant coach. I was very much more attuned  to what was going on in the men   s program those three years just  because of office work and office proximity, listening and learning and  talking about things. Then knowing that I possibly had a chance to be  the head coach, I was kind of mentally preparing myself for that  possibility.  Before we get into your coaching, talking about your outstanding career  as a golfer, I know you played on three conference championship teams.  You were a medalist at the conference tournament. Which year was  that?  1995.  And so, you talked about you could   ve been a better player, but you had  some pretty outstanding credentials: All-Conference, Academic All-  American recognition. Can you share some special memories of your  collegiate golfing career that stand out, maybe ones you won, but other  things, special experiences, special times?  There was a few. I think my sophomore year was definitely my best  year. I had a career-low round at a very reputable tournament in  Albuquerque at the Dick McGuire  Tournament  against really good  competition and was able to play in the leader group that day. The  people that I played with that day are still playing on the LPGA  Ladies  Professional Golf Association  Tour. Then that year, I won the  conference championship. It was the Big 8. I   ll be perfectly honest with  you. The level of competition at the Big 8 in golf was not   I played  some good rounds. My sophomore year was very good. I practiced hard  my freshman year, and I really learned a new level of work ethic. There  was a senior on the team at the time that was very helpful to me as a role  model, and she would take me to practice.    This is what you need to  do,    and that kind of thing, and that was really, really, really good. My  sophomore year, I did pretty well, and then my junior year, kind of up  and down. Quite honestly, once I had achieved a fairly high level, I think  I thought it was just going to be kind of easy and I could just put it on  autopilot and practice at the level I was, and obviously that   s not how  you beat people in sports. If you   re not staying ahead of them, you   re  obviously going to be behind.  You also had some shoulder problems during your junior or senior  year?  Yes, I had an injury my junior year. My shoulder came out of socket  when I was hitting a golf ball. I had to have a rotator cuff surgery after  that, and I think it affected me mentally more than anything. I had to  22  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  make some choices at what level I was going to participate after that, but  I think it wasn   t because of my physical ability. It was really more  between my ears, and how committed I was to it at the time. But Ann  was very gracious and worked with me there. I mean, if you go back into  the record books and look at the numbers, I   m not even remotely as  good my junior and senior year. It was kind of a peaked career, I think,  and then kind of leveled off. And I   m just being 100 percent honest  about it, but I did play on some teams that did win, and that   s all well  and good, but I   d like to think that I contributed more after my four  years as an athlete as opposed to when I was really a player with what I  learned.  Who are some of the women that you played with?  Oh, wow. Lots. Played with Jennifer Bartley, who is also from Houston,  and we   re the same age. She   s really a very good player. Charlotta  Eliasson is a Swedish player who played. I played with Anna Lindblom,  another Swedish athlete. Nikki Gill. A girl named Arantxa Sison, who is  from Florida. There   s just a bunch. JoJo Robertson, who   s now the head  coach at Texas Tech for women   s golf, who was a two-time Public  Links amateur national champion. We played together. Eva-Charlotta  Stromlid from Sweden, we played together. So, there was a good group  of people at that time.  You mentioned one of the teammates, the older teammate, who kind of  took you under her wing. Who was it?  Charlotta Eliasson, and she was a full four years ahead of me in school,  but we were very good friends, spent a lot of time together. She really  helped me stay more focused and get out to the practice range and work  and do things.  During your years as a student athlete and assistant coach, OSU  transitioned from the Big 8, which you said earlier wasn   t maybe quite  as strong at that time, to the Big 12. How did that impact the team and  the OSU golf program?  I think it all of a sudden became more competitive in women   s golf,  because Texas was very competitive at that time in women   s golf. They  came in, and Kelli Kuehne was playing for them, and Heather Bowie -  Young , who both played the tour for some time. It was just like  instantaneous competition, and I think what was pretty easy for  Oklahoma State to win Big 8 championships and win conference  championships every year in women   s golf. Ann   s record in the  conference tournament was really superb. I think they won all but two or  something in her career. Maybe three. And so with the Big 12, obviously  23  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  it became harder with Baylor, Texas and Texas A M, trying to be  competitive, and they have been competitive, especially recently.  Did OSU have to elevate its game, so to speak?  Absolutely, no question, and I think it   s just a mental mindset of what  they had to do to win.  Did that bring more attention to the program, moving from Big 8 to the  Big 12?  Yes, I think so. I think it gives everybody a lot bigger place to hang their  hat. It   s good competition that moved in from the south, especially in all  of our sports.  When you completed your senior year, did you consider trying to make  the pro tour?  Not really. No. It really wasn   t something that I felt like I wanted to try  to do. I think my performance over my senior year affected that, but I  don   t think that I had the work ethic to be successful making a living  playing golf. It   s a very, very hard lifestyle and very, very hard to make  a living. You   ve got to work really, really hard. Just one of those things  that I felt like I would be better suited to try to give back to the game  here at Oklahoma State and help Ann Pitts in an assistance role.  Picking up on your comments, from 1997 to 2000, when you served as  staff member and assistant coach with Ann Pitts, how did that  opportunity come about and was it a difficult decision for you to make?  No, not at all. It was actually really easy. We had had an assistant coach  at the time for one year. It didn   t really work out. When she left, I  remember walking into Ann   s office and she and I talking about it. Ann  and I had a superb relationship. I was really growing up a lot at that time  and really thinking more about the consequences of my decisions, and  she said,    I don   t know what I   m going to do about getting an assistant  coach,    and I said,    Well, I think that we ought to talk about me being  your assistant coach,    and I said,    because we work really well together  and I think I could help you.    It was kind of like a light bulb turned on  for me, and I knew that I could help in that area.  Did you know you wanted to coach at that time?  No, not at all, but my choices were to continue in graduate school and  continue my education and try to proceed in the world of demographic  studies and in geography or cultural studies in geography, or try to test  24  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  this thing out in golf. I thought,    I know an awful lot about this game for  me to just not be a part of it anymore.    That opportunity came about,  and then she agreed to it a few months later.  Can you describe some of your responsibilities as a staff assistant coach  during this period?  Yes. I helped her run practice; I helped manage the team and coach them  during qualifying, trying to help them out on the golf course. I also  began doing a lot of recruiting and all the correspondence with the  recruiting. It was really, really a recruiting role at that time. I would go  out into national tournaments and travel and watch people play golf, and  just try to build relationships in different parts of the country and build  up our recruiting base and our communication.  What did you consider your recruiting base? Did you recruit nationally  or regionally?  Nationally.  Did you follow a lot of the summer amateur programs     Yes, sir. Absolutely.     and develop relationships with high school coaches?  Not really high school coaches as much as people in the golf business or  people that might know a player from a certain area of the country. But  really, in golf, it   s a little bit different. You don   t have as many middle  men, or AAU coaches. They really don   t exist. The high school coaches  don   t really participate in the golf world as much. It would be more of  the swing coaches, actually, people that are giving the actual golf  instruction. Just use Leadbetter as an example. They have a high school  that is an actual high school where people can go transfer there and  practice and play golf and go to school. So, that would be the best  example of something like that, building those relationships.  Did most of the outstanding players coming out of high school moving  into college come out of the amateur summer programs? Is that what  you   re saying?  Yes. It   s the same system that I grew up playing in, as well, so I was  very familiar with it.  You talked about learning and being a sponge earlier in our  conversation. How did being a staff member change your perspective on  25  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  golf and the OSU golf program?  It really gave me a stronger appreciation for what Ann and Mike, both,  and the assistants, Bruce Heppler at the time, had done over a period of  time. All the correspondence that comes in daily from recruits that you  owe a response back to. The phone calls that come in about camps, or  the phone calls that come in about    Can my kid come play there?    Even  the responsibilities back out into the community, or as a staff member of  the department, participating at whatever level they needed us to, being  out of the office more than half the day for practice, but yet getting your  work done that you needed to get done. Running a fundraiser every year,  communicating with donors, making sure that you are fulfilling the total  needs of the program.  Moving one step forward, how did you know and learn that Ann Pitts  would be stepping down, and did you, during that period   was it four  years that you worked as assistant coach?  Three.  Three years. Did you think then about maybe stepping in as head coach?  Had you and Ann had some conversations about that?  Yes, sir. The first year was kind of like a test. Like,    Okay, this is a fun  thing to do.    I didn   t hardly make any money at all but was technically a  full time staff member. Then the second year, they gave me a little bit  more money, I was doing a good job, and same requirements,  responsibilities. Well, that year, basically what we found out was that  because of Ann   s lawsuit, she had signed an agreement to where she  would have to retire in 2000. So, it was the athletic-director-at-the-time   s  discretion whether to enforce that settlement in the case or not.  You could probably just look that up on the disclosure of the settlement  in public record, I   m sure. Terry Don Phillips at that time chose not to  renew her contract or to extend it. And so with that, they   and I knew  probably twelve months before that that they really weren   t going to  renew it. I mean, it was kind of in her mind that they weren   t, and in my  head that I needed to start thinking,    Okay, is this really something I  want to do? Do I really want to go after that head coaching job?    So, the  third year that I was an assistant coach, I became much more involved in  the practice aspects, the daily scheduling, the recruiting. I didn   t do as  much on-course coaching. Ann still took all the reigns in that because  you could only designate one coach for the five players, which has  changed now. I pretty much ran everything else.  Amy, when it came time to apply for the position, you told me that you  had sort of prepared yourself in that last year to be coach. Can you tell  26  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  me about the process, how that evolved, and how you got the position?  They opened up the job, and I put in my formal application. There was a  search committee, and I remember meeting with Coach Holder, and  Marilyn Middlebrook was on the search committee and Ann Baer at the  time. I remember meeting with Terry Don Phillips and going through the  whole process. They were gracious, and I tried to treat it like I had just  met all of them and tried to put a fresh look to it. I think it was important  for me to establish myself as an independent candidate even though I  was an internal candidate and then just go from there. The process was  interesting. There were some issues that came up with some people  involved in the process that were interesting, but at the end of the day, I  ended up getting the job and moving on down the road.  I know this is asking you to be objective, but can you share why you felt  like you were the best candidate and got the position?  I think the other two candidates, one of them had never coached before,  and the other candidate was the assistant coach that had been fired from  working here, that had worked for Ann for a year, who Ann had asked to  leave, and it   s my understanding that there were no other national  candidates that they looked at. Now, I could be mistaken, Jerry.  Amazing. A program like Oklahoma State University   s didn   t attract a  larger candidate pool?  I don   t know. So, at the time, I really felt like I was the best qualified,  because I had three years of experience, being an assistant for Ann. I felt  like I could transition and elevate the program immediately. I had very  good relationships with most of the alumni, and I felt that I could carry  on the way Ann had interacted with them for years and had sustained  those relationships for years. I felt like I could do the same thing going  forward.  Before we talk about your role as coach, could we step back a minute  and talk about Ann just a little bit again?  Sure.  Talk about Ann   s contributions to women   s golf at Oklahoma State  University and nationally.  Nationally and at OSU is incredible. When you look at her body of work  over, I guess, starting in    78 or    77 when she did, all the way up into  2000, I mean, you   ve got twenty-two years of being the leader there of  young people and some of the great players she had. She had players  27  Gill  Weeks  that played the tour for twenty years and people that have gone on to do  fantastic things in the work force and in the country; was the national  coach of the year multiple times; won emeritus service awards multiple  times for contributions to the game; served on the women   s golf  committee multiple times; was part of the group that really started  keeping statistics about each player and being able to share those  statistics back and forth at the end of the year with stroke averages and  the rankings of teams. She was on an early committee to start that. I  haven   t thought about this stuff. I used to be a wizard at spitting this  stuff out about six years ago. Everything that moved women   s golf, and  collegiate golf, really, because the men were doing the same thing at the  same time. I mean, just some of the automated scoring. She was on the  cusp of all of that. Part of the rules changes.  When she first started, coaches couldn   t even go out on the golf course,  and then was part of the movement to get coaches out onto the golf  course where they could actually interact with their athletes. Before that,  they used to just sit in the clubhouse and play cards. Really interesting.  Dale McNamara was the coach at Tulsa, and Dale will tell you that Dale  started, like she had uniforms for the first time for her teams and Ann  was right there with her with that, and the national scheduling for  women   s golf. They would try to go out and play against the best teams  and raise money to go travel and to have golf balls for her team. Just so  many things that she was a pioneer in.  If you look at the success of women   s golf at Oklahoma State nationally  compared to other women   s sports, one of the reasons I think, up until  recently, it   s been superior at the national level, it   s because of her and  the influence and the involvement that she had with the coaches  association at a national level, with the NCAA with the golf committee  at the national level, and just being a pioneer for the sport collegiately.  Was there from the AIAW  Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for  Women  to when it transitioned to the NCAA. You can   t put a price.  That   s invaluable.  Why do you think she was so successful? What is it about her?  I don   t know if you recall a little bit ago, I talked about her ability to be  patient with people and find the right way to approach them, to address  an issue, more subtle. She had this ability to accept who you were and to  let you be yourself but still attempt to get more out of you than you  thought you could give. She was also very committed to making sure  that you were a well-rounded person off the golf course and that you  were growing between your ears as much as you were on the golf  course. That was really, really, really important. She   ll tell a good story  about how she had this great player on our team. She was on Weight  28  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Watchers, the player. She was trying to lose some weight. Ann drove  that athlete to a Weight Watchers meeting during competition, not  during the tournament, but after competition, so that she could stay in  her routine. I mean, just the extra things like that. I think most coaches  would say,    I   m sorry       Now, I   ll do that kind of stuff online, but in  the mid-   80s, that obviously didn   t exist. You had to go to the meeting.  She would help the player find the meeting and drive them to the  meeting on the road, and support those intricacies that I think in  women   s athletics are so prevalent. She had an ability to make  everybody think it was okay, but yet we were still here to take care of  business and to win tournaments.  Kind of synthesizing some of these things, what do you remember about  her most as a coach, as a person, what stands out in your mind?  There are so many things, Jerry. Ann has a funny, dry sense of humor.  The thing I remember about Ann most is that no matter what you  brought to her, she could handle it. She made you feel like it was the  most important thing in the world. She never discounted anything. Oh,  you know how when you   re a coach you hear the same problem thirty  years in a row. You can imagine how it is, times eight athletes, after  twenty-five years. But when I was a freshman, and I brought that exact  same problem that she had had 500 times, it was like the first time she   d  ever heard it. She had that ability to make you feel like you were the  most important thing at that one time. I mean, that   s just a really good  gift. She could also turn that off and go take care of herself, which I  think taught a lot of us that there   s more to life and athletics than just  what was going on on that golf course. She was still very committed to  her friends, and still very committed to having a good time, and still very  committed to being off the golf course by a certain time so you could go  home and have dinner and study, and giving balance. Very good at  coaching balance.  Great. Obviously, she influenced you. Can you talk about some ways  which she influenced your coaching philosophy?  Balance would be key, and the listening aspect. Understanding that  everybody   s going to bring something different to the table on your  team, and you have to teach them to accept their roles. You have to find  people that are going to accept their roles on the team, and getting  people together for something greater than just whatever their score was  that day, and for them to understand that for four years in college you   re  going to play this as a team sport, and it   s weird for golf. It   s weird. But  it was special. Very, very, very special. I mean, just philosophically, she  really helped me understand how to listen and how to be open-minded,  how to take advice from other people, how to try different theories and  29  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  continue to learn from other people and to try to apply that in your daily  coaching or on the golf course so you could get better.  In all the time that you spent together, as a player but certainly as an  assistant coach, did she ever visit with you about some of the issues and  challenges that she faced early on?  Oh, all the time. We talked about it all the time. She would talk about  not so much the things in the department, because I don   t think she  wanted to taint my view of the inequities that happen in women   s  athletics. It was really more about the opportunities, and that this was the  first time they got to do this, this was the first time they got to give each  player a dozen golf balls, whereas before it was three golf balls for the  whole tournament. This was the first time we got to get uniforms; this  was the first time we had enough money in the budget to travel to  California. Really, she really focused it more on opportunities and  change and cultural change, and how to stand up for what you believe in,  the importance of equal opportunity, than it was challenges. She didn   t  really take a negative approach to it. She took a positive approach to it,  and I know that was hard for her because let   s be honest, there was a lot  of negativity in the    80s with budgets and cutting sports, and it must   ve  been very, very hard to be around at that time.  Did she talk a little bit about promoting the women   s athletics program,  particularly golf, in the early days when they were merging the  programs into one, back in the    70s? Did she share some of her  challenges, she said maybe opportunities, in promoting women   s golf?  I think she looked at it as if it were her job to promote it, and it was her  job to get good players, and it was her job to be out in the community  and be around and available and to shake hands and kind of be the face  of the program. I don   t think, back then, coaches really looked for  somebody else to promote their team. I think they used their own team  to promote their own success. That   s my opinion on how she viewed it. I  don   t know if she   d say the same thing, but I think they took a lot of  personal responsibility in that.  Ann, as you alluded to earlier in our conversations, had some concerns  about equal treatment of the women   s golf program and women   s sports,  generally, but certainly women   s golf, and eventually led to her bringing  a lawsuit, as you indicated, against the university. I   m trying to recall.  Do you know which year that was?  I don   t know what year it was filed, no, sir.  Was it in the    80s?  30  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  It was in the    90s, actually.  Can you share some information about the suit, its origins and  outcomes?  What I recall is that it was a Title VII, equal pay act, equal work for  equal pay. Basically, her premise was is that she was the women   s golf  coach, and she made x-number of dollars, and the men   s golf coach was  making x-number of dollars for doing the exact same job, and I guess  there was a considerable disparity between those numbers. That went to  court, and there was a settlement. I think she won the decision and made  some money up for some of those years of inequitable pay, but then also  I think there were some, I wouldn   t say consequences so much, but in  the settlement, the way it worked, at the end, it pushed her retirement  date to kind of a line in the sand. Like I said earlier, I don   t ever  remember it being a cloud hanging over our program. I was an athlete  when it happened. I don   t ever remember her talking to us about it like it  was a big deal. It was her thing. It was her private thing, and she didn   t  really involve the student athlete in it at the time. I know now, from  working with her and working a little bit in the administration since  then, that I believe our women   s basketball coach received a  considerable raise because of it, as well as our softball coach. I don   t  know about other coaches at OSU, but I know that that affected the  disparity and pay significantly, and from what I understand, there was a  very, very, very disparate level of pay.  Did it impact Title IX issues at all, because you   re talking about salary,  but part of Ann   s issues were what resources were being put into  women   s sports, like women   s golf is put into men   s golf.  Not in her lawsuit, it was not, because those are two different laws, Title  IX and Title VII. So, pay and salary and equity of pay does not fall  under Title IX. Quality of coaching falls under Title IX, and access to  quality coaching falls under it, but not how much you   re paid.  ------- End of April 6, 2010 interview -------  My name is Jerry Gill. Today is April 7, 2010. I   m visiting with Amy  Weeks on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma and this interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. This is a follow-up to our  first interview, Amy, and I appreciate you taking the time for a second  time to visit with us. I just wanted to ask you if maybe we could recap a  couple of things from our earlier conversation. I   m trying to get a sense  of the status of the program when you applied and you first came in  2003. Maybe later we   ll talk about some things like changes under your  31  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  leadership. First of all, I want to get a sense again of the kind and  amount of travel  for the women   s golf program . You had a fall and a  spring season. About how many tournaments would you have each  season?  You would play approximately three or four tournaments in the fall and  three or four tournaments in the spring plus the post season. So the Big  XII or the Big 8 Championship, the regional qualifier and then if you  qualified for the national championship tournament.  You   d usually take off on a Thursday and then it   d be like a Thursday,  Friday and Saturday?  That   s right. We would travel on Wednesdays typically and have a  practice round on Thursday. You   d play Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Occasionally you   d travel on a Thursday and you   d play a 36-18  tournament where you   d play thirty-six holes in one day or sometimes  you played on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. It just depended on when  the golf course was available and what part of the country it was in.  Well, speaking of that, where were the tournaments held? What parts of  the country were you in?  Myself, as an athlete, it was all over the place.  Amy, we were talking about your travel situation and the tournaments  you were playing.  Right, and areas of the country. So we played all over the country. It  just depended; I mean sometimes we   d play in Kansas, in Texas, in New  Mexico, in California and Florida. Played at different university courses  around the country   sometimes in Georgia. It was different every year.  West coast and down south.  Yes. Sometimes we   d go to Las Vegas and play a tournament or we  played in UCLA   s tournament in California outside Palm Springs or we  played in San Jose   s tournament outside of Monterey. Played in  Stanford   s tournament on the Stanford University golf course. Played  the Betsy Rawls in Austin, Texas. Played at University of Florida   s golf  course. It just varied. Furman   s golf course, we went there when I was in  college.  How did it compare with the men   s program? Were they playing at  about the same number of tournaments, do you recall?  32  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Oh, yes. Everybody has the same amount of playing dates.  So the men and the women played around the same number of playing  dates and tournaments?  Yes. You played the same number of playing dates a year.  And you were laughing about traveling in fifteen-person vans, but you  did fly a lot to your distances, so the funding was there for travel and  proficiency.  Yes. We had a great travel schedule.  Super. Well, Amy, I want to come back to the point where you had a very  successful career as a student athlete and then you worked as a student  coach, but now Ann Pitts stepped down in 2000 and you   re the head  coach. Your first thought must have been,    Gee, I don   t know what the  heck to do with this.    When you first thought about that, did you feel a  little overwhelmed following a legend like Coach Pitts?  I don   t think it was being overwhelmed. I do remember, after I was an  assistant trying to make a decision, is this something I really want to do  and taking it obviously very seriously and very businesslike and  professionally and really trying to prepare myself for the travel and the  recruiting involved. I remember after I was named head coach thinking,     Wow, there   s no one else to blame if something goes wrong.     (Laughter) I did not have an assistant coach so it was just me. I  remember thinking everything is 100 percent my responsibility. The  players are my responsibility. Their performance is my responsibility.  The budget is my responsibility. Their health and wellness is obviously  somewhat my responsibility. Their fitness is my responsibility and I  remember thinking,    Wow, there   s no one else to blame. I can   t hide  behind anybody else and say,    Well, they   re partly to blame for this or  because this person didn   t x, y or z and that   s why that didn   t work.        But I think that that was actually really good for me.  Can you describe some of the things you did? What were some of your  activities as coach since you didn   t have an assistant coach? You must  have had a broader array of things.  You did everything. I mean from be there at every single workout to  obviously manage every single practice to correspond with every single  recruit to plan all the travel and all the hotels and all of the travel  expenses, all the uniforms, all the golf club and equipment management  with the contracts with manufacturers. All the team travel schedules for  the tournaments, all the entry fees and the correspondence for that. Then  33  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  the recruiting and the relationships on top of that, whether it be just  talking to be people that never had a chance to play here, but  communicating with them or actually actively recruiting players to come  to Oklahoma State and managing the roster.  Amy, how many hours a day were you working on this?  I just think it   s like any coach. You come into the office and I wasn   t  necessarily one that was here at 8 o   clock in the morning, I mean some  days I was, but we had workouts at 6 AM so you get up and you be at  the 6AM workout and you come home, shower, breakfast and come to  the office and you   re at the office until noon and you go to the golf  course and have lunch or wherever else and then you   re at the golf  course    til five or six every day.  And afterwards you   re writing letters to students.  I did most of that stuff in the mornings in my office hours.  Well, from your opinion, what was the status of the program when you  took over? Can you summarize what you thought were the strengths of  the program, as well as areas that you thought needed to be improved?  I think the program was definitely a top twenty program in the country  and we had some very good athletes individually. I remember Maria  Boden was a first team All American that I was about to coach as an  assistant coach and I think she was a senior that last year. I did not coach  her as a head coach, but she was a senior that last year I was an assistant  and she was very, very talented and really good. She went to the national  championship twice as an individual. So I was able to have that  experience at the national championship which really gave me some  time to reflect and think,    Okay, this is what we need to do to get our  team here. This is where our team needs to be,    when I was an assistant  coach. Some of the changes or some of the strengths that we had as a  team, I think that when we had a really good time, we had a great  schedule. We definitely were playing the competition in order to give  ourselves the chance to be the best. We just needed the chance to work  on   I think we needed to get some better recruits and increase our  athleticism on the team and just our work ethic, maybe tighten some  things up as far as   I wouldn   t say rules or discipline issues, but just  make sure that everybody understood the reason that they were there and  that they all needed to pull in one direction. Once we got a few different  recruits then things really picked up very quickly.  Did you set some goals for the program?  34  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Yes. Every year you sit down and go through what you want to do and  I   m not really a set   your-goals-and-put-them-on-a-piece-of-paper-and-put-  them-up-on-the-wall person. I think it   s kind of hokey for whatever  reason, I don   t know, but I mean it was obviously my job to get the most  out of our athletes. I felt that if I did the little things every single day to  make our team better, then we would be at the top of the leader board at  the end of the year. And then we would become a better team, attract a  higher quality recruit and then have a chance to win the national  championship and really that was what we talked about   winning the  Big XII and the national championship. It   s the one thing that the  women   s golf program has not done. They still haven   t won a national  championship and it was definitely the direction that I wanted to take  that team.  Amy, you were talking about Boden and as an individual playing in the  tournaments you have to qualify at the regional to go to nationals as a  team. How frequently was that happening before you became head  coach?  The individuals or the whole team?  The team.  I think they qualified almost every year. I know we qualified in either     93 or    94, my freshman year. I know we did not qualify in    95 because I  played in that regional, and I know we missed it by a few shots, which  was very disappointing. My junior year, I don   t know that we did, and  then my senior year I don   t know that they did either, quite honestly. We  may have qualified that first year as an assistant. I don   t know. I   d have  to look at the records, Jerry. I know Maria qualified for two or three out  of four years, and maybe we took a team one of those years. I   d have to  go back and look. It   s a little bit muddy in my head, but we definitely  need to get back to qualifying every single year, and I think since that  first year that I was head coach they have qualified for the national  championship every year.  And how many teams qualify for the national tournament?  Twenty-four.  Okay, thank you. In your mind, what were some of the challenges that  you faced as a first time head coach?  I can   t say that I remember being challenged by anything. There were  some athletes on the team that really didn   t belong there that I had  inherited and so I tried to place them at other universities or see if they  35  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  really wanted to continue to play golf and we tightened up the roster a  little bit and got it down to a manageable number for me with people  that were more competitive. That was a challenge. And then also just  attracting a higher quality, higher caliber athlete to compete. It was  really about getting out there and talking to parents and young people  about Oklahoma State University and what we had to offer and what  Karsten Creek had to offer and the practice facility and the perks that go  along with that, the environment of practicing and playing golf with  some of the best men   s golfers in the country, using that as a catalyst.  So to kind of summarize, Amy, your expectations of those, or however  you want to phrase it, were to qualify at the nationals every year. To  compete at the national championship and to do that, one of your key  goals was to strengthen your quality.  Right, we had to recruit better players and the way I looked at it, quite  honestly, was that I needed better players than I ever was when I was in  college. Because we needed to do better. Well, it   s pretty obvious that if  I played on a team that had x amount of results and we need to step up,  well then it   s pretty easy to judge, well if I   m good at this then I need to  get somebody twice as good. I know it   s kind of elementary, but we just  need to get better players.  Will you talk a little bit about your strategy on recruiting?  It was be present at every major junior golf tournament. To wear orange,  to wear the OSU brand, just to outwork other coaches. Just recruiting  parents and building relationships and really selling the program and the  brand of the women   s program and the history that we had had.  Did you visit with a lot of parents in the summer programs? Did you talk  to the parents?  You can talk to parents at certain times and so yes, building a lot of  relationships.  How did you, I mean, it   s probably to you a very simple question, but  how did you identify those student athletes that you wanted to recruit?  First of all you go regional and say,    Who are the best players out of this  region that may have an affinity for Oklahoma State or may be  comfortable here?    You try that route. And then you say,    Okay, who   s  in Texas and who might want to come to Oklahoma State from Texas?     And you say,    Well who   s here in California?    I   ve recruited kids from  all over the country. You have a connection through a swing coach and  they say,    Well I know so and so and they say you   re really good.    You  36  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  go watch them and see if they fit your program. It   s not science, that   s  for sure. It   s more get out and work and go through the players and see  whose personality might fit yours as a coach. See whose personalities or  where they come from with their families might fit Stillwater. Just kind  of go from there and build people that would stay and stay four years  and participate and want to graduate.  Did OSU have a pretty good reputation at that time?  Absolutely, but we had slipped in the late    90s as far as not going to  national tournaments. That   s something that I tried to really affect when  I was recruiting as an assistant coach is try to get out and be visible and  try to change that look. We had a lot of international athletes during that  time and sometimes that   s great, but sometimes you don   t have people  from the United States, people don   t talk about OSU as much. We had  Swedish athletes primarily, so in Sweden we had a great reputation but  we need to have a great reputation in Texas. So just changing that  environment.  Did you feel that you had the support of the athletic administration?  Absolutely.  And sufficient resources to achieve your goals of being nationally  competitive?  Absolutely I did. I think that comes from golf being a long time sport  here at in the department. Our budget had grown over the years and so it  was very sufficient. And I tell you, really the blessing for golf was the  relationship that we had with Karsten Manufacturing, with PING Golf  Clubs, with other manufactures such as Titleist and Foot Joy. Just the  product that they were able to sponsor us with helped tremendously.  Being a part of the bag program with PING and Karsten Manufacturing  was huge. They gave us travel bags and golf bags. There were things  you could supplement out of your budget that I never would have been  able to afford if we   d only had to use our equipment budget.  You mentioned budget, do you recall when you started what the budget  was?  I could not even get close to tell you. I just managed it year by year. I  don   t know what that total number is in my head.  (Laughs) It just worked out somehow.  Right. It   s something I really couldn   t control so I didn   t worry about it.  37  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  I just managed the resources with what we had and moved on down the  road.  What was the salary of the head coach at that time?  I think when I was hired I made like  42,000 and then I think the last  years that I coached I made like  50-something.  Was that comparable with other Big XII  coaches ?  I think it was a little lower, actually.  Can you describe a little bit about your coaching philosophy? You  touched on aspects of it a little bit how you approached coaching.  Well, approached coaching, that   s pretty broad. I don   t know, I guess,  Jerry, I wanted to provide an environment where young people had a lot  of fun. They wanted to go to the golf course every day and practice  every day. They were proud to play for Oklahoma State. They were  proud of their teammates and the other people that they competed with,  which I felt gave them more sense of responsibility because golf is an  individual sport. It   s a little bit different when you play it as a team. So I  felt if they like each other and they care about each other then they   re  probably going to do better for each other out on the golf course. And  we just tried to play at the game with a lot of respect and pride and win  and beat people.  Just beat people. That sounds good. I was interviewing an individual  and Coach Gallagher was his coach in wrestling. I asked,    What  philosophy did he give you?    And he said,    Go out there and pin 'em.     Yes.  (Laughs) That kind of sounds like your philosophy.  But I think that there is a strong   whoever is leading your group, if you  really focus your attention on certain areas then people tend to follow  and they   ll kind of emulate whatever everybody else is talking about.  Amy, how did you set up your week of practice? You were talking about  your morning workouts. Could you kind of go through a week and your  techniques?  We   d always take one day off a week, so either Sunday or Monday  usually, typically based on travel. Sometimes our off day was our travel  day. So for instance, Wednesday was our day off and we   d play a  38  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  tournament Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday back in the gym.  Sometimes I   d give them Monday off depending on how late we got in  on Sunday night, but we were back at the golf course on Monday  afternoon. Occasionally we   d have to deal with test schedules and  sometimes you need a day of the week while you   re in college just to  take care of your bills or go grocery shopping or get your oil changed in  your car or whatever it is. I just tried to work out individual times with  the team and we   d talk about it as a group, what the week schedule  looked like and get it out ahead of time. Pretty much your travel  schedule is set before the year begins so you can kind of get that onto the  calendar. Then you can work your qualifying days to get your top five or  top four chosen after that and then you can set up your other open days  to have open practice or short game practice and go to a different golf  course and play.  What about your morning work outs? Were they at 6:30?  Six AM.  Six AM, wow. That had to be exciting for the players. (Laughs)  Yes, they didn   t like it, but I hated it more, so.  And what did you do in those work outs?  Gary Calcagno was our strength coach when I was the head coach and  he still works here at OSU in the strength and conditioning program.  Every year he and I would sit down and look at the athletes we had and  kind of figure out where we needed to go with them. He would go and  run them through a warm up. He would run them through a stretching  routine which was critical for flexibility. He would do a tremendous  amount of core strengthening with them and ab work. He would run  them through a lift circuit of upper and lower body workouts. We did a  lot of agility ladder exercises and they did some, really a lot of, core  strengthening so left-right integration. We would get on these foam  rollers and they   d lay on these foam rollers which make you balance  your body on it and you   d lift your legs and your arms together in  different areas to use your body weight to help you strengthen your core.  To really help with your muscles when you turn and increase power and  stuff like that.  Was that different from when you played in earlier  years ?  Yes, very different.  So the strength and conditioning during the season and off-season  39  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  program were     We did not have an off-season program when I was an athlete. Ann may  have said she encouraged us to exercise, but we didn   t have anything  written down and then also, like I said yesterday, we walked the stadium  stairs. She was big on lower body strength and it was effective. It was  very good for your cardiovascular part when you   re walking on the golf  course. I didn   t do a lot of running with the team. They could do some  individual cardio and some of them like to run and some of them liked to  get on the stair master, and some of them liked to do the elliptical. We  did not have a lot of machines at that time when I was coaching  downstairs. We have a lot more now. I probably would do it a little  differently now if I had to do it all over again. And it would have been a  lot more fun. We   d have more equipment to use.  We talked about the off-season   I guess the off-season for some wasn   t  off in a sense in the summer because I picture you would play in the fall  and spring. During the year there   s really no, what you call an off-season.  That   s correct.  But there   d be the summer season. A lot of your golfers were competing,  I guess, but did you prescribe an off-season program for them in  addition to golfing?  Yes, we obviously encouraged them to stay fit. Gary would give them a  take home  workout routine  for the summer, but quite honestly, they  played so much golf in the summer, that was about their only really  recovery time and they were traveling and playing in national golf  tournaments and regional and the country. And some of them around the  world, I mean the international athletes were playing in different  countries around the world, so they were playing golf basically all year  round.  Interesting. Are there any particular personal attributes that you  consider your strength? If someone said,    Amy, what is a coach?    Kind  of be objective and step outside the  box , what would you say your  strengths were as a coach?  I don   t know. I   d like to think that I was generally a pretty good decision  maker. Good or bad. I kind of enjoy the decision making process and  analyze the problem in trying to get to the end result and so I think I was  pretty good at picking maybe the right decision. I tried to be very  supportive of women   s golf when I was a coach. I wanted those athletes  to know that that was the most important thing to me and tried to show  40  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  them with my time and effort that that was the most important thing in  my life. I tried to actually have a good time when I was a coach, too. I  enjoyed taking them to nice restaurants and nice places to see parts of  the country, so that we had a good time when we traveled.  Speaking of, just interjecting, you mentioned earlier that you stayed in  quality places.  Yes.  Traveling was some good quality and good time and good facilities.  Absolutely. Great. Actually I get a little fired up about stuff, especially  when I watch sports now, people say,    How were you ever a golf  coach?    It   s a little bit different when you   re doing that and you   re in  that environment. I was able to just calm down and just take whatever  was happening right there in that moment and try to address that one  situation or that one shot with an athlete and not overinflate it to  something bigger. There may have been a lot of things going on in my  head, but I hope that that player didn   t think so. It was that one shot and  that was all that we needed to worry about at that time.  Obviously from your conversation, you had to be a pretty good recruiter.  I think communication and relationships and selling a program   I think  I was good at that, yes.  So you   re good at the selling part and the promoting. Sounds like a good  package then. (Laughs)  I don   t know if it worked, but we did okay for four years.  You had some pretty amazing years, coaching for four years you had  pretty good results in the program. I want to summarize some of these  and ask you to help me out on what I miss.  I won   t remember. I   ll have to look at a media guide, Jerry.  I think there were three Big XII championships out of the four years and  a runner up that fourth year and it was capped by a second place finish  in the 2004 NCAA tournament. Runner up was the highest we had ever  had in our program ever. Didn   t quite get the national championship,  but second place.  Two shots. Two shots. We lost by two shots.  41  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Who   d you lose to?  UCLA.  UCLA. Gosh darn it. You won several other major tournaments across  the country. Can you share some special highlights   winning, yes, but  just the events? Individual things that stand out in your mind, special  memories you had?  I was head coach for four years and we finished in the top five at the  national championship three of those four years and I think honestly  when it really first got started was that very first year. I didn   t have a  very deep team. I had four players and then I   d ask a walk on   well I  had a walk on on the team, Julie Jacques. And she had been participating  for about three years and she was a good golfer. She wasn   t a great  player  but a  great, great young lady. Basically we could have played  just about any of our other players in that fifth spot and probably would  have all worked out the same. That   s my instinct, I don   t know, maybe  I   m wrong. Somebody could have done who knows what, right? But  Julie, I did a sudden death playoff for qualifying and it was hole by hole  and whoever stayed in the longest was going to go to the rest of the  season tournaments. Maybe that was a good idea and maybe that was a  bad idea, I don   t know, but it just seemed the thing to do at the time. But  Julie qualified and she played with us at the Big XII and the regional and  the national championship. I   d have to look back at the scores to see  what her score counted and I don   t know exactly where the regional was  played that year. I   d have to look that up as well, but the Big XII was  played at Iowa State and the weather was really, really bad, but we  counted her score one of those rounds which helped us win.  Then, at the regional, I don   t know where we qualified, but we did  qualify, which was a huge accomplishment. I don   t know if her score  contributed then or not, but then at the national championship we went  to Florida and we were playing a golf course, I don   t know, somewhere  outside of Jacksonville or something. I   d have to look. And one of our  very best players, Linda Wessberg, who plays the LPGA and European  LPGA still today, very good player, she began to get heat exhaustion.  The national championship is a four day event. So we had been out there  for two practice rounds, six days. This was the sixth day of golf. It was  100  humidity. Very, very hot in Florida. It was at the mid of May and  it was abnormally hot, and she began to get heat exhaustion. And Julie     her score just started hanging around, around a few over par and just  kept staying right there at a few over par and then she   d make a bogie  and then she   d make a birdie and then she   d make a par. I just kept  thinking,    Wow, we   re going to count her score today.    And Linda,  basically   she didn   t quit. I mean she kept playing, but I think she shot  42  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  like an eighty-something. I think Julie shot like a seventy-seven or  something like that, and we counted that score and it kept us in fifth  place.  Wow.  That was a huge turning point, I think, for me as a coach and for our  program for us to have adversity, have what I considered to be a shallow  roster and for her to come in and contribute and for us to finish fifth at  the national championship. We played in the leader group the last day.  We   d have to go look back at the pairings. We played in the leader  group two of those four rounds. And for me to gain that experience, I  remember calling Coach Holder when I was at that event saying,    Hey,  you got any tips for me?    I think he said something like stay out of their  way or something like that. (Laughter) But it was very exciting and we  were in contention and in the top three and in the top four and in the  leader group pairings throughout that week. It was exciting and I  remember that feeling and I remember thinking,    This is exactly what  it   s supposed to be like. And this is what we   re supposed to do.    After  that it became trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together to do. I   ve  told that story a few times to a few people because it just seemed to  really shift the expectation of the women   s program. I had some young  players on the team that year and they kind of understood, this is what  we   re supposed to do and now this is what we have to do to get there  and to get better.  How did runner-up year feel in 2004?  2004. Well, it didn   t feel very good, to be quite honest. (Laughter)  Can you share a little bit about your highlights of that tournament?  That was a tough year, but we had a great team, probably, if not the best  team we   ve ever had here, as far as I think. I would have traded maybe a  few athletes, but it was an interesting year. I had three freshmen on the  team. One of them was a redshirt freshman and two of them were true  freshman and I don   t think we had a senior on the team. Karin Sjodin  played very well and Annie Young played very well and then I had  Candy Herrera from California who was kind of an up and down player  and then two young freshmen from Texas, Mallory Underwood and  Ashley Knoll. Ashley Knoll ended up transferring to Texas A M, but it  was an interesting group and it was just a great week of golf and for  some reason things just kind of clicked. The funny thing about that  whole month before is that in April we had not won the Big XII, which  was very disappointing.  43  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  First time in your career.  Yes. It was rained out. Basically the last day was rained out. So I really  have a bitter taste in my mouth.  How many strokes were you off at that time?  It was a few. I felt like in the third round, which was thrown out, we  were coming back and if we had gathered up all of the score cards and  looked at it we might have even been ahead. But anyway, that was hard  to swallow and I didn   t like that very much. Then, we went to regionals  and we qualified for the national championship in a playoff against the  University of Florida. Ironically on the same golf course, we played that  national championship that first year as head coach and we won on the  very first hole, which was good that it didn   t have to go more. And we  beat Florida in a sudden death playoff with all five players from both  teams and then we went to the national championship and never looked  back. We played great golf at Auburn that year and it was a lot of fun.  We had a lot of rain delays that week, too, at Auburn. A lot of on and off  the golf course.  What was the stroke up or down going in the final round?  I don   t remember.  You just remember you were two strokes short at the end?  Yes, and I think we led one or two rounds.  You have kind of spoken to it generally, but maybe I can ask it again.  How, in your four years and maybe you can tackle it and say your three  years as assistant coach, but particularly in your four years, in that  seven year period, looking back on how the program evolved, how had it  changed and in what ways?  I think that we had a higher quality of recruit coming in. People wanted  to be golfers and try to play professional golf that were highly ranked  amateurs. Had a lot of national and international experience. I think the  athleticism had improved and I think the expectations of themselves had  improved. I mean just the total package improved.  Your strength and conditioning program, you indicated there was a  definite change in the program.  It improved. Just different. Maybe it wasn   t better. Maybe we could  have been just as good if we had done the same thing as we had always  44  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  done.  Had your budget been the same all of those seven years?  I don   t know, Jerry. I can   t say that I ever really paid a lot of attention to  those things. I felt like it was my job to take the resources that were  given to me and to manage them effectively and to use them for the  athletes to the best of my ability. I can   t tell you if our budget increased  or decreased for those seven years. I have no idea.  That   s interesting. You were so focused on the coaching aspect?  Well, you coach in golf and you try to teach young people to focus on  what they can control and to pay attention and to put time and energy  and effort into things that can help them be better. Worrying about a  budget certainly was not one of them.  Okay. You mentioned some of your players. You talked about someone  that you mentioned earlier, but anyone else you want to mention that  stand out in your mind in your four years?  Great players   all the ladies. I mean, Linda Wessberg. Annie Young,  who is our head coach now. Karin Sjodin, Christi Cano, Emma  Zackrisson. I   m going to forget somebody. That   s not good for me to do  this. I need a list. Jennifer Karr played good rounds for us. Candy  Herrera played a few good rounds. Mallory Underwood had a huge  tournament in Auburn that last year as a true freshman and finished  tenth, which was a big deal for her. And Ashley Knoll put some good  rounds together. She didn   t stay at Oklahoma State, which was  disappointing, but was certainly a good player. Gosh before that, Maria  Boden and Linda. Julie helped us. We had an Australian kid come in,  but never really turned out to be anything that stuck with us. There were  some great, great young people.  I   m going to ask you again. I know I   m getting repetitive in the  questions, but if there   s one thing you had to put your finger on that  triggered the success of the program from when you came in to when  you left, what would it be?  I don   t know. Luck, I guess.  (Laughs) You mentioned the quality of the student athletes that you had.  I think they were a lot better than the total package team that I played  on. I mean, we had one or two great players when I was playing, but I  felt like the depth was better. But maybe not. Maybe it was just luck.  45  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Looking back on your coaching career, what gives you the most  satisfaction?  That everybody graduates. That everybody had a really good time. This  is going to sound ridiculous, but that Annie Young learned to eat steak  medium rare.  (Laughs) As opposed to?  As opposed to well done. (Laughter) Winning tournaments is great. And  it   s awesome and I   m very, very proud of the record that our team had  competitively, but also the fact that we didn   t have any major problems  and people stuck around and they graduated. Yes, we had some players  come in and transfer out, but it was because they either weren   t getting  playing time or Oklahoma State wasn   t the right fit for them. I just think  generally I   m proud of the fact that we competed at a very high level and  that people have good memories of Oklahoma State and of Stillwater  and when they come back they tell me how much they miss it and that   s  special.  You mentioned graduation. Can you recall what your graduation rate  was with your women golfers during your college career?  Unless they transferred to another school I can   t think of any that didn   t  graduate.  That   s incredible.  But that may not be true. We   d have to go back and look. Probably not  perfect, but it was darn close. You   re not going to get a lot of women  golfers that don   t graduate. They   re going to come in and spend four  years and graduate. Now some of them are going to transfer out, but  they   re most likely going to graduate from other places.  Gosh, that   s interesting. Looking back on your coaching career, is there  anything you would have done differently, Amy?  I probably would try to be more sensitive. I tend to be direct and maybe  I   d learn to be a little less direct sometimes to certain people. Depending  on where people are from they may not be used to that type of direct  communication. For me, it   s just easier to get it over with and get it out  and out in the open. Sometimes you kind of have to tailor your remarks  and kind of go slow a little bit.  But other than that?  46  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  I don   t have any regrets really, Jerry. I try not to live my life that way. I  try to just do the best you can. I know sometimes you have to look back  and change your behavior or wish you had done some things differently  and I certainly learn a lot every single day, but at the same time I think  you can waste a lot of energy worrying about things in the past, too.  Speaking of the women   s golf program, kind of where you left it, where it  is today, what would be the keys to continue success for our program in  the future?  I   ll be 100 percent honest. I think it has been hard with the coach   s  turnover. When I decided to move into administration, Mike McGraw  took over, who was our assistant coach who helped our women   s team  that last year. That was a tough transition for him and then he decided  that wasn   t the best thing for him and actually, I think Coach Holder  became the athletic director and so then Mike McGraw became the  men   s coach and then we had to find another women   s coach. So if Ann  started in    77 and I started in 2000, after 23 years of the same coach,  then you had seven years overlapping of the same assistant and then  head coach with a lot of the same energy and some of the same  philosophy. Then you had an interim, basically, and then you had a  totally new person from the outside.  I think that there   s just a gap between the way we   ve always done things  here and bringing in an outside person that didn   t really adjust, so  Laura   s not the head coach anymore. And now bringing in Annie  Young, who was part of the program but still is very, very young (no  pun intended). She hasn   t coached before and so she   s learning and  doing a great job, but it   s going to take her awhile to figure it all out. I  had three years as an assistant coach. And Mike McGraw, that   s all he   s  ever done is coach golf either at the high school or collegiate level. I  think that   s been the toughest transition. I think the key to maintaining  success, to answer your question Jerry, I   m sorry, is that we need some  stability with the coach and give Annie some time and let her bring in  her own recruits and develop a system and kind of grow with it.  But the budget and facilities, you think, are adequate to what you need?  Better than ever. Coach   s salaries, facilities, budget, fundraising     everything. Better than ever.  You feel good about all of those things.  Better than ever.  Excellent.  47  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  It   s more resources than you could shake a stick at compared to other  people in golf. I interviewed one summer for the Tulsa job. They asked  me to come over to interview for the opening and it was flattering and it  was very nice.  And this was when you were an assistant coach?  No, this was when I was a head coach, and I do remember this about the  budget. I do remember them showing me the budget and I remember  going,    That   s your travel budget?     (Laughter) And the AD is sitting  there and I probably   one of those sensitivity things I probably should  have learned, right? I think I left that office thinking,    How do they get  from A to B?     How did they get to be as good as they were at one point?  Yes, well they had a great leader and great coach, Dale McNamara and  then her daughter after that. But I was just really, really, really surprised.  Wow. That   s fantastic. Amy, do you ever have a chance to speak with  and talk to some of your counterparts in the conference about our  facilities, our budget, our traveling?  I know a lot more about budgets now as far as total departmental  budgets than I did then. But Oklahoma State still ranks about half way,  midpoint in the Big XII with total resources. So if you think that it   s  probably about the same percentages almost ten years ago   six years  ago now   as it was then, as it was now, it was probably about the same.  I just think that golf had been such a great sport for us at OSU and Ann  and Coach Holder had done such a phenomenal job making sure golf  had the resources it needed to be successful and because they were so  successful, I think they just kind of had an edge. It   s kind of like  wrestling here. There   s two sports that have been phenomenal here for  history and it   s golf and wrestling and I think that   s just a tribute to the  people that have managed the programs. It   s a tribute to the history and  to the donors that have contributed and to the time and energy of the   coaches . Basically Ann and Mike both, that   s all they did was coach  golf. I mean, they gave up a lot of their family time and a tremendous  amount of personal time to do better for golf and to raise more money  for golf. And for Mike, obviously, to build the golf course and Karsten  Creek. I mean, who does that? So, I think it   s just a special, special,  special program here.  Speaking of that, the facilities and those sorts of things that you have  here, is there anything that you wish you had for the program that you  don   t have?  48  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  When I was coaching, I can   t think of any and I can   t think of anything  now. But, like I said, I hadn   t really thought about it in six years. I have  other things to worry about. I can think of a lot of things we need in  other sports.  Exactly. Well you were talking about the dollars in fundraising. Could  you talk a little bit about the Cowgirl golf tournament and the fundraiser  that they have I think every spring and then it started back in    79?  Right. Ann started a tournament called the Cowgirl Classic, very similar  to what Mike Holder had done with the Cowboy Pro/am, and it   s a great  time to just come in and have a fundraiser for women   s golf. Guys and  girls come in and play a scramble and you try to get some alum and  some current players playing with them to meet them. You just have a  great day. Raise money. Have fun.  What kind of money did you raise with the tournament each year?  I   d have to go back and look. I think we   d raise about  90,000 to   100,000   maybe sometimes  70,000- 80,000 per day.  That   s a difference maker for the program.  Yes, absolutely, for the Foundation. Just for instance, say our equipment  budget   I don   t know just making up this number    10,000 for  women   s golf back then, which I don   t think it is now. But say it was   10,000 for equipment. By the time you bought just uniforms, shorts and  shirts and stuff, you could easily spend  4,000. Okay, well what if we  needed rain suits. And that   s something that we didn   t have   a  manufacturing contract. If you bought nice rain suits, well, they   re about   350 to  500 a piece, gortex. It   s something that you really need to  have   a good piece of outerwear for golf. So you can imagine once you  buy eight of those, that it can get a little expensive, so that   s where those  things helped. Just helped with the little things.  In 2004, you were appointed to the position of Associate Director of  Athletics and Senior Woman Administrator for OSU; this must have  been quite an honor. Certainly coming very early in your career, but on  the other hand, was it a tough decision for you to give up golf, Amy?  Yes.  Can you kind of walk through how that happened?  Yes, absolutely.  49  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  And what your thought process was?  Absolutely.  Because you had just turned the program around and dipped a little bit  and wound up and finished in the top five four years in a row.  Yes. Not five. Three out of four. We finished thirteenth one year.  Sorry about that, but finished your last year as runner-up. So probably  good things, maybe better things on the horizon for OSU women   s golf.  Yes, I think that   s probably true, too.  Was that a tough decision for you?  This is what happened. About in April-ish, Harry Birdwell, who was  athletic director at the time, Ann Baer had announced her retirement for  the following year and he approached me and said,    There   s been some  talk that you might be a good person for this job.    And I said,    Really?     and he said,    Yes.    I said,    But I   m a golf coach.    And he said,    Yes, I  know. But you   ve done very well with your program and I think you  might have a skill set that could really help me.    He said,    Why don   t  you just think about it for a little bit and then we   ll talk about it again?     And we talked about it a little bit more.  Of course, the job had to be opened up obviously to the public and I had  to go through the application process, but anyhow, here   s the deal, long  story short. I wanted to make a decision whether that was something I  wanted to do or not before the end of the season. So basically I told  Harry,    Look, if this is the real deal, and I really have a chance to get  this job, then okay, I   ll do it. But I   m telling you now, you better give  me the job because       (and HR will go crazy on our oral history project  here) but anyway, I said,    You better give me the job because I   m not  going to go back to golf after this. Once I decide that I   m going to move  forward and move into administration and do this with you, that   s it.  You know I   m not going to waffle.    Because I didn   t want the success  or failure of my team that year to affect my decision. I didn   t feel like  that was healthy for me going forward because then I would always look  back and say,    Well why did I do that? Did I make that decision to move  into administration because we won? Or did I make that decision to  move into administration because we lost?    I didn   t ever want to look  back and wonder that. So the whole time that I was coaching that very  successful post season, I knew that I was leaving my job. And I thought  about it every single day.  50  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  But here was my decision, that I was twenty-nine years old at the time.  The only thing I had ever done was coach golf or play golf in college  and I had not worked in another professional setting or environment. All  I had done was coach. I started thinking,    Okay, so if I coach again for  ten more years or whatever that is then I   ll be thirty-nine years old. The  only thing I will ever have done is coach golf and I can be as successful  as anything in the world, but then what am I going to do? Am I going to  continue to coach golf? I don   t know. I have a lot of interest in a lot of  different things.    So I thought,    Here   s my problem. I   m going to end up  being a forty or fifty year old woman. Only thing I   ve ever done is coach  golf. And then what am I going to do? Go work at a golf course? Give  lessons? No. that   s not what I   m going to do.    I decided that this  decision was really about the rest of my life, as opposed to short term.  And that was that. Some days I feel really, really good about it and some  days I don   t. (Laughter)  You look at the golf course and say,    I would like to be out there.     That   s right and I miss the young people, but at the end of the day, I  think the skill set that I have developed and moved into in administration  will carry me further down the road into my career into my fifties and  sixties in athletics as opposed to being a golf coach for the rest of my  life.  Can you talk about some of your job responsibilities, Amy, and your day  to day activities as a senior woman administrator?  It   s kind of a jambalaya of a lot of different things. I do have direct  supervision over three sports: softball, soccer, and then track and field  for men and women. So I work with those coaches, not always on a  daily basis, but when things come up here, there and yonder. And then I  also work in marketing and promotions. So I manage all of the staff that  does the in-game promotions and operations. We do all of the video  boards. We do all of the game day scripting. We do a lot of execution  with Learfield Sports, which is our third tier media rights provider. We  do all of the advertising. We work a little bit with the website, although  Kevin Klintworth works with them primarily. But we work a lot with the  web. Like I said, print, radio, TV third tier   all of that.  Amy, you work with?  Soccer, softball, track and field.  And golf?  No. Golf does not report to me. It reports to Mike Holder.  51  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Okay. That   s interesting.  Well, I mean he   s a golfer, too.  That   s right.  He   s a lot better than me.  Did you want it that way? Or did he want it that way?  No, that   s his decision. He   s the boss, so he makes that decision. Now, I  talk to Annie all the time. So it   s not that we don   t communicate about  golf. I   m here to help however I can. It   s just a paper thing anyway.  Can you talk a little bit about the organizational structure in the  Athletics Department, how it works and where you fit into that scheme of  things?  I report to Mike Holder, the Athletic Director. And then I have my  employees under me on the flow chart and I report to him.  So what other, at your level, are their associates?  There are other associate ADs, yes. Kevin Klintworth works with media  relations. Jason Lewis works with the business operations. Marty  Sargent works with game operations and safety. He also does a lot of  travel, all the teams that do charter and stuff like that   operations. Dave  Martin is our senior associate athletic director, but technically I don   t  report to him. Technically I report to Mike Holder. But Dave is  definitely my superior.  Who do the other team sports report to?  Let   s see, tennis   men   s and women   s tennis report to Jason Lewis.  He   s a tennis guy. And then baseball and equestrian and wrestling report  to Dave Martin. Golf, men   s and women   s, report to Mike Holder.  Football and men   s and women   s basketball report to Mike Holder. I  think that   s it. But Mike and Dave buddy up on all the football and  men   s and women   s basketball issues.  And wrestling.  Wrestling   Dave Martin. He   s the wrestling expert.  Under the current structure, how are decisions that mainly affect  women   s sports   budget, staffing, fundraising   how are those decisions  52  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  made?  Fundraising would just all be under Mike and major gifts and stuff like  that. So coaches can do fundraising and things to enhance their  foundation to use for discretionary spending. All of the big projects,  facility projects, all of that is done with Mike and his vision. We talk  about those things all of the time   what facilities we   re going to build  next, where the need is the most and that kind of thing. As far as  staffing, I   ve been involved in a lot of coaches    changes in the last six  years and hiring new coaches. I   ve been involved in almost every one of  those for women   s sports, either really doing the search myself and  working with Mike to select a coach or being a host or kind of an  assistant giving information or doing background research and then, you  said, kind of decision making.  We really make a lot of decisions by group. Here we have a Tuesday  senior staff meeting that a lot of people are able to throw their ideas in  the hat back and forth and sit around and talk about things. And Mike  will come in and sit down and say,    Hey, what do you think about this?  This is kind of what I   m thinking.    When I   ve got a staffing decision  with one of my sports, I   ll talk with that coach and then we   ll take that  up to Mike for approval or not. Basically that   s just kind of how it goes.  Pretty simple.  Amy, do you know basically what percentage of the budget would be for  the women   s programs as opposed to the men   s programs?  I can look up the number, Jerry, but I don   t have that off the top of my  head.  In one sense, is it like a fourth or third, the total budget of women   s  sports?  I have no idea.  Maybe this is just a kind of general question, but do you have any sense  of how well women   s sports are funded by OSU compared to other Big  XII schools?  Well, we   re fully funded as far as scholarships. Of course, it   s  uncommon for a BCS equity, a Big Six conference school not to be. I  don   t know that any schools aren   t. And then generally, we have a great  Nike contract. Our equipment for our teams, which is actually superior  to Nike contracts with some of our peers. We have decent facilities for a  few of our sports. And then, I think, budget wise we   re generally in  pretty good shape. There may be just some extra things, like midweek  53  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  charters, occasionally with planes for teams like softball or soccer or  even baseball that don   t get to charter as much as maybe like University  of Texas or OU does. But Texas has  126 million budget and we   re at  about  50  million  and OU has a  76 million budget and we   re at about   50  million . We basically have the same number of athletes in all the  sports. Honestly, I don   t know of anything besides facility issues that we  really have problems with right now.  I wanted to pick it up with you on facilities. There are a lot of proposed  facilities like the Athletic Village project. What   s the status of those?  I don   t know. I   m not an expert. That changes every single day, so you   d  have to ask Mike. I really don   t know.  What were some of the women   s venues included in the Athletic Village?  Track and field, soccer, tennis.  And there   s some talk about equestrian.  Absolutely. Well, they did make an exchange with campus to take over  that section of land where the old swine facility used to be off Highway  51.  So it   s going to be over there now.  That   s my understanding, but I haven   t asked for an update on that in a  long time, Jerry.  As Senior Woman Administrator, are  facility  issues a concern for you  for recruiting and being competitive nationally?  Well, yes. They   re a concern for everybody, not just me.  What do you think, in terms of facilities, we   re lacking and what needs to  be enhanced?  We   re lacking in almost every facility except for football and men   s and  women   s basketball.  Another women   s program, like tennis, for example, doesn   t really have  an indoor workout facility. They have to go     Yes, men   s and women   s tennis   we equally discriminate in those  sports. There   s no indoor practice facility for them.  54  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  We talked earlier about the excellent graduation rate that you had for  women   s golf program. How do women   s sports graduation rates  generally compare to men   s graduation rates?  I   m sorry, I don   t know the percentage off the top of my head. It   s  higher because you don   t have the professional opportunities. And you  don   t have the number of professional opportunities. Football really  skews those numbers considerably.  I think baseball does, as well.  Yes, baseball does as well. But at the same time, you just don   t have the  number of professional opportunities. So ninety-five-plus percent of  your women athletes intend on graduating either at the school they begin  at or the school they transfer to. And I think most of them do. I just don   t  know those numbers. It   s not in the ninety percents, but it   s probably  pretty high. Marilyn Middlebrook could tell you all that stuff. I just  don   t know those numbers off the top of my head.  Thank you. What are some of your greatest challenges as Senior Woman  Administrator?  I think the challenge is just kind of managing the wants and the needs  and    my bullpen didn   t get raked this morning.    I think it   s just balance.  I mean every administrator, you have the wants and the needs of the  program and you   re trying to balance that with the reality of whatever  the budget limitations are or staffing limitations or balance decision  making. I think that   s just the hardest thing, but that   s part of  everybody   s job every day. No matter what you do, just finding that  balance.  Amy, I   m just reflecting on our conversation, from the time you started  in your position until now, has it changed? The title Senior Woman  Administrator might entail this person is in charge of all of the women   s  sports, for example.  Yes, it   s interesting.  Our conversation, understanding that it   s not     No, it   s not.  Do you feel any sense of overall responsibility, not specific job duties,  but responsibility for the women   s program?  Yes and no. A little more no than yes. The title Senior Woman  55  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Gill  Weeks  Administrator is a title that the NCAA created years ago   probably  around    82 when they began sponsoring women   s sports and women   s  championships. And it   s a reporting title. So for instance, they decided  that every university that is a member of the NCAA had to denote a  Senior Woman Administrator   basically the highest ranking female  member of your staff. And it is, in my opinion, actually very antiquated.
