Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the OSU Library. Today is  October 18, 2013, and we   re here in Stillwater, Oklahoma, for the O-State  Stories Oral History Project. With us today, we have Sandy Bass,  we have Jody Jobe, and we have Louan Torres. Thank you so much for  joining us today. To begin, I   d like for y   all to tell me a little about  yourself. We   re going to start with your name, the year you were born,  and where you were born. Sandy, we   ll begin with you.  My name is Sandy Jean Bass, Stephenson was my maiden name. I was  born in Ardmore, Oklahoma. I grew up in Norman. What was the third  question?  The year you were born.  I   m sorry. I was born in 1958.  Okay, and, Jody?  Jody Jobe. I was born in Ponca City, Oklahoma, in 1956. What was     You got it all. Ponca City. And Louan?  My name is Louan Brown Torres, and I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma,  July 13, 1956.  I   d like for y   all to tell me about your path to OSU, why you chose to  attend Oklahoma State. Louan, let   s begin with you.  Well, there is a history in my family with my grandmother on my  mother   s side being from Stillwater, so many falls and summers and  5  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  football seasons were spent over here in Stillwater, visiting that side of  the family. In fact, our homestead is outside of Ingalls, Oklahoma, on  my mom   s side of the family. I kind of had orange blood and wasn   t  given much choice, but it was the choice that I did make. That   s what  led me from Tulsa to Oklahoma State.  And Jody, why did you decide to attend OSU?  Well, I grew up in Stillwater. My dad was a professor at Oklahoma  State, so that was just kind of an easy move to make, to go to OSU.  What did he teach on campus?  Math. He was a math professor. He   s still living, retired math professor.  And Sandy?  I grew up in Norman, and I came here because my best friend   s older  siblings were here. I visited a couple of times with her when we were  seniors in high school. My parents were very strict Southern Baptist, and  I was absolutely certain if I picked up a beer in Norman, there would be  all these cars that were doing an FBI stop. (Laughter) I thought it best to  get out of town a little bit, and Stillwater was a great choice since my  best friend was going here.  Let   s talk a little bit about your education here on campus. Share with  me your major and maybe any favorite classes during your time in  school. Sandy?  Accounting major, German minor. German was the hardest thing I ever  took, hardest thing I ever did. I can only say,    The library is closed on  Sunday,    in German anymore. I liked it all. Really, I did. I enjoyed my  classes. I enjoyed the teachers. One particular one doesn   t stand out.  And Jody?  I was an interior design major. I started out as an art major but switched  over to interior design so I could stay for four years. I initially was going  to transfer out my junior year, but I stayed. A lot of hours. If you   re in  any kind of art-related field, there is a lot of studio hours involved. It  was fun, a lot of hard work, a lot of late nights, and it kind of prepared  me for what I do: a lot of hard work, a lot of late nights. It was great. It  was fun. It was hard, but it was a good major. Good experience here at  Oklahoma State. I had a couple of teachers that I really liked. Chris tine   Salmon, she was great. Leevera Pepin, she was really good. Those are  the two that really stick with me. Good experience.  6  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  And Louan?  I was a health, physical education, and recreation major. I kind of kept  switching around once they started breaking those apart. You could get  either a health degree or a recreation degree or a PE degree. I didn   t like  taking all the hard science classes that they would put us in the vet  students. They never got that fixed while I was here, but I really enjoyed  a lot of the physical education classes and recreation classes. In  particular, it   s really fun for me to think about   I believe it was my  sophomore year that Coach  Mike  Holder, (I took a golf class) he taught  that class. Coach Holder has gone on now to be the athletic director of  this great university. It   s kind of fun to think back on,    I had him for a  teacher.    (Laughs) There was a lot of great teachers on the campus then.  All three of you share a bond in sisterhood as members of Kappa Alpha  Theta. I want you to talk to me a little about the Rush process, what it  was like for you. Jody?  Well, my story is a little strange. Rush process, it   s scary because you   re  coming and you   re a teenager. You   re thrown in, and this is a big school.  You   re thrown in with a bunch of people you don   t know. Even growing  up in Stillwater, I really was not prepared for Rush. It was a lot of fun,  nerve-racking. Actually, some of my best friends in high school pledged  other houses, but that   s all right. It worked out well. It was exciting. I  dropped out of Rush, and then I actually went back, and I pledged in the  spring semester of my freshman year. So my experience was probably a  little different than these two, obviously. I remember her going through  Rush.  Well, Sandy, tell me about Rush.  Well, again, being the leader I was, I followed right behind my best  friend whose mother was also a Theta. (Laughter) I knew nothing about  Rush, really. It was nerve-racking. They didn   t have too many girls  coming from Norman. I was hoping that might benefit because usually  they try to geographically divvy it up a little bit so they don   t get people  from all one high school. It was very nerve-racking. Honestly, I had no  idea what was going on. I was glad to be a Theta. I think just being  included in something, whether you start with band or anything, just  knowing somebody is going to include you, made me feel good.  And Louan?  I think from what Sandy just said, it makes an easier transition onto a  huge campus compared to your high school campus, whether you came  7  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  from a large school system or Fairfax, Oklahoma. It is a comfort zone,  being part of a sorority, even though as freshmen we did not live in the  house. My experience of coming up from Tulsa, I came up from a large  city. A lot of girls going through from different high schools in Tulsa.  Knowing some other people in other houses was a big help to me, as  well as my folks both being Greek. Until you   re there going through the  recruitment, you   re just like,    Oh, my gosh, I just cut my mother   s  sorority. What is she going to do?    It was a decision you had to make,  and as I found out as a parent, yes, you wish for them to maybe be part  of the Greek system that you were part of, but it   s about the kid   s own  decision. It was one of the greatest things that   s ever happened to me in  my life is to be a part of this group of sisters. We had a darn good group  during the time we were here in Stillwater, during those years of    74 to     78.  Let   s talk about where you lived on campus, starting as a freshman.  Jody, where did you live?  Actually, as a freshman, I lived at home, being from Stillwater. I   m  going to be    (Laughter) Dud. I know, right? I lived at home, but it  actually worked out well. The rest of the time, I moved into the house. I  rode a bicycle a lot back and forth to the house. I had to get in the study  hours and that kind of thing. Being a part of something, even though I  grew up in Stillwater, lived in Stillwater, around this big thing that is  Oklahoma State, cracking the shell and being a part of it is very  different. You come up here, and you   re still like a little piece in this  great big puzzle. To be able to have the house to go to and this nice  group of people, you had seniors and you had people older than you that  were kind of taking you in. If you   re walking across campus, you   d see a  familiar face. It   s terrific.  What year did you move into the house?  Fall of    75. Would that be right?  Yes.  Were you a sophomore?  Yes. I don   t know how it is now, but for us, you did not live in the house  as a freshman. Wherever you lived, at home or if you lived in the dorm  or whatever, and then people would move into the house as a  sophomore.  Louan, where did you live as a freshman?  8  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Drummond Hall. (Laughter)  What was that like for you?  It was an experience. (Laughter) It was great. I think now, to what they  have now, because I do have a daughter that   s currently here, they had a  cafeteria. They don   t have that on campus anymore. It was great because  that was just so many people and so many different floors that you  become,    Oh, yes, she   s a Kappa. Oh, yes, she   s a Pi Phi.    Or you have  met your new sisters, and they   re living in that dorm, and you walk over  to the house to do your chapter night or do your study hall or go to  Homecoming and do your pomping hours. We actually didn   t have  pomping hours back then, but we had study hall hours. It was a great  experience. I just drove by it last weekend, and I was like,    Oh, it   s still  here.    The familiar landmarks, some are still here.  Well, Sandy, I take it you also lived in Drummond?  Tenth floor, yes. Still remember. I liked it. I think when you compare it  to campuses now   . I have four kids, taking them to various and sundry  campuses, you can say,    Back in the day, I used to have to wait for the  elevator       Now they have these suites and stuff. I liked it. It was a  great way to meet people outside your sorority. I kept in touch with  several of the people that I met on my floor that weren   t in my sorority.  We had lots of open doors, and I liked that a lot.  As sophomores, you moved into the house. Tell me about your  housemother.  Mama Morefield.  Morefield.  Yes, she lives behind a door. (Laughter)  The one we had, Mama Morefield     Hazel. Hazel Morefield.  Yes, Hazel Morefield, that   s right. Very good, Louan. She was tough. I  think now maybe it   s more lax. I don   t know. It wasn   t necessarily a bad  thing. She was a little tough.  I think they had things that they were to teach us about etiquette  (Laughs) and about promptness and kindness, be it phone etiquette  because we had phone rooms and we had phone duty     9  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  This is pre-cellphones.     (   this is pre-cellphones    is right) to the table manners. That   s why you  had formal dinners.  That   s why I pass the salt and pepper at the same time. Don   t you find  yourself doing that? (Laughter)  Yes, yes.  A lot of that has to do with   that was part of the house mom   s job.  Pick up on the left. (Laughter)  It was a teacher.     Would you like some more?    (Laughter)  She was fun, but she was strict. She was not to be our mother, per se.  She was almost like a grandmother figure. You don   t   .  You don   t mess with   .  Right.  She wasn   t horrible. She was very nice, too     Yes.     but she was there for a purpose.  Well, explain phone duty. What does that entail?  Well, a phone, which is not something that you put in your pocket and  get email on. It   s like the box thing that has a receiver and a cord.  (Laughter)  House phone.  I   m probably going to get this wrong. We had a phone room, and we had  two or three numbers that went to the house. This is a house of eighty-five  people, and you have two or three phone lines that go into that  house. That   s it, so you   d have to have phone duty. You   d sit by the  front door. This was also pre-door-codes and things like that. The person  on phone duty would answer the phone, and they would also answer the  10  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  door. If somebody came in the house that was not a member, you   d have  to, like, deal with that.  We also had an intercom system that they probably don   t have in the  houses anymore. If somebody can go up to the intercom system and say,     Jody Jobe, this is John Jones here to pick you up,    or,    Jody, come on  down      Or,    You have a guest.    I remember that.  That   s what we were supposed to say. We were supposed to say,    You  have a guest.     But that phone, that was the lifeline to your parents calling you. Calling  home collect was a big no-no because it was very expensive. (Laughter)  It   s funny because these things that y   all grew up with, our generation,  we   re like,    What   s phone duty?    How did you all do your laundry?  We had washers and dryers on each floor.  Second floor, third floor.  We had washers and dryers on the floor. We were spoiled. We did it  ourselves. We didn   t have somebody come in and do it, but we were  pretty spoiled.  The ironing boards could set up there. I don   t know that too many  ironing boards sit up in the house anymore. (Laughter)  They were there. I saw them. I saw the ironing boards.  Was anybody using them?  No. (Laughter)  Those ironing boards could set up right outside. It   s an area that you  could close off. It was behind open-up doors.  Yes, when you   d have open houses, those doors would be closed.  I think one of the big things in high school for gifts back then was  laundry bags, and how many people made laundry bags. Even after you  pledged a sorority, you   d get a black and gold Kappa Alpha Theta  laundry bag. That laundry bag could fill up and go with you, home to  Tulsa.    Oh, I   m home for the weekend.    Then, yes, it got done. It wasn   t  11  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Jobe  baskets, per se, but it really was laundry bags.  What about curfew? Did you all have curfew in the house?  I don   t remember that we did.  I remember we had a discussion when I came to college. There was still  at least one or two dorms that were curfew, and it was no boys in one, no  girls in one. I really had to talk long and hard to my parents to not make  me stay in whatever that one was and stay with Megan  Wantland , my  friend. They still had dorms then that somebody would enforce it. I  guess it was your RA? So my freshman year, there would have been  some sort of   .  We did. We did have a curfew. The door was locked at, I think it was  midnight. Eleven?  I think they made it eleven on weeknights.  You were supposed to be in. I think you   re right. Weeknight is eleven,  and I think on the weekends it was, like, twelve or twelve thirty,  something like that. You were supposed to be in the house. If somebody  knew you were going to be a little late and was kind of maybe hanging  out in the phone room would maybe let you in, if that ever happened.  (Laughter)  Like if you had car trouble or something.  Yes, if you had car trouble, or if you were at the library too late.  (Laughter)  I think the library stayed open until midnight. Sometimes we had to let  people in from coming back from the library.  They were studying until midnight. (Laughter)  What other insights into differences between sorority life then and now  come to mind? We   ve seen lots of changes.  I have a daughter that   s an active Kappa Alpha Theta. One thing that  they don   t do anymore is they don   t have you go through pledgeship  through the first semester of whatever year you pledge, that they initiate  by the end of September, first of October. Jody was different because  she was a spring pledge.  I was different.  12  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Jobe  Torres  We were pledging in August or September. Then we would not be  initiated until February. Number one, we had to make our grades.  Number two, we had to put in study hours. They don   t do study hours  anymore. At least, the Theta   s thing is that they do the Homecoming  pomping hours. That doesn   t mean the girls aren   t studying, but they are  asked to study. Anyway, it   s just little things. There are a lot of things  that have changed.  I think a big thing is the responsibility of alcohol and drinking and  driving. Of course, society has gotten better about it. I just don   t think  we thought about it. We   d have a party at Yost Lake, and you   d get in  the car and drive home. Like my parents    generation never thought about  seatbelts. I have a son that   s in a fraternity at OU. They really, as part of  their programs, they   re not trying to encourage it at all but make sure the  pledges are going to be a designated driver or set up something that if  somebody needs a helpline to not drink and drive. I think that   s a huge  step in the right direction because I don   t think we were responsible  about that at all.  No.  We were lucky.  We all think we were very lucky. I will have to say that last year, my  daughter had pledged as a sophomore. One thing she would say, she  goes,    I was a DD last night.    I knew, but I wasn   t real sure what she  was talking about. I said,    Well, that   s good.    Then to get a shout out in  Chapter because you DD   d for the seniors, those things didn   t happen.  I think it   s great.  I think it   s a great thing.  What about shenanigans? We   re in the   70s here.  No, we studied a lot.  I   m sure you did. (Laughter) Did you end up doing anything, say, with  the Sirloin Stockade bull or     That was before we came.  No, it wasn   t. (Laughter)  They   re trying to get that out of us. (Laughter)  13  Jobe  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Oh, sorry.  It was the year before we came.  I   ve heard, just, some things. (Laughter)  That was back in the streaking days.  I remember the streaking days.  Tell me about the streaking days.  I was always studying on that Thursday night. (Laughter)  You may not have been an active participant.  I could hear it from the library. (Laughter) I remember, actually, even  pre-when we were in school, I remember as a kid we lived (my parents  still do) over by Will Rogers Grade School. I remember in the spring,  trying to go to sleep at night. My windows would be open. You could  hear from there, (this was a couple miles away) you could hear people  screaming     On the Strip.     this roar. You would know when somebody was streaking because as  a little kid, you could hear two miles in the distance. (Laughter)  What made them finally stop that? Did they start arresting naked people?  I don   t know. I think they did.  They did. It was that Bill   s Italian Pizza at the corner there of  Washington. They were standing up there. I think it made it from the  Stillwater NewsPress to CNN or something. (Laughter) It was just like,     Wow, that was       You look and say,    Good thing I wasn   t in that  picture.    There were those kinds of shenanigans.  That was pre-digital.  Shenanigans for me was like having a light beer, honestly, because I  lived a very sheltered life.  She actually was studying. (Laughter) My car ended up on the Theta  front porch a couple of times.  14  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Torres  And how did that come to happen?  I don   t know. (Laughter) I had a little tiny Fiat, and it was easily moved.  If we were doing something with a fraternity, like at Homecoming or  Spring Sing or whatever, they weren   t going to, like, pick up Reese   s  Grand Prix and put it on the front porch. That little Fiat was easier.  (Laughter) I think the Stockade Bull, that   s how that came. It just, like,  appeared.  I don   t have much memory of that. Maybe that was before my time.  It was on the front lawn. You remember that, don   t you?  Yes. (Laughter)  You might have helped to get it there.  I was studying  I do recall, we had a little bit of a reunion this summer at  the Theta house of several classes. One of the girls was like,    Well, it  was my car that ended up there in front of the library. You know where  the fountain is right now in front of the library? They had driven up here  through areas. There was some of that that went on.  Mary Fallin was at our reunion, our governor. She was a Theta while we  were there.  She probably drove that car up there.  She probably did. Let   s blame it on her. (Laughter)  She did. (Laughter) We could go on and on with this subject, but I don   t  think we have that much time.  She could always run real fast. Remember that? (Laughter) She could.  She could run real fast.  She was on the football team. She was very good. She played flag  football and volleyball. She was very competitive. I wanted her on my  team.  We don   t want that to make the papers. Mary Copeland   s friends said,     She was fast in college.    (Laughter) I meant she could run fast.  Everybody knows that, now. (Laughter)  15  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  There are many traditions on campus. Before we get to Homecoming  traditions, are there any traditions that come to mind that y   all  participated in, or it may be specific to your sorority?  The house would always, they would participate in everything. You  have that many people, and that is part of being in a sorority or fraternity  is that you participate. That   s good. I think that   s a good thing. It   s  forced, but then once you do it, you think,    Oh, man, we   re going to do  that again next year, and we   re going to win.     The singing competitions and dancing, what were those called?  Spring Sing, all of that stuff.  Varsity Revues. Intramural sports, I participated in those.  Yes, yes. I still can remember some of the songs that we did.  Go ahead, we   ll   .  No, no, no, no. (Laughter)  Volunteers, philanthropy, CASA,  Court Appointed Special Advocates   it was to help to make us become well-rounded women. We were  seventeen, eighteen, nineteen years old. That was part of what the Greek  system offered you, and it did offer some structure but also a lot of fun  and a lot of girls all being together at once.  You meet people, whether they were fraternities or sororities, you   re in a  singing thing, you   re all freshmen, you   re all learning a dance. You have  nothing in common because you don   t know where you   re from, except  for that dance. I enjoyed that.  So in 1977, what year were you in school? Sandy?  Sophomore.  Jody?  I must've been    77?  Wait a second. I graduated from high school in    76, so I would   ve  started college in    76. In    77, I was a sophomore.  Well, then, the fall   we graduated in    78.  16  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  I was in my fourth year. Jody, you were a senior. She was a senior, but I  dropped off on my majors and stuff, so I was behind.  Let   s talk about Homecoming. Let   s talk about Homecoming pre-1977.  What was Homecoming like? What did it mean for y   all?  It was fun. It was exciting. It   s like you have this big project. It    a big  thing. People come to the campus. Although, I think now, you get a lot  more population coming into the campus. That could be maybe from my  perspective, now, versus my perspective as an undergrad. It was the big  football game. Our teams were, they stunk. Now it   s so much fun to  come because they win. (Laughs)  We beat OU while I was here.  I know, we did, but it was like     We lined up on the wrong side of the field or     Something happened, yes. (Laughter) Homecoming was the big thing  because you have the parade, because you have the house decorations,  because you have all this influx of people. It was always a big deal, and  in the house, it was a big participation deal. Everybody got organized,  and everybody would show up whether it was pomping or   . There   s so  much more to Homecoming than what you see. There   s the homecoming  queen, the signs, the spirit, the marketing. Sandy would probably speak  more   she knows more about all the intricacies.  Well, when I did Homecoming that year, I really didn   t know that much  about Homecoming because the Theta house and a lot of houses would  have kind of an on-year and an off-year, not in a bad way but a year  where you really went out for it and spent a lot of money, and a year  when you kind of backed off a little bit and saved money and maybe just  did a sign or something like that. My freshman year, it would   ve been an  off-year. I wouldn   t have known that much because we wouldn   t have  had a house dec or float or maybe just a very small one. I didn   t have  any memories of it.  So in 1977, do y   all remember the Homecoming theme that year?  I know the Thetas and AGRs were talking about Homecoming because  that was our shtick.  You mean the university   s?  Well, what was your theme with AGR?  17  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Torres  Well, that was just our little marketing   the Thetas and AGRs are  talking about Homecoming. I brought our logo. Did you draw that logo?  Yes, I did.  This was my idea, and I look back now and think probably a lot of  people are going,    Whose idea was this?    We were going to stay on the  phone Homecoming weekend, twenty-four hours a day. We brought  (somebody said this) a composite over to each other   s house, so  everybody had to sign up for phone duty. That was our shtick.    We   re  talking about Homecoming.       We   re talking about Homecoming.    We  literally were talking on the phone twenty-four hours a day. If you were  talking to Joe Blow, you could at least look at him on his composite over  at the Theta house and see who you were talking to. Our t-shirts said  that, and I   m sure Jody drew that. I brought the only copy I have of that.  That   s what I remember about it. I know the school had a   I don   t  remember what the   .  It had something to do with Pistol Pete.  Yes, it   s in there.  Well, yes. (Laughter)  (Sarcastically) It was orange and black.  We haven   t even been drinking. (Laughter)  I think it was football-related.  It was something about Pistol Pete.  Okay, I accept that. That sounds reasonable.  So how did the AGRs and y   all come up with the overall idea for what  you were going to create?  Well, you sit down, and if we could remember the theme, that would  help, too, which we can   t. You sit down with a committee of people.  Like Sandy said, this was the year we decided this was going to be a big  one. We were going to participate. We were going to take the list, and  we were going to check all the boxes and then create some because then  you get more points. We wanted to go for the sweepstakes.  We were participating in the sweepstakes.  18  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Bass  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Bass  We wanted to win the sweepstakes trophy. That means you have to place  well in all the different categories of Homecoming. For my participation  in it because I can draw, I would sit with this committee of people and  come up with ideas and draw out,    Well, if the house decoration looks  like this, the float could look like this,    or whatever. It   s a whittling  down. You do two or three different ideas, and then you say,    What  could we really produce, and how could we produce it?     Can we show the   picture?  Oh, you can show.    (Laughs) Everything that was visual, you had to  have the drawings.  This is Jody working.  This was probably a sketch, an idea for maybe what the sign competition  would be.  Who is it? Not Winston Churchill.  Teddy Roosevelt.  It would just be a matter of throwing out ideas and her doing all the  work and us saying,    Ehh,    or,    Yes, we really like that.        Do another one.    (Laughter)  The house dec was a castle, though, wasn   t it?  It was a castle.  With a drawbridge. It was going to be really pretty. Like I said, I was  involved in the visual stuff. Louan and Sandy, they were involved in  everything, but they would know more of the intricacies of the spirit  competition.  I don   t know how we   do you remember?  I think we had little subcommittees, as far as some of that, where they  just needed to coordinate back with us and we kind of said,    This is what  we   re going to do. Can you handle that for us?    You   d have a Theta  working with a AGR on the spirit     Right.  19  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  We didn   t have time to do everything, but it did get coordinated, like if  we needed to make changes. One thing I was talking to Sandy about the  other night is that we needed to get these extra points. One of the  marketing things was the phoneathon with the AGRs. We also  incorporated it to the Kansas State Theta Chapter and invited them to  participate with us.  Oh, yes, I forgot about that.  We asked them to come to the house on Friday night to spend the night  with us. There was an AGR, I believe, fraternity at K-State. They, in  turn, did the same thing. So we did have some phone calls back and  forth, part of just adding to our so-called talkathon to be unique, to be  different, to get extra points to help us towards placing or winning  sweepstakes. The plans were all laid out for all the   I recall the Thetas  were coming in on a bus on Friday night to spend the night at the Theta  house.  Yes, they were going to do it.  When we talk about building these things, I didn   t have any background  in any of this. It was so interesting to me to go to the AGR house, who  are traditionally from rural communities. Boy, every one of those guys  would stand up the minute you walked in the door. It was very, very  nice.  They were all gentlemen.  We   d try to be thinking about the building process, or    We need this,     and somebody would say,    We need an arc welder.    I   d be going,     What   s an arc welder?    And somebody would go,    Oh, I   ve got one in  the back of my truck.    That   s just the kind of guys     They could weld anything.  They were coming up. I remember riding around with one of them that  had a loaded gun, who won   t be named, underneath his   .  That could be several of them.  I sent him a Facebook message today saying,    Maybe you want to be  interviewed.    He had a loaded gun underneath his passenger seat. It was  a new experience for me. Liberty, Oklahoma. Freedom, Oklahoma.  Places I   d never heard of before and people who carried arc welders in  the back of their car because they knew what to do with them.  20  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Torres  Bass  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  They really wore cowboy boots. They really wore them     They did wear them.     because that was their footwear. It wasn   t because it was a fashion  thing. That   s what they wore. They were just a unique and special group  of guys.  They all cared for each other, but then the bonds started as we started  working with the ideas. It trickled down into the brothers, and it trickles  down to our sisters.    This is what we   re going to do. Things are laid out.  Pomping hours are assigned.    It wasn   t like our girls and they did not  want to do this. It became we all became family and very committed.  Our alums were committed; their alums were committed.  Somebody would have a great idea, and somebody else would go,     That   s a great idea. I can do this. I can do this.     Or,    I can call my dad and ask him this.     Yes, it was very collaborative.  We got a lot of materials donated back then because, again, this is a lot  of money for us to spend. I know Sandy has an account of how much  money was spent for chicken wire and tissue and things like that.  Did I put that in there?  You did.  That   s good for me. (Laughter)  She   s the tax attorney.  It   s in there.    I can drive to Newkirk and pick this up.    It was like,     Great.        Where   s Newkirk?    (Laughter)  And I can shoot a deer on the way and dress it on the way back.  (Laughter) This is for dinner.  Charcoal it up for dinner while we pomp all night. (Laughter)  One of the best things (I don   t know if you remember this) we were  going to have a calf fry.  21  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Jobe  Oh, yes   We were all going,    Oh, that sounds good      There was a lot of girls in our house.  Do you know what a calf fry is?  I do. (Laughter)  But if you didn   t know what that was     Did you all enjoy the calf fry?  I did not attend.  I wouldn   t commit, no.  We had one or two sorority sisters who were from rural Oklahoma that  probably suggested that we might not enjoy the calf fry. It was like,    Oh,  okay.     Something about a texture issue. (Laughter)  They knew.  There were some of us that didn   t know, but there were sure a lot of  sisters from Ponca that wore their cowboy boots, or from Fairfax, and  they   d just think,    Oh, they   re so fun, and it   s so good.     I appreciate the arc welder but not the calf fry.  It was interesting.  How long before Homecoming did y   all start working to put the  infrastructure of the house decorations together?  I don   t remember.  It goes together quickly. I mean, it   s amazingly quick. There   s so much  that   s done behind the scenes, and then they just bring it out and  assemble it. We were just talking about this on the way over today. I   m  sure there   s a reason why. I don   t know why it is, but now most of the  house decorations are long and flat, like billboard-ish. When we were in  the house, they were all very three-dimensional. Every house, three-  22  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  dimensional. Like ours was a castle, or one of them may have been a  corral. It wasn   t just this big flat thing. They   re still beautiful and more  detailed, maybe, than when we were there, but they were just different.  A lot of the smaller pieces might have been assembled behind the AGR  house. They would have started welding back there, I think because  there   s a certain time you   re allowed to go to the front yard. I think there  is a time because otherwise you   d start like in August.  I remember them being at someone   s parents    barn. Also, other house  decorations, we did parade floats back then. The floats got started on a  trailer somewhere     A tractor. (Laughter)     and then eventually were brought to the back of, like, the AGR house.  They   re not there on site, but they started in September.  Did we elect Homecoming chairmen? Did I know when I left my  freshman year that I was going to come back as the Homecoming  chairman, or did we elect at the beginning of the year? I remember being  so excited to be a sophomore and be Homecoming chairman. I really  thought I was all that.  To be asked by the AGRs would have been the end of your freshman  year. Yes, I think we were already selected and designated.  Yes, I think so because I think you   d already had a couple meetings.  Yes, probably. I was excited, though.  So at what point   let me first ask, were you on site the morning of the  accident?  I was not. I had just been dropped off by the guys who went to eat  breakfast.  I think I left their house about two or three o   clock in the morning  because I had a test the next day, so I was not.  I went to a seven thirty lab test because I had not been to class all week.  I was in class when I heard sirens, of which I now know what the sirens  were for.  So Friday morning on October 14, how did you get word of what  happened?  23  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  I   ll start. I was in this lab. I know there was another sister that was in it  with me. I just can   t remember who it was. We heard all these sirens, we  heard more sirens, and we heard more sirens. As soon as I got done, we  waited for each other, and we started back. All I recall is more and more  sirens and a smell of burning and smoke. I said,    It   s got to have been  somebody   s Homecoming dec or something.    I just kept running. I kind  of ran straight towards the Sigma Nu house. I do know Sandy had sent  somebody to find me to tell me what had happened because most of the  Theta house knew.  I don   t remember if that person caught me before I crossed University.  All I remember is I have a brother that was at the Sigma Nu house that  was a pledge. He and the Sigma Nu brothers were out front and stopped  me and said,    You can   t. You   ve got to go in the house.    I go,    Are  there any girls over there?    He said,    It   s been a horrible accident.    Not  until I got into the house at that time, (the Sigma Nus had their famous  Mom, Simon) Mom Simon and some of the guys, they took us into the  living room and told me what had happened. I think this other girl, and I  don   t even remember who it was   none of my sisters were there, but  here I was with my blood brother, which was great. I don   t remember  how I got back to the Theta house. I went out a little bit just to look over,  and I could see some areas where the fire department, I guess, had been  and all. I didn   t go any further and then got back to the Theta house.  I woke up   I can   t remember. I think somebody woke me up to tell me  that there had been this accident. Even now, it   s like it was surreal. It   s  like, you know,    Okay, right?    Not,    You   re kidding,    but,    There   s got  to be a mistake or something.    I remember coming downstairs at the  house, and Suzanne Carpenter, an alum, was there. I   m thinking,    This  must be serious because she   s here in the morning.    I mean, alums come  and go, but they   re not there in the morning. I think my dad came over.  My dad, even though we live in Stillwater, he has been in the Theta  house maybe two times. He came over.  So you knew it was serious.  I knew it was serious, but even now, it was like   . I think I saw you, and  you were kind of in a daze.  We did all-night pomp before they called it all-night pomp. We had done  two nights of that, maybe napping during the day on Thursday before we  all-night pomped. We had a huge amount of people over there with  spotlights and all, working on that house decoration. Some were back  working on the float, too, because we were doing both at the same time,  full participation. Everybody looked a little dazed, but it really became a  daze.  24  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Somebody woke me up. We   d been doing the all-night pomp. Kevin   Wilson  and I, and I don   t remember. Maybe it was Weldon  Kissler . I  thought maybe a couple girls went with us, too. We went to eat  breakfast. I was just refreshing my memory with what I wrote back then  about us arguing about who wanted to pay for breakfast. I think they  dropped us off or whatever, and my head hit the pillow, and I was  asleep. The next thing I knew, somebody was waking me up. I talked to,  I think it was Weldon at the AGR house. Of course, all of us wanted to  go over there and see. They were very,    No, we   re not going to let you  get past the back of the house, so don   t try.    That was our first  experience. I remember sitting out on the curb or something, seeing a  van go by with news cameras going like this.  I remember that.  I thought it was tacky. Somebody else said that was tacky, but then I  thought,    I guess that   s how everyone else feels when a news camera  goes by them,    and we   re watching it on the news going,    Look at the  sad people,    and then you   re one of them.  Back in the day, it was just CNN. I was telling Sandy last week, I said,     I   ll never forget   .    My dad worked at University of Tulsa, and he  listened to his radio. KRMG broke in about a campus incident at a  fraternity and said    Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity.    He picked up the  phone and called my mother and said,    We   re going to Stillwater.    They  drove up here to Stillwater and don   t know from Tulsa to Stillwater who  was involved. They had a son that was a Sigma Nu; they had a daughter  that was part of the Homecoming committee. KRMG and CNN, and  look where we are nowadays.  Cheryl Plaxico had said (I   ve got contact information for some of the  people) the Thetas and AGRs had changed jerseys sometime during the  midnight pomp just for fun, so when some of them got killed, there was  some confusion at first about who died. Whoever I talked to at the AGR  house, it was just like,    The guys with cowboy boots died. The three  guys with cowboy boots died, and the four guys with tennis shoes  lived.    They were going to the funerals, and they had holes in their  fingers. Some of them said a few on the shoes and stuff, too.  Keith Kissee was an AGR. He was one of the guys that was helping  move the scaffolding. He told me that that day, it depended on what  shoes you put on if you were going to live or die. He said he woke up,  from whenever this happened, across the street in a doorway of one of  the shops across the street on Washington Street because the charge of  the electricity, I guess, had thrown him. He was a big guy. He was six  25  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Jobe  four, two hundred pounds, big guy.  He was big.  He said he had holes in the soles in his heels of his shoes, and his heels  were burnt on his feet because he said that day it just depended on what  footwear you decided to put on.  Yes. I remember this, and I remember us reviewing the articles, too,  being on that scaffolding. I remember standing below, somebody had a  concern about it. I don   t remember. I think it was one of the AGRs,  about it being close to the power line. I think they called somebody in.  They called somebody over. There was a discussion. I think they did  inspections, then. We must have passed the inspection. I remember  being on that scaffolding when it wiggled. I mean, scaffolding obviously  is going to wiggle a little bit. There was an evaluation before it tipped  about whether it might. I don   t know if I thought of it in relation to the  power line or just falling over and hurting people.  No, I think the height was the thing. I do recall the inspection. I just  know being up there, as you   re up there pomping the night before,  you   re like,    Hmm.    Of course, you look over, there   s the Coney  Island     There   s a good view  (Laughter)     and you   re just like,    Wow, that   s not all that far away from me.     Again, that   s exactly that area is where they were moving the scaffold  around the castle. I mean, when you get up there and get on the  scaffolding, first of all, you have to make it up there. You get up there  and you   re starting to work on this, and you look, and you   re like,    It   s  not that far away.     Pomping then, (this sounds silly) it was different. Just on the way over,  we went by the house decoration the Thetas are working on this year.  These squares that they use now are like two-inch squares. We were  using four- or five-inch squares.  Our chicken wire must have had bigger holes.  It   s micro.  Now it   s like, I guess it   s all digital how they project the picture. Going  back, maybe this is why these decorations are flatter now and not more  three-dimensional like when we   . Maybe it   s to hopefully prevent  something like this from happening again. I don   t know. I don   t know  26  Bass  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  when the changes   but the pomping, you actually climbed up on the  thing to do it. You didn   t do a bunch of pomping in a room and then  bring out a sheet and put it on. You actually did it on the piece, itself, so  you would have had more bodies out there working on it than they do  now. The bodies working on it now, I guess, are in dining rooms or   .  And they must have had big lights on us.  We had some big   we were lucky we did it with the AGRs. They had  all that equipment. They had all the equipment.  Do you know why they were moving the scaffolding?  To finish up some areas there on the castle part. I believe it   s  documented in what Sandy has also put in, that they had some areas they  were going to try to finish up, so they were trying to move it around to  that spot because, you know, it is safer to move it around than to have  somebody that   s up here on the scaffolding lean here and then fall. They  were moving it to finish up some pomping.  They were actually moving it for safety reasons, I guess.  Well, yes. Who would   ve known?  How did you find out the news of the three brothers that passed away?  When did you get word that these were the three?  The two of them, I didn   t. I just knew Kevin, the other homecoming  chairman. FYI, I thought he was so cute, honestly. I was working on  Homecoming, and I   d just be going,    Hi.    I thought he was so cute. This  AGR I talked to said,    It   s Kevin.    I wouldn   t have known. Were the  other two pledges? At least one of them was a pledge.  They were both pledges.  One of them had an older brother, so I know somebody said they had to  send somebody to get that guy   s brother who was in class, so he could  find out from them before he found out another way.  It kind of trickles on in the Greek community. Kevin had a sister who  was a Pi Phi. I can   t remember. Was it Merle  George    s brother? I can   t  remember if it was Merle who had the brother or who it was.  I think it was.  I think it was Merle   s brother, had an older brother.  27  Bass  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  And Megan was walking by there, another one of our sisters that wrote  an email. She said what she saw was one of the AGRs trying to get in his  truck. He was going to try to move the scaffolding off the power line by  driving into it. There were people there saying,    Don   t do it.     I remember that now. I remember my brother telling me they were like,     Stop, stop, stop.    It wasn   t going to help.  So what happens after the accident? What happens at this point? Is a  decision made?  It was taken out of our hands.  Everything stopped.  We go, and we were at Theta house, as you have heard what Sandy said.  AGRs didn   t want us there. They didn   t need us there. That   s your  reaction to,    Well, we   ve got to go help.       No, we don   t, because we  needed help.    Our alums rushed to circle us.  I remember I was mad that they withdrew. So was Lorrie Reed because  we were of that nature,    Kevin would have wanted us to finish it.    We  were almost done. He would have wanted us to finish it, but obviously it  was the right decision to do what the alums did, I think, in hindsight,  obviously. I think OSU   I   m surprised that they still had awards. You  were saying you were mad that they still gave out the sweepstakes  trophy and stuff, weren   t you?  Yes, the decision was made by the alums that we would withdraw.  Theta alums.  Theta alums. Something had to be done with our parade float     Oh, yes, it was almost finished.     so we started clearing the Theta parking lot. We had gotten a phone  call, I think. Somebody from the AGRs or the Sigma Nus or whoever,  Sig Alphs, they were moving the float to the Theta parking lot.  It was the AGR parking lot, wasn   t it?  Yes, it was in the back. It was moved there, and then all of a sudden, it   s  like the Greek community is finishing our float in the Theta parking lot.  A few of us felt it was therapeutic to go out there and do a little pomping  28  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  ourselves.  I don   t even remember that.  I remember, I guess, because I did go out there. Then as parents arrived,  we all made it through that night. The next day was the football game.  They had the parade. They did not cancel the parade. They had the  parade. Our house decoration was totally knocked down by noon.  It was gone by then. They took it all down.  It was gone by noon on Friday of Walk Around. We had a sorority sister  that was up for homecoming queen. Again, that would   ve been points.  She won homecoming queen. That was really nice. OSU said they were  not going to give out the sweepstakes award. OSU gave out a  sweepstakes award. Talk about,    What were we going to do now?    We  stayed until halftime. They gave out a   there was all this cheering, and  you were just like   .  Yes.  That was so insulting.  That was.  It was very hard. It was like,    Okay.    We go back to the Theta house. I  remember walking with some of the AGRs back to the AGR house. Of  course, all their alums were there. What happened after that is they had  to get together and wait to find out until the AGRs    families had had  times as to when and where the service was going to be, and how do we  take care of the sisters that need help, and what do we do.  I remember driving with Weldon Kissler at night. I think we drove all  one whole night. I think we went to Bartlesville. I have no idea. I don   t  even know if we talked. We just drove. We just couldn   t process it.  There just wasn   t a way to process it.  It was so huge.  You   ve got to remember, we were twenty years old, eighteen or nineteen  years old, and you   ve all of a sudden been handed this real, adult kind of  blow.  Did you notice memorials popping up on the property?  I didn   t notice anything.  29  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  I don   t. I   m sure there were. I   m sure there were, but I think, for myself,  I was in a daze. I remember going to Kevin   s funeral.  Yes.  We went a long way. We were in the car a long time. When we went  there, I was with Keith and somebody else, I think maybe Cheri   Neundorf  and Brent  Henderson . I think that   s who we went with. We  went all the way to Beaver, Oklahoma. I remember the church was kind  of out in the middle   it was very rural. It was neat, but it was rural. We  got in the car, and we drove all the way back. It was a long day in the  car.  As an aside, I drive back and forth to Colorado a lot. One of the ways I  can go, goes about twenty miles through Beaver, Oklahoma. I always     there was a pull.    I   m going to go visit his grave. Aw, that   s dumb.     Then I wouldn   t do it and wouldn   t do it, then there was a pull. So  finally, one of my times, I did. I looked everywhere and couldn   t find  Kevin Wilson. I kind of remembered where we were standing on that  lonely hill. It was not a very big     It was, like, up there.  Yes, yes, yes. I couldn   t find it. Anyway, there was a number there:    If  you   ve got any questions about the cemetery, call.    I thought,    Well,  dang it. If I   ve come this far, I   m going to call.    We exchanged phone  calls, so the next time I went through, he told me to go to this one place.  It was the wrong Kevin Wilson. It was somebody in Vietnam. He goes,     Oh  Do you know what? Call somebody down at the Ag office.    Mr.  and Mrs. Wilson moved years ago, and they dug Kevin back up and took  him with them. I have no idea where they went. I   m sure some of the  AGRs do. So he   s not in the Beaver cemetery anymore.  I do remember a couple of years ago (I told the girls this on the way  over) it was Homecoming, and I was here. I went with my friend  Martha, who was a Pi Phi and my childhood friend. We went by,  looking at all of the decorations and then the AGR house. I was looking  at the decorations, and there was a picture of the three guys. Boy, you  could have hit me with a baseball bat. Even a few years later, sometimes  it comes back, and it   s just so fresh.  Did you attend the other two funerals?  I attended one of them. I think there was very few of us that attended. I  think the very first one was, it was one of the pledges.  30  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Yes. I went to one of those, and then I went to the one in Beaver.  I didn   t go to that one. I don   t know what I was so busy with. We  couldn   t go to them all. It was,    So and so is going to go. Sandy and I, of  course   .     We had representation.  We had the representation; it was there. The Beaver, Oklahoma, to  Kevin   s, yes, it was a long way, but one thing that when you   re working  together for a lot of weeks and a lot of months and a lot of dining rooms  and outside music, there sure is a lot of good Steve Miller music.  (Laughter)  There is. You   re right.  One thing I really remember, there was a lot of eight-track music in the  car. I went, and I couldn   t tell you who I was with. I might have been  with you. I don   t even remember. We were all together, AGRs and  Thetas together. After that funeral, I was ready to      Six hundred more  miles. Crank that Steve Miller     Music is always reminiscent of certain  times in your life. Music during that time   .  Remember Spav   s?  Yes, yes   Yes, and the different places we would go to.  We went to Spav   s a lot with the AGRs.  We did a lot of fun stuff with the AGRs.  Who would name a restaurant Spav   s?  I don   t even want to know. (Laughter)  Did y   all attend the memorial at the Seretean Center?  Yes.  What was that like?  I have no memory of it. I read about it, but I don   t remember.  31  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Bass  Jobe  I   m sure I did.  I think I was talking to Kim, another sister, about that. She said it was  just kind of,    Oh, is this it?    It happened. It was like,    Okay, we   re all  here together because we   re all here together, and we   re all leaving  together.    I think everybody was so in shock at that time, and it was the  Saturday morning before the football game.  Yes. Coming on the heels of staying up so late, I think   I don   t know.  I   ll use that as an excuse.  You know, I think it was nice that that was done for the university, but  why did they still give out a sweepstakes award?  That bothers you still. (Laughs)  It does. It   s like,    Okay, that was very great. That was kind.    Nobody  knows how to react to something like this. This had not happened  before. Did he have another university president he could call  somewhere else? Well, no.  Kind of a seat-of-your-pants decision.  Nobody   s homecoming is like Oklahoma State   s. I won   t be critical of it,  but years after, it was like, that wasn   t even necessary. It wasn   t  necessary for me to hear other Greek people cheering.  Right. What   s there to cheer about?     Yay, we won the sweepstakes.     I do remember, like you said, we left at halftime. I remember that  because we waited for halftime because Suzy  Short    the homecoming  queen thing was already decided. It wasn   t just announced on the day of  the football game. They announced it on Wednesday or something that  she had won. So to support her   she still had to go out on the field and  still had to accept this, and graciously, so she did. She didn   t want to be  nominated in the beginning. (Laughter) This is a very shy woman.  Beautiful woman.  Beautiful but very shy.  She   s been emailing her.  I remember we decided to go to the game to support Suzy, and then at  32  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Bass  halftime we all left. We were sitting with the guys.  What was the mood on campus weeks following?  It   s hard to say because the mood on campus really revolved around us  in the house. Personally, because I don   t know what everybody else was  feeling, but I know the house feeling, everybody was still pretty numb,  sick. You keep going back to the sleep deprivation thing. You   re still  trying to recover from that, then this other jolt, and then you   re still a  student. I do remember, for me, my transcript, I did not do well that  semester with my grades. I didn   t care.  I remember the Thetas obviously processed it different because some of  them really weren   t dealing that close with Homecoming. I remember  coming home from one of the funerals, (I think I told you this, Louan)  and somebody was yelling at me, not yelling, but I had missed  something where I was going to get a pledge daughter or something. I  was still so numb. I realized people were moving on, and we   ve got  Theta activities and responsibility. I just wasn   t   it was completely  foreign to me whatever they were talking about. I couldn   t understand. I  just couldn   t understand. I was in shock.  I think the AGRs and Thetas were just handling it amongst ourselves.  Gradually, we   d get together with more and more groups of them as time  would warrant that happening. I understand what you   re saying about  seeing people move ahead. There wasn   t anybody in the Greek  community that was just,    How are y   all doing?    as you started back to  class and stuff. That great group of the Greek community that came out  to finish that float and to do what they could and some of those people  that knew a lot of the sisters, they weren   t sure how to handle it. Nobody  in the community knew how to handle this, but you handle it by showing  respect and being kind and just being yourself. That   s all we really  needed at that point.  So y   all were still in the middle of your college careers. How was the  next Homecoming?  We were gone. We graduated. I was still here, in Stillwater.  I was, too.  I don   t think the Thetas participated.  Well, it would   ve been an off-year, anyway, since the other one was an  on-year.  33  Torres  Bass  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Bass  They were asked by AGR to do it again, and they did.  Did they?  They just didn   t do   .  It was low-key.  It was low-key. I was still here on campus until December, but that   s  what it was. That   s what they did. It was low-key.  So it   s 2013 right now. It   s been about thirty-six years.  No, I think you   re wrong. You better check your math. (Laughter) We  graduated very young. Has it been thirty-six years?  Yes, it has. I was trying to do the math on my fingers this morning.  You don   t have that many fingers. You need a couple more hands.  (Laughs)  So it   s been many years later. How about that? That   s better?  (Laughter)  Perfect.  I   m liking her better and better.  It   s been many, many years later since the accident. Does a year go by  that you still think about it?  Oh, yes. Like I said earlier, you go to Homecoming, and (Sandy told me  this) they have the pictures of these folks on everything they do. I didn   t  realize that. When I was back after not having attended Homecoming for  a while, maybe five or six years ago, I saw it. It   s one of those things  that sometimes it feels like thirty-six years ago; sometimes it feels like it  was yesterday.  Certainly after you have your own children   I don   t know. For some  reason when I found out his parents had moved him, I thought our pain  and loss is nothing compared to what his family went through and what  his parents went through, I   m sure, their whole lives. I have no idea if  they   re still alive or not. But, you know, can you imagine? You send  your son off to school to do a Homecoming decoration. That wasn   t  exactly in the cards.  34  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Bass  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Bass  I believe that even my parents were worried about us as to the trauma  that we went through at the age of,    I think they   ll be okay. I think  they   ll be okay,    but also thinking it could have been their kids and  those that did survive were so lucky. I remember at one time, we   d said  we could have been going to six funerals in a week. We could have been  going to seven funerals in a week.  Yes.  Yes, as bad as it was, it could have been worse.  We were just like, because we had three, this will be history.  Because of what footwear you wore.  It was exactly that. There   s not a Friday before Homecoming I don   t  think about it.  I don   t come back to Stillwater much. I don   t think about it that much. I  told them (I don   t know if this is weird or not) when I sent each of our  four kids off to college, I feel like it   s this sort of greater beginning of  your own life to seek your own path. Like if your kid got into Yale,  which none of my kids did, and I said,    Go to Yale, Yale, Yale,    then  they   re in a Homecoming accident, you think,    I don   t want to direct  their life anymore.    Like if Kevin   s parents had forced him to go to OSU  and then he got killed   that   s how it affected me. How would you feel if  you had any sort of input in that decision?  I feel like it   s the child   s beginning when they go off to college to really  seek their own path and for the parents not to influence them at all. This  Homecoming accident is why I felt that way. Maybe that   s very weird,  but it doesn   t feel weird to me because I think if I was a parent that had  forced my kid to go to a school and then had a horrible accident like  that, I would have felt responsible, whereas if the kid picks the school  and they   re happy, happy, happy with it, if they pass away due to a  horrible accident, that   s their chosen path. Does that make sense? It  affected me when each of my four kids picked a school.  I don   t think that   s strange at all. I think it   s actually good parenting.  Good for you. I think if you can   t learn when something horrible like  this happens, if you can   t take something from it, then shame on you. If  you took this from it and can pass it along to your own children, then  good for you.  Thank you.  35  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Bass  Torres  Bass  Torres  Do you ever share your memories from Homecoming that year with  other sisters, maybe current students? Is it even talked about?  Well, I do. With having a daughter that pledged last year as a  sophomore, she   s heard about it. We lived out of Oklahoma for a while,  but I think I brought her   she was like in eighth grade. Came with a  sorority sister, went to the AGR decoration. I had heard about the boys  were always memorialized every year. This was my first year back to go  to it. I just stood there with her, and she looked at me. We will never  forget it. Yes, you had to have some tears, and yes, it makes it very  fresh, but it   s a good fresh because we need to never forget them. My  daughter has known that since then.  My daughter is a go-getter. She   s like an apprentice for the  Homecoming committee for the Thetas. She barely said    boo    to me at  the house earlier. (Laughter) I wasn   t allowed to do that to my mom.  Again, tradition is important, and Homecoming is a tradition. It   s  becoming almost too big. Too much money is being pumped into it, too  much competition. I think it   s good. They still need to have  Homecoming. What would the merchants of Stillwater do if they didn   t  have Homecoming? Why are they giving so many tests during the week  of Homecoming? It   s just one of those things that   s tradition, and you do  it, and it   s pride for the alumni. Yes, you want to beat the opposing  football team that weekend.  The AGRs, I think I   ve seen Homecoming once since I was here. I saw  their   I don   t know if they had pictures. They had their names. Do the  AGRs that are there   they   re in their own lives. They don   t know these  guys. They   ve got this concern, that concern. Do they just go roll out the  Kevin/Merle/Randy  Logan  memorial and whack it up there and then  put it in the closet, or do they really     Last year it was on a   apparently they have to have so many movable  parts, and that   s the way it is every year. Last year it was like a flip. It  flipped, and there was Merle. I had to watch it flip several times, and  then my eyes teared up.  I wondered. I felt so remote and not involved and older and all that. I  just wonder how the current students   .  Well, and see, there   s a couple of active Thetas that are nieces of people  who were in our house. After reading what we   ve had, I think it   s time  we bring it to Chapter. It needs to be taught. They need to see the bond  that was developed and what had happened. Houses are bigger, more  and more members. Not everybody participates. There   s always going to  be a little bickering of,    So and so is not out there helping        36  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Nykolaiszyn  Torres  Bass  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Your program has allowed us to   we   ve done more communicating just  after   I think the email I got asked for the class of    63 or earlier. I didn   t  read that part before I responded to you. (Laughter)  That   s okay.  I realized that on the second or third email. I thought,    She said    class of     63,    and I   m not that old.    Since that time because of Facebook, and  we   ve got some other people that try to keep us together, we   ve done  more communicating about it and,    Do you remember this?       No, I  don   t remember that.    For that, I thank you because I think it   s time. I  hope the AGRs will be able to open up now.  Well, you know, we could wait to the fiftieth reunion, or we could take  steps now and help fill some of the gaps. Again, I think it   s important  campus history. It   s history for your sorority and for the AGRs that  should be recorded in some way. We should not forget the memories of  these three students. I   m sure as time goes on, y   all are still healing, as  well, right?  Sure.  You don   t forget.  Coming to Homecoming helps you to heal. You see the good in it. We  remember the good, and the good that we had in it.  It kind of makes me tired, really, honestly. It really does. After this, I   m  going to get in the car and go. I really am. (Laughter) It   s too much.  It   s a lot of emotion. It   s a lot.  Well, as we wind down, when I interview alumni, I notice something very  clear. I notice that OSU alumni are very loyal to the school. What is it  that sparks such loyalty in our alumni?  Hatred of OU. (Laughter)  I   ve got to take my red shirt off. (Laughter)  We know what we had when we were here as students. Those  friendships are friendships for a lifetime. That bond is there whether you  meet again at tailgating or you come for Homecoming every twenty-five  years. You just   friendliest campus in America, very friendly.  37  Jobe  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Jobe  Bass  I think some of it, too, is just the geographical location of OSU. You   re  out here. There   s nothing else. It   s OSU. Believe me, I grew up here.  Now this is like a metropolis compared to then, but it   s still OSU in  Stillwater. We   re not a tagged-on thing of a larger city or anything.  You   re kind of out here in the middle of nowhere. Isolation kind of  breeds solidarity in a community that I think you don   t get a lot of places  anymore. We   re still isolated. It is a big school. It   s not like a 15,000-  person school. It   s a big school, and they do big sports. They do big  things, but I think because of the physical isolation of where it is, I think  that kind of breeds more loyalty, too. You   re in Stillwater; you   ve got to  find something to do.  I think having other alums reach out to me, like the Thetas   we   ve had  reunions here at the house and stuff. Someone   s taken the time to do that  and to get us back together. That   s made a real difference to me because  someone takes you, again going back to college, and says,    I want to be  part of your life. I want to talk to you.    Suddenly, we   ve got more of a  connection with either the Theta house or with Stillwater or with this  project or whatever. I wasn   t the organizing type. If someone will  organize me into it, I   ll come. Someone has. Sandy Meuller did. I really  enjoyed catching back up with OSU and the other Thetas, et al.  One more question. Obviously, your sisterhood has been a big part of  your college life here on campus. Can you talk a little about the role, the  importance of that for you, having that connection, that bond?  Well, because Kappa Alpha Theta and many other sororities and  fraternities are a national thing, (it   s not only at Oklahoma State, not  only do you have the bond and anchoring of here) it   s kind of neat.  They   re everywhere. My mom was a Theta at TU. You have the legacy  thing. I think being part of the Greek system here, because the system  here is such an active system and they do participate not just within  themselves but they also participate with the residence halls and  Stillwater as a community, I think just the participation. If you   re  working with other people in your own sorority or other sororities to  whatever common goal, be it Homecoming, be it the canned food drive  or whatever it is, I think that shared experience kind of thing, I think that  fosters some loyalty and some anchoring.  I agree. I think it could be with the band or the football team or whatever  you are. In our experience it was Theta. It was really making you step up  and do these activities that as an individual, I can   t do Spring Sing or  whatever, but as a group, someone tells you that   s older than you, they  bring you in and say,    You all can do this. We have done this, and we  can do it.    You get to look at somebody and say,    Oh, we can do that.     That keeps going in life. You realize that at some point it   s our turn to  38  Jobe  Bass  Torres  Bass  Jobe  Torres  Jobe  Torres  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  look down and reach up from somebody else and say,    You can do this.  You can. We   ve been doing it. You can do it again.    I appreciate it very  much, the people that put in the effort to keep us together.  I also think, too, that a large part of going to school   academics  certainly are important, but I think you need to learn from the people and  the things going on around you as much as from the textbooks. I just  think that   s part of the round education that you can get, and I think it   s  an important part. Anybody can go to school online, but if you get out  there in the trenches with people, that makes your education that much  better.  I wish we could somehow let the families of these three guys know how  much we appreciated their lives, whether we knew them well or didn   t  know them well. I don   t know how that could be, but I wish we could.  They   ve gone on all these years, and they haven   t heard anybody say,    I  was with him thirty minutes before he died, and he wouldn   t let me pay  the check.    If it was my kid, I   d want to hear that story.  I don   t really think the AGRs that were with us at that time need to hear  that, but it is pretty cool to realize nobody   s going,    Well, those Thetas  never said anything about anything about how hard we worked and what  all we had to deal with.    None of us whined. We were all very unified in  being together.  Clearly, the emotional burden had to be much harder on them.  Oh my gosh, I can   t even imagine.  Oh, gosh yes, but they were   we shared a lot of cheers together and  some conversations, but these guys were men.  They were forced to be, quick, in a hurry.  This was very, very, very fast. I would think maybe the AGRs that  would get involved in talking to you and who we have sorority sisters  married to could forge that onto siblings if the parents are still living  somewhere.  Well, as we close out our interview, is there anything else you   d like to  say that we have not talked about today? I know we focused our  interview focusing on a specific event, but is there anything else you   d  like to add?  I   d like to add that I have some emails and other information. I have  something that I wrote back then that   s on the original Theta stationery. I  39  Torres  Bass  Torres  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  Bass  Nykolaiszyn  have some items I   d like to give you, that if you all are going to do some  other historical things, they   re contacts that might help you. One of the  girls, Lorrie, is married to an AGR. They   re a great couple resource. She  was at the house when it happened. I   ve spoken with her. She   s now an  Olympic ice skating judge. She was a cheerleader here, too. A great  person. Some other great resources, we   d like to help you if you want  more resources. I have no idea if you   re going to do this interview and  the next interview and then that   s going to be enough, but there are some  great people out there that have great stories that are OSU-related that  can also help you, not only with this. Lorrie   s story is great.  Her husband, presently, that was an AGR, he was the pledge trainer, so  he was extremely working with all these pledges.  Yes, he was in close to those guys.  He has probably a fantastic recollection.  Right, and their information is in there, too. That   s all I wanted to say is  that we want to help if you need help, or we want to shut up if you want  us to shut up. (Laughter)  Well, we definitely appreciate your time coming to see us, especially  during Homecoming. Welcome back to OSU, especially if you haven   t  been back in a while.  Thank you. It looks pretty good   We hope you enjoy Walk Around tonight. Thank you, once again.  -------  -------
