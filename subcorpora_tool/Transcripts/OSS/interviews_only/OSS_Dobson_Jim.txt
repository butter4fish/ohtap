 Gill. Today is April 18, 2009. We   re on the campus of  Oklahoma State University in Gallagher-Iba Arena. I   m interviewing  Jim Dobson, who played on the 1959 OSU baseball NCAA  Championship team. This interview is part of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program, a project of the O-State  Stories  Project.  Jim, I know we said you played on the 1959 NCAA Championship  baseball team and your teammates are here on campus for the 50 year  reunion, is that right?  That   s my understanding.  Celebrating that championship year, is this special for you?  Absolutely. Wish we would do it every year.  Oh, yeah. Who are some of the guys on the team you were especially  close with? Do you remember?  Well, there were four of us that went to the same high school in  Oklahoma City, Capitol Hill. Dick Soergel, Ray Bond, Don Soergel, and  myself. I played against Dick all the way back in junior high. He was a  year ahead of me, but then we played two years in high school then we  played through his graduation at OSU.  So, you all were pretty close before you ever got to OSU then?  Well, yes. We played a lot of athletic games because Dick was a three  sport letterman here at OSU and I played three sports in high school, and  actually I tried to play three here but I only played about a year and a  half in basketball and two years in football. So, I got to play a lot with  Dick.  5  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  You were a running back, as I recall, Jim. Is that right?  Yes, I was a running back.  Starting running back, I think.  I started a little while until I got hit too many times.  Get some concussions, did you?  No, no, no. I had a knee operated on, and forewent my senior year in  football and concentrated on baseball.  I want to ask you some questions about your team and obviously about  the championship year. But first can we go back and share a little bit  about where you grew up, about your family, some of your early life?  Okay. Just ad-libbing then. Well, I grew up mostly in Oklahoma City  and lived on the north side until I was about five and remembered very  little of it, and then my parents moved over to the south side of  Oklahoma City. I attended Oklahoma City public schools, went through  Jackson Junior High School. Then I went to Capitol Hill Senior High  School and was fortunate enough to have coaches like Coach C.B.  Speegle, Cliff   s brother, and  Cliff  Speegle interested in me.  Cliff   came and talked to me on the high school campus and offered me a  scholarship, and I accepted it and came to OSU. The one thing that I  thought was a little bit interesting, maybe to somebody, when Coach  Speegle was interviewing me, he said,    You know, we really want you,     and so forth and I said,    Well, I have a question I   d like to ask you,    and  he said,    What is it?    I said,    Well, if I come on a football scholarship,  could I also play baseball?    And he said,    If you want to, that   s fine.    I  kind of think that was my memory, but we   re talking fifty-plus years  ago. That was kind of the way he came down and when I made the  decision to come to Oklahoma State.  Can you recall your interest in Oklahoma State? Was there a certain  reason or a certain person that attracted you to Oklahoma State?  Well, Coach Speegle was a very excellent recruiter, and he came to talk  to me and I thought that he was really a very classy individual. He said  one thing to me, and you impress high school athletes by trying to  compliment them. He was very complimentary and he said,    Well, you  know, last year we think we got the best player in the state of Oklahoma  in Dick Soergel.    And he said,    We want the best player this year in Jim  Dobson.    (Laughter) That sort of makes you turn your head. It   s very  flattering. Thank you.  6  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Pretty flattering. So, what year did you enroll at Oklahoma State?  1957.  Do you recall what your first impressions of OSU were? Of course, you  might have been on campus before you got here. But when you got here,  what were some of your early impressions of the campus?  Well, my first vivid memory of OSU was   I don   t think I had ever been  on campus until I was recruited. If I had, I do not remember it. But I had  been to OU, and I remember that the OU campus was a big contrast in  my mind to the OSU campus because everything was green and just  looked great. OU had a lot of that red clay and they hadn   t planted grass  on it, and I thought to myself,    Gosh, this seems unusual for a big  university like Oklahoma to have that kind of         you know, the grass  wasn   t all over the place. OSU was just beautiful. Theta Pond was  gorgeous. Trees, grass, everything was manicured very well, and I was  quite impressed more than I thought I would be because it was really a  beautiful campus.  What are some highlights of your non-sports undergraduate experience?  Activities, things you did   are there some memories that stand out for  you?  Well, I   ll tell you a humorous story. I thought it was a little humorous,  and I hate to say it this way, but I don   t know how else to bring this up.  I   m not bragging or anything; I   m just trying to give you facts. Before  the College World Series in 1959, I was a sophomore at that time, I had  taken a speech class here on the campus because I was a pretty bad  public speaker. I thought I needed that. So, I took the class and I think I  made a C in the class and I was really pretty bad. I   ll jump forward now  to when we won the    59 championship. I think it was the trainer Byron  Bird. Did you ever know him?  I knew Byron.  I thought you did. I think it was him that said to me the night before we  played the championship game,    Get your speech ready,    and I said,     Pardon me?    He said,    Get your speech ready. You   re going to be the  MVP.    I got to thinking about that and I thought,    Well, he knows kind  of what he   s talking about and maybe I better.    Well, I   m going to fast  forward a little more now when the game was over and we won it. Why  I did get that award and I didn   t know it, but it was on the radio. I didn   t  know it, but my speech teacher was listening to the game. This was in  June of    59 when we won it, and so I didn   t come back to the campus  until September when we started the next year. My speech teacher  7  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  looked me up and he said,    Jim, I   m so proud of you. I told everybody  that you were one of my students.    He said,    You socked it to them on  that speech.    So, I thought that was kind of a humorous story because I  was terrible in the class. (Laughs)  Did you ask if it was too late to change your grade in the course?  (Laughter) I should   ve done that.  What do you remember were some of your favorite hangouts on campus  and off campus?  One of the things that I do really remember was that I was pretty serious  about baseball and my ambition was to go to the big leagues. One of my  teachers in high school came up and talked to me in class, and when I  think I was a sophomore in high school, and he said,    You   re going to  get an opportunity to go to a big college university, but they   re not going  to take you if you don   t make those grades.    I remembered that, and I  kind of buckled down and tried to get my grades because the other thing  he said to me   maybe a lot of people won   t know this, but the south side  of Oklahoma City is not the rich part of town. Mr. Hiller was the  teacher   s name and he says, I think he said this to me, forgive me if my  memory is not really good, but you   ll get the point. He said,    This is  your ticket out of here and you need to take advantage of it and get those  grades.    I thought that was really good advice because I got an  opportunity to get a college education through my athletics, and  especially football was what got me the scholarship, and I switched over  after that. But one of my memories was that I thought that was really my  opportunity to find a pathway in life that would get me far down the  road, and a college education was very important to me.  So, you spent a lot of time in the library, then?  Well, I don   t think I spent a lot of time in the library, but in those days I  thought about girls, and if I could get a C that was fine. But when this  teacher told me that,    They   re not going to take you if you don   t have  good grades,    I ended up being on what they call the Principal   s Honor  Roll. You had to have a B or better average, and I wasn   t a straight A  student by any stretch of the imagination, but I was able to make the  Principal   s Honor Roll and so I must   ve made some Bs. I do remember  the one class I made an A in was Trigonometry. I was really proud of  that because the teacher just said,    Oh you need to come to my class,     and she saw things that I couldn   t see at the time.  Jim, let me fast forward a little bit. I want to get back to that  championship year with the team. But can you tell us a little bit about  8  Dobson  your career and your life after you left Oklahoma State University?  Well, I didn   t graduate because I didn   t have enough hours. My ambition  was to play as much as I could and I wanted to be a three sport person. I  played football, basketball and baseball, but it got to be such a really  tough drag that I didn   t have time to do anything but go to class and go  to practice or the games, and then no time to study. So, about halfway  through my sophomore year in basketball I had had some injuries and I  was having difficulties with my ankles, so I dropped the basketball  because I just didn   t have enough time. I was doing nothing but  practicing and going to class and didn   t even have time to study. I just  knew I couldn   t make it that way. So, that gave me a split between the  seasons of football and baseball. After I graduated I didn   t have enough  hours because I had cut my hours back. It was tough being a student and  a participant. I loved to participate and compete so I needed eighteen  hours.  Well, after the last year in 1961 we played in the College World Series  again. We got beat in the final game by Southern Cal, one to nothing.  So, we came in second place that year. Then I signed a contract with the  Houston Astros. In those days they called it the Houston Colt 45s and  the next year they changed it to the Astros. I spent about two and a half,  three years in that organization and got released, came back and went to  work in the business world. I had gotten my major was in Business  Administration, but after my first year of pro ball (I went to  Jacksonville, Florida). And at the end of that season in September, I  can   t remember exactly what happened but it may have been the Cuban  Bay of Pigs thing when they had that fiasco, and President JFK froze all  of the National Guard units all over the United States. I was scheduled  by the Houston organization to protect their players and I was already  twenty-two years old. In those days, they thought you ought to be in the  big leagues by the time you were twenty-two. They wanted to get you  when you were eighteen and send you through the minor leagues for  four or five years, and then you either made it or you didn   t. So, I  needed eighteen hours and Houston said,    We can   t protect you from the  draft.    In those days they had the draft. Everybody had to register for the  draft, as you well know, but the kids today don   t know that.  I called them and I said,    What am I going to do? I   m scheduled to        and they said,    We got the same problem with everybody else in the  organization. You   re just on your own. We can   t do anything. They   re  going to draft you, or whatever they   re going to do.    Well, I got the  paper out and started reading it real big after President Kennedy  announced that all the National Guard units were frozen. It said  in  the  last line, if I recall this correctly,    Anybody that   s in school making a C  average or better, we   ll classify you as 2A.    1A, you were gone. I said,  9  Gill  Dobson  Gil  Dobson  Gill  Dobson     Well, wait a minute. I didn   t graduate. I needed eighteen hours.    So,  what I did was, I went ahead and enrolled in OSU the next semester after  I played that summer complete in Jacksonville.  I spent the next semester getting my degree. eighteen hours was a pretty  good load, as you well know, so I took a couple of fairly easy courses  and one of them was called Marriage. And, of all things, I met my future  wife in the marriage class and we got married, were married twenty-four  years and had two wonderful daughters as a result of that. So, then, it  was kind of a turmoil time, and I went back and played more baseball  and I got released. Then I wanted to play so badly, Roy Peterson, one of  the guys that   s on the    59 team, was two years older than I was and he  was playing in the Chicago Cubs organization. I   d done everything I  knew to get back into pro ball and I contacted him. I said,    Can you help  me?    He said,    Well, I   ll talk to some guys.    They sent me a contract.  So, Roy got me back in for a short stint and I went back to pro ball for a  short while. I was married by then and didn   t make it so maybe that,  hopefully, is an interesting story for somebody that might care.  So, your career, then   what did you wind up in?  Oh, then I went into the business world because I had a degree in  business administration with management and psychology as minors. I  went to work for an oil company for five years and then I went to work  for a few other companies that lasted anywhere from five to twelve  years, but it was all in the field of business. I was in management for a  while and decided that I couldn   t make as much money. so I went into  sales and made twice as much money and was twice as happy.  That   s great. Let   s talk about the championship year. First of all, tell me  some things you remember about Coach Toby Greene. At that time, he  was pretty far along in his career, wasn   t he?  Yes. I would   ve estimated him at the time to be somewhere in his sixties  and I thought he was ready for retirement. But I later found out that he  coached for several years after I left in    61. But Coach Greene was a  man of very few words. In the three years that I played for him, if he  ever spoke more than three words in a sentence to me, I cannot  remember it. But Coach Greene kept most of the stuff inside his head  and you didn   t know really what he was thinking.  What do you think were his strengths as a coach?  I think his strengths were that he did not over coach. I   ve been talking to  some of the guys today and I feel even more strongly that that was one  of his strengths. He did not over coach. He kind of let you do your thing,  10  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  and, as long as you were doing the job, he didn   t say very much to you.  But if you weren   t, he could be on you big time because I remember  some guys that were tremendous baseball players and Coach Greene  gave them some really hard times, but he never said anything to me, so I  guess I must   ve been doing something that he liked. (Laughs)  Did he have a pretty good command of the game in terms of being able  to size up people?  Coach Greene?  Yeah, and what kind of a game day coach was he?  Well, he was no different on game day than he was any other time. But  I   ll tell you an incident that really kind of opened my eyes. As I told you,  I played football for two years. The coaches would kind of double up  from one sport to another. They had him doing the   what do you call it  when you go see the team you   re going to play the coming week?  Scouting.  Scout. He would scout the team then he would come in on   I think it  was like we   d play on Saturdays, usually, or Saturday night. Then we   d  have a meeting on Sunday night that was just inside this building, and  we reviewed game film, and then he would give a scouting report for the  team the next  week . I was really impressed about his ability to tell us  what the other guys were doing because, as I told you, he never put three  words together in a sentence that I can recall in three years. He was  really good at it. I think he had a lot more going on inside than he  revealed from what he had to say.  Jim, what do you remember about the pre-Allie Reynolds Stadium days  in terms of facilities? What was it like?  Well, we had bleachers, as I recall, and it seems like to me   I played  third base that year, and the bleachers only ran from, like, behind home  plate out to maybe the third base, give or take a few yards. Then there  was a big hill beyond that, down the left field line. We were fortunate  enough to have what I consider to be one of the better teams, as far as  camaraderie. I think of that team   when I think of it, one word is  camaraderie. We were fortunate to win a lot of games. People responded  to that, and I remember looking down there and people would just fill  that hill later in the year when they saw that we had a winning team.  That   s my kind of memory of the stadium.  I remember one time, one other incident that I thought was funny after  11  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  this, after the    59 championship year. I moved to the outfield in left  field. Before the game, they hit fungoes to all the outfielders, and you  throw them to each of the bases. I had what one of the people told me  was a pretty good throwing arm. I was playing left field in this one game  that I specifically remember; they had either fertilized or re-sodded the  infield. They hit me a fungo out there and I was supposed to throw it to  second or third and then I threw it to home. And I thought,    Hey that   s a  pretty good throw, Jim.    It landed about halfway between third base and  the home plate and just stopped. I don   t think it even made it all the way  to home plate. So the field was nothing like it was today. I was really  impressed and so was some of the other fellows, and we had comments  to make,    Gosh look at this field  And they   re going to build a new  one?    (Laughs)  So you played third base?  I played third base.  Were you the regular third baseman that entire    59 season?  Yes.  Do you remember your fielding percentage there?  No, but I tell you what. It was a lot better than it should   ve been because  of a young man named Grayson Mersch that played first base, and we  called him the vacuum cleaner. I couldn   t throw one by him; the only  way you could get one past Mersch was if you threw it over his head. He  caught everything that came and I just never worried about it. I just  concentrated on catching everything I could off the bat and then throw it  somewhere in the vicinity, and Mersch would come up with it.  That   s great. Did you hit in the four hole? Were you the cleanup?  Well, I was not until the final game of the    59 Series. Ben Bancroft was  the cleanup hitter. I was only a sophomore and Ben was a year ahead of  me, really a good hitter. I kind of caught fire at the College World  Series, and Ben had a little bit of a downturn, but, to his credit, later in  the series he came up and hit a home run that helped us win the  championship.  What was your normal place in the batting lineup?  I was five.  Five.  12  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Coach Greene just switched places; moved Ben to five and me to four. I  think I only did that one game and that was the final game of the Series.  I could be wrong, maybe two games, but I think it was just one.  You could hit for power, too, as I understand. How many home runs did  you have that year?  I really do not remember. But all the stuff that I   ve read was either six or  seven.  And your batting average, do you recall that?  .342.  .342, whoa. (Laughter) For a power hitter, that   s pretty good. Pretty  good, Jim. Well, I   ve heard some stories and I want you to verify them  for me. These are team travel stories. (Laughter) First of all, you didn   t  go on a plane; you didn   t go on a luxury bus. Can you tell me how the  team traveled to games?  We just traveled in individual cars with four or five guys in each car.  And it wasn   t even caravan. You just got kind of scattered out from  wherever you started out of Stillwater, and guys would arrive at different  times and they   d stop and eat when they wanted to and stuff of that  nature. Like I said, you were asking about Coach Greene. He didn   t  seem to put the clamps down on anybody, the    you be here at this  certain time,    and so forth. He just said,    Be there.    It seemed like, when  we   d go, it   d be really early in the morning.  And I guess we   ll bypass the St. Louis story, is that right? (Laughs)  You know, I only know about the St. Louis story of what the guys that  were involved in it told me. I was not there so I can   t verify whether it  was true or if they embellished these stories a little bit.  There were some extracurricular activities.  There must have been.  Well, Jim, do you recall what the expectations for the team were when  you started? Did you have any idea that you were going to be   not that  you would be National Champions. Did you think that you were going to  be a really outstanding ball club?  Well, I was talking to one of the guys, Marvin Kline, who you   ll talk to  here in a few minutes. He actually told me that Coach Greene told him  13  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  that he thought that he had the potential to win the National  Championship. First time I   d ever heard that story from Marvin. You  might want to ask Marvin about that and about some of the things that  he talked to Coach Greene about, because he told me that he had come  to school then he left school and went in the military. Then he came  back later, and he   d had a lot of experience and played at Enid High  School, and Coach Greene asked him to come and be on the team. So, I  think you ought to ask him about that. But back to expectations. Well, I  sort of had expectations in my own mind. But I didn   t even know what  the National Championship was. I didn   t know it was played in Omaha,  Nebraska. I was three months removed from being a teenager when we  won the National Championship, so you can see how naive I probably  was.  But here   s my recollection of that. When I got to Stillwater, I looked out  there, and here   s Bruce Andrew at second base. I   d played against Bruce  Andrew in American Legion ball in high school; I knew what his  abilities were. Bob Andrew, his brother, was a shortstop. I didn   t know  about Grayson Mersch at first base, but you could certainly tell that  nobody threw the ball by him. He was an excellent defensive first  baseman. Ray Bond was the catcher who I   d played with in high school  and he was an outstanding catcher. I don   t think I ever saw a better  defensive catcher than Ray in all the years that I   d played. Ben Bancroft  was a good addition and I could see he had ability. Then, we had three  pitchers. I   d played with Dick Soergel and I knew what kind of pitcher  he was. Toby had put him behind Roy Peterson and Joel Horlen and I  thought     He was actually third, wasn   t he?  And so, to me, that meant that he thought Dick was number three. But  they were seniors and we only had three seniors on the pitching staff  coming back, as I recall, and Ben Bancroft. I think he only got to play a  little bit as a sophomore and this was his junior year. But I knew all  these other guys and we had all played with each other or against each  other, and I said to myself,    Hey, we could have a pretty good team,     because I knew all of them. Don Soergel was Dick Soergel   s brother,  who I didn   t know, except I knew that they were a lot alike and Don was  an all-state athlete at Capitol Hill three or four years before I was there.  So, I knew we had a really good chance to have a good team.  You mentioned some of the players who probably were your leaders on  the team that year. Kind of go-to guys.  The thing that I remember most about that was the word    camaraderie.     It didn   t seem like there was anybody who stepped out there and said,  14  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson     I   m the big leader,    you know that. It was like,    Hey, boy, we   re all for  one and one for all.    It was the most compatible, congenial mix. I   ve  heard other guys say that today and during this visit. But the leadership  came from those pitchers. They just went out there and did the job.  Everybody else just kind of meshed in and it just fit really good.  Was there a series or a game during the season you look at as kind of a  turning point for you, when you said,    Hey, we got over the hump   ?  Yes. In my whole career, I was always a slow starter. It just seemed like  it took me a while to make all the pieces sort of fit. We went to Houston  and we played four games against Houston and Rice, two games each. I  think I recall, and you probably know this, most athletes want to know  what their statistics are. In my mind, I think I was hitting .250 when we  got back from the Houston trip and, in my mind, it seems like it wasn   t  very long that we went to Norman and played the University of  Oklahoma, which, of course, was our big rival team then. Still is,  probably always will be. We beat them three games in a row. I had a  breakout and I said,    Hey, I can do this.    I had one of those series that  you dream about. I just couldn   t do anything wrong. It was like I was in  that   have you ever heard Michael Jordan talk about being in    the  zone   ? Well, I kind of feel like that   in that weekend, we beat them  three in a row on their home turf, and I was in    the zone    and so was  most of the team.  My understanding is during this season you only lost one series. You  played three game series in the old Big Eight?  That   s correct.  Seems like it was Iowa State, I don   t recall, but maybe one series that  you didn   t win.  I think it was Iowa State. It was the only series that we lost. Iowa State  had a good team. They did have a good team, had good pitching.  Was there one for the team? You talked about, for yourself, the breakout  series with the University of Oklahoma. How about for the team?  I think it was the same thing.  You think it was the same series?  I think that was a breakout because, I think it was the time that we all  just came together. It wasn   t that I know all these guys and I know what  they   re capable of. It was   I know all of these guys, I know what  15  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  they   re capable of, and now they have proven it, because we beat them  bad. They just had no answer.  What would you consider the strength of the team? Was it defense,  pitching, hitting?  It was the same thing that   s always been, is today, and always will be:  up the middle. We had strong pitching, we had strong catching, and we  had strong short and second base. Bob and Bruce, great double play  combo; Ben Bancroft in center field. Then you fill in with the first  baseman because we had the vacuum cleaner over there.  Great defense, then.  We had great defense.  And good pitching.  And great pitching. The schedule set up perfect, because all you had to  do was play three games in a weekend and come back and pitch the  same three guys. Very few guys got to play when those guys went out on  the mound. They started it and finished it, for the most part.  Is it your recollection   I remember talking to Dick Soergel and I said,     Dick, who was your reliever?    and he said,    We didn   t have relievers  in those days.    (Laughs)  And that   s true. I don   t think we did have relievers.  (Laughs) So these guys, I mean, they had to have a good game because  if it was a bad game it was going to be a really good game, right?  Because they were going to be there the whole time.  I guess. But they never did have a bad game that year. We just had one  of those magical years.  So, the team that won the Big Eight Conference automatically qualified  for the playoffs, is that right?  They had the nation split into eight districts and each of those districts  would go to Omaha and play in the College World Series. And our  district was five, and I think it was the Missouri Valley champion that  played the Big Eight champion.  Was it with Bradley you guys played a three-game series?  16  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  We went to Bradley and played a three game series with Bradley.  So, the winner, then, in these eight regionals, or what do you call them     Districts.  Districts would go to the College World Series. So, eight teams, double  elimination, like it is today.  That   s correct.  What was the College World Series like? I mean it   s a pretty big hype  nowadays, but was it still a big deal in those days?  It was really a big deal. I remember thinking this, but I was in that     zone    again at Omaha so I just didn   t even think about it. But the crowd  was there; the people were very supportive about it. Each team had a   I  don   t remember exactly what it was, but to me, in my mind, it was like  the Kiwanis Club would sponsor the Oklahoma State team, and what are  some of the other civic organizations?  Rotary.  The Rotary, yeah. They would do all the other teams, and every team  there had somebody to do that. They would haul us from the hotel to the  ballpark and we couldn   t have been treated any better.  Stayed in a motel there in Omaha?  Stayed in the finest hotel there.  Busses back and forth to the ballgames?  It seems like, to me, they may   I don   t recall for sure, but it seems like  they may have done some other activities for us, but it was fifty years  ago. (Laughs)  Was it special to play in those kinds of ball games in that kind of  atmosphere?  Oh, it was very special because we were playing almost major league  type baseball. It was Triple A. Omaha had a Triple A team there and that  was the baseball diamond we got to play on. I remember one unique  thing about it. I can   t remember the guy   s name, but it seems like it was  Dusty somebody that was the umpire. He had been a big league umpire  and I recognized his name, and I  thought ,    Man, this is really a big  17  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  deal. We   re playing with big league umpires, too.    He would step on a  button behind home plate and this little thing would come up, and here  were extra balls. And he   d get a couple balls and put them in his pocket  and press the button and it   d go back down. I was really impressed with  that so, to me, it was first class all the way.  Jim, obviously you were MVP, most valuable player, in the College  World Series, and that had to be special for you. Can you go back and  take some of the games, special hits, special games you remember?  Well, first of all, I   d like to say the only reason I was MVP were all  those guys that were on that team. The guys that participated in the  practices, scrimmaged against us, helped us develop our skills to become  that good. So, I hope all of them will know that I   m sincere when I say  it. I think this is as much an honor for them as it was for me, because it  would   ve been impossible for me to be the MVP without them.  Let   s give you a little credit too, Jim. Again, I want to ask you, do you  remember some key hits you got in some of the games?  Well, I can   t say this for sure but I think Bill Platt was the announcer  and he had just started his career, but I could be wrong about that.  Maybe he had already been the OSU announcer. Anyway, he was a great  announcer and he used to say flattering things about the guys, and I  heard him years later and he was just an outstanding announcer. But I  guess one of the special things that I remember was I just started  doing   it was building as the year went by. As I told you, I started very  slow. I was hitting .250 after the first four games and we only got to play  32, so that   s a pretty high percentage of the total games, and by the time  we finished with OU, I just got confidence and I seemed to get a little  better and a little better. I was reading the paper after we went to Peoria  and I   m almost sure, I could be wrong, may have been Otis Wyle, but I  somehow got Bill Platt mixed in there and I didn   t know this, and he  said,    Dobson came to the plate, stepped up, hit a mighty shot that went  over a house behind the left field barrier.    And I thought,    I didn   t hit a  ball that far.    But like I said, it was one of those magical years, and  everything just seemed to go right.  Jim, what stands out in your mind in the championship game, the second  game against Arizona? I guess we won 5-3. What stands out in your  mind about that game?  Well, I   ll tell you kind of a funny story here. As I told you, it was like I  was in the    zone    and I   d been batting real good, and before the final  game, I think it was trainer Byron Bird that said,    Get your speech  ready. You   re going to be the MVP.    I walked up to the plate, first time  18  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  at bat, and I was feeling confident. I was just really anxious to get up  there. I had been told that this was their ace for Arizona pitching. He  was a darn good pitcher. He threw me one. I hit it right on the nose, right  at the left fielder, and I took off. And later I ran into this left fielder, and  he said,    You know that ball you hit in the first inning first time at bat?     and I said,    Yeah.    He said,    I was the guy that caught it.    I said,     Really? You dog.    (Laughter) He said,    You know what?    He said,    It  was hit so hard, and I couldn   t even judge it.    He said,    I had to leap up  to do it,    and he said,    I broke my supporter.    (Laughter) I thought that  was pretty funny. If you   re offended on this, watching this, I apologize if  you have your kids or something. You can explain the rest of it to them.  Now, you had a couple other hits in that game, though, didn   t you, that  actually fell in? Tell us about those.  Well, I had had so much success, and I   m sure from the first game I was  hitting very well. I   m sure they had their scouts watching and said,     Here   s how we got to pitch this guy,    and so forth. So, we got  somewhere midway toward the end of the series and the guy was on the  mound, and I thought to myself, this was one of the things that went  through my mind,    What would I pitch this guy if I was the pitcher?    I  can   t tell you why I thought this, but I thought he might throw me a  change-up. He did, and I hit it over the left field fence.  Stayed back and waited on it, huh?  But unbeknownst to me, one of the guys told me later that the ball hit  right on top of the fence and bounced on over. In those days, you did not  do what they do today. Slug it out of sight and then stand there and  watch it go. Because guys would be on your case big time if you   they  called that hot dogging and I didn   t want to do that, so I wasn   t watching  the ball. I was running.  Was that the go-ahead?  I don   t really remember whether it was go-ahead, but that wasn   t the  final game. That was one of the games before. I hit two home runs in the  series up there. That was the first one that I hit.  It must be special for you to think about. You played on the only baseball  team that won the NCAA championship. Think of all the great Gary  Ward teams and, of course, Frank Anderson teams we have now, great  talent, great players, Pete Incavigilas and Robert Venturas. But you  guys are the only ones that have ever won it. And then you came back a  couple years later and were in the finals in the College World Series?  19  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Yes.  So, it must   ve been very special for you.  Very, very special. The way I remember it is I got to play on teams that  went for the three years that I played. We won a first, a second, and a tie  for the third. I thought that was pretty darn special a career for a guy to  have. But I wasn   t the only one. The whole infield, except for Bob  Andrew, were all sophomores, and so they had the same experience that  I did. And that was just very special to say you played on three teams.  We won the first, second, and tied for the third.  Those next couple of years was there an African-American player on the  team at that time, do you recall?  We had a guy named  Don  Blakley that was a pitcher that was on that  team, but he left somewhere before we got to Omaha and I don   t really  remember. Guys would come and go and Coach Greene would, (laughs)  some of us laugh about this, but he would run them off if he didn   t think  they were going to help us. I don   t think that was the case in this case,  but seems like the guys would come and go, and you don   t know what  happened to them. Blakely was kind of one of those guys. He was out  there one day and then I just didn   t see him anymore. And, of course,  you   re busy trying to make your grades, and make practice, and be at the  games. College life was very busy; I recall that as being a very busy time  in my life. Didn   t have time to do a whole lot.  Jim, you   ve probably watched a lot of baseball since then, but I   m  talking about college baseball. How has college baseball changed since  the years you played to now?  Well, one of the big differences is that it was a lot easier for us to win  the National Championship because you didn   t have the Regionals like  we have today. You didn   t have the Super Regionals; you didn   t have to  go through what I consider to be a darn big obstacle course in order to  make it to Omaha. All we had to do was win the Big Eight, which, I  mean, that was a big accomplishment. I don   t want to say that our guys  didn   t earn it because we did, not just me but all them too. Then all we  had to do was win the district playoffs two out of three games, which we  were fortunate enough to do. Then, we traveled to Peoria, and then  you   re in the big show at Omaha. Today, I mean, I listen to a lot of Gary  Ward   s teams and, I mean, making it through the Regionals and the  Super Regionals is a big deal. The competition is probably much, much  greater, and then the money that the programs are able to put in, most of  it went to football. Baseball programs   a lot of guys didn   t have full  scholarships. They   d have a partial, maybe a half or three-quarters,  20  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  something like that. So, the competition was not as tough, I don   t think. I  think that we didn   t have it as tough as they have it today.  Jim, what about facilities? Are you excited about, of course, at Allie P.  Reynolds Stadium they   re talking about building a new stadium?  Well, as I said a little earlier, we were all saying,    They   re going to build  a new stadium? This one   s fabulous.    Because we just had the bleachers  and the hill on the   but I will say this and all the fans that came, they  came and supported us. My memory is we had 4 and 5 or higher, 4,000  and 5,000 and more people come out and watch a baseball game,  especially in the spring and a nice day, the sun was shining, and no wind  and stuff like that. It was a good outing. People sat out on that hill and  got a suntan, and they cheered us on.  That   s great. What is it about   you   ve been gone but you   ve come back  and stayed in touch with your alma mater, but what is it about  Oklahoma State University, you think, that makes alumni so loyal and  come back and be part of the program?  That   s a really good question. But the thing that is so good to me is just  the people that you dealt with in your era. We had such great people, all  those guys on that baseball team. If you look at them today, I mean, they  went on to great careers. They were great citizens, not just baseball  players or what some people say,    dumb jocks.    They were quality  people and that   s what I remember. I mean, I just loved to see all the  guys today.  Before we close, I want to ask a little bit about your football career. You  played running back, and started, as I recall, for a year or two before  you got injured, is that right?  Yes.  Did you play in the Bluegrass Bowl?  I did not get to play in the game. I went to the game suited up but I  didn   t get to play. I just didn   t get to play in the Bluegrass game, but my  sophomore year I got to play. I was the returner for kickoffs. Then the  next year I was thought enough of that I was a starting right halfback  when the season started. Then got a knee hurt, got a hip pointer, got a  calcium deposit on the left thigh and got a thumb knocked down. It was  a pretty rough year, physically, for me. Started off pretty good, but kind  of went downhill pretty fast by the time we got     Well, looking back, Jim, just OSU generally, not just your sports and so  21  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  Gill  Dobson  on, but what are some special memories, favorite times that you recall at  Oklahoma State?  I really think that outside of the baseball, the only thing I kind of  remember, baseball, football, and basketball, because I was so busy  doing those things that it didn   t seem like I participated in a whole lot  until my senior year. Then, of course, I met my spouse here when I was  a senior and came back for that last semester to get my degree. That was  very special for me. I had joined the Sigma Chi fraternity on a quirk,  really. I got to know a lot of guys that were outside of athletics and  became friends with them, and some of them were also jocks. Grayson  Mersch was a Sigma Chi, and a guy that I roomed with in football  named Jim Frasier who was an All-American high school football player  at Ada. I roomed with him for several years, and he was a Sigma Chi.  So, one day we were walking across campus and didn   t realize it at the  time, but everyone that was walking across there was a Sigma Chi  except me. There was about ten of us or so and I said,    Gosh, I wish I   d  have been a Sigma Chi.    One of the guys said,    Well, maybe you  should   ve been,    or something. I said,    Well, maybe I   ll just do it now,     and he said,    Okay.    So, I pledged really late and became a member.  And that was a very special, special time because I made many dear  friends in that.  Jim, is there anything that we haven   t covered? Anything that you   d like  to share with us about     No, they probably heard all of me they want to hear. (Laughs)  We appreciate it very much. Thank you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
