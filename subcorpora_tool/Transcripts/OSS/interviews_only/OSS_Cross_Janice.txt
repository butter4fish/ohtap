 Ahrberg and today is October 15, 2009. I am visiting  with Janice Edwards Cross in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The interview is for  the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Welcome, Janice, we   re glad to have you.  Thank you. I   m glad to be here.  You   re coming back to the campus for the Women of Willard, WOW,  Reunion. That   s great. Why don   t we start off with asking you to tell us a  little bit about your early life   where you grew up, your family, the  school you attended, your parents and your siblings, if you have any?  I grew up on a farm in western Oklahoma. I had one sister and great  parents. I went to school in Gage all twelve years. I think there were  eighteen in my graduating class, so you can see it was a very small  school. I played basketball and I was very active in 4-H. Those things  were a very important part of my life. I was also busy on the farm. My  dad had no sons and two girls, so we did the farm chores. He never let us  do work in the fields. He never let us drive tractors and things like that,  but we took care of the animals and that sort of thing. So we were busy.  What did he raise?  He had cows and we had pigs for a short time. He wasn   t fond of pigs so  we didn   t have pigs very long. We had chickens, always we had  chickens. And horses. He had horses that were cow ponies, and dogs and  the usual.  Did you have any crops?  We did. He was mostly a wheat farmer, so he had some grass for the  cows. He got into raising registered angus late in his career and really  5  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  excelled at it. He loved it and those angus were very important to him.  Oh yeah, I can imagine. What was your favorite part about being on the  farm?  I was really a tomboy growing up, especially in grade school. I loved to  do all of the tree climbing and I loved the freedom. And in a small town  like that I could get on my bike and ride to Gage; it was three miles. You  didn   t have to worry about a lot of traffic and certainly no crime. So it  was a very good life, free of the enticements that a lot of children face  these days.  What were your favorite activities in school?  I loved basketball. I loved 4-H. I liked school. Basketball trips and 4-H  trips were a very important thing. Western Oklahoma was not a very  prosperous area, so the 4-H trips were a big part of my life.  Can you tell us what influenced you to attend OSU and what year did  you enroll?  4-H influenced me to attend OSU. I had been here so many times on 4-H  trips and I knew the campus. My best friend and my boyfriend both went  to OU and I didn   t even consider going there because I knew the campus  here. I knew some of the girls that were already here because of some of  our activities in 4-H and it was just an easy thing to do.  And the year that you enrolled?  I enrolled in 1956.  You said you   d been here I guess several times with 4-H. What were  your first impressions of the campus and the town of Stillwater when you  came on those trips?  We weren   t in the town much. I loved the campus, I thought it was just  beautiful: Theta Pond and the grassy areas and of course the buildings. I  just enjoyed it a lot.  Now there were a lot of new buildings at that time when you first came  on campus.  There were and then there was Old Central. (Laughs)  We   ll always have Old Central. The Student Union was new and the  library was new?  6  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  I don   t know when they were built, but they looked new. They were very  nice.  What years did you live in Willard Hall?  I lived here the whole time in Willard Hall.  Freshman through your senior year?  Yes, yes. With the same roommate as long as she was there.  Oh, that   s wonderful. Speaking of roommates, were you assigned her or  did she come with you?  No, I knew Virginia Adams   Virginia Semrad, now   through my 4-H  and she was one of the people we frequently traveled with on 4-H trips.  She came the year before I did and she knew my roommate, the girl who  was to become my roommate, Georgia Kirby. Georgia was not going to  stay with the roommate she had then, so Virginia wrote to me and said  she thought I would enjoy Georgia and set it up for us and that   s the way  it happened.  So, were you assigned to Willard? I mean you knew you were     No, we were able to state a preference and I preferred Willard. Yes.  On that first day that you came into Willard Hall, what was your  impression?  I just remember so many new people coming in and I thought,    I hope I  like this.    (Laughs) Even though I had been here many times, it was all  still very strange feeling to me. I was very glad to get up into Willard on  the second floor and see Virginia and Mary Eva. I knew Mary Eva  Nemecek and it was nice to see familiar faces.  Did you take the elevator a lot or did you use the stairs?  We mostly used the stairs unless we were moving something in. The  elevator was very old and rather creaky. (Laughs)  What was your room like?  We had twin beds and we each had a dresser and we had a sink in the  room. We had two small closets   that   s pretty much it.  You came from a far distance, so did you bring all your clothes, like for  7  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  all four seasons?  No, we didn   t. There would not have been a place to put them.  There wasn   t enough room.  No, not enough room. We would go back each time the seasons changed  and get whatever we needed for that season.  Did you have to iron your clothes, because they were all cotton back  then weren   t they?  Yes, I remember ironing clothes. Of course, we wore jeans so much and  we didn   t iron jeans, but if you wanted to look nice, then you ironed  them and you had ironing boards in the room and a little iron, so.  Did you cook much in your room?  No, no. We had no cooking facilities and I don   t believe it was allowed.  There was a commissary in the basement where we could go in the  evenings and get a snack, but     So, you didn   t make popcorn or anything like that? Could you make  popcorn?  I don   t remember making popcorn. I can   t think that they would have  objected to a popcorn popper, but I don   t remember making popcorn.  What was it like trying to have a personal conversation on the floor  phone?  (Laughs) We had two phones within the distance of our room and one of  them was in the hall. So whoever happened to come by just heard your  conversation. The other one was in a little booth type thing, there was a  door that you could close. So if you wanted   well, of course you didn   t  have any choice about who called in, you could call out. If you wanted a  private conversation, you could go down to the one with the door.  Were the phones used heavily?  I don   t remember. I don   t remember ever having to wait for the phone  except the phone with the door that you could close. (Laughs) And I  think we did have to wait for that.  That was the most popular.  8  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Yes, that was the popular phone.  Did you communicate with your parents by phone?  No, not much at all. Letters.  There was a common shower and restroom area on your floor. How  many women would you say shared that facility and what was that like?  I can   t ever remember it being a problem. We were just used to simple  things. I think almost all of us who came, came from smaller  communities, at least the ones that lived around me. And it just was not  a problem. We   d go down and take our shower and put on our robe and  come back to the room.  Did you ever have to wait in line? Friday night, whenever everybody  was getting ready for dates?  No, I don   t think so. I don   t think there was ever a line. I do remember  there was one tub and I don   t think it was heavily used. I do remember  one of the girls that lived close to us had to get up very early in the  morning to go on duty in the hall and she ran tub water and fell asleep in  the bath tub. (Laughs)  Did it spill over?  No, fortunately she had turned the water off before she fell asleep.  Oh, that   s cute  Was Willard considered to be a popular or prestigious  hall at the time?  I couldn   t tell you, I don   t know. I always supposed that Murray was  more     And why do you think that was?  I don   t know. I don   t know why I had that impression. I just didn   t really  think about it one way or another.  In your mind, what set Willard apart from other women   s halls in that  late 1950 era?  I think the women who lived there   well and our house mothers. They  were just top notch. Mrs. White was the daytime mother and she was a  sweet little grey haired lady that just knew how to handle things. She  was very, very gentile and nice. The lady that came on duty in the  9  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  evening, I believe her name was Mrs. Pryor and we didn   t have as much  contact with her. I did work in Willard for awhile, so I would spend  some time with her in the evening. She was very interesting to visit with  and just a very, very sweet lady. We just couldn   t have asked for better  house mothers.  You said you worked at Willard, what did you do?  We had a common   I hardly know how to describe it. It was almost like  a switchboard. Each room had a buzzer and to summon someone in that  room if someone came to see them, if their date came, one of the girls in  the room would be one ring and the other girl would be two rings. And  so I worked that, that little switchboard type thing and then probably the  same job description, I checked in girls at night. Checked all the rooms  in probably half of Willard Two to make sure the girls were in and the  dorm was quiet.  Now what would happen if a girl was not in?  Well, we had to sign out if we went somewhere and if they didn   t sign  out, we   d call the home and say,    Your daughter is not here, do you  know where she is?    Most of the time they just forgot to sign out and  they would be at home.  Was there a penalty for someone that didn   t let them know that they  were  leaving ?  I never had it happen on my floor, so I believe they sent a letter to the  parents to inform them that they weren   t in and we didn   t know where  they were.  Well, I   m going to talk a little bit about some of the    WOW    traditions  and one that they   ve asked us to mention was Willard Beach. Does that  sound familiar to you?  Oh, I think that   s where some of the girls climbed out the window and  went out on the roof. I personally (laughs) never did such a thing.  You didn   t go out and lay out on the deck?  No, I didn   t.  So that only happened on the second floor?  I don   t know.  10  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  What about Christmas traditions? Did you share in any of the Christmas  traditions? Did they have a tree? Did you all sing Christmas carols?  We did have a tree. I remember going caroling once. I think they  probably did that more than once, but I only remember the one time. We  always, on west wing of Willard Two, had little Christmas parties and  exchanged little gifts, sang carols and talked about how nice Christmas  vacation was going to be.  Did you get to go home often, considering the distance?  I would say once a month, once every six weeks, maybe. There were  several people from Gage that came and some of the boys had cars and  we could pay for a little gas.  How far out there is that from here?  I think it was about an hour and a half. I remember going home once and  we had a big snow storm and the roads were bad and I remember my  ride did not come back. I had a test on Monday and I remember my Dad  bringing me back and it was not a good experience. Not a good ride. I  felt badly that I had gotten him out of the house to do that.  Did Willard participate in Homecoming events and contests?  I don   t know. I don   t remember.  Do you remember Homecoming at that time?  Oh yes, I do remember Homecoming. And I remember the parades and  the floats, but I don   t believe   oh, yes I do. I do remember them  working on floats in the basement. So, obviously, yes.  Oh, great. What happened when one of the women became engaged?  Did they have a candlelight? Did they serenade the woman?  We didn   t, not as a hall.  Now they talked about Willard having their own scrapbooks   dorm  scrapbooks. Do you recall seeing any of those or being a part of putting  those together?  I don   t.  What do you remember or what did you hear about the 1955 Panty Raid  on Willard? That   s very famous.  11  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  I did hear about the Panty Raid. Not a lot of details, but I do recall them  saying some of the women enticed the guys. (Laughter)  So, I guess it was pretty wild. What were the resident hall hours when  you were on campus?  We had quiet time from eight to ten. You could go to the library or you  could be in your room studying. You could not be in the hall unless you  were on your way to the restroom, so it was pretty strictly enforced and  if there was too much noise, Mrs. White or Mrs. Pryor would come up  and ask you to be quiet. It was a study time and if you weren   t in the  library, you were supposed to be in your room studying.  Now I was looking through Virginia   s scrapbook over there and I saw  some pictures where a lot of the women were smoking cigarettes. Was  that very common back then?  No, it wasn   t. Just a few of the women in our group smoked.  Did they allow smoking in the rooms? Or in the dorms?  Yes, yes. Yes, they did allow smoking in the rooms. The women who  smoked could smoke in their rooms. I wonder if the picture you saw was  the picture of the     It   s a western thing.  That was one evening.  That was an exceptional evening?  That was an exceptional evening, yes. (Laughter) Some of the girls did  not have dates and they dressed up in these western outfits and were  playing poker, I guess, and smoking cigars and cigarettes and none of  them smoked, so they were not     So that was an exception.  That was an exception.  Do you remember the penalties for coming in late past the curfew?  I think you got to talk to Mrs. Pryor or Mrs. White. I don   t think it was  any, unless it was habitual.  Was there a dress code at Willard?  12  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  No. No.  Did you all mingle with the other dorms, Stout or Murray?  Not so much. If you knew someone over there, they might come over  and visit you.  But you didn   t have any exchange parties or anything like that?  No, no. We had dances in the basement and some of the guys would  come over, but I don   t believe the girls from the other dorms came.  Well tell us about those dances. What were they like?  Well they were just very casual. They had a phonograph and records and  they had chairs set around and you just     Were they held on the weekends only?  Yes.  Was PDA, Public Display of Affection, a serious infraction at Willard?  I don   t remember much of that. We would stand out on the steps and  have a goodnight kiss and that was pretty much it. I don   t remember  seeing anyone linger out there for a long time.  What were some of the most personal or special memories of your years  in Willard? Was there a special year that stood out, your senior year or  your junior year? Was there a particular dance, activity, room party?  I just remember everyone got along really well. We would have  gatherings in the rooms and I don   t know that there had to be a particular  occasion. We would sometimes all gather in one room and there was just  a wonderful camaraderie. We just got along very well and, you know,  we   d get together and sing and if somebody got engaged, of course they  would go show their ring to everybody.  Did you live all four years on the second floor?  Yes.  Did you ever think about moving?  Oh, no. Oh, no. (Laughs)  13  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Did the women from the other floors come down? Did you all go up and  down?  Yes, yes.  One woman mentioned the fourth floor was the P.E. floor, kind of. But  you did mingle. While you were there did you experience any tough  times? Was there a particularly bad year where you suffered with your  grades or was there any hardship while you were at Willard during your  time at OSU?  I don   t remember anything that was not a very positive experience.  That   s wonderful. What about diversity in Willard? Were there any  ethnic or international students that lived there?  I remember one black girl. That   s all I remember.  Was that true on campus in general? Were there very few?  Very few.  You told me that you did work in the hall itself. Did you ever hold a  hall  or floor  position or were you active in the OSU Residence Hall  Association?  No.  When Willard was converted to administrative use, was that  controversial with some of the Willard alumni when they changed it  from a dorm to an administrative building?  If it was, I wasn   t aware of it.  And do you know if the WOW group participated in the renovation plans  of Willard?  Yes, we did. Two of our group were deceased at that time and we did a  fundraising among the group and got enough to dedicate one of the  rooms to these two women.  Oh, how neat.  And there   s a plaque on the door. It was special.  Do you know what year that was?  14  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  It must have been six or seven years ago, I would say. I   m not exactly  sure.  What do you think about the new residence halls on OSU campus?  I haven   t been back to campus to really visit any of the buildings. I hope  to do it this time. When we were here for the dedication of Willard,  when they changed over and we saw the room we had dedicated, I didn   t  go into the other residence halls, so I didn   t see them.  What did you like to do off campus or on campus? Were you involved in  activities on campus?  I started to try to play basketball. Basketball was an important part of my  high school, but I just couldn   t adjust to the different rules and I didn   t  stick with that. We liked to go to the Union   four or five of us would go  to the Union. After study time or after classes we   d meet over there. One  in our group was a trained dancer and there was a guy on campus, Kat  Taylor. He was (laughs) a tall, skinny guy with a big hat with a feather  in it and he was quite a dancer, too. He would come dance with one of  our friends who was trained and they could really cut a rug. We loved to  go over when Kat was going to be there.  And this was dances at the Student Union?  They had a jukebox on one of the floors. I can   t recall the floor    fourth  floor . It had a jukebox and it was a dance floor and you could go up and  get a coke and just sit and have fun. Somebody would put a nickel in the  jukebox and you could dance.  Did you go to the library much?  I didn   t go to the library too much. I could do most of my studying in my  room. If I had a paper to write I would go to the library.  What was it like? My understanding is that it was a new building at the  time.  It was very nice. They had little cubicles for studying and if you were a  serious student, you could get back in a little quiet place even and study  where it was very, very quiet. They had a lot of tables, of course a large  selection of books. It was very nice. A beautiful entry. I remember the  beautiful entry.  So, what were some of the hangouts where you liked to hang out off  campus or on campus?  15  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  I don   t recall going off campus very much. We sometimes went to the  movie. It was on the corner across from Old Central, sort of. But we  didn   t spend a lot of time off campus. We mostly hung out in the Union.  Now my understanding is pizza was just starting to come in to being  popular. Did you get to have your first slice of pizza here at OSU?  Yes, I   m sure. I   m sure. (Laughter) We did go out for pizza. We used to  go, if somebody could borrow or happen to have a car for the weekend,  we   d go to Mooreburger.  Where is that?  Well, it was north of the main part of town, I remember, and it was just a  drive-in hamburger place, sort of like Burger King. (Laughs)  But it was a treat.  It was a treat to get off campus and have something other than the dorm  food and so that was a big deal.  What was your dorm food like?  It wasn   t too bad. We had open dining, I guess you would call it. Some  of the guys from Murray used to come   they could eat there. It wasn   t  too bad. We had a selection and it was okay. If they had something that  was really bad you could go to the canteen and get something that  evening.  Did you have houseboys or anything like that?  No.  No houseboys. It was cafeteria style.  Right.  What was your major?  I majored in Home Economics, originally with the intent of teaching  Home Economics. At the end of my freshman year I decided I didn   t  want to do that, so I went in to talk to my advisor about changing to  elementary education and she told me about a program that they had at  that time that I could stay in Home Economics, major in Family  Relations and Child Development and get an education degree, an  elementary degree, when I finished and so that   s what I did and it was a  16  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  very good decision. The Child Development courses were not only very  helpful to me while I was teaching, but raising my children, also.  What year did you graduate?  I graduated in midterm of    59. But I didn   t have the actual graduation  until    60.  Tell us a little bit about your life once you left OSU   places you   ve  lived, maybe jobs you   ve held.  My first teaching job was in Oklahoma City in an inner-city school and I  had a split second and third grade and I have never had such a trying  time. It was very hard to adjust to, the children were behind and they  were inner-city children and it was a lot of moving in and out during the  semesters. There were a lot of troubled children and I remember I would  go home at the end of the day so tired that I thought if anybody pulls out  in front of my car, I will not be able to stop. I was there just a short  while. I married after I had taught for one year and then my husband was  in the Air Force. We moved to Enid for pilot training and then spent four  years in Waco in the Air Force and then we moved to Dallas. He left the  Air Force and got a job at Braniff International and we were there for 25  years. Then Braniff went bankrupt and we moved to Phoenix and he  finished his career with America West.  Did you have children?  Yes, I taught five and a half years and then we had our first child. We  have two children, a boy and a girl.  Did they attend OSU?  No. We tried to talk to them into it   So where are you currently living now?  In Phoenix. Well, right outside of Phoenix in a little community called  Fountain Hills.  Well, I   m glad you came all the way back, that   s neat. Let   s talk a little  bit about your general OSU experience. I know President Willham was  president at that time on campus. Do you recall anything about him as  president?  You know, he was just someone who was there. He didn   t make any  particular effects in my terms at OSU.  17  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  What was the student newspaper like? Did you read it every day?  I don   t think we had it every day. Maybe it was a weekly newspaper?  I   m not sure. I did read it and tried to keep up on what was going on on  campus.  Well, television was just coming into popularity or mainstream  popularity. Did you have a television in the dorm?  Yes, we did. We had a television in the dorm. It was in the main lobby. I  don   t remember spending a lot of time in front of it. I do remember  when Elvis was first on Ed Sullivan and the room was packed.  (Laughter)  Someone said they only showed him from the waist up.  Yes. Yes. He was quite sinful. (Laughs)  Were there any particular professors that influenced you, that you  recall, in any of the classes?  I recall some professors. I think the ones that I recall the most were the  ones that were difficult. My home economics professors were very kind  and the classes were good. They were good. I do remember a cooking  class that I took that we had to learn to cook and serve. We had one meal  where we served the fraternity guys and I remember I was absolutely so  nervous. I was fine when I was in the kitchen, but when I got ready to  serve, my hands were shaking so the dishes were rattling  (Laughs) It  was quite traumatic.  This was a requirement?  Yes, it was a requirement and that was a big part of our grade, the  serving and cooking part.  Have you been able to come back to OSU much, living out of state, as  far as attending Homecoming activities?  Not a lot. I think I   ve been here three times. This   ll be my fourth.  Why do you think that the WOW women have stayed so close together  through the years and continue to have reunions even 50 years later?  We had so much in common when we came and there was such  camaraderie between us and the effort that somebody has made each  time to get together and arrange a place and a time and activities for us  18  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  Cross  Ahrberg  and just people making an effort to get here.  How many reunions have you been able to participate in?  I think I have missed two.  Wow. That   s quite an accomplishment. Would you say that the  experience that you had with Willard was different, probably, from  women that lived in Stout or Murray? Are you aware of that?  I think if they didn   t have a similar experience it would be because they  didn   t make the effort maybe, because OSU is a very friendly school.  And I don   t think it would have been difficult for anybody to establish  the kind of relationship we have. I haven   t heard of anyone who has,  but     Have any other women in Willard on the other floors done what you gals  did on the second floor?  Not that I know of.  And how soon did these reunions start? I   m curious to know.  I believe the first one was ten years, but I   m not certain.  After you graduated?  Yes.  Somebody just kind of picked up the phone and said,    Let   s get  together.     Yes.  That   s really neat. Well are there any other favorite memories that you  would like to share with us about OSU or your experience on campus or  what it has meant to you to be a graduate of OSU and come back?  I just think I couldn   t have made a better decision than coming here. It  was just a wonderful experience. I wouldn   t trade it for anything and I  just love coming back.  Well Janice, I want to thank you for coming today and sharing your  memories with us. It   s been a pleasure to interview you and hear your  stories and I hope you just have a blast with those ladies.  19  Cross  Thank you. I think they   re already having a blast. I can   t wait to get  there.  -------  -------
