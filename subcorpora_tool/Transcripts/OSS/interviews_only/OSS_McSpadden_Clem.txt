 Neurohr  McSpadden  Good afternoon. Today is June 5, 2008. My name is Karen Neurohr, and I   m  with the OSU Library from Stillwater, Oklahoma. I   m at the office of  McSpadden   Associates in Chelsea, Oklahoma. I   m here today to interview  Mr. Clem McSpadden and Mr. Larry Kilgore, who are founding members of  the OSU Rodeo Team, among many other things. Mr. McSpadden, we   ll start  the interview with you. Could you tell me a little bit about yourself?  Well I was born out in the country five miles from here, southwest, at our  little ranch place out there. It   s a place that my grandmother and grandfather  settled in 1885, and we   ve kept it together up to and including today. When I  was two   actually I hadn   t had my second birthday yet   my uncle, Will  Rogers, asked my dad if he would come over to Oolagah, which is across the  river about 20 miles as the crow flies   and manage the ranch, and Dad said  yes, he would. And so we moved to the old Rogers place in 1927 where  Uncle Will was born. So I actually wasn   t two. I was, oh, 17 or 18 or 19  months old.  We moved there in the summertime, and I was raised in that old house there.  Being raised on a ranch, you   re just out there. We were about five miles from  town. Our closest neighbor was about a mile and a half. We lived pretty  much a semi-primitive life, almost like my dad had been raised   and there  wasn   t anything to do in high school but play basketball and learn to rope. So  we roped calves and goats and played basketball, and that   s kind of how I  got started.  Okay, and what years did you attend Oklahoma A M College?  Well I started in    43. I graduated in    43 and I   d promised my mother and dad  that I would go to college and finish college and so they wanted me to start  in    43. And after I   d enrolled, I found out that if you hadn   t joined the  service within about 60 days after your 18th birthday you were drafted and I  didn   t want to go into the Army. I thought I wanted to go to the Navy or the  5  Marine Corps or somewhere, so I stayed at Stillwater until my 18th birthday  in November, and decided I wanted to come home to spend the last 60 days  at home with my mother and dad, which I did.  I joined the Navy on the 8th day of January in 1944, and there   s an old fiddle  tune that country people used to play called,    The 8th day of January,    and  Dad always laughed and said I picked a good day to join the Navy. So I went  to boot camp in San Diego and was lucky enough to get in the Navy B-12. I  guess the law is still the same in the Navy   anytime you   re making a  landing you have to have one officer in every boat. Well in a lot of those  little old landings, there were maybe 10 or 12 people on one of those little  boats but you had to have one officer with them. So they were sending us to  midshipman school for 90 days and then sent us on to   no, that wasn   t  midshipman school, that was the first sitting   then you went to midshipman  school for another 90 days and you were commissioned. I was set to be  commissioned before I was 19, and by the time I got through the first 90  days, the Navy had enough boot ensigns they didn   t need any more.  What the Navy did, instead of sending us just into the general force, they  sent us to Navy V-12 and there we took the same course that they give at the  Naval Academy. Then by the time I   d taken all the courses and all that good  stuff, two and a half years had passed and I had enough points for discharge  and enough schooling for a commission. So I was commissioned and  discharged almost the same day, in Texas.  I went to school at the University of Redlands in California for three  semesters, and North Texas Agricultural College, which is now the  University of Texas at Arlington   it was then a division of Texas A M,  now it   s a division of the University of Texas   and then finished at the  University of Texas for three semesters. So actually they sent me eight  semesters to college and what I can   t tell in Oklahoma is that I graduated  from Oklahoma A M and the University of Texas. So that doesn   t put me in  very good stead with the OU  University of Oklahoma  folks.  But I came home after my service and went right to Oklahoma State   it  wasn   t Oklahoma State then, it was still Oklahoma A M   and I got my  degree in animal husbandry, and that   s all I wanted to take. And when I came  back, I took the easiest courses I could take because in that doggone stuff we  had to take with the Navy following the classes that they give at the  academy   gosh I had to take calculus   integral and differential calculus and  all that stuff and theory of equations and all that math and I didn   t know  anything about that. I just studied art and tried to keep from flunking out, and  didn   t know what I was doing half the time, but I got through with that and  then came back to Stillwater and got my degree in animal husbandry and  graduated then in    48.  6  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  What were your favorite classes in animal husbandry?  Well, I liked the cattle classes more than anything. I guess being raised on a  ranch, I looked down on the sheep business. I didn   t much like the sheep  courses. Pig courses were all right, but I liked the cattle courses and feeds  and feeding and things like that and enjoyed them a lot.  Did you also have equine and poultry courses as well?  No, didn   t have any equine courses at all. Could have taken one one  semester   don   t know why I didn   t, but I took something else instead and I  don   t remember what the trade was.  What professors stand out in your memory?  Oh gosh, Glen Bratcher would be the number one person. I always thought  that at that time he was the only college fella I ever saw   well I shouldn   t  say this   he was one of the college people I saw that I thought could make a  living on a ranch. And Bob Totusek really wasn   t old enough to impress me  then. I did have a seminar course with Dr. Totusek and have always had such  a great respect and admiration for him as a good person. So I   d say Glen  Bratcher and Totusek. And then there was a sheep man, Dr. Briggs, that I  really liked as a person. I didn   t like his courses worth a dern, but I tried not  to tell him   and I liked him a lot.  Were there any particular projects that you remember or reports or things  that you did when you were in school that just really engaged you, I guess,  as a student or that you just really loved and     Well to be brutally frank, after having gone through that    hell-on-wheels     thing in the Navy   it was so hard that I never did know what I was doing.  All I wanted   I   d promised my mother and dad I   d get a degree, and all I  wanted was (Laughs) the easiest thing I could get which I was taking I think,  the ones that fitted me well. I was not a straight-A student. I made about a  3.0, just about a 3.0, but I passed everything. So, no, there wasn   t any that  really scared me, I don   t guess, because I thought I could, you know, pass  them all.  Where did you live while you were in school?  Well let me see   when I came back after the war, I lived on   well it   s a  block east of the north-south street going south from the Field House,  whatever street that is.  McElroy?  7  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Might have been. And I lived with a nice lady and her son, and they took in  three or four boarders and I was one of them. The first year, when I went  over in    43, I lived at Joe Shoulders, who is Jim Shoulders    older brother.  We had played basketball against each other in high school. We lived down  on, I guess it was Duck, and we got a room for  15 a month. I don   t know  whether that was apiece   I guess it was apiece. We had one little    ole place  to hang clothes. Well, we didn   t have enough clothes to even fill that thing.  And we didn   t have much money, and we used to walk across through the  backyard of another person behind us and we could get a day-old pie for 50  cents. We   d go buy a pie and take that back to the room (Laughs) and split  that pie. We got along pretty good.  Now I understand that you walked on the basketball team under Coach Iba?  Yes, ma   am.  Do you remember the first time you ever met him?  Yes, ma   am.  Could you tell me about that?  Yes, ma   am. I just walked into his office   you didn   t have to make  appointments in those days   and introduced myself to him and, boy, I was  green. I didn   t know anything about scholarships. I knew if you   I heard the  expression,    Oh, he   s going to school on a scholarship.    He   s    getting paid.     So I just walked in and asked Mr. Iba how you got one of those scholarships.  (Laughs) He kind of looked at me funny and he said,    Do you play  basketball son?    I said,    A little bit.    And so we talked, and he never did  laugh or anything, but he wasn   t really too gruff, and so he said,    Well, you  just walk on.    I didn   t know what    walk on    meant, but he told me when the  practice started and all that stuff and where I reported to, so I did.  He was training Bob Kurland that year to tend goal. The goal had never been  tended before, and Kurland was seven feet tall, and so he got another guy,  another goose like me, Norville Trask from Miami and after we had a little  scrimmage we would two-on-one Bob Kurland to try to score on him, just  from the almost free-throw line in. And we could fake Kurland out of his     oh, out of his socks, I guess I want to say. We did everything that Mr. Iba  told us, and I got fairly well acquainted with him. I   m not trying to tell you  that I was in good or real solid.  I think the biggest thrill I ever had   after I went to the Congress for a year  and completely lost my head, I decided I could be elected governor. And  David Hall was the Governor then and was gonna run again, and he was in  bad trouble with the courts. And I thought,    Well he can   t         They won   t  8  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  elect him, and I believe I can win this thing.    Well that was pretty good  thinking until a fella named David Boren decided to run, and he ran me out  of the state almost. (Laughs) We won the primary and then he got us in the  run-off, but David Hall shifted his strength in the run-off to David Boren and  so we got beat about 30,000 votes statewide. And that sounds like a lot, and  it is a lot, but then there was better than 3,000 precincts so we got beat about  nine or ten votes a precinct. I mean, it wasn   t like getting beat three to one or  five to one   and so I learned then that you don   t ever predict Oklahoma  politics   never.  What year was that that you ran for governor?  In    74.  In    74.  I can tell you. Yes, ma   am, exactly.  And what year did you walk on the basketball team?  That would have been    48,    46? Did I get back in    46, the fall of    46? Yeah, I  guess I did. Kilgore says I got back in    46, so    46.     46.  Yes, ma   am.  And then so when you ran for Governor, Mr. Iba     Endorsed me.     endorsed you.  He called, and I was never surprised in my life and he kind of hesitated and  he said,    Clem, would it be all right if I endorsed you?    I said,    Oh, my God,  Mr. Iba,    and I couldn   t say anything. So he endorsed me, and I remember  we went over to Langston and they had a nice deal there in the gym, a nice  little short program on stage, and he introduced me to all the students and the  faculty at Langston. I don   t know whether we carried Stillwater or not, but I  know we carried Langston, and so I   ll be eternally grateful for a good  feeling. That was the best feeling I   ve ever had in politics because everybody  that knew Mr. Iba just revered him and admired him. I can   t tell you the  feelings that people had that knew him a little bit, and that meant so much to  me. Never, never, never will I forget that.  And had you kept in touch with him over the years?  9  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  A little bit before we lost him, but not real close, just     That   s amazing that he called you.  Yes, ma   am, because I hadn   t seen him in   well this was in    74, and this  would have been in the   oh, gosh, yes   so that would have been in the     40s   that   s a lot of years.  That is a lot of years.  Yes, ma   am. I had met a couple of his brothers in that period of time, but I  don   t believe I   d ever talked to Mr. Iba.  What do you remember about his coaching, his practice sessions?  Oh. (Laughs)  Were they pretty rough?  They said,    You done what he said, or you tried to do what he said.    And,  yes, he was a taskmaster.  Was he a large man?  No.  Very commanding presence though?  Well yes, ma   am, very commanding presence, and he never laughed. Now  I   m sure he laughed and smiled and ha-ha   d at home or something, but he  was all business there and you played to his drummer.  Did he have a whistle? Did he blow a whistle? Do you remember?  You know, I don   t remember. I   m sure he did, but his voice was shrill  enough you could sure hear him.  Oh.  I   m not sure. I   m not so sure he did. I   d have to ask Joe Shoulders or  somebody.  What do you remember about Bob Kurland?  Big, nice guy. I   ve kind of kept up with him, not too closely but I talk to him  every couple or three years, and he   s the kind of a fella that I could walk into  10  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  his office now and he   d call me by name and I could call him by name and  we could talk. That   s the way I would describe him. But a super nice human  being.  Okay. Well, let   s talk about the rodeo team and how that all got started.  Oh, we heard about   they were gonna have a college rodeo at Lawton, at  Cameron University, and we kind of wondered how you got into this thing.  Somebody found out that you had to have an entry form that had to be signed  by a sponsor, teacher, somebody. We didn   t know who to take it to, and so I  knew Lee Gilstrap. Colonel Gilstrap had taught at the Oklahoma Military  Academy, which is now Rogers State College, and he had transferred over to  Oklahoma State   Oklahoma A M then   and he taught speech, I believe.  Well we couldn   t find him. None of us took speech. We didn   t even know  what building he taught in, and so I don   t know whether I signed it   I know  Gilstrap didn   t sign it. Some of us signed it, or one of us did, and so we just  took her down there and they (Laughs) accepted the entry, and we won the  prize. And my friend Kilgore was the   well they didn   t call it the    All  Around Cowboy    then   they did in some places   I believe they called it the     Best Cowboy    or the   whatever it was   but he was the    king of the walk.     We all thought we could beat him and we sure didn   t when it came to where  the    cheese got binding.    He whooped us all.  Okay. So that was the first rodeo, and so that was how the team started?  Yes, ma   am. And then we got this little    ole trophy that stands about this  high and we didn   t have any place for it. There was no place (Laughs) to take  it, and I   ll let Larry tell that story in a little bit because one of his very dear  friends and one of my dear friends, a former House of Representatives  member, Ed Apple, nosed around and found out that Ed was a brother-in-law  to Harold Emery, now deceased   one of our five starters   and he had a day  for us over at the Capitol. We got to go on the floor of the House and say  words and all that good stuff, you know, and they have a way of pouring it  on you over at the House and so we did that in Oklahoma City. And they  took it to the Cowboy Hall of Fame and now I believe it is   is it not at  Stillwater now? Not yet?  I think it might still be at the Cowboy Hall of Fame from what I   ve heard. I  think it   s still there.  Okay. Well I want to be sure that it   s where people can see it, or we   ll get a  movement to move it home   sure will.  So did you have a horse     Yes, ma   am.  11  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden      in school? Where did you keep your horse?  Yes, ma   am. Kept him out at the fairgrounds. Nice old gentleman named Mr.  Blue ran the fairgrounds   little short man, wore bib overalls, kind of a  country-looking gentleman. He looked after several horses that were kept out  there, and I brought two roping calves with me to practice on and that   s  where we kept our livestock, although we would go out   I guess it was west  of town, as I remember   to, oh, Frank Jay   s place, Jay Cleaners. And we   d  practice out there and practiced some at the fairgrounds but not that much.  What were your rodeo events?  I roped and tried to bulldog   and I say    tried    meaning exactly that   wasn   t  very good.  Calf roping or team roping? Both?  Calf roping.  Calf roping.  Didn   t team rope then   didn   t have it.  Were there other events that were different then than now?  No, the rest of them were about the same. Had steer roping some in some  rodeos, and I roped steers in smaller rodeos back then, but not in big ones.  Didn   t have enough money to enter the big ones. (Laughs)  When did you first learn to rope?  Oh gosh, I don   t know   I was three or four, five years old maybe.  You just grew up roping?  Yes, ma   am. Yes, ma   am.  And when was the last time that you roped? Has it been awhile?  Oh, yes, ma   am. It   s been 10 or 12 years.  Do you miss it?  Yes, ma   am, I do. I could still go get it on one, but I wouldn   t know what to  do with him after I caught him I don   t think. I   m too old and slowed down. I  couldn   t finish it.  12  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Kilgore  McSpadden  What were the entry fees for college students when you all went to the  college rodeos?  I want to say  10, but that   s a guess. It wouldn   t be over  15, I   m sure.  And did you all have the money to pay the entry fees?  We had that.  You had that.  We had to get it or find it or something. Yes, ma   am. We had to have it.  And it was  10 a person?  Yes, ma   am. If you entered two events, it would be  20.  And what kind of prizes were there?  Well they would take the pot, like if you had 30 ropers at  10 apiece, that   s   300, and if they   re gonna get two calves, you   d take two calves on average,  so it would be three pay-offs, and you   d take a third, a third, a third of the   300 which would be three  100 dollar deals and you   d give 40, 30, 20 and  10 percent of that, which is  40,  30,  20 and  10.  And did you have a pick-up truck and a trailer?  No, ma   am.  No? How did you haul your horse?  Oh, bummed a ride or something. No, ma   am, I didn   t have a pick-up, didn   t  have a trailer, but that   s why we had   we all tried to stay in good with  Turner Meadors. He had (Laughs) wheels, had a trailer and everything and  was pretty good.  So when you went to the rodeos, what other rodeos did you all go compete  at? You started out at Lawton at Cameron.  Then we went to Kansas State at Manhattan, and I   d have to   you   re asking  me questions that   things happened 60 years ago and I   m not very swift. I  don   t know if we went to any more or not. Larry?  We went to one at Norman.  Yeah, we did.  13  Kilgore  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  That   s when the bulldogging horse got away from us and Leo almost had a  heart attack.  Yeah and I think it   s the only time they ever had anything resembling a  rodeo in Norman.  Did they have barrel racing at that time? Were there women competing?  Not much, no. That came a few years later, I   d say on up in the beginning of  the    50s up in there. I   d say    53,    54 or    55, along in there is when they first  started.  Well, did the ladies come and watch the rodeos?  Oh yes. Sure they did.  So pretty good crowds?  They didn   t   no, they didn   t sell out or anything. Yes, they had decent  crowds. These   I mean they were real interesting to us because there had  never been college rodeos before.  Were there rodeo clowns then?  Yes, yes.  How did they dress? Is it the same now or has that changed?  Very similar, and they fought bulls. They were more bull fighters than  clowns, and then the trend later became,    If you   re gonna be a clown, do  something funny.    Then in regular rodeos, PRCA  Professional Rodeo  Cowboys Association  rodeos, they started the bull fighting in the    80s and  then every clown wanted to just be a bull fighter and not be a    clown    clown.  So it   s changing back a little now to some humor.  Well, is that when the barrels started, or had that been around longer than  that   where the clowns would use the barrels?  No, the clowns always had a barrel to run around, I guess   as long as I can  remember, just about.  Okay, that   s interesting. Did you ever try your hand at any other events  besides roping?  No, ma   am.  14  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Never were tempted to bull ride or anything?  Heavens to Betsy, no. (Laughter) Those guys are nuts.  So as a rodeo announcer, you   ve seen so many rodeos and events over the  years   do you enjoy watching the roping the most since you roped?  Still do. You never shed that thing that you started in trying to excel. You  always try to excel. You very seldom do, but you try and you hustle.  Okay. Were there social events after the rodeos?  Sometimes there   d be dances, but we   d generally have to get home to go to  class the next day so we didn   t. We   d just get behind that wheel and go home  or go to Stillwater.  You mentioned that you had some calves and you kept your horse there and  that you would practice   did you go quite a bit? Did you practice almost  every day?  Sure. I tried to get up and rope a little bit every day. I just had those two  calves so I just probably roped two calves and that way it   s kind of keeping  your horse in shape and   yes, ma   am.  Well, tell me about your rope? What kind of rope were you using?  They were three-eighths or a scant seven-sixteenths, and they were Plymouth  Yacht Manila. That was before they started really making nylon ropes. They  started making nylons during World War II, and before that they were all  Plymouth Manila ropes. They were made back east in Massachusetts     Boston. They had a good feel to them and as a matter of fact, I believe that   s  one right over there, that one   s that coiled up   I think that   s a Plymouth.  And they don   t   that one has just been coiled up there for years but it   s a  good feeling rope. It might be a little stiff now, it   s been in this room for a  good while.  Were there any traditions that developed around the rodeo team?  No, we all just went and had fun and tried to win. That was it, and if we  didn   t win it was all right because we had gotten to hear the band play and  gone somewhere and got to rope before a crowd. (Laughs) So that was all  right.  So you all enjoyed being together.  Sure we did.  15  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Kilgore  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  Yes. And who were the other members?  Harold Emery, Turner Meadors   of course, Larry Kilgore, Bud Reger and  Leo Roberts   and gosh, they   re all gone except Larry and I.  And you all kept in touch all across the years, didn   t you?  Yes, ma   am.  Could you tell me a little bit about that?  Well we just kept in touch. We were friends then and we were friends the  rest of our lives. And when you form a friendship, especially at that age and  that close, you don   t ever get away from that friendship. You stay friends  and you know that you can count on them and they   ll be your friends   and  that   s the way we lived for about, almost 60 years.  Did you have reunions in particular?  Not per se   we had one at Kilgore   s house years ago.  What about Leo   s turn at the lake?  Well, but I   m talking about way back, when Emery and those guys were  living. And so, yes, we kept in pretty close touch with each other because  they kind of spread to the high winds and moved out of the state.  Did you ever meet President Bennett?  Yes, ma   am. He wouldn   t have remembered me, I don   t think, but yes,  ma   am. I had a distant cousin that married his daughter, and so I knew who  he was. Yes, ma   am, I knew him.  What do you remember about him?  Well to me, he looked gruff. He wasn   t, but he didn   t have a happy face   I  guess that   s what I want to say   but he was a great president, a great  president.  Did you realize that at the time?  No, ma   am. No, ma   am.  And how was it with the different colleges? Did the students get along or did  the agriculture students and the engineering students have any   was there  any friction between the students of the different colleges or anything like  16  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  that?  I didn   t notice that. No, ma   am. I   m sure there would be some rivalry, but we  didn   t notice that very much.  Okay. Did you ever meet Frank Eaton   Pistol Pete?  No, I don   t think I ever did. I saw him bunches of times   as far as meeting  him or talking to him, I don   t think I ever did. Don   t think I ever did.  Okay. One of the things I wanted to be sure and ask you about today was  your Cowboy   s Prayer. Could you tell me the story behind that?  Well, I   m a big sports fan and   oh, in the    50s, I don   t know when it was        56 or    57,    55   along in there   once Tulsa had an old-timers baseball  dinner that I had gone to for several years. There was a minister   he was  either a Presbyterian or a Methodist   and he always gave the invocation to  open the festivities that night, and he gave a baseball prayer. And driving  home   I do all my thinking when I   m driving by myself   and by the time I  got to Catoosa, just a few miles out of Tulsa, I had put together a prayer in  my own mind that used western or Cowboy lingo as he used baseball lingo.  And his punch line in his prayer was,    May he ask the Lord to let him live  the kind of life so when he got up there the Lord could tell him that he was  safe at home.    So by the time I got to Catoosa, I kind of had one thought out.  I didn   t do anything with it until I went to Big Spring, Texas that summer to  announce the rodeo. We were still in session in June, and I had a plane  chartered to fly me to Big Spring. I called ahead and said,    I   ll be there just  in time for the rodeo. Don   t panic,    and talked to the secretary, I said,    Get a  program ready for me, will you please, ma   am.    And she said,    Yes.    So, oh,  I get there like 10 minutes till 8:00 and get up on the announcer   s stand and  there   s a fella waiting for me there that   s on the committee and it   s the first  time I had been in Big Spring. I had never seen this man before, and he said,     And don   t forget we   re gonna lead that rider-less horse out for Uncle John.  Could you say something? A little prayer or something?    And I said,    Yes,  sir, I believe I can,    and then with that, he turned around and walked back  down.  I turned to somebody and I said,    Who was Uncle John?    They said,    Well,  he was an elderly gentleman, rancher   everybody knew and everybody  loved, and he helped start this rodeo several years ago and he died last  winter,    and so I just ad-libbed my thoughts after they led the horse out.  Freckles Brown was there in the bull riding, and Freckles and I had traveled  together a lot and stayed together. We were best friends, and we had a deal if  he got to a place first he   d have a room for me or half a bed or something,  and I   d do the same thing for him. So when I crawled down off the  17  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  announcer   s stand that night, he was waiting down at the bottom and I just  knew he was gonna say,    Now, I   ve got us a room up here at the Trails End  Inn up here.    He kind of talked fast, and he said,    Hey,    he said,    Clem    and  he used the word    little    a lot      I like that little horse         I   ve got a good  little pick-up,    he   d say. He said,    I sure liked that little prayer you gave.    I  said,    Thank you, Freckles.    He said,    Make me a promise.    I said,    What   s  that?    He said,    If I die before you do, will you give it at my funeral?    I said,     Yes, I will.    So he did, and I did, and I gave the Cowboy   s Prayer at Hugo  at Freckles    funeral several years later. But I admired and respected this good  little man.  Would you recite the prayer for me for the camera?     Our Gracious and Heavenly Father, we pause in the midst of this very  festive occasion as we prepare to present a sport spawned from an industry  of the livestock more than a century ago and whose contestants, today   s  professional cowboys and cowgirls, carry on the same hopes and dreams and  traditions that our pioneering forefathers did. As cowboys, they don   t ask  you for any special favors, Lord. They don   t ever ask that they never break a  barrier in a timed event, that they draw around that chute-fighting horse or  bull they   re not sure they can make the whistle on, because they realize  there   s a much more important arena for all of us   the arena of life. Help us  ride in that arena, Lord, on a horse that   s as honest as we hope to be and in a  country where the wind blows free and clean across the western range land.  So when we make that last ride that is inevitable for all of us to make, to the  place up there where the grass is green and lush and stirrup-high and the  water is crystal clear and deep, you   ll tell us as we enter your arena     Cowboy, your entry fees are paid.    We ask these things in Christ   s name.  Amen.     That   s very nice and have you had opportunities to say that a lot over the  years? (Laughter)  Yes, ma   am. (Laughter) I gave it at 150 performances of the National Finals  Rodeo in Oklahoma City, and then I was asked with Reba McIntire to re-do  the opening in Las Vegas two years ago using the prayer, and I did a flag  thing then introducing her to do the National Anthem. And so   and at every  rodeo I go to now, with rare exceptions, they   ll want that. I never try to tell  them,    I   ve got it. I   ll give it for you.    I like for them to ask. I don   t want to  force anything on them, but it is, I think, the way that a cowboy believes and  I   m a firm believer in that and so. Then we get   oh, once or twice a month,  we   ll get a call or a letter from somebody wanting it for a funeral. We even  had somebody in Colorado that wanted to pray it at their wedding or recite at  their wedding which I thought was kind of gross but then it takes all kinds.  Well     18  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  I   ve talked too much.  Oh, there   s a lot more I know you could say, and I see hanging on the wall  another poem, I guess, or the,    if our flag could talk,    that you wrote?  Yes, ma   am.  What   s the story about that?  Oh, you don   t do anything original, you generally steal or borrow a little  from somebody. When I was in Congress, they had the Marine Corps Band  on the floor of the House one day and the Marine Corps young man gave a  little dissertation on,    if our flag could talk,    and talked about the steel mills  of Pennsylvania, the redwood trees of California and so forth and so on, so I  just kind of changed some of that and did that.  Before we close up here, I may just give you a name of somebody that I   ve  heard of or know about in Oklahoma and if you   ll just kind of give me your  reactions, I guess, or your opinion. Jim Shoulders, of course, would be     Jim Shoulders was the biggest tree in the rodeo forest, period. Nobody will  ever replace him. He was my friend and I   ll never forget the man, never. His  widow, Sharon, and Donna are great friends   they send jokes on e-mail  every week   and you just don   t forget people like that.  Your family   your uncle Will   great-uncle     He gave me this saddle when I was five, and that   s a Visalia and it   s   these  are sterling silver conchos. The Visalia was the   I guess kind of the  Mercedes-Benz of the saddle business back then. It   s a California-made  saddle. Blake Roberts    (Leo   s son) little boy rode that saddle for awhile. Bill  Lawrence   s kids all rode it (Laughs) in everything and I   ve just kind of kept  it around for a number of years.  Ben Johnson?  Yes, ma   am. That   s him right there. He was raised over in the Osage. His  father was a great steer roper and quit the roping business. All of a sudden he  had a chance to run the Chapman Barnard Ranch and did until his death. I  believe people up there might have been the greatest cowboys of all time in     53 with Casey Tibbs and Todd Whatley and those guys   Bill Linderman     great bunch of cowboys.  Reba McEntire?  Oh, good Lord. She   s the sweetest, nicest person that the Lord ever sent  19  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  down. Donna and I gave each other an airplane ticket to New York when  she   we wanted to see the first performance when she opened on Broadway,  and we wanted to do something for her. She likes yellow roses and we  bought, it was either 26 or 27, yellow roses for her. The girl that traveled  with her, we told her what we were doing, and we wrapped them all up. Reba  had seats for us on the fourth row   aisle seats, great seats   and so we   I  took them in and put them under our feet, and a little girl came down to pick  us up right before the end and took us down to the stage   and boy those  lights are bright, I had no idea how bright they were.  And so I   m standing there kind of down on about the 20-yard line on the one  end of this long stage and Reba came out with the cast and looked down and  saw me and kind of had a funny-looking look on her face and walked down.  And so I handed her these 27 yellow roses and told her that there was one  rose for every year since she first sang the anthem at the Finals and it was a  long, long road from the bull chutes to Broadway, and she broke down and  cried right there. I mean that   s how normal she is and, you know, she   s just  normal   good, good people. Good, good people, and she hasn   t forgotten  where she came from. And you could almost describe her as an old country  boy would describe somebody who was very    common.    You say,    Well  he   s common as pig tracks, but he   s a good fella.    Well she can be,    as  common as pig tracks,    but a great, great lady and has a talent as big as  Texas.  What about your wife?  Oh gosh, she   s the glue that holds it all together. I can   t tell you the many  nice things that she can do. I just can   t. I over-matched myself, and I   ve been  kind of down here for six weeks   don   t get around good, and she waits on  me like   oh, good Lord, I can   t begin to tell you. I just over-married  myself   way out-married myself.  How many years have you been married?  Forty-seven. Indian says,    Long time.    Not as long as you guys  referring to  Larry Kilgore and his wife .  What about Oklahoma?  Oh, there   s just one place and that   s Oklahoma and then there   s a bunch of  other ones all around us. But you love Oklahoma   sure do   not a better  place to live anywhere. A lot of them have pluses and minuses, but I   d put us  up against anybody.  Changes in the rodeo business?  20  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  McSpadden  Neurohr  Oh, Lord, I could talk for 18 hours on that. You ought to hold that for  awhile     Okay.     and we   ll   next time   in about a year when you think you   re through,  come over here and just ask me that question (Laughter) and we   ll talk early  maybe some morning   early some morning.  All right. Well is there anything else that you   d like to add?  No, Lord, Lord, Lord   what   s the point? I   m gonna get a glass of water  now. My throat   s dry.  Well, thank you     You bet.     for the interview. I certainly do appreciate it.  -------  -------
