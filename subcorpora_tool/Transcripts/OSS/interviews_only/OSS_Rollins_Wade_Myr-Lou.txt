 Finchum. I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is July 20, 2009. I   m here with Myr-Lou Rollins Wade  and she   s going to talk a little about her time here at OSU as a dance  instructor  1956-1986 . Thank you for coming today.  Thank you for having me.  Let   s start by having you talk a little bit about your childhood, where  you were born, then we   ll work our way forward.  Do you want the birth date also?  If you want to give it, that   s fine.  I was born February 5, 1935 in Corpus Christi, Texas in my mother   s  bedroom. That was an ordeal too, back in those days. She was supposed  to go to the hospital but it didn   t happen so I came in the bedroom.  Anyway, I went to school. Graduated from Corpus Christi High School  in 1952. Then I went to Del Mar Junior College for a little while. Since I  had danced all of my life, I was more interested in dance than I was in  college. The teacher at the time was very good for encouraging me and  doing a good job with promoting me, and thought it would be good for  me to go to Hollywood. So my parents reluctantly, and we were not  really well-endowed, were able to scrap up enough money. I was so  unhappy not being able to dance that I was sent to Hollywood and had a  real good opportunity to study with different people there. I soon found  out that I was not interested in that style of life and was eager to come  back home after about six months of being there. I got enough of  Hollywood.  5  Finchum  Rollins Wade  I came back and was told about Texas State College for Women having  a dance degree in recreation   or in dance. They had actually a  performing group and a dance program. So I went to Texas State  College for Women and auditioned for their dance group and was  accepted. And for three years then, plus summers, I was with the Texas  State College for Women Dance Group. We toured all over, going to  different colleges. My senior year, we came to Oklahoma A M. We  stayed in, I think, Murray Hall. I don   t remember now which dorm it  was we stayed in but we had to walk around Theta Pond to go to the  concert hall to rehearse and get ready for our concert. It was spring and  it was beautiful. The campus was the prettiest. People were the  friendliest. We had been to many different college campuses at that time.  I just fell in love with the campus.  But little did I know, when we got on the bus ready to go back home,  this woman came in and sat down beside me and asked me if I was  interested in coming to teach. At that time, I really wasn   t thinking   about work , I was just interested in graduating and getting through. I  hadn   t really thought about where I was going to go to teach or anything.  But that made my decision very easy because it was such a beautiful  campus and everybody was so friendly.  My dean, at the time, had a fit. She said,    You need to go interview all  these other places     Most of them were all east because back then dance  was not all that popular in the education system. I said,    No, I don   t need  to go interview. I   m perfectly happy coming to Oklahoma.    My parents  thought it was in Indian country and back in    56, you didn   t let young  ladies go very far. But anyway, they let me go to Hollywood, so I guess  they thought it was okay for me to go to Oklahoma. So that is the way I  ended at Oklahoma A M. It was with the promise that I would get my  master   s so I had to go back to Texas State College for Women during  the summers and do also correspondence courses to get my master   s. At  that time, they changed to Texas Woman   s University and of course  after I was at Oklahoma A M for a while, it changed to Oklahoma State  University. So every place I   ve been has changed their names on me.  (Laughs)  When you first started here, how many classes did you teach?  I don   t recall specifically, but each semester it seemed like we had at  least five or six classes that we were expected to teach. It was for the  two-hour physical education classes, which most of them were dance at  that time. But then I didn   t teach them bowling and gymnastics and body  mechanics   they also had what was called body mechanics at that time,  which that was a forerunner into aerobics.  6  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  And where were the classes? What building?  When I first came, it was a definite division of the women   s department  and the men   s department. The men were in the field house which at that  time was called the field house instead of Gallagher-Iba. Our department  was in Gardiner Hall. We had our main offices there. There was social  dance or ballroom dance which I taught in the old gym which is the  armory which now is part of the  architecture  department. They   ve  changed it completely, or are in the process of changing it anyway. The  dance studio was down in the basement of North Murray Hall, which  was a disastrous place because it flooded several times. I don   t know if  that has been mentioned in the history of OSU or not. And then, of  course, when I taught bowling, I had to go to the Student Union. I had a  lot of leg work. I used to bicycle for a while to go from place to place.  At that time there weren   t that many vehicles on campus, really and  truly, so it wasn   t that difficult to park. But we did get permits to park at  the Student Union. So the years I taught bowling, I didn   t have to walk  that far.  We should probably say you were here from 1956 to     1986.     86.  When I first started with dance, it was basically at a private dance studio  which was ballet and tap and acrobatics at that time. Then somewhere  around my junior and senior year of high school  1951/1952 , we started  hearing about this weird thing called modern dance, contemporary dance  which back in those days it started with Ruth St. Denis and the scarves  and were more free dance type things where you didn   t have to wear  ballet shoes or any kind of shoes. You danced barefooted. You had  much more freedom of movement which when I found out you could do  that, I really fell in love with the idea of the creative freestyle of modern  dance.  So then I started studying. Of course when I went to Hollywood, that  was the professional introduction, I studied at the Alvin Ailey Dance  School which they still have even though he   s no longer living. They  still have a touring group that performs his style of modern dance. Then,  I had to teach modern dance when I came here. That was what they were  in. And, of course at Texas State College for Women, it was a modern  dance group. We did a ballet each time just to have a variety of style.  But most of the time it was a creative type of modern dance that they  were interested in promoting.  7  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  You had to do costumes too for some of that?  Oh yes. When I had to do my master   s, Texas State College for Women  theses were creative theses. They were not research projects. You had to  choreograph, create a suite of dances based upon some story. I thought  since I was in Oklahoma that I would create a suite of dances based  upon the history of Oklahoma.  Oh neat.  That was my first introduction to this library, digging through some of  the dirty (laughs) history books of Oklahoma, which they were really old  ones back in those days, and getting some things that would be  interesting to create a dance. So that was my thesis, which I used the  students here and then we had to go to Texas for my committee to  observe them and approve the dance style. It all had to be written and  documented, also. I also created the music at that time. Plus, the  costumes, as you said. (Laughs) So it was the whole process of doing  that.  Now as far as costumes, when I first came, down in North Murray they  had an attic type place back there that had some boxes of old costumes  of which Flora Mae Ellis, I don   t know if you   ve had that name  presented to you, but she was the dance person before I came. She was  doing a lot of this free type of dance with scarves and the more  Ruth   St. Denis and Mary Wigman and their type of dance. At that time, there  was not a budget for dance, but Mr.  James J.  Kevin who was the head  of the department and Ms.  Valerie  Colvin who, bless her heart, she was  my mentor and promoted me, helped me a lot and was able to get some  funds so that I could create some costumes for those dances. And, of  course, those dances were also used in the concerts. I had a concert of  every year that had to be done, or was done. I don   t remember if that  was a requirement or I wanted to do it. But we did it anyway, giving the  students the opportunity to experience this new style of dance, which  most of them, like myself, had only been trained in a studio with ballet  and tap and later on jazz came about, which was a new style to  incorporate and the classes.  Where would you do the performances?  Well, the concert hall, which was not Seretean at the time. Everybody  called it the auditorium and that is where we performed the dances.  Were there as many men as there were women that participated?  Well no, very few. But we did, from year to year, have some men who  8  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  would try out for the dances. Of course, I was eager to use them as best I  could. Some of them had some experience and some of them didn   t.  They were just eager to try it out. I would give anyone a stab at it if they  were willing to give the time. That was another problem, finding  rehearsal time that everybody was able to get together and work for  doing the dances and having them perfected for the concert.  At that time they were required to have physical education classes?  Yes, the requirements were for the classes. But as far as the concerts, the  tryouts were open to the whole university. Anyone who was interested  could come. Like I said, there were people who were in the classes, but  for several years there was no requirement for them to be in the concert.  Then there were certain years when the physical education majors were,  so to speak,    taking dance classes.    That was in part a part of physical  education at one time, to promote dance along with sports. Through their  required classes, it was a part of their requirement to participate in the  concert. Some of them were not very willing to do that, (laughs) but they  did.  Would classes generally be in the morning or would they be late  afternoon?  The classes have been either in the morning or the afternoon. Now, the  rehearsals, as far as practice and everything, we had to occupy the late  afternoon and the evening hours. To try to get a group of students  together to rehearse was not easy when they had many different class  schedules. When we moved into the Colvin Center, we had conflicts  with the recreation classes which were using the dance studio. Then, we  weren   t able to rehearse at night many times because they had recreation  classes in the dance studio. So that became a problem.  Talk a little bit about the dance studio. What was the studio itself like?  Well, North Murray was basically a cement and tile floor which was not  the best for dance. Also, then in the basement at that time, we did not  have air conditioning so that was not the best for circulation. We had  fans down there, but in the afternoon and evenings the sun made it pretty  unbearable. We endured the heat a lot easier then than we do now  because we weren   t used to air conditioning. But then going to the  Colvin Center, I will explain when it came time to create the Colvin  Center, each of us in our own areas were asked to give recommendations  for space, designs, whatever that we wished for the new building. So  with my creative mind, I started thinking about the best dance studio I  could come up with, and I designed the original drawing on scale putting  down exactly where I wanted the electrical outlets and the mirrors. The  9  one goof that I made was that I wanted curtains to cover the mirrors. But  I didn   t know you had a third of the space for the curtains to go back and  it would cover up the mirrors. So we never used the curtains because I  didn   t want the mirrors covered up because that is an important part of  learning your dances is to watch yourself in the mirror to see that you   re  corresponding with everyone else. But when it comes time to perform,  we   d have to turn around the other way so that they wouldn   t be using  the mirrors. That   s the reason I wanted the curtains, so we could cover  up the mirrors when it came time for performing.  I also created a costume room, which up to that time I was making  costumes in my apartment with my own sewing machine and everything.  When the budget allowed they bought me a sewing machine for a  costume room. It had a beautiful big table that you could lay patterns  and materials out to cut and sew. It was a beautiful costume room, I was  so proud of it. And the studio was beautiful too. Then recreation came  along and wanted the use of the floor space for their classes. So then we  had to compete with trying to keep shoes off the floor, dirt off the floor,  because we were barefooted and of course did all the stretches and  working on the floor, so it was nice to have the clean floor.  And also then Physical Education divided into Health, Leisure Sciences  and started hiring more people and they also had a graduate program  developed. They needed graduate assistances. So they took over my  costume room and all of the costumes and everything had to be moved  out into closets and the dance studio, which took up dance studio space.  Plus, it was not good because they finally put locks on them, but then  people would break into the locks to see what was in the costume  closets, which naturally wasn   t anything they were interested in. But  they would break into them to find out what was in there. So all of my  beautiful things that I worked for soon started disappearing.  The first 25 years were very fun and encouraging. The last five were  starting to wither away my ideas because as I said, the Board of Regents,  I assume, I don   t know, but we also had a change in administration. We  were in the College of Arts and Sciences. At that time, Dean  Smith L.   Holt did not think physical education should be a part of the College of  Arts and Sciences. He wanted it to be in the College of Education  because it was basically a teaching program. The head of our  department, Dr.  George H.  Oberle, was a very fond person of dance. I  don   t know exactly how it happened, but somewhere along the line they  decided dance was not a part of the required program. All physical  education credits went. So therefore I guess it all fit in with the dance  deal also.  They started cutting the requirements for the physical education majors.  10  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  I think they just take one class of combined dance now. At the time they  had four different classes, which they took modern dance, folk square  and social, a choreography class, and a dance production class which  was the concert performing part of the class so that when they went out  to teach, they could do a dance program after having some experience.  Most of them never had any dance when they came to OSU.  I   m thinking now of Dancing with the Stars. Dancing has become more  popular.  Oh, I   ll tell you, you know I don   t think my body could exist in what  they   re doing in dance classes now. It   s really amazing to me with  especially all these spins on different parts of their body which I don   t  think the Lord made us intended to do that. (Laughs) But anyway, I did  go back to the costumes, since it was limited, I had to do the creation  and the making of the costumes. We used leotards and tights as basics  instead of trying to fit each individual body into a certain costume. Then  using parts and pieces like skirts that had elastics in them or scarves that  you could pin on different ways. When you look through the pictures  you   ll see that basically everybody has a leotard and tight on and then  something is added to make it appropriate for their dance they were  creating. Each of the concerts had a different title and I have a book that  has all those programs in there that you can look through and see if  you   re interested in those. To come up with a theme for the concert and  then try to create dances that interpret that theme or that title which I  was intent on trying to make it creative dance, not just movement for  movement   s sake. Then, of course, jazz came along and that became  popular. Everybody wanted to do jazz. (Laughs)  So you had to continually be learning new things yourself.  Well I did   I had all kinds of workshops that I went to during the  summer to study under different people. New ideas were evolving all the  time. It was hard to keep up with it for sure.  So among all of your students, did you have a favorite or two that just  stand out in your mind?  Well, there were students who were very eager to perform and would  come back every year. I created what was called the Leo Award which I  designed in the shape of a basic  leotard . At that time the basic black  leotard, at the very beginning, was a short sleeve leotard made out of  cotton. If they participated in four years that they were here which  included six dances, some years we   d do two dances instead of just one  in the concert, then their name was put on that plaque. I had several  students that continued to do the dances to be honored on the Leo  11  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Award. But as far as name dropping   I do have certain students and I  can tell you later on if you don   t want it on the recording.  It   s up to you. If you want it on the tape, that   s fine. I didn   t want to put  you on the spot.  Well the one that stands out of interest for most people is Sandy Mahl at  the time, who married Garth Brooks.  Oh, okay.  The last two years of    84 and    85 she participated in the dance concert.  And  her  last year, she had met Garth and he would come to pick her up  at the rehearsals. I tried to get him to participate in the concert but he  was so busy singing and playing his music that he wasn   t interested at  that time. Of course, they got married, and everyone knows where they  lived and my apartment was not too far from them. Sometimes I   d see  them walking their dog out and would meet them out that way  sometimes. Then another one that people might know is Carol Ann  Drummond which was Dr. Drummond   s mother. She was one of the  students that participated. So I   ve had some students that have continued  to do very well.  Did you ever imagine that you would stay in the same spot for 30 years,  in your career?  Well, back in those days, I think longevity was more prominent than it is  now. I can remember maybe the last ten years that everybody kept  saying you need to change and go to another place. Well, I wasn   t  interested in changing. I was very happy here and I enjoyed it. I had  good support for dance. The budget was very limited but    oh and I  would like to mention that Dr. Kamm, which he was the head of the  College of Arts and Sciences, was very supportive of the arts, and dance  especially. He and Maxine were   and I have some thank you letters that  they wrote me for the concerts that I did. And of course, Ms. Colvin,  Valerie Colvin which I would like to make a point which I   m hearing  students call her Coalvin instead of Colvin. And her name is Valerie  Colvin, not    Coal,    and she would be very unhappy because she was a  very proper southern lady that she thought everything had to be perfect  and correct. I hope that if nobody else is correcting the students, that  they do get that corrected, that her name is Colvin. She was very good to  help me with the dance. She was very supportive.  Would she ever do some of it?  Oh no. But she did teach. She was very tiny, extremely active to her late  12  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  years. She would teach. And Creative Rhythms,  which  was another  class that originally was called   oh, what was it, elementary education  classes that they had activity.  P.E.  The elementary teachers were  required to take an activity class she promoted the sports and dance  activities, also. Then, they decided they needed a Creative Rhythms  class for elementary teachers, which was not a requirement but they  could take that as a physical education class at that time. And that was a  fun class that I taught that would take the elementary teachers to the  elementary schools here and let them experience working with them, the  children, through Creative Rhythms.  That had to be fun.  It was a good experience. Some of them decided they didn   t want to be  an elementary teacher after that. I don   t think at that time they gave the  students an opportunity to actually experience some of their degrees they  had chosen. But it was a good class and I enjoyed that too. I don   t  remember now why it was deleted from the requirements. But there  were a lot of changes. It seemed like they constantly changed, which of  course I guess that   s progress.  I don   t know if now they require any physical education for freshman  here.  I don   t think so. And like I said, even the physical education majors are  very limited with what activity classes they are required to take  anymore. It   s a whole different world.  Did you parents ever come up and watch any of your      Yes, once or twice they did. My mother was very supportive. My dad, of  course, he wasn   t a dance   well neither one of them had a lick of  rhythm to them or the ability to dance. I don   t know where I came about  it. They did come up twice, I think. It was not easy to travel in those  days. And then, of course, my father became ill early and they weren   t  able to do much.  What do you think prompted your interest in dance to begin with?  I was told I was very shy and I   d always   of course everybody wore  skirts back in those days. They   d be out and I   d always hide behind  mother   s skirts like kids do, trying to hide. She thought it would be good  for me to take dance to try to overcome that shyness. She took me to the  one teacher they had in Corpus at that time. Her name was Ella Ilse and  she said,    Oh I don   t take children that young.    And she said,    Well if  you   d like to come and watch the class and see.    So Mother would come  13  Finchum  Rollins Wade  with me and they told me that I wouldn   t get off of her lap but we would  observe the classes. Mother says the first time that I finally got off of her  lap that I never wanted her back in the room again. And for some reason,  it really took. Then that teacher had to have a leave of absence to have  some children. I took from another studio which I was not as happy  with. So, when my original teacher started teaching again, then I went  back to her. She was a perfectionist and she made sure, she was very  intent on the correct usage of the body. That   s where I got a good  background in exercise and how to use your body correctly, not to cause  injuries. She was a very good inspiration, plus she would take us to  conventions and we would see professional people and they would pat  you on the back and encourage you.  The campus has changed a lot since    86, but from    56 to    86 it probably  changed quite a bit, too. And they were having Homecoming. Did you do  anything specifically with Homecoming where dance was concerned?  No. Coordinating dance and activities on campus was not very easy.  There was a time when Max Mitchell, who was the head of the music  department, had an interest in trying to coordinate the arts. We did some  dance with the music department. That was somewhat well received but  the music people had their own agendas for what they wanted to  promote and they were not interested in coordinating or using their  talents as a backup, so to speak, for dance. Now since then, and there  was a performance not too long ago that a lady, I don   t remember her  name, and her daughter performed on stage. The daughter was a dancer  and the mother was a music professor in the department. I was glad to  see them allowing some coordination there.  Then we tried to coordinate with theater. At that time Vivia Locke was  very proper with her drama in that she did not think the coordination of  acting and dancing, singing was not a part of her agenda. She wanted to  do Shakespeare and more classical thing. The interesting thing is that as  soon as they built the Seretean Center where they had the theater, which  was ideal for dance because the concert hall stage was just deplorable at  that time and the nails and the splinters were not good for bare feet.  Armando Contardi, thank goodness, he tried to improve the stage as  much as possible. But we were allowed to perform on the theater stage  one year and Vivian Locke about had a fit because we were occupying  her departmental time for using the theater for rehearsals. So one year  was the end of any type of trying to coordinate with the theater  department. But it   s such a blessing that they have Peter Westerhoff, that  they do dance. And they   re performing musicals.  Originally I started first with the endowed scholarship through the  College of Education trying to promote a person who might be interested  14  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  in dance and physical education to give them an opportunity for a  scholarship. Then, I did a scholarship in the College of Arts and  Sciences through the theater department for a person interested in dance  there. So even though dance has almost evaporated from the campus,   we   re  trying to keep a spark going in physical education and like I  said, the theater department is doing a very good job in encouraging  dance there.  Back in the late    70s a lot of dorms or sororities would have dances.  Would they ask for any private lessons or anything at that time?  No, we did have quite a few people who would try out at the beginning  of the spring semester each year. They   d be gung ho. Then Varsity  Review would come along and Spring Sing and all their activities. So  that would be a real challenge for the students to try to do both  rehearsals and practicing for both activities. I did not have much  working with the sororities as far as coordinating dance. Now some of  the people that would take dance would work with their Varsity Review  visual choreography and things like that. But did not have a lot of  coordination with some of that.  Well changing gears just a little, you mentioned that you also taught  bowling. Do you want to talk a little bit about the alley, for the record?  Well, that was an experience. I had bowled some and I guess that   s the  reason I was asked to teach some bowling. Then again I had to do some  studying to be able to know exactly what to do. They had people come  on campus for workshops that were able to go get more information for  bowling. That was a nice break from dance, but it was also a challenge.  When I first started, all the classes were women   s classes. Then some of  the men would choose to take the ballroom social dance. There was a  time period when it was very active and it had up to 200 people in a  social dance or ballroom dance class at that time, and not always were  there equal men and women. But in the bowling classes then, you   d end  up with more men than women. (Laughs) That was an experience too, to  work with the bowling.  Originally the bowling alley was not automated. You had to go back and  set the pins. The classes were three times a week so you had to rotate so  one of your class periods would be behind the bowling alley to set pins.  The students were not very eager to do that. It was hot and dirty and  noisy and everything else. You know everybody has their own talent and  you   re not always able to adapt to all their talents. Some of the girls  were not able to understand the mechanics of how to pull the level to let  the pins down and to watch for the balls. You had to stay very alert  because it could be dangerous to work back there. So that was an  15  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  experience to have to coordinate students to agree to do that. And later  on, they came up with the automated system and originally you learned  how to do your own scoring which some students, their talent was not  math. (Laughs) So that was a challenge. There were a lot of changes in  all departments, I guess, as technology improved.  The alley was in the basement of the current Student Union.  Yes, I think the Student Activity   what do they call those? Pigeon holes  or whatever you call them. That   s not what you call them.  Carrels?  Well, I think that   s the more technical term, where they had their desks  where they do their thing. That   s where the bowling lanes were, down in  that area. Originally, the bowling alley was the only thing down there in  the basement. Then, they came up with the game room. And if you talk  to Allen Reding, he   ll have all the information about the changes that  they made in the basement.  Do you remember much of the hubbub over the name change from  OAMC to OSU? It happened in like    57-   58, somewhere in there.  I don   t remember what year it did change.  1957, right about when you came.  Well I guess so. Like I said, Texas State College for Women changed  their name. I think everybody was increasing their status, I think you  could say, by changing the name to a university from a college. I was  always so focused to dance that I wasn   t always in on understanding  what was going on. I just went with the flow and did what I had to to  continue. So I don   t recall any big hubbub. I know my brother and all of  his kids graduated from Texas A M. That was always a comparison if  Oklahoma A M changed their name, should Texas A M change  theirs? And they weren   t about to change. So Texans are more stubborn,  I guess.  The presidents of the campus probably changed a couple times when you  were here, too.  Oh yes, and I don   t recall all of them except for Dr. Kamm, which I  always had great admiration for his personality and abilities.  Well, back in    56 when you first came, you were single, away from  home, for the second time. Is there anything about Stillwater that you  16  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  recall?  Well, it was very small. When it was time for me to get a job I didn   t  have a car because back in those days you didn   t have cars when you  were in college. In fact, Texas State College for Women didn   t even  allow a vehicle on campus. If you needed one, you had to get a special  permit and generally it was for handicapped people or someone who  managed to get them. So anyway, I did not have a car so I had to  purchase a car. Back in those days, new cars were not always readily  available. I got myself a    56 Chevy Bel Air, which it was a beautiful  white car. Now those are classics, I wish I still had it. Anyway, when I  first came to Stillwater, everybody took a double take to see that car  because there weren   t that many of that style of car. I had to have what  few belongings I had shipped by train. I guess my father knew how to do  it but that was a problem because my belongings didn   t show up for two  or three days. My mother came with me because she did not want me  coming up here by myself. (Laughs)  And places to live were not that easily available. Ms. Colvin drove all  over town, it was a small town at that time, looking for an apartment for  me. She saw them building these apartments behind a house, a two story  apartment. She stopped and talked to the people, who were the Diggs,  and they said they were going to try to have it available come August or  September, whenever I was supposed to be here. So it was a brand new  apartment when I moved in.  Oh and I might back up. When this lady came on the bus to ask me if I  wanted a job and I said yes, well when I got home that summer and my  father wanted to see the contract I said,    Well, I don   t have a contract.     He said,    Well, how do you know you have a job?    (Laughs) And I said,     Well, they talked to me and told me.    Later on I got a letter saying I  had been accepted. I guess all that time I just thought I had a job. But  everything was so informal back in those days. The phone calls and  letters and like I said, Ms. Colvin finding me a place to stay. That   s how  I arrived.  Did you stay in that same place your entire     You   re going to get me to admit something. I still pay the rent on that  same place. I   ve purchased it many times. (Laughs) But I met my  husband in    86 when things were not going too well. But I didn   t talk  about that. When they started doing away with dance, I was told I would  have to teach health and I   ve forgotten now what else, other classes  which I was not trained and I was not prepared to teach. I think they  were interested in getting rid of dance anyway. Luckily I was able  to  use  the  rule of  80 plan,  and was able at  51 to take early retirement.  17  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  So I was still paying rent. I was not being allowed to continue to teach  dance, I   ll put it that way. I had plans for a 30 year concert to have  students from the past come back. Some of them were eager to do that.  Well, the powers that be would not give me a budget. They didn   t want  any dance, period. So I did not get to do a dance concert.  About that time, the Stillwater Ballroom Dance Club was developing  and they wanted a person to teach some dance. So I was contacted to  help with the Ballroom Dance Club, in the community, to get started  with the dance lessons. So I went to one of their dances to observe and  this man asked me to dance.  This is a  long story, but anyway three  years later we got married. At that time, he had a house in Perry that was  full of stuff and I had an apartment in Stillwater that was full of stuff. So  we both agreed to keep that apartment. I still pay rent on it and I still  have an apartment full of stuff, and he still has a house full or stuff. We  both have more stuff than we need. (Laughter)  And that   s been 20 years or so, hasn   t it?  It has been, yes. (Laughs) Never realized it would last that long, but  anyway it has. He likes to dance. He   s very creative. He   s extremely  hard of hearing and nobody understands how he can feel the rhythm but  he has beautiful rhythm. He   s very creative with some of his steps so it  clicked and we enjoy dancing even though I had to give up my modern  and ballet and all the other forms of dance I enjoyed doing. We do  country western and polka dancing. We   ve kind of given up ballroom  dancing now because we don   t drive at night that much, so we don   t  come to Stillwater at nights.  All of those require different attire too, don   t they?  Yes, more or less. And supposedly a different style, but we just have our  one style is all we do.  Well, I don   t have a rhythm bone in my body, so I admire someone who  does. It   s a shame that they don   t still have it.  What I said about everybody having their own talents, either you have a  talent for dance or you don   t.  I don   t.  Now, there was a period in time when people said,    Oh, everybody can  dance.    I don   t think that   s true. Just like everybody can   t be an artist or  everybody can   t be a musician. There are certain talents that you   re  limited with.  18  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  So you still stay in shape then by doing a little dance every day?  Oh, no. I don   t do them. I like working out in the yard and doing  things   I stay active, that   s for sure. My body was starting to rebel.  After dancing barefoot for years on a cement tile floor, even though the  dance studio floor had a very nice floor, takes a toll on the bare feet after  awhile. So I started having heel spurs and problems like that that I had to  start changing my ways. (Laughs) Plus your bones don   t want to move  like they used to anyway.  Slow ball room dancing then. Well do you have a favorite memory of all  of your time here?  Well, the favorite memory is just working with students in dance. Giving  them the opportunity to explore something new and different. Like I  said, the modern dance was different for them.  I have to come back and ask one more question about the library. It was  new when you first came.  Beautiful.  A very new building. Do you have any particular stories about it besides  digging for the old history books?  I think third floor was the art area that had dance. There was a lady that  was very eager to get more dance books, so every time I would find  something that sounded interesting in the dance magazines, I would give  her a list of books and she would  get it . I   ve used those, that area of the  library quite frequently for the majors, expecting them to do some  research on different people and the history of dance and everything like  that. It was used quite a while during a certain period of time. Plus, the  fact that sometimes if you had absences you could make up work with  library work. I can   t remember now what the detail was exactly.  That   s interesting.  But I would have them come up to the third floor and do the dance  research and write a paper about that.  That   s good to hear that the librarian helped you keep the collection  going.  Yes it was. I really enjoyed the usage of the library. And I wish I  had  but  I did not write down all the names of people who were so helpful at  times. But she was very good. I can   t think of what would that area  19  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  Rollins Wade  Finchum  would have been called in the library at the time? I can   t remember what  section it was.  The social sciences and humanities. Maybe it   s humanities.  Maybe humanities was the section. Then they had a specific dance  number. I guess I should go look and see if they still have some of those  books. (Laughter)  They probably do. Well I   ve asked all of my questions. Is there anything  else that you   d like to say before we call it a day?  Well it was my life. But it was a good one. Then when you ask about if I  ever thought about changing jobs, I don   t know if this was typical of  everybody but I stayed and lived in the same apartment and rented from     56 which I   ve continued to pay for it at the same job. My brother, his  interest was chemical engineering and after he got his degree from Texas  A M and of course had to do an ROTC stint, he went into working with  Celanese in Bishop, Texas and he spent his 30 years or more, I can   t  remember exactly how many years, but he had only one job his whole  life too. Our parents were not educated. Neither one of them, I don   t  think, ever went to high school, but they did a beautiful job of giving us  the opportunity to do what we wished to do. They were very proud and  very happy that we were successful.  OSU was lucky to have you for 30 years it sounds like. Thank you for  sharing your story with us today.  Well, thank you and I   m glad that you   re interested in receiving some of  this information.  It   s great. I look forward to looking through all the pictures.  -------  -------
