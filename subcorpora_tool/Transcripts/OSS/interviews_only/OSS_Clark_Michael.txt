 Finchum Today is September 11, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, and along with  me is Madison Warlick. This is part of our Cowboy in Every County  project, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we are in Dewey,  Oklahoma, which is in Washington County, to visit with Mike Clark. Thank  you for having us today.  Clark Thank you.  Finchum Let   s begin with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Clark I was born March 8, 1986, in Stillwater, Oklahoma.  Finchum Oh, you   re our hometown boy  (Laughs) What did your parents do for a  living?  Clark My father was a pharmacist. He was a pharmacist at Central Drug Store in  Stillwater for twenty-five years. My mother worked for CEAT Support  Services at Oklahoma State in the engineering department.  Finchum Do you have brothers and sisters?  Clark I have one brother. His name is Tim Clark, and he is thirty-two. (Laughs)  He   s a little older, three years older.  Finchum Did you grow up in the town of Stillwater?  Clark I did. I grew up in Stillwater. We actually lived in Perkins  Oklahoma  for a  few years, until about first grade. I guess I was about six when we moved up  to Stillwater, and then from then on I grew up in Stillwater.  Finchum Which elementary school did you go to?  5  Clark I attended Skyline Elementary School, which is on the north end of  Stillwater, a little bit north and east, and went there   can   t think of the years  right now, but when I was young. (Laughter)  Finchum Did they have the middle school then, or did you go   ?  Clark They had middle school, yes. They had the middle school then. We would  go through fifth and sixth and seventh grades at middle school, and then we  went to the junior high over by Skyline for eighth and ninth.  Finchum Then back to the high school?  Clark Then back to Stillwater High School.  Finchum What year did you graduate from high school?  Clark I graduated high school in 2004.  Finchum A little over ten years ago. Did you have a favorite subject?  Clark Not particularly. I spent a lot of time in band. I spent a lot of time in the  band. When it came to subjects, not so much. (Laughs) They were all  school. None of them interested me or disinterested me any more than any  other. Most of the time, I was in the band.  Finchum What instrument did you play?  Clark I played trumpet. I played trumpet for a long time. (Laughs) I played  trumpet from, I guess when they started us playing trumpet, which would  have been middle school all the way through high school. I went through my  senior year.  Finchum Once you graduated from high school     Clark I went to OSU.  Finchum    you went to OSU.  Clark I went to Oklahoma State.  Finchum By choice?  Clark By choice. I actually wanted to. It was my only choice. Also I just barely  passed the ACT. I had to take the residual ACT at OSU, and that   s how I got  in. I do not believe today I could have got in. I think the ACT requirement is  higher than when I did. I went to OSU, and I did not live at home. My  6  parents were adamant that I should move into the dorms and have that  college life away from Mom and Dad. I moved into Kerr. I moved into Kerr  Hall on the eleventh floor and started my college career then. I think, at that  time, I was a graphic arts major my first semester, and I learned very quickly  that I cannot draw. I cannot draw to save my life. (Laughter) That began a  number of changes of majors. I think, in the end, by the time I actually  graduated, I think I had changed majors seven times. I graduated in 2009. It  took me five years.  Finchum What was your major finally?  Clark I graduated with a degree in history. I had the most credits in history. It was,     Do you want to graduate now, or do you want to graduate in another year  and a half?    (Laughs) I graduated with a degree in history.  Finchum What were you planning to do with that degree?  Clark Well, really, that story is a little longer. The reason I had more credits in  history is in 2006 my father passed away. I actually had an easier time with  the history courses, being able to read the book, study for an essay, and take  a test than, say, something like an engineering course where there would be  weekly mathematical things because there were some weeks when I really  couldn   t function. There were some weeks when I could. History became  one of those classes that I could take my time in, make a decent enough  grade, and graduate within five years or so. That is more why   I was  originally a journalism broadcasting major. I was told I had a voice for  radio. Some people said a face as well. (Laughter) I was in Structures and  Styles at the time when my father passed away, and it was the second time I  took that class. There was just no way I could keep up with that sort of  rigorous, ethical study that the journalism majors go through. I stepped back  to a slower pace.  Finchum Did you have some advice or good guidance at OSU to help you make that  decision?  Clark I did, in the end, actually get the degree. At the time, they just wanted to  make sure I made it through. I really wasn   t advised for or against any  particular major. They wanted me to find my way and say,    What are you  interested in?    At that time, I was interested in just getting a degree, which  is going to sound a little bad. (Laughs) It was important to my dad. It was  important to me, sticking in regardless of what my grades were. There was a  lot of discussion about,    Should I just drop out?    I stayed in college a lot to  stay with my friends and a lot just to complete it. What ended up happening,  like I said, is that I had more credits in history at that time. It was about  2007. They said,    You can focus and go this way, and you can graduate by  2009.    That was the path I eventually took.  7  Finchum Any plans to teach history in high school or anything like that?  Clark Not particularly. At the time, in 2008, I started driving school busses for  Stillwater Public Schools. I learned very quickly that I do not want to teach  children in any way, shape, or form. (Laughter) It was an experience. I have  a lot of respect for the teachers and for school bus drivers, and it was a  wonderful college job. As long as you could wake up early enough to work  three hours, then you got off, and you went to school with the kids. The kids  went to their school. I went to college, and then I got out of class, my last  class. Well, one forty-five, we   d go back to the bus barn about two, two  thirty, get on a bus, drive, and wait for the kids to get out at three thirty and  work for another three hours. It was very good money. It wasn   t like your  normal college job. It made quite a bit. I could afford to live on my own. I  could live with a roommate, and we could live comfortably instead of eating  ramen noodles every night. (Laughter)  Finchum Moved out of the dorm then, I take it.  Clark Yeah, I moved out of the dorm, and that was, I moved out of the dorm  shortly after Dad passed away. That would have been 2007. That would  have been the beginning of 2006, the academic year in 2006. That would  have been fall 2006 I moved out of the dorm.  Finchum When your dad was working at the drugstore, did you have a part-time job  there with him?  Clark No, I didn   t ever work with him there. I worked everywhere. I worked at the  Carmike Cinema for four years. I   ve worked at Lowe   s, across the street.  I   ve worked up and down Perkins Road. (Laughs) I worked at the GameStop  that was over there on the corner, and then eventually I worked at the bus  barn, which is also just right off that road. I have worked a number of jobs. I  worked at the Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimarron, New Mexico, over the  summers between 2007, 2008, and then after graduating from college, the  economy collapsed in 2008 and 2009. There was nothing for me.  There was nothing for any of my friends, but on a whim, there was a Disney  College Program seminar. I interviewed for the Disney College Program. I  was going to drive the Kilimanjaro Safari trucks because they   re busses. I  was driving busses. It was a pretty good fit. Then they said,    Hey, there   s an  audition for character performers in Oklahoma City. It   s at Ballet OKC. You  did plays back in high school. Would you want to do that?    during my  interview. I said,    Oh, it   s just down the street. Why not?    I interviewed.  They needed a tall, lanky guy, about six foot two. I went and worked for the  entertainment department at Disney World for about a year. About seven  8  months, I was at Walt Disney World in Florida performing as animated  characters.  Finchum Which one in particular?  Clark I   m going to have to redact that one. To protect the magic, I will not say  which characters. I was not any of them. I was friends with several of them,  but I did not portray any of Disney   s characters. (Laughter) I worked for the  entertainment department, and we had a lot of fun. I did a lot of wonderful  events. Met some really interesting people and had a very surreal job.  Getting to experience the parks that way behind the scenes is amazing, and  being able to get into the parks for free for seven months, you actually get to  enjoy them  (Laughs) There are still things I didn   t do. There are still things  down there at the Disney Parks I didn   t do simply because there was that  much. I was there for seven months, and I was also working.  I worked at the Contemporary Resort. I worked in the restaurant, Chef  Mickey   s. I worked in the France Pavilion at Epcot. I   m trying to think  where I did not work. I worked a lot of Epcot, I   ve got a lot of   I didn   t  work at Magic Kingdom all that often. There weren   t many places for a six  foot two person. I worked at the animation   what was that called? Disney  Hollywood Studios, which, they   re changing the name now, but I worked  there a lot since the Incredibles were in the animation building. That was  one of the places I worked, and I did a number of shifts there.  Animal Kingdom, I had a couple of shifts at. I really didn   t work there very  often, but I earned my stripes there because at the time it was one of the  outdoor locations. It was very hot, and I was new. I was the CP, and I was  scheduled there. I had a lot to earn my stripes and costume out in the heat,  and then I got cast in other locations, which would, eventually would   ve  been Chef Mickey   s and then from there at France (Epcot) with, Belle and  Beast were the ones over there.  Finchum Some fun mixed in with your work. (Laughs)  Clark Yes, it was a really interesting time and kept me away from worrying about  other things. (Laughter)  Finchum Were you with other people from Oklahoma?  Clark There were a few. There were a few. In the entertainment department, there  was another lady. She had graduated from OSU the year before, and then  there was a lady I really like. Her name is Stephanie Wyatt. She had  graduated with a hotel restaurant/business administration degree in 2007, I  want to say. She was actually the coordinator for that at that time. She was  working at the Grand Floridian and now is doing management somewhere.  9  (Laughs) I don   t really know where anymore. I should, but she is doing  management at the resorts there. That   s her career. That   s what she wanted  to do. That   s how she got into that. I have friends that still work there in  management. One   s in management of Frontier Land, and the other one is a  similar position at a resort.  Finchum Since we   re talking about Disney, did you have a favorite ride?  Clark A favorite ride  Ooh, depends on the time of year. (Laughs) In September,  there   s almost no one there. Basically after Labor Day everyone has to go to  work. The parks clear out almost entirely. One of my favorite things to do is  actually the Hall of Presidents. I have a history degree. I knew some of  them. I knew some of what they did, and at the time, it was very odd, as  Barack Obama was president. We had Robama. They had put in Robama.  He gave a speech. It was really cool to see the    automatronic.     People would cheer for Bush, or they would cheer for their favorite  president. After a few times of doing this, I would cheer for ones I knew  like,    Hey, James K. Polk  All right     No one would know who I was  talking about. (Laughter) I would cheer for ones that were a little more  historical. Tourists really had no clue until we got up to the current era. I got  a kick out of doing that. Californians would know Polk. He was president  during the Spanish American War, 1846-1848, which gave us Arizona,  Utah, Nevada, and that   s why we have forty-niners in California instead of  forty-eighters.  Finchum It would help, being a history major. (Laughter)  Clark We all had weird quirks at the parks when you   re working with so many  people so often. One of the things that I remember the most, my roommates,  Corey  Donnellen  and Michael Wenzel, we had all graduated college. We  all found ourselves in this apartment, as we all shared it. We had all already  graduated college. We all had gone for the same reason. We just didn   t  know what to do with ourselves. The girls across the way, we had a group of  them. They had all graduated college. Everyone in this area had done the  same thing. We all became friends. Corey and Emily eventually got married.  One of my favorite memories is that Corey and  Michael  Wenzel and I  were just at Epcot having a good time. We were going to ride a ride. It   s  called Mission Space. It   s a very space-themed one. It   s a centrifuge. Well,  this one lady, her granddaughter wanted to ride, but she really couldn   t.  They paired this little tiny girl with us. We decided,    We   re college-age  guys. We   re cast members. She doesn   t know it. We   re going to make this  as real as possible.    We went through the whole gamut, and we had the little  screen.  10  We   d salute to Gary Sinise, who was the guy that gave us the pre-show  intro. We got into our little cockpit that had all these buttons, that don   t do  anything, and we click them like we knew exactly what they were doing so  this girl would have a good time. Then the ride starts up, and she was, it   s a  centrifuge. It holds you against the seat. She wanted to hold my hand. I let  her hold my hand. I don   t know her name. I never did learn it. She had a  great time, and we helped her push the buttons, which is really hard to do in  a centrifuge because it   s spinning. I   m trying to reach over to hit her buttons  so that she can have a good time with it, too, and then she went off and ran.  Had to tell her grandma how much fun she had.  We just disappeared, never to be seen again. I really like that because she  had such a wonderful experience with complete strangers because she could,  and that was really neat. Well, we   re just three college, just out of college  guys. Who would trust us to do anything? Well, we all decided to do the  same thing at the same time without saying anything. We just knew we   re  going to make sure this girl had a fun time.  Finchum That   s pretty nice. (Laughter) She won   t get the same experience when she  goes back for the second time. (Laughter)  Clark Maybe, maybe not. Maybe she will. Maybe she   ll remember it. Who knows?  It was an interesting time.  Finchum Back to your time on campus when you were struggling with what to do, did  you have anything that you would do for fun while you were on campus?  Besides working and studying, what did you do for fun?  Clark (Laughs) I was a member of the sailing club. Jim Bruer was the commodore  at the time. That would have been, that was 2006, 2007, 2008. What a  wonderful idea that a whole bunch of Oklahomans in a landlocked state  were going to be in a sailing club.  Finchum I didn   t know we had one.  Clark Yep, there was, and then a number of them did regattas. They would race.  They would race in regattas in these old boats called FJs  Flying Juniors . I  was never a good regatta racer, but we would compete against KU, OU. We  would compete, and it was a really good time. We ended up having a spring  break trip to sail to the Bahamas. We rented a number of boats, two  catamarans, and a monohull, and a whole bunch of Okies decided that we  were going to go sail on the ocean, after sailing on lakes for all of our entire  life. (Laughs)  Jim Bruer was, though, he grew up in the New England area. Big waves,  ocean didn   t surprise him, and a number of our more talented sailors were.  11  On my boat, it was a catamaran. I   m trying to think of the name of it. I want  to say it was The Catalina. It was a forty-two-foot catamaran. It was Skipper  Bill, myself, Matt Catchy, Nicole Wiebert, at the time (I think she   s married  now), two other girls, and two other guys. There were about, I guess, eight  of us on that boat, and we were going to sail to the Bahamas. That trip, it  was a fun trip. Everything that would have been difficult, happened.  (Laughs) We got in a boat, and we got sailing.  Our boat was at Fort Lauderdale  Florida . Now the other boats were in  Miami. We had to sail down to Miami to meet them, and it was uneventful.  When we woke up in the morning, it was beautiful in the ocean, actually in  the bay, and we got ready to sail. We started out towards the Bahamas. The  wind was in a strange direction. It was actually from the northwest. It was  pushing us away from the Bahamas. It was actually pushing us more down  toward the  Florida  Keys. Well, our boat was a whole bunch of sailors. We  had Skipper Bill. He used to be a pilot. A boat pilot helps to navigate boats  and jetties. He did that. He was a very skilled sailor, and Matt Catchy and I,  well, we just needed something to do. We worked on the wenches, and we  were going to make it. We made it out into open water. We got into some,  we were making about fourteen nauts, which is not bad time, but we were  having to tack against the wind a lot to make our way up. Some of the others  were doing calculations saying that we would probably make it, constantly  tacking, about two in the morning. That   s not what anyone else on the trip  wanted to do. (Laughs)  Now our boat was, we were going for it. We were going to do it no matter  what. They ended up having to call us back by signaling radio because the  person that made the decision, their boat was several miles south of us. They  had to more or less leapfrog the signal to us because we were going to go.  We were the only ones making good time, and that was a little  disappointing. We turned around, and we decided instead of going to the  Bahamas, we   re going to go to the Keys. We   re going to follow the wind.  We   re going to have a good spring break in the Keys. That was a good  decision because, I mean, open ocean   s open ocean. I remember seeing oil  tankers because we were going up and down these waves. They were not  big. They were eight-foot waves, which sounds big, but for ocean people,  they   re not. We   d saw this oil tanker that just was massive, hitting the waves  as if it was nothing, and we have people getting seasick from just going up  and down.  We turned the boat around and started heading south toward Key Largo and  to the Florida Keys, and Skipper Bill gave me the helm. I had never sailed a  boat in my life. I mean, I   ve sailed a boat on the lake. I never sailed out in  the ocean. I   m sitting here just holding the heading. It   s not a big difference,  and I eventually saw a lake buoy ahead of me. I   m thinking,    Well, we   re in  the ocean. That   s a lake buoy. I should avoid that.    What I did not know is I  12  had missed a number of buoys to the side that were big, orange, and red,  which signify there   s a reef. The lake buoy   s on the top of it, the highest  point. We unfortunately skimmed the top of that reef. Skipper Bill very  quickly told me that I was not going to be on the helm anymore, a little  frustrated at my not noticing that we had passed these bigger orange   buoys . Fortunately, though, instead of really punishing me (I was a little  embarrassed that I hit the coral reef), he taught me how to pilot the boat. No,  I was never going to touch the helm again. However, once we got into open  water again, he taught me to read the chart and know our heading.  I told him I had earned my Eagle Scout, I knew how to use a compass. He  handed me a specific nautical compass that has, it   s got a dome, and it   s got  the compass in there. It   s got some poles to look at landmarks. For the rest  of the trip, I got to help him pilot the boat and choose the course. Then he  would have someone else or him (at that point it was him or Matt Catchy)  actually pilot, actually change the heading of the boat, which was really  interesting. I was happy he took that embarrassing    well, you ran into a  coral reef in the middle of the ocean    experience into something  constructive.  From that point, we anchored at, I think it was Key Largo that night, and our  anchor held for a while. We cooked up some food, and we were going to  take some of the food over to the boat. Our dingy died. We went off adrift. I  was with Skipper Bill in the dingy, and it took them a while to realize that  we were drifting away. We had no way of telling anyone. No one noticed  that we were starting to drift away and then finally, we had a flashlight. I  don   t remember. I don   t know whose boat it was. They finally figured out  that we were adrift. They got their dingy out, and I remember Jim being a  little upset because one boat was worried about their steak. Well, here   s two  other people just floating out in the dingy. (Laughter)  They retrieved us and brought us back to the boat, and in the middle of the  night, our anchor broke. Now when it breaks, it doesn   t break the chain. It  breaks the dirt. The anchor just started to slip. In the middle of the night, the  anchor broke its oaring. We got up, and we pulled the anchor up. We started  to circle, and that was a very surreal moment for me because it was an  overcast night. There was no star. There was no light. We were out pretty  much in the middle of the bay. Can   t see anything. Can   t see anything.  There   s no light at all. My job was to take this flashlight and to shine out to  make sure we don   t hit anything. I have never experienced it being so dark  the flashlight just goes away.  You   re just shining the light, and there   s nothing to reflect off of it. It   s very  scary, and it makes you feel really small to know that there   s just nothing  out there. We are a little island, a little boat with the light coming down, and  that is it. Everything else is black. When we finally got a place for the  13  anchor to hold, we went to bed. (Laughs) Woke up the next day. Decided to  go again. The next day, we were going to a nearby reef, the Molasses Reef.  We took these boats, and we went to the Molasses Reef. I had gotten a pair  of snorkel, fins, and goggles and such for my birthday that year to go take  on this trip, and we went out. We were looking at fish, and I learned very  quickly that there wasn   t a lot to see. We weren   t far enough into the reef  yet, but I was also learning very quickly that I   m not a good swimmer. At  least I was not as good a swimmer as I thought I was.  I   m used to swimming in pools. There are waves. I started getting tired.  Fortunately, my buddy, who was swimming with me, I was like,    Look, I  don   t know. I think we should head back because I   m getting real tired.  We   re a long way from the boat.    He kind of looked at me funny, but I said,     You know, I just don   t feel comfortable out here.    On the trip back to the  boat, I was just getting more and more tired. It was getting harder and harder  for me to swim, harder and harder for me to keep my head above water.  Fortunately, I mean, at that point, I was just more or less doing kind of the  dead man   s float to conserve energy and coming up and swimming some  against, doing whatever I could. I was very, very scared. (Laughs)  This trip doesn   t sound all that fun, but I was scared. I mean, I   m here in the  middle of a reef, Molasses Reef. I don   t know if I   m going to drown. I   m  getting really tired. We make it close enough to where someone threw a  lifejacket I could put underneath me, and then I got on the boat. People were  very concerned like,    Are you okay?    I didn   t look like someone that would  have gotten that tired, and I got some water. We noticed that Orville   s boat,  that the monohull was getting smaller and that it had a big, yellow, frayed  thing at the end of it, which was, it used to be his anchor. (Laughs) His boat  had broke its anchor rope and was adrift. Fortunately, everyone was so  scared about me being, almost drowning, we were on a boat. We got  everyone on the boat. We go in and chase down this other boat, and Jim (he  was the commodore), his friend, Nate, they finally got the dingy close  enough to it. He jumped onto the dingy of the other boat, got it under  control, and then we decided that we   d enough fun for that day. We should  go down to the next key, which would be Marathon.  Marathon Key was wonderful. It   s a very beautiful key. It   s about eight  miles long, but it   s only about two football fields wide. We actually docked  at a marina. (Laughs) We decided that we weren   t going to dock out in the  shallow bay, and we had a wonderful time there. There was a number of  local places to eat. We were on dry land. We went to a Publix, which is a  nice, it   s a nice grocery store down in Florida, and got some nice cheese,  and for once, nothing wrong happened. (Laughs) We went and swam at the  beach nearby.  14  There was this wonderful gentleman that they made their, him and his son  made their livelihood fishing. They would fish for tuna, mahi-mahi, that sort  of more exotic fish, and that   s how they would pay their marina fees. They  had befriended a manatee near their boat. I guess manatees, you   re not  supposed to, but they enjoy you with freshwater being sprayed on them.  There   s signs saying not to, but I guess they were ignoring, or this one, they  had done to the point where it was accustomed to it. It was neat to see a wild  manatee up close.  There were porpoises that had swam through the marina at one point as well.  I was kind of sad when we left Marathon Key. It was wonderful. I had just  turned twenty-one a couple weeks beforehand. I had my first mojito. It was  key limes, and it was wonderful. A lot of really good memories there. When  we decided to start heading back, we had to sail back from Marathon Key  back up to Miami. In the process of doing that, we ended up getting a lobster  pot caught in our prop. It was a line that wasn   t buoyed. It would have  happened to anyone, but it ended up burning out one of the engines, though.  We had a wonderful lobster to eat. I mean, at this point, the engine   s broken.  We finally get under the boat and realize what the problem was. Clearing  out the rope, and we have this pot that had nine Florida lobsters. We decided  that we would be poachers. (Laughs) We took three, and we put the other six  back in the pot. (Laughter) They were amazing, and they tasted wonderful. I  mean, absolutely the freshest you could possibly get, and we figured that the  pot had torn up our engine. We could at least take a couple lobsters out and  cook them.  Now we were sailing most of the time, but we had one engine to work with.  Well, throughout the way back, we realized the next day that there was a  squall building, and we were at Key Largo again. We were going to sail up  to Miami and then hopefully drop the boats off there, and the storm was  building the entire time we got to Miami. We got to Miami, and we found  out that of course, of all people, our particular charter boat wanted us to sail  the boat back to Fort Lauderdale because they had another group that would  be waiting pretty much as soon as we docked it to get on it and go on  another trip. We told him,    You know the engine   s broken, right?    (Laughs)  They said,    That   s not a problem.    They   d fix that.  We got to Miami, and they wouldn   t, there was a storm growing. There was  a storm by that point, and they said,    No, you need to sail the boat back.     We got on the boat, and the people that had, the people on the trip that had  actually gotten their boat at Miami, they were going home. It was just our  boat at this point, just about eight of us, and we got in the boat. We started  sailing through that storm. We went through a jetty, and I found out that  cruise boats are immense next to a forty-two-foot catamaran and a cruise  boat is giant. (Laughs) We got sailing in that storm, and we didn   t, we had  15  one engine. We had to sail it. We couldn   t just drop the sail. We had to be  careful with how we did it. Fortunately, Skipper Bill knew everything there  was to know about sailing a boat in a storm, but for the most people, they  were terrified.  It basically boiled down to Matt Catchy and I just wanting something to do.  We couldn   t just sit there. If we just sat there, we would be worried, scared  and like all the other girls and a couple guys who were below deck. I would  go down to the chart and make sure we weren   t going to hit anything  because there were some shipwrecks and there were some things that we  could hit. I made sure that we weren   t going to hit those on our tacks against  the wind into the storm, and then we would just sit next to the wench. We  were sailing, and the wind would be blowing the water in our eyes. It was  sharp, and we finally worked our way for a couple of hours through this  storm up to Fort Lauderdale where we could get into the jay and we could  drop the main sail and then use our one engine to get into the marina, and it  was a wonderful feeling. In hindsight, I wish we had worn life jackets.  (Laughter)  We jumped up on the main sail, and we just pulled, Matt Catchy, we just  pulled it down. We pulled it down, and we were on a high. We   d just sailed  through a storm. (Laughter) I   m sure our mothers would be proud of us  sitting up there on the edge of this boat and just going back and forth. If  we   d fallen off, who knows what would have happened? (Laughs) It was a  good time. We got that boat back to the marina, and sure enough, they got  that thing ready for someone else to go on it, which was fortunate because  there was some damage that we did to it. Because they wanted to flip it so  quickly, they couldn   t prove who did it. (Laughs) This was not really any  proof that I hit a reef that may or may not have offset the engine that then  got pulled off by a prop later. (Laughter) That was an adventure with the  Oklahoma State Sailing Club, and there were several.  We had a gentleman named Orville who was our community member. He  had a nice thirty-foot catch that had a concrete bottom. We all learned how  to sail a larger boat on Lake Carl Blackwell, which was interesting. That  boat was called the Swan Maiden. It has a concrete keel. It was built in the  Bering Sea. It   s designed for really heavy weather. It seems a little overkill  for Lake Carl Blackwell, but it was a fishing lake. They had just filled it up.  They hadn   t knocked over any trees. One of the exciting things when you   re  sailing Lake Carl Blackwell is when the boat starts to rise up and you hear a  crack and it starts to fall back down because you hit a tree with a concrete  keel that has now cracked that rotting tree which is where they   re fish and  all kinds of things and just knock it over. (Laughs)  16  There were a lot of really interesting people in the Oklahoma Sailing Club. I  believe Jack Hodgson, at one time, he was the OSU liaison with the faculty.  I don   t know if he still is or not.  Finchum I didn   t even know we had one. I don   t know. (Laughter) That was your fun.  (Laughter)  Clark That was an adventure, to say the least. (Laughs)  Finchum Were you a member of any other organization, activity type clubs besides  that one?  Clark Not particularly. I didn   t do any of the fraternities. I didn   t do any of the  service organizations. For the most part, it was just the sailing club.  Finchum Attend football games or basketball games?  Clark Oh yeah, oh yeah. We always went to the football games, and if we could,  we used to camp out for tickets for the basketball games. I   m trying to  remember. I believe I was still in college. Yes, Eddie Sutton was still a  coach for a year or two while I was in college. Then it was his son. He was a  really   always enjoyed the basketball. It was always hard to get basketball  tickets when Eddie Sutton was coach. You almost couldn   t get them.  Finchum That   s about the time they were raising the roof? No, that was before when  they raised the roof.  Clark Yeah, that was before when they raised the roof. They were building Boone  Pickens Stadium. I remember the year before, it was still Lewis Field, and  then my senior year they started building it. Then it was just enough open  for people to watch games. It was still very much under construction when I  was in college, and they finally finished it my senior year, my first senior  year, I guess, 2008.  Finchum You were in the band in high school, but you weren   t in the band at OSU?  Clark No, no, I did not do band at OSU. Didn   t think I would have time, and it was  sort of a high school thing. I didn   t want to pursue it in college.  Finchum Well, if you were in plays and such in high school, did you carry that over?  Clark Yes. I did Little Shop of Horrors. I was the voice of the plant in 2004 in high  school. I didn   t do anything with theatre for a long time, and then when I  came back from Disney World, which would have been January 2010, I sat  around home and drove school busses. Then there was an ad in the paper for  Town   Gown   s saying they were doing Little Shop of Horrors, and, well,  17  I   d been the plant. I didn   t have anything to lose. I figured,    No one knows  that part as good as me. I can go and audition and do it again. It   s no big  deal.    I went to auditions, and I remember (my wife would say it differently)  during my audition I felt like everyone clapped for everybody when they  said their part because we were waiting on the pianist to come play. When I  said my part, I don   t remember hearing any clapping. I was a little upset  about that. I was like,    Well, this is a cliquish place.    They really weren   t.  Ashley says that they clapped for everybody because she would have been  the outside observer. (Laughs)  When it came time to sing my song, I was singing a song of a villain from  Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. It was written by Joss Whedon. I decided I  would just do that in character and be a jerk because they   d been a jerk to  me. Then I was just going to blow this whole thing off, because I didn   t  know any better. I was just maybe a little upset and probably a little hungry.  (Laughter) I sang my part. I sang it well. I acted more of the part of the  villain and then more or less left.  I got a call from Kevin Worley, the director, about a couple days later. He  said,    You can have the part of the plant, but I liked your audition. Would  you want to be the dentist?    He wanted a jerk  I just happened to have acted  like a jerk. (Laughs) I said,    Sure, I could do the dentist.    It   s a part I hadn   t  played before. Then I went into rehearsals with Town   Gown Theatre to do  Little Shop of Horrors. I met a lady named Ashley Hodges, and she and I hit  it off. We eventually got married. (Laughs)  It was a very fun show. There were a lot of good times. I met a lot of really  interesting people and then got involved with Town   Gown. Ashley was  big into some of the theatre. She was much more into theatre. She had  actually graduated from Oklahoma State in   2007 (she might get onto me  for that) with a degree in theatre. Then she was auditioning, and she was  working for Home Health agency at the time. We got along pretty well.  (Laughs) Yeah, we did a number of shows there. We did Little Shop of  Horrors followed by Rumors, which is a Neil Simon show which she  played. Yeah, she played my wife, and that was all kinds of fun. I think  that   s when I met Bonnie  Cain-Wood . I think it was Rumors when I met  Bonnie, and then we did Clue. My wife directed Clue, and I worked  backstage on a number of shows. She did All My Sons. I think I built half the  sets that year. (Laughs) We were really involved for a while.  Finchum So you can sing.  Clark Yes, I can sing. I can sing. (Laughter)  Finchum We would ask you to give us a sample, but I don   t know what you would  choose.  18  Clark Whoo  Something with a bass or baritone part. (Laughs)  Finchum Do you know the alma mater?  Clark I do know the alma mater  (Laughs) Do you want me to   ?  Finchum Sure, if you   re willing. We would love it   Clark Maybe I don   t know the alma mater. I know how it goes. (Laughs)  Finchum Loyal and true   .  Clark I remember    loyal and true.    That   s the end of it, though.  Finchum Yeah. Do you know it?  Clark Uh-oh  Does Madison? No? (Laughter)  Finchum I watch the words     Clark    when you see them on the Jumbo Tron. (Laughter) I know all the words  when I   m watching it on the Jumbo Tron. I don   t know how it begins. I  know the middle of it.  Finchum    Herald  your fame     or something like that, too, isn   t it?  Clark That   s the second line. That   s the second part. Oh wow  None of us can  remember. We should be better Cowboys fans than that. (Laughs)   Proud and immortal  Bright Shines Your Name  Oklahoma State  We Herald Your Fame  Ever You'll Find Us  Loyal and True  To Our Alma Mater  O - S     U   Finchum Maybe it   ll come to you before you finish up. (Laughs) What year did you  and Ashley get married?  Clark We got married this year in July. We got married July 3, 2015, about two  months ago.  Finchum How did you end up in Dewey?  19  Clark How did we end up in Dewey? That   s a long story. (Laughs) Well, first we  were in Stillwater. We met. I got a position with the Boy Scouts and Last  Frontier Council as a district executive in Oklahoma City. We moved to  Edmond  Oklahoma  to work for the Boy Scouts. In that time, Ashley  decided that she enjoyed her job as a dental assistant at Dr. Kendrick   s. She  learned a lot from Dr. Kendrick, and she decided that she wanted to take that  next step to go from assistant to dental hygienist. She applied to the (I don   t  know if we can say it here) OU dental hygiene program and got accepted but  accepted to a distance site in Bartlesville. We packed up, and we moved to  Bartlesville. That   s how we ended up here, and we stayed here for the past  two years or so.  Finchum I think Bonnie or someone had said you worked at Pawnee Bill   s for a  while.  Clark Yep, I worked at Pawnee Bill Ranch. I was a blacksmith. At Philmont Scout  Ranch, I had learned how to blacksmith. Philmont is the world   s largest  youth camp. It is owned by the Boy Scouts. It   s in Cimarron, New Mexico.  It is two hundred and fifty-six thousand square acres of land, and it   s a  wonderful place. I worked at the Kit Carson Museum, which is the farthest  south camp. The Rayado is the name of it, and we did historical  interpretation.  I had met with a gentleman named Doug Palmer in Stillwater who did  blacksmithing so I would know something ahead of time, and I went down  there. I had three months to put coal on a fire, stick metal in it, and start  hitting it until it made a shape. After a couple of days or months of doing  that, you can make some really nice things. I wouldn   t say I was ever very  skilled at it. I could make knick-knacky items. I could make a rose out of  steel. I could make some door handle pulls. I could make some shuckers, but  I could not make anything really useful. (Laughs) I couldn   t make a tool to  save my life. I could make all these other pretty things.  However, in a historical education setting, you don   t have to make  interesting things. You have to teach somebody what blacksmithing was  like. I learned how to teach kids how to make s-hooks or at least hammer the  metals safely around it so they could get a feel for what blacksmithing is. I  did that for two years in New Mexico, and then in 2011 there was a position  at Pawnee Bill Ranch. They wanted someone to lead tours, but they also did  these other things. I just nonchalantly said,    Well, I can blacksmith, and you  have a forge. You have a farrier forge over here to the side. I   d be more than  happy to teach classes or to teach       school groups is mostly what goes  through Pawnee Bill Ranch       I   d be more than happy to demonstrate  blacksmithing to some of these school groups.    I did that for about a year.  20  I would give tours of the mansion, and then on Saturdays, I would work in  the forge. Anyone that came by, I would teach them a little bit about,  mostly, at that time period (it was 1900), it   s wagon making and  horseshoeing. Not a lot of blacksmithing at that point. That   s much farther  than the Pawnee Bill Ranch time. I would talk more about farriering,  whereas at Philmont, we were working at 1851. We were going to make  everything. I had to teach kids how to make nails because nails are  incredibly important and easy to make and easy to show kids how to make. I  did that for about a year. Worked for their wild west show, and it was an  interesting time.  They have some very, very dedicated people that work at the Pawnee Bill  Ranch that love what they do and can   t imagine them anywhere else. A  gentleman named Kevin Webb, who portrays Pawnee Bill, he is very skilled  at whip tricks. There   s a lady named Anna Davis there that works at the  Pawnee Bill Ranch as one of the historical advisers. I   m not sure what her  actual title is. She   s not a docent. She   s more in charge of the collection and  more in charge of the operation, but she   s not a curator, either. She   s  somewhere in between, and she is incredibly knowledgeable about  preserving artifacts. Right now, they are incredibly worried about the  number of earthquakes that are shaking the house. (Laughs) They   re  wondering what they can do about it since the house is an antique, and it   s a  national, it was built in 1908. It   s shaking.  Finchum Was a good fit for a history major.  Clark It was a good fit for a history major that didn   t want to teach. (Laughter)  Honestly, I like to joke that my history degree was useful but my  blacksmithing got me in the door, than to use my history degree. (Laughs)  You had to be interesting. You couldn   t just have the degree. You had to be  a little bit more interesting than everyone else that had the degree, too.  (Laughs)  Finchum Well, after there, what did you do?  Clark After that, that   s when I went to work with the Boy Scouts. While we were  there, I see you have a note. There   s a gentleman in Stillwater named Eldon  Waugh. We had met him at a Payne County fair. He is a wonderful man.  You should actually interview him, too. Now that I think about it, he would  be a wonderful   .  Finchum His last name was...?  Clark Waugh. I can give you his contact information. He   s a beekeeper, and he  sells honey at the Payne County Fair. He   s been doing it now for forty-seven  years. At the time, he   d only been doing it for forty-two, and for whatever  21  reason, he was just really nice and talkative to us. I had never really talked  to him in person before that point, and he told me that when there   s a swarm  of bees (he had some pictures), you cut off the branch. You put a towel in  front of a beehive, and you shake the bees off that branch. They all march  into the hive. It sounds ludicrous. It doesn   t make any sense at all that bees  would do that. That stuck with me. I really couldn   t answer why. I started  looking at books like,    Somewhere in here   s got to be if this is true or not.    I  went looking online. I couldn   t find anything that specifically stated that. I  went and read books and learned more about bees, and I found them to be  very funny and very interesting.  I knew, at that time, that there was a gentleman that lived next to our house  near Skyline that had all these bee boxes in his backyard, and I figured,     Well, we   ll just go and knock on his door.    I didn   t know if he would be  home, and I knocked on his door. It happened to be Eldon. I did not know, at  that time, he lived a block from me. We talked to Eldon for a while, and he  told us, his eyes, he has macular degeneration. He really can   t see as well,  and he could use some help with the bees. I said,    Well, it   s November. If  you still need help in March, I drive school busses. I   m free during the day.  Just give me a call.     Well, sure enough, in about February or right before March, he called me  and asked if I wanted to go help him with his bees, and I said,    Well, sure.  That   s no problem.    He let me borrow a mask, and we drove to Coyle   Oklahoma  and saw some of his bees there. We drove to Stillwater and saw  some of his bees. We drove to Jim Mote   s farm, which is just north of the  junior high. It   s on Jardot  Road . We went and checked his bees there, and  it was interesting. It was a weird feeling getting in front of a box of bees.  You open it up, and there   s hundreds of bees around you. You   re just  thinking,    What the heck am I doing? (Laughs) This is not natural,    but I  didn   t get stung. We weren   t wearing gloves. We just stick our hands in  there. I would learn later why. I thought that was interesting. I wasn   t  scared.  I got a call about two weeks later and Elden said,    We   ve had a swarm.  Would you mind helping me with it?    I said,    Okay.    We drove back to Jim  Mote   s farm, and sure enough, here   s a swarm no taller than this table is. He  told me that in the cool months of spring the swarms will be lower to the  ground, and as it gets hotter, they   ll move higher up in trees. Once again,  that   s more anecdotal knowledge. I never found it written in a book, but I  have seen it with Eldon. Sure enough, we got a box. He put some frames of  comb in there. He put a bedsheet and stapled it to the front. Pulled out the  sheet. Cut the branch. Shook it real hard. I   ll be damned every one of those  bees walked in that box. I watched it. (Laughs) I could not prove him wrong,  and it   s funny when you try to prove someone that   s doing this for forty-two  years wrong. It doesn   t really work. I just helped him for the next few  22  months, and I ordered a box online. It came to my house, and the day it  came to my house, I had checked to make sure all of my stuff was there.  Eldon called and said,    I have a swarm. Do you want it?     I said,    Well, I just got my box in the mail. Yes, I do.    That swarm had been  caught near Couch Park. In fact, the little tree that dips down over the road,  it was right there. Eldon had brought this box of bees that he had captured  the swarm and proceeded to take each frame and just shake it and knock  every bee off just really hard, and they fell in the box. They flew in the air,  and we put them in one box to another box. Then I had bees in my backyard.  From that point on, we had bees in our backyard for about a year.  I started with a hive and let it build, and then the next spring   the reason  they didn   t sting me from earlier is they didn   t have any honey to defend.  There didn   t have nothing in the box. Most of the bees were out trying to  find anything. It was still too early to find anything. There was just nothing  for them to really defend. They   re awfully nice. They   re awfully quiet in the  spring because they   re busy doing other things.  We went from two hives, and then one of my days, I had taken a couple of  kids from another school because the bus broke down. I   d driven out to take  them home near the Harley Davidson dealership on Thirty-Second Street,  and I saw some people out there. There   s actually a florist out there. I saw  them working, and I had gotten rid of all my kids. I stopped the bus in the  middle of a dirt road. Walked out of it and met up with Vicky and Terry  Standbeck. Said,    Hey, I   m a beekeeper. Would you mind if I brought my  bees here?    Didn   t know them. Never had met them, and they said,    Sure.  We   d be more than happy to.     We waited until a good day. I had confined the bees, and we moved them  out to Bear Creek   s Florist. They   ve been there for the past three years. It   s a  wonderful location to have bees. It   s a commercial florist. That   s their  livelihood. The bees, if it   s a hundred thousand degrees outside and there   s  not been rain for the past three months, well, there   s still flowers because  that   s their livelihood. (Laughs) They   re very, very spoiled bees just to put it  in the easiest terms. (Laughter) They have no need to worry about flowers,  no need to worry about water, and they   re in a nice, shaded, tree line. The  trees block the wind from our storms from either direction, from north or  south, and they   re in the shade half the day. They   re incredibly spoiled bees.  (Laughter)  That same year (that was 2012 when we finally got them out there), we got  our first honey harvest. It was a very, water white would be the correct term,  water white, thin honey. It was made from, the vast majority of it was the  purple hairy vetch that grows on the side of the road. There   s about a mile,  or so, of road between Thirty-Second Street and Fourteenth Street. Bees will  23  fly in a mile and a half in any direction to make honey. They   ll fly three  miles to find food. They cut that in half. That   s where they   ll actually make  enough food to also produce honey with. You draw a circle from Thirty-  Second Street to Fourteenth Street and then just go around. That   s their  entire range. It   s very large.  That year, there was just a lot of hairy vetch, and we had already missed one  of the blooms of crimson clover that the florist grows as a filler. It   s actually  a weed, but they grow it as a filler. We had missed that bloom. It was all  very, very, very thin, almost white color thin, and it had a cinnamon taste to  it. That was our first year of honey. We sold it in little pint jars and half-pint  jars. The next year, we would get a little bit more serious about it. I bought a  ledger book, and we went and ordered   well, didn   t order. There   s a place  called Beekeeping Etc. in Oklahoma City. They sell plastic jars. We went  from glass to plastic, which was a much better option. It was lighter, and  they didn   t break as often if you drop them.  That year (that was 2013), we actually had a large honey harvest. Well, large  for us. We had never had that much. We had about, oh, two and a half  gallons, somewhere around thirty pounds, which we then bottled up most of  it, and then we sold some to a lady that makes jams and jellies at the  Stillwater Farmer   s Market. Her name is Susan Webber. She does sand plum  jelly, and she also does a lemon honey jelly, which is honey from our bees.  That year, I also entered the Payne County Fair. Our honey won first place  in the Payne County Fair. It was very fun. I have that blue ribbon  somewhere. Then the next year, we actually hit that crimson clover harvest,  and our honey, it was very dark. Same location. Nothing changed. It was  just very dark from the crimson clover and any other flowers that it could  get. That year, which would have been 2014, yeah, we entered Oklahoma  City Fair, and we won first place in the Oklahoma City Fair. Now that is,  sounds impressive, but there was only one other entrant. (Laughs) It was  going to win first or second either way.  This year, we are entering the Tulsa Fair. We are entering all three. We got  second place in the Payne County Fair, which is my fault. I could have  checked the mason jar lid a little better to make sure it wasn   t dented. It   s all  based on appearance. It has nothing to do with how the honey tastes. It has  to do with what it looks like, and if your rim is not perfect and someone  else   s is, well, then there   s a point. That   s probably why I got second. That   s  what I can think because there were several pretty noticeable dents in my  ring. I should have been a little bit more choosy, but we also are entering  three different fairs this year.  For Tulsa, Tulsa actually had a more sophisticated, a little bit more  professional honey competition. We had to buy Queenline jars, and that   s a  completely different jar that   s specifically for honey. What I really want is a  24  rosette. That ribbon is nice, a blue ribbon, but a rosette has a button and  ruffles. It   s purple and white or sometimes blue, and no fair I   ve entered had  rosettes for honey. Tulsa does. That   s why I   m entering. I want the rosette.  (Laughter)  Finchum Do you harvest the comb, too, or just the honey?  Clark We did once. We did the comb once. We generally leave the comb on for  the bees. It takes a large investment in the bees to produce wax from     honey is a carbohydrate. It   s a sugar, and then pollen is a protein. When they  eat these, they excrete wax, and it takes a lot of that honey to make. You  basically have a choice. You either spend your season making wax with  your bees, or you spend your season making bees or honey. You really can   t  have all three.  Instead of cutting the comb to make comb honey, I like to keep that  investment in wax so that the next season they have it to, they   ll brood on,  fill with honey, and then when we spin it out, we can put it right back on the  hive. Whereas if I cut it out to make comb honey, they would have to start  from scratch. Granted, that location is good enough they could probably be  fine, but I have just, we haven   t cut comb honey again. It   s fun. It   s really  interesting, and I might again. I just haven   t done it in a while.  Finchum Do you wear the full getup?  Clark I don   t wear the full getup all of the time. Most of the time I just wear a  jacket that has gloves and a veil. I have the full getup for when I do  removals from houses. Back in 2012, we got a call from a News Channel  Four anchor named Chellie Mills, and she had bees in her wall, the dividing  wall outside of her house. I think it was Kathryn Weinland. Somebody knew  her personally and said,    Well, I know a beekeeper.    We went out there, and  we chiseled open that wall and removed the bees.  I have a full getup for doing bee removals, which are always really  entertaining just to see the natural comb and how bees have found a gap  that   s no bigger than a couple of, six inches. They made a hive in there. It   s  always really neat to see how they did it, but of course we   ve got to go tear  them out. We use a vacuum that has a special hole in it, more or less, that  controls the suction. We can suck up the bees without killing them, and  that   s how we remove the bees from walls and from combs. We just suck  them all up and put them in a bag. The way the vacuum works is we suck  them up. Then when we   re ready to shake them down, we just pushes all the  bees down. We take the lid off and put another lid on and take them home.  Put them in the back of my car, and we drove back to Stillwater from  Midwest City  Oklahoma . (Laughs)  25  Finchum Well, in the news lately, they   ve been saying the bee population is going way  down.  Clark A lot of the bees are owned by commercial beekeepers. When they say the  bee population is down, about 98 percent of all colonies of bees are owned  by commercial beekeepers. They did see a large number of drops, but a  large number of drops are also based on mostly a number of   they like to  say Colony Collapse Disorder. Well, what is Colony Collapse Disorder?  Really is a number of some interesting things that happen. When you keep  bees by the thousands, I mean, if you   re talking ten thousand colonies, that   s  several million bees. If there   s a parasite, you treat the entire lot. You don   t  really treat the one, and quite honestly, statistically, you probably would  have it in a large diffusion of all the hives. It makes sense to treat that way,  but that   s not necessarily the best option.  Also just the active migratory beekeeping, which you   re limiting what the  bees can eat based on what crop is available. If you think of almonds in  California, there are miles of almonds. In fact, there   s enough miles of  almonds that you can put a hive, and the only thing in that three-mile circle  is almonds. If all you ate was broccoli, it   s not going to do you any good,  either. Then from there, they   re getting all put on a truck after about three  weeks, and then they get shipped to the next one, which I think is  blueberries. Then they get shipped down to Florida for oranges.  The act of beekeeping is not natural at all. If you find someone saying they  have all-natural, organic beekeeping, the straight-up act of manipulating  frames of honey is not natural or organic. (Laughs) A natural organic honey  would mean they found a tree and cut it out of there, and you might get that  from   there are some places where you can get that. I know Kenya has a  number of that. They have honey hunters there.  Finchum Well, you said your first batch tasted a little bit like cinnamon?  Clark It did. It had a cinnamon aftertaste. The second batch had a wintergreen  aftertaste to it. It was much darker, and it   s just from the available nectar  sources. This year   s is a lot lighter. We found out from Susan Webber that  where our bees are, there   s the commercial florist, but I guess about a  quarter mile southwest there   s a farmer with a large clover field. We didn   t  know this. They talked to him and he said,    Well, there   s thousands of bees  in my field. I   ve never seen so many,    and it   s because of the rain. There  was more rain. The nectar content of the clover is higher, and the bees have  been over there. Our honey actually went from being very dark back to an  amber color. It has a different taste, and it has had a different taste every  year, slight changes. Now there   s still the straight, normal honey taste, but  just slight variations based on what   s available.  26  Finchum It sounds like you   re a perpetual learner, even though it   s not college, not at  college.  Clark (Laughs) Jack of all trades, master of none. I couldn   t call myself a master  of anything.  Finchum You   re just curious, and you go out and figure it out and learn.  Clark There   s a quote from Albert Einstein. To paraphrase it, it says,    I   m not  particularly special. I   m just eternally curious.     Finchum That   s very interesting, I think. (Laughter) Well, how often do you get back  to Stillwater?  Clark Well, currently, I am   I   ve been in Stillwater quite often. (Laughs) I   ve  actually got season tickets to football games. (Laughs) They   re pretty much  every weekend now. We get back to Stillwater pretty often. My mother still  lives there. I   ve got a number of friends there because we were, we grew up  there. We get back to Stillwater at least once a month, I would say.  Finchum Do you attend Homecoming and Walkaround and all those festivities?  Clark Oh yeah. We go to those when we can. I don   t think we went last year, but I  know we go as many times as we can.  Finchum Do you recall your graduation day?  Clark I do. It was in May of 2009, and it was overcast and rainy. (Laughs) I do  remember that, though. I remember that there was a big hubbub, because  two years prior the president came. I think that was, what, 2007. I think  Bush came in 2007. Then they decided they weren   t going to have a speaker  in 2008, and then that didn   t go over very well. In 2009, they had someone  speak. I don   t remember who it was, but they weren   t very interesting.  (Laughter) We were all still upset that they had the president two years  before, and we got whoever this guy was. (Laughter)  Finchum Was it in the stadium, or was it in the arena?  Clark It was in Gallagher-Iba, yeah. It was in Gallagher-Iba. I think most of the  graduations are in Gallagher-Iba anymore. I was in Arts and Sciences. I  think I was in the morning, I was the morning graduation of Arts and  Sciences College. There was one in the afternoon as well. That   s when they  started splitting them up.  Finchum Do you have any advice for current students?  27  Clark Advice for current students  I might have to think about that for a little bit.  The advice I give most people is that everyone wonders,    How did you wind  up in New Mexico? How did you wind up in Florida?    Of all of the most  interesting things isn   t how I ended up here at the funeral home. I worked  there. I didn   t go on a trip. I worked for these places. If I wanted to know  what it was like to be a funeral director, I worked here for two years. I  worked as an apprentice. I mean, I   m taking classes at UCO now to get my  license. The most important thing is that everything looks good on paper. No  one   s ever going to tell you the bad side of things, even if they   re very  closely trusted. The only way you   re going to learn whether you like  something or not is to go do it.  I mean, I read books on beekeeping. I spent more money on books on  beekeeping than I want to admit. I didn   t really learn anything useful until I  was doing it. Now I had all that knowledge from the books. I knew enough  about what was going on, but I did not learn that bees are very much like  people. If it   s hot and humid, they   re going to be just as upset as you are,  and if it   s nice and cool, then they   ll be a little more quiet. Bees have  different buzzes for things. That   s not in any book. You can tell if they   re  upset. You can hear it. It goes    buzz    real loud. That bee is not too happy.  Sometimes they don   t make any noise at all. We had a hive that was almost  entirely silent. They made a little soft buzz, but you didn   t hear much at all.  I learned a lot of things by doing it.    Why would you go do sailing?       Well,  there   s a sailing club. Let   s go find out. Let   s go do it.    I would never  discount an opportunity if you have it. I   m rambling now. I should have  thought of some better advice.  Finchum Oh, that   s okay. We need to back up, too, though, and have you tell us how  you came to be   .  Clark Oh, here? How did we get here to the funeral home?  Finchum Yes.  Clark That is another long story. My father passed away in 2006. It was February  15, 2006. I was nineteen. He died of acute cardiac death syndrome. In the  middle of the night, his heart stopped. He was fifty-one. It devastated our  family. We went through the funeral process, and I remember a lot of it, and  I don   t remember a lot of it. There   s a lot of things that I wish I had  remembered better. I do remember needing a job to do. That   s common. I  remember being very upset at people. I remember being not exactly the  nicest guy to be around, and I   ve learned. Part of the reason, what brought  me here is that a couple of my friends    fathers passed away within the next  couple years as well, and I wished I could have done something to help  them.  28  A lot of the time spent at OSU was handling my grief. I did that a number of  different ways, and a lot of what I   ve just described could be considered  avoidance, doing anything possible to not think about this over here. My dad  died in 2006, and I started in the sailing club within about four months,  anything to avoid it, push it over there and deal with it at another time. That  only works for so long. (Laughter) Then you   re faced with the realization  that someone is gone.  I was interested, and there was a number of times that I took different  classes, and most of the time I said I took these classes so I would have time  to think. When I got back from Disney World and I met Ashley, Ashley   s  grandparents had just passed away. We had something a little bit in common  and a little bit different than just,    Oh, well, we both like theatre,    and we  talked about things we missed and how you feel when you lose somebody.  A lot of times, especially in this industry, people wonder,    Well, am I going  crazy?    I   ve heard a lot of people say that, and it   s not really. When you   re  handling grief, nothing is crazy, absolutely nothing.  Being angry at people is not crazy when they have no idea. Binge eating,  people do all sorts of things to handle grief. When we moved up to  Bartlesville, I was actually driving school busses for a while, and I had  gotten sick. I had gotten a wire crossed, and I had started to have anxiety  driving busses. I couldn   t do it. I would get on a bus, and I would make it  about half a mile when I   d start breaking out in a sweat. By the time we  made it to a mile, I was almost passing out. That   s not safe on a school bus,  no. I ended up losing that job and sitting around the house for a while not  doing anything, being pretty worthless, and then, well, I have a CDL.  I went to the funeral homes because I could drive any passenger vehicle,  which, at that time, I thought limousines.    I can drive your limousine  legally.    I didn   t realize that limousines are too small to matter. You don   t  need a CDL to drive them. (Laughs) I went to this one. I went to that one.  They all were varying levels of interested at all. Most of them weren   t, and  then I came to here, the Davis Family Funeral Home. I told them about my  dad. I told them about some of the experiences I   ve had because they  wondered why this young kid wants to work for a funeral home. I don   t  think Carter really knew what to think of me at the time, but he said,    Okay.  You can work.     We worked a service. It was a really iconic first service to work. It was a  lady. Katie Peterson had passed away, and she was an influential person in  Dewey. They had a horse-drawn carriage for her casket. We went to  Memorial Park in Bartlesville, and sure enough, they had big, black,  Percheron draft horses with all the tack, with an 1800   s horse-drawn hearse  carriage. It was really interesting and really neat.  29  In that time, I got my insurance, produces license, and that   s when Carter,     All right, this kid   s not just looking for a handout.    I started working here  on a limited basis. I got my apprenticeship through the Oklahoma Funeral  Board, and I started helping them with calls. I have wondered since I dealt  with my own father   s passing away,    Could I help people? Could I do this?     and I found that, very quickly, that I fit in pretty well. Maybe I   m not the  oldest person, but when you   ve stepped through a serious amount of grief  having to bury a father or a mother or brother, sister, immediate family  passing away, it   s easier to sympathize with other people with losing their  own loved ones, even if they know when there   s been an illness forever.  Yeah, my father passed away suddenly. That does not really correlate with  someone that has a degenerative disease, but grief, as a whole, is similar.  You can   t say that you   re going to grieve the same way, but knowing that  someone is grieving is a whole lot better place to start and knowing that  yeah, they might be absolutely, they might be in shock that their loved one  passed away. Now they feel like they   re out of control. They need to control  whatever they can. Knowing that helps out a lot whenever you   re in this sort  of situation, knowing that that   s what they need, to feel bad. You need to let  them do some of that. Otherwise it   s not going get along because it   s  amazing how powerless you can feel when someone passes away.  I worked for Carter and did more calls and receiving people and doing the  embalmings, working the funerals. We had a lady that passed away of  cancer, who, she was thirty-four, I believe. Her name was Hillary, and I  remember her husband was not much older than I am. In fact, I think he was  only a year older than I am, and I remember how rushed everyone was, his  family was making him. I tried to make sure to make a point of it, saying,     Your wife just passed away. You   ve only been married a few years. Spend  as much time as you need. You   re going to have people saying,    You need  to come do this. You need to come do that.    Honestly, at the funeral home,  we   re here for you and for your family. You don   t have to go do this right  now. If you need to stay here and be with your wife, do that. Don   t let all of  the thousands of little mundane decisions that people will come and ask take  you away from the moment, which is to acknowledge the passing of your  loved one and the spend that time with them.     Surprisingly, that was one of the few times I was able to have that direct  contact in a grieving situation. Most of the time, we   re doing all the  mundane decisions and all that and trying to get things taken care of. I was  surprised at the   there   s a definite need for a lot more of the grief  counseling, a lot more of the acceptance and working through these issues  but the reluctance for those people that need it to even come get it. A lot of  people say,    Well, the funeral home, they need to do this and that. They  don   t have time.    It   s not that we don   t have time. People don   t take  30  advantage of it. We would be more than happy to go through any of these  issues with anybody. In fact, we   ll sit out here and talk to you for as long as  you need. We know the people to call if you need that.  There   s a lot of people that just feel like,    Well, that   s there.    We keep all of  that at a distance. As I go through the apprenticeship process, there are all  kinds of interesting things you learn about people and about how different  cultures handle things, how different things   I mean, also, in the back, I  learned that I really enjoy several parts of the process of preparing the body,  mostly making them look really good. (Laughs) Also, some more of the  medical side of it, we can determine a lot about a person, how they passed  away, based on some of the processes, the aspiration. We remove the fluids  from the lungs, and feel like maybe now they can get a deep breath. It   s  weird to think that. You can tell if there was fluid in the lungs. We can tell a  number of things about the body and about the person, and it   s really  intrigued me.  I hope, I mean, through these processes, the body looks more natural than it  did and we can get an appearance that is close to, well, sometimes very, very  close to what the family remembers seeing their loved one as and allow  them to spend their last moments not remembering the cold and the sterile  environment of the hospital or the nursing home but seeing their loved one  in their favorite suit or, I think bathrobe was one of my favorites. She would  always wear pajamas. We put her in her favorite pajamas. That   s what she  would have done. She would have been walking around. That   s how she  would have slept in her pajamas like that.  To allow people to have that because there   s a lot of I   ve noticed here  with   I   m sure y   all have heard a lot of people are going to a cremation. It   s  easier, it   s cheaper, but it depends on what you do. A lot of funeral homes,  well, they offer all kinds of things, but the one that they offer all the services  of funeral and then the cremation, which, I think if you   re going to go that  route, it   s the best route. A lot of people just want to get it over and done  with. They   re continually pushing that grief even farther because there is no  acknowledgement. There   s no time spent with their loved one. They just     poof    and gone. That   s going to have its own box of worms to deal with. I  think it   s very, very important to spend that time, to be able to work through  and be present with the body as opposed to just send them off and come  back. We got off on a tangent. Sorry. (Laughs)  Finchum No, that   s okay. You   re going after your license?  Clark I   m going after my license, yes. I attend a couple of classes at UCO   University of Central Oklahoma . They have a mortuary science program,  and that   s the only one in the state. I had to go there. (Laughs) There   s a part  31  of me that   s really interested in the medical side of it, and who knows?  We   ll see. I   ve got plenty of time to decide.  Finchum This won   t be your last stop, I don   t think.  Clark No, absolutely not. (Laughter) If anything, I   ll come up with something else.  (Laughter)  Finchum It sure sounds like it. (Laughs) Well, is there anything else we need to cover  that we haven   t asked already? You got most of my list. You   re not from  Dewey.  Clark I   m not.  Finchum There   s probably not much   I mean, do you know much of the history of  Dewey?  Clark Well, I know that Tom Mix was here  in Dewey . This is very important  because of Tom Mix, and they have a museum for him here. Bartlesville  itself is one of the oldest towns in Oklahoma, and ConocoPhillips is here.  (Laughs) Has been here for a very long time.  Finchum We drove through the cemetery to see Henry Starr. We   ll have to go back  and figure out who exactly he was, but he had an interesting headstone.  Clark In fact, the Dewey Cemetery up here has the original Bartles family in it.  They have a big mausoleum there.  Finchum We saw that, too. Have you thought of the alma mater yet?  Clark (Laughs) No.  Finchum (Laughter) We   ll give up on that one, huh?  Clark I   m sure I could think of it. I knew the first line because the    humble    line   s  the second line.  Finchum We should know it, too, because they play it. The tune is on the library bell  tower at noon every day.  Clark Sorry. I thought I had it, too.  Finchum We   ll make it our homework, too. (Laughs)  Clark I think you   re right. I think the first lines are    proud and immortal, bright  shine your name       No. (Laughter)  32  Finchum Well, all right then. If there   s nothing else, we   ll say thank you very much  for talking with us today. It   s been a pleasure.  Clark Well, I hope I   ve shared enough stories for you. (Laughs)  Finchum You were great. Thank you, and people are right. You do have a nice radio  voice.  -------  -------
