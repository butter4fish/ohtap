 Gill. Today is December 16, 2008. I   m visiting with  Dean Bob Curtis Hamm at the Library of the Oklahoma State University  Campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE  Stories project which is part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program.  Bob, I appreciate you taking time to be with us today. There a lot of  ways we could start, but I   d like to back up to the beginning. Can you  tell me a little bit about where you grew up, family, and things that  influenced you early in your life?  Yes, I was born in Oklahoma City, went to Capitol Hill High School,  Lee grade school and I was greatly influenced, as I said when I was  inducted into the Oklahoma Higher Education Hall of Fame, I was  greatly influenced by my fourth grade teacher. In those days, they gave  you IQ tests. Not only that, they told you, you know, you have an IQ and  we   re going to put you in a special class. My brother, I remember, they  told him,    You don   t have it    so they put him in the vocational class.  There were about 12 of us in that higher IQ class, and she took us to the  Civic Center, she gave us tickets to ride on the bus to go to Shakespeare  movies and plays and concerts. She really looked after us. She had a  major influence on us. And I thought, if I ever get to be a teacher, I want  to be the kind that looks after my students, based on that fourth grade  teacher experience. Her name was Ms. Jane. The rumor was that she was  a Native American princess. And as I like to say, I don   t know whether  she was or not, at that age we didn   t know, but she was our princess, and  that   s all we cared about.  My dad was a sheet-metal worker; during World War II he was putting  sheet metal on airplanes. My mother was a buyer for John A. Brown and  Company, the largest department store in Oklahoma at that time. She  bought for the children   s and boys department. She influenced me in the  6  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  marketing. My aunt, who was a world traveler, influenced me on  wanting to see the world. She was on the last ship that left Shanghai in  1937 before the Japanese invaded. She came home with home movies  and my desire even as a little boy was to go to China and see it. Of  course, later on we got to do that as a Fulbright Scholar in China. We  also went there for one day in 1980 to see Sun Yat-sen University. Then  when I went back in 1984 and    85, we went to the same hotel that my  aunt stayed in 1937, it never had changed. Now, if you go back today  that hotel is gone and new hotels are there. But in 1985 the old hotels  were still there.  Then my dad, who was not a believer in higher education, he said,    Man  is not worth anything who wears a tie    and    they live off the rest of us  who are the common laborers.    So knowing this, I had to get a job in  high school. I was a janitor at a local insurance company to save up  some money and I was able to go my first year at OSU. I lived in   first  year that Bennett Hall was open, it was the first year the Library was  open, and the first year the Student Union was open. So when I came up  here I was impressed by three brand new buildings.  Huge buildings.  Yes.  What influenced you to come to Oklahoma State? Is there some story  there?  Yeah, not really so much. I really wanted to   this sounds terrible, but I  really wanted to go to Texas A M because I was impressed by their  marching band.  A lot of people are. (Laughs)  Yeah, but out-of-state tuition and other things. And my best friend, one  of the sixteen, I was the only one who actually graduated out of those  students. But my roommate at OSU actually came from Capitol Hill too,  but he flunked out because he joined a fraternity. He actually became a  colonel in the Air Force. That was when you could become a pilot  without a degree. So he did that. But anyway, since he came up here and  I could afford it   that was a major consideration.  So your dad relented then and let you go to college?  Oh, he didn   t care if I went, he just didn   t want to be responsible for  paying any of the money for it.  7  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Did you pay with scholarships the rest of the way through Bob?  They didn   t have any scholarships, really. I worked. I worked at Bennett  Hall as a dorm counselor. I worked in the kitchen. Actually, in those  days, you got free football tickets, and I could sell my ticket for 50 cents.  You can   t do that, of course, today but in those days you could. And 50  cents was enough money to take a girl to the movie, so that was  important to me.  More important than going     Yes, more important than a football game, as far as I was concerned  anyway.  What about your undergraduate experience at Oklahoma State?  Oh, it was absolutely fantastic. I got involved, in fact the first semester I  was here I ran for a class office. We don   t have those anymore either. I  lost, but it encouraged me and I ended up being President of, what they  called in those days, the Independent Men   s Resident Hall Council and  the Resident Hall Association President. My mother told me that she had  an intern from OSU who was a Blue Key member. And she said,    When  you go to OSU, I want you to join that Blue Key group because they   re  really sharp.    So when I came up here, I said,    I want to join up Blue  Key. How do you do that?    And everybody laughed and they said,     Well that   s for juniors and seniors who are leaders on campus and  probably you don   t qualify for that right now.    They were right of  course. So I waited two years; my junior year I got accepted into Blue  Key and I was just terrifically proud of that. I was so proud of that, that  later on when I came back as a professor, I became the advisor for Blue  Key for over 20 years. So that had a long history to it.  Hold on, because I want to come back to that and other things. I want to  talk about your work in student organizations. But let   s back up a little  bit, what about some of the academic? Did you major in marketing?  Majored in marketing. I always majored in marketing.  So you started right off in marketing.  And that was the influence of   there were two influences in my life.  One was my mother   s business, the John A. Brown Company. The buyer  for the young men   s department took a liking to me, and he didn   t have  any children. So he would spend time with me showing me John A.  Brown   s, how they bought things, took me to the market. He did all  kinds of things, bought me clothes actually. Right before he died of  8  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  cancer, they were opening up a new store in Penn Square and he said,    I  want you to go with me.    I had to hold his arm he was so weak, but he  wanted to see that store. But merchandisers, they really love their work.  Of course, they worked in those days six to six and a half days a week  depending on the holidays, but nobody seemed to care. They were just  glad to have the work in 1940s and early 1950s. But anyway, I always  majored in marketing. Three times I did that.  Bob, do you remember some of the faculty who taught you?  Absolutely.  Can you share some stories?  Yeah. It   s really interesting, because I didn   t have any scholarships. In  fact, we didn   t have very many scholarships in those days. Most of us  worked if you needed extra money or needed money to go to school.  And I carefully planned this out. I was in ROTC, that paid  50 a month.  Then I was a dorm counselor, and then they asked me   as I was walking  across campus and Professor, Zimmerman was his name, he yelled out  the window,    Bob come in here.    So I went in there and he said,    We  need somebody to teach ten-key adding machine.    If you can imagine, in  our computer world today. He said,    I want you to teach two classes of  ten-key adding machine.    And I didn   t know much about ten key adding  machines, but I thought well, okay. So I went in, he showed me how to  do it. He said it   s a one hour credit, this is what it pays. So with my  50  plus my counseling fee, plus my dorm deal, plus these two classes. And  when I graduated in 1955, I had  2.64 left over. And I thought,    God  really has looked after me. He   s given me more than I needed. He just  gave me  2.64 left over.     In the 1950s, what were the student hot spots, the hang outs? You talked  about taking a date   I guess the Leachman Theater was there.  Yeah. The Aggie Theater downtown. The Leachman was right on the  corner. My favorite story about that is Don Dickerson who also lived in  the dorm, he and his eventual wife, and the girl I was dating was a girl  named Karen Carson, but everybody called her Kit Carson   we double  dated. And you tried to make friends with somebody who had a car. Of  course, we didn   t have a car because we didn   t have the money. But  there was a guy there who had a Ford,    39 Ford and he didn   t date much.  So we were all really nice to him hoping we could borrow his car. We  borrowed it one Saturday night. And he said,    There   s a little trick to it.     And I said,    I   m not going to drive it anyway, I   m sure Don knows how  to drive it. So Don got in the front and sure enough he knew how to  drive it. So we went to the movie, came out and it was pouring down  9  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  rain and we all four of us piled into the car, and he couldn   t get it to  start. There was a little mechanism you pushed down or up to engage it  and then you turn the key. It just wouldn   t start.  It was getting curfew time for the girls. They were living over in Murray  Hall. And so we thought, we   ve got to get the girls back, it   s pouring  down rain. And like I say we didn   t have a lot of money. So we both  pooled our money, and we had enough money to take a taxi. There was a  taxi right by the Leachman Theater, and so we went over and asked him  to take us over to Murray Hall. Also in those days, when you went on a  date you wore maybe a suit and tie. So both us had on our only suit and  ties. So we got the girls over there and there was a little light. I  remember there was a light bulb up there, and the tall guys would undo  it so it would be dark so you could give the girls a kiss. And I of course  fully expected to get one that night, but I didn   t because we were just  soaking wet and the girls ran on in.  The taxi driver said,    Do you need me to drive you guys on home?    We  looked at each other and Don and I, neither of us had any money. So we  said,    Oh no, it   s a nice evening, we   ll just walk.    So we walked from  Murray Hall all the way across campus in our suits. The next day, we  didn   t go to church because we only had one suit and it was all wet. And  you couldn   t go to church in   well you could, but you wouldn   t go to  church in those days without a suit and tie. So we missed church the next  day because of that. And Don and I   Don is now deceased, but we used  to   every time we   d see each other, we   d always joke,    Do you have  any money for a taxi?    That was our joke with each other.  So was the Aggie B going strong in those days?  Yes. Swim   s was big, we   d go there and have a coke. But our most  popular place to hang out was the Student Union. We   d go up to the  fourth floor and they had sock hops in those days and those were free.  Everything revolved around the campus in those days. We liked that.  You could walk over to the dorms, pick them up, walk over to the  Student Union, for a nickel get a coke, go up and have a dance, sit down  and have a coke, and then you could walk them back home. You didn   t  spend very much money, and we didn   t have much so it worked out  really good.  Cost a nickel a cup of coffee also.  Absolutely. Coffee was cheap in those days. It wasn   t  3.95, I   ll tell you  that. (Laughter) Well, we were making .50 cents an hour working the  dorms. And so by that analogy it would cost you 8 hours of work for a  cup of coffee in the modern day.  10  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Mercy. When you graduated with your degree, tell us a little bit about  your career from there until you came back to Oklahoma State.  Okay, 1955 is when we graduated. It was a time in which we had just  finished the Korean War so those of us who were in ROTC   and we  were in ROTC for two reasons. One was because everybody was very  patriotic in those days and we were defending our country against the  Communists and that was very important. My brother who was with the  Fifth Reconnaissance Combat Team in Korea kept sending me  messages,    Get out of ROTC, too many lieutenants are dying over here.     In fact, half of the class of West Point of    51 or    52, they all died in  Korea. But anyway, I graduated and they didn   t need us for what they  thought they did, so they gave us six month active duty and then seven  years in the reserves. So I went to Fort Benning and finished the basic  officer   s course. And then I wanted to go overseas because I had that  desire, but they sent me to Fort Riley, Kansas which was not exactly  overseas. It was in the boondocks, but not overseas. I served with the  First Infantry Division there. Then I got out and joined the 95th Infantry  for eleven years. Ended up being a captain, that   s as high as I went. The  reason why I got out was because, at that time, I was in graduate school  and I had the chance to take student groups to Europe in the summer,  and that looked more fun than two weeks at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas in  the summer.  So you were on active duty less than a year?  Less than a year. Then we were on reserves for seven years. That was  our obligation.  How soon did you go to graduate school after that, Bob?  Well, as soon as I came back, I went to work for IBM. But it took me  about a month to get a job. So I understand how it feels to be out of a job  and need a job. The Army in those days paid us  240 a month as a  second lieutenant. I spent about  100 of it one month, the last month, for  a new suit; it was a gray suit and I had a white shirt and a red tie. So I  went down and interviewed at IBM, and I was early, because everybody  said don   t be late for your job interview. I was standing outside this  building at IBM and all of a sudden this pigeon came over and dropped  something on my shoulder. And I thought,    Oh my, I   m not supposed to  get this job.    So I had to go in the men   s room and get that all cleaned  up. (Laughter) By that time it was my appointment, so I went to my  appointment and they looked at me and they said,    What happened on  your shoulder?    I told them the story and they died laughing. They said,     Well normally we don   t accept people who come in that way but you   ll  be an exception.    So I came in and interviewed for this job. Took a test  11  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  of course, IBM made you take a test. So I took this test, and they  interviewed 27 people. I was the second highest on the test. I really  wanted this job. You can imagine being out of a job and having a new  car and all those kinds of things.  So I really wanted this job and I called and said,    How did I do on this  test?    And they said,    You were number two out of 27.    I said,    Well  I   d really like to have this job.    And they said,    Well, the manager   s  wife is in the hospital.    Well, I didn   t know it but she was having a     woman   s operation    that you have at a certain age. They said,    Well,  she   s in the hospital, so he can   t respond.    I said,    Well, I   ll call back  tomorrow.    I called back every day for eight days. And finally the  assistant manager said,    Well, why don   t you just come on to work  because you show more persistence than anybody else.    So that   s why I  got that job. I worked there for five years.  What city were you assigned?  Oklahoma City. On a Friday, in those days, things were different.  They   d come in on Friday and they   d say,    Well, we   re transferring you  to New York City. On Monday, you   ll be up there in New York City so  get your plane ticket and show up. Well, I had started my MBA at OU. It  actually wasn   t an MBA, it was a master   s in economics, and I   d taken  nine hours. But then they had announced that OSU was going to have  the first MBA in the state. I really wanted to come back and get my  MBA. So I saw this as a sign that I should get an MBA. I asked if I  could have a leave of absence and not go to New York City because I  was engaged, and I was active in my church and a lot of things. I wasn   t  willing to do that. And they said,    Well, go get your MBA, then come  back, and then we   ll promote you.    I said okay. So I went to OSU, got  my MBA degree, and again you always need a little extra money. And  they said,    Well since you worked for IBM, you can teach computers.     So I moved from a 10-key adding machine to teaching a computer class.  That   s great.  Which worked out pretty nicely actually. They were evaluating  professor   s teaching and my ratings were higher than anybody in the  business school. So they said,    You ought to get your Ph.D. and come  back and teach.    I said,    Oh, I   m not smart enough to do that,    because I  hold professors in very high regard. So I went to see Professor  Zimmerman again, my old professor, because he was very honest with  us. He was not politically correct by today   s standards. He told you     you were either good or bad or ugly or whatever. (Laughter) So I went to  see him and I said,    Professor Zimmerman      and he didn   t have a  doctorate degree either   but I said,    Professor Zimmerman, the head of  12  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  the Marketing Department told me I should get a Ph.D. and come back  and teach for you guys and I need your opinion.    He looked at me and  smiled and said,    What   s your reservations?    And I said,    Well, I   m  concerned that I don   t have what it takes to get a doctorate degree.    He  said,    Well Bob, I   ve known you for a long time. You   re not the most  brilliant person I   ve ever met, but with your personality you will talk  them out of one. I   d go ahead and get it if I were you.    So that   s how I  did that.  Finally after four years at the University of Texas I came back. Well  they had changed deans; they had changed department heads; they had  changed presidents. Bob Kamm was the new president; Dick Poole was  the new dean; and Wayne Meinhart was the new department head. So I  came here and I said,    I   m supposed to have a job here.    Well, Dick  Poole was in Colorado. Wayne Meinhart said,    I don   t know, I haven   t  hired anybody. But I understand that you wanted to come.    And Bob  Kamm didn   t know anything about it either. I said,    Just give me the  forms.    So they gave me the forms and I filled them out and Wayne  signed it, then the underlings of everybody else signed it because they  weren   t here. That   s how I got my job.  Well, now did you do you doctorate at the University of Texas?  University of Texas, yes. And when I was done there, I fortunately had  the same positive experience. I was selected because they had a student  survey and I was selected as the outstanding teacher at the University of  Texas in the business school, which I always prided myself on that  because they had some truly outstanding people. But it   s more than just  knowledge in your head, you   ve got to be able to pass it on to students,  too. But anyway, that   s how that got started.  Let   s see, you came back to Oklahoma State; how did you know there  was an opening available at Oklahoma State?  Well, every time I would go to an academic meeting, I   d see Dick Poole  or I   d see somebody and they   d always say,    Well we   re looking  forward to you coming when you graduate.    So I just   I knew. It   s sort  of like, you know you kept saying,    Let   s have a date.    Well, pretty soon  you think, well they want to have a date. Well, they kept saying all the  time I was down there we want you to come up and teach for us when  you get through, so I took them up on their word.  Showed up and said here I am?  Yeah, I just showed up and said here I am. I had offers at Penn State and  Colorado. It was difficult at that time to find professors; I mean OSU  13  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  was glad I came because they needed somebody. And I   ll tell you how  bad they needed somebody; they had a doctoral student from OU driving  up here to teach a class.  Boo.  And they were just delighted that I was coming because I was an OSU  person, getting rid of that OU person.  Save the department.  Exactly.  Bob you came back and you had a pretty fast ride. I mean, you came  back in    66, is that right?     66, that   s right.  And then I think in    69 you were promoted to Director of Graduate  Studies?  Yeah. But what happened was   that   s over an interesting period in the  history of the College of Business. The department had been declining  for several years and a lot of them frankly had not kept up with the  literature. They were not really as current as others were. And in  marketing, they only had me and one other person, and he was an older  person. In fact a couple of years later he died of a heart attack. He also  had eyesight problems that made it difficult to read. He didn   t always  keep up. So when I came I started teaching graduate courses. And then,  which is sort of an interesting story because  half of my first class  dropped because they thought I was too hard .  Which is a little unusual isn   t it, the first year teaching graduate level?  First year, yes. But I remember that class so well because I tried to do  the same thing we did at the University of Texas, which was of course  probably a mistake in some people   s eyes. So a week before class started  I put a syllabus on my door and put an assignment up. Of course,  students didn   t come by and look at the door and the assignment, but  there it was. So the first day of class I walked in and I said,    Okay, turn  in your papers for today.    Of course, nobody had any papers for today.  And I said,    Is there some question here? I asked you to turn in the  papers and nobody   s sending them down here to the front.     Somebody finally said,    Well Professor, what assignment are you  talking about?    And I said,    The one that was posted on my door. That   s  normal procedure for graduate classes. You don   t want to come to class  14  Gill  Hamm  on the first day which is three hours and simply ask me to call your  name and give you a syllabus and leave. We can   t waste that much  time.    I said,    You   re not prepared today.    So I said,    Well, since you   re  not prepared, I   ll go ahead and lecture.    So I lectured for an hour and a  half and then I gave them a break. Well at the break, there were sixteen  of them that went down and dropped the class. I had sixteen left.  Well, the next day I got a call from the associate dean. He called me in  and he said,    Bob, are you aware of how many students dropped out of  your class yesterday?    I said,    Well, there were only sixteen at the end  of the class and there were thirty-two at the first.    And I said,    Thirty-two  students are too many for a graduate class anyway, now I   ve got it  down to a good size.    And he said,    Well, what are you doing in that  class?    I said,    Upholding high expectations.    And he said,    Well, tell  me about the class.    I said,    Are you questioning my teaching  techniques and what I   m saying, because if you are, I want to have a  lawyer here from the ACLU.    He looked at me really funny and he said,     Oh no, I would never do that. Just continue on.     So one of the assignments was that they had to write an article, a 12-  page article and submit it for publication. And if they didn   t have it  finished by the semester, they had to at least have the article ready, it  didn   t have to be submitted. Out of the sixteen students, four of them  had articles published. I told them,    Would you have published an article  and had your name now on an article if you hadn   t had that as an  assignment?    Then they realized what I was trying to say to them. We   re  raising the bar on graduate studies at Oklahoma State University. And  that became quite a topic of conversation at the University that a  professor requires students to write articles at the master   s level. But we  were so successful, we kept that up. Students ever since 1966 have been  writing articles.  As Director of Graduate Studies, are there other changes you have  made?  Oh yeah, oh yeah  Tremendously. We increased the requirements for  statistics and math. That was one of the major things we did. But all of  the classes were   I mean the whole MBA program raised the bar to a  new level. That was one of the best things we did. And hiring new  faculty members, outstanding people from all over the country, and great  graduate programs. At the same time though, we started   I was the  person who wrote the original doctoral program. I served on that  committee   I was chairman of that committee. And then later on, I  wrote the one that managed the one for marketing and management that  we had for a while. And then I did just the marketing one after that.  I  also taught the first doctoral students in marketing. It was almost a one  15  Gill  Hamm  man show for a few years.   In    74 you moved into Business Extension Director of that program.  There must have been some insights with the work with the business  community and corporate leaders.  Right. Well what happened was, Dick Poole who was the dean was  involved with NASA in Houston. So I got a call one day and he said,     We need somebody in management at NASA and they want to hire you  as a consultant.    Well, I was elated but I couldn   t see any relative  contribution that I could make. He said,    Well it   s in management, go  down and talk to them.    So I flew down to Houston to the Johnson  Space Center; they wanted to have somebody to train the young  executives who worked in the spacecraft industry, so I wrote some case  studies on how  they purchase and evaluated marketing decisions .  They had a device called a solar simulator. They take the cone of the  spaceship and put it in the simulator and then they push the switch and  all these carbon arc rods would come on. It stimulated the power of the  sun. They did that and when they pushed the lever and it all came on, it  blew up. And so that was a perfect case study. Should you go back and  hire that firm over and pay them millions of dollars to build another one,  or should you go to another contractor? And so we wrote that case. And  then when these young guys came in to work for NASA, we used that  case study. That sort of helped me as an Oklahoman to put on my record  as a consultant in NASA for a year, that this guy can consult with big  corporations.  Meanwhile, the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity decided to initiate me as a  graduate brother because they needed an advisor. Now, how does that  relate to consulting? Well the first thing that happens is you get a ring  showing your membership in the fraternity. So I got a call one day from  a lawyer saying,    Will you come and talk to us, we   re interested in  talking to you about location analysis.    I went to Muskogee and the  lawyer and I are talking about putting in a new bank. He said,    Are you  knowledgeable about location analysis?    And I said,    Yeah, I have a  Ph.D. in marketing.    And he said,    Do you know how to do a location  analysis for a bank?    I said,    Oh yeah, that   s one of my specialties.     Well, before I went down there I   d gone to the Library and got a book  on location analysis. So    specialties    is somebody who read the book.  He looked at me and he saw my ring and he said,    Are you a Fiji?    I  said,    Yes.    And he said,    Well you   re hired.    So I started developing a  career in banking and did that from 1967 to   well to now. I   m still  doing bank consulting work.  16  Gill  Hamm  So anyway, I really enjoyed making the relationship between the real  world and the classroom. I thought it brought reality to the classroom. I  tried to bring in my consulting work and show them here   s a concept,  here   s an application for the concept. And when you are in your own  industry, you   ll take that concept and then you   ll be looking at problems  then you   ll say what concept will help me solve that problem? I think  that was a real learning experience for the students.  Well, that relationship with the community caused Dean  Vergil  Miller  who at that time was the new dean to select me as Director for Business  Extension. We did not have a real outreach program for business. So he  told me that he was going to appoint me to be the director of the first  real executive professional development group. Clayton Millington had  that job but he was primarily interested in economic education. By  accident more than anything else, they had  64,000 in outreach  programs for business. So I took that over and I had an assistant, Jim  Hromas, and one secretary. At the end of six years, when I left there in  1980, we had almost  800,000 in revenue coming in. Now it   s in the  millions of dollars. But it started in 1968 or    69.  Bob were those contacts really valuable for the College of Business that  you made with industry?  Oh, absolutely, yes. I would go to these banks and tell them we had this  seminar, and the bank would say,    Okay, we want a one day seminar.     I   d develop the one day seminar, I   d go teach the seminar, I   d pick up  the check for the seminar, come back and put it in the school. And then  eventually we got enough money   I mean this is what you do in a small  business. You get enough money ahead that you can hire people who are  experts on that so I didn   t have to kill myself. I was giving speeches for   25 and driving from Stillwater to Bartlesville or Fort Gibson,  Oklahoma or Woodward or I was going everywhere for 25 bucks  because we had to get the word out.  I learned a great lesson then because a guy said to me one day   you  know, at first I was just talking about how great OSU is and the College  of Business at OSU. One guy came to me and he said,    I came here to  hear you tonight because I was hoping you were going to say something  I could use. I already know Oklahoma State is a really good school.     And I said,    Well what do you mean by that?       Well, I was hoping you  were going to say something that would help me in my business.    And  that totally changed my orientation to public speaking. I changed it, from  then on, I   d go and give speeches, and I   d say here are some of the latest  ideas and thoughts that may help you in your business. I   d give four or  five new concepts or maybe three depending on whatever the number  was at the time. And I   d say,    Here are three major new concepts.    That  17  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  information encouraged those business people to want to come back and  use OSU for programs. And that   s why I think we were so successful  because we did a lot of one-on-one with people.  Are there some highlights in your teaching and your faculty  administration career at Oklahoma State? You retired in     Well, actually, people joke about me. They say I retired every other  year. But I retired officially in 1990. I was promoted from assistant to  associate professor in two years. Then associate to full professor in five  years. So there really wasn   t any major goals ahead. That   s why I was  glad to take on administrative responsibilities. Then I was a Fulbright  Professor to China for a year. I was in Jordan for a year on USAID. I  was on Semester at Sea going around the world. I didn   t want to stay  here so long that people would say,    Oh my god, is he still there?     So in 1990, I was offered a job as Associate Dean for Graduate Studies  at Oklahoma City University. They wanted to beef up their program and  they wanted me to come down and help them. So it turned out   I did  that for a couple of years but mostly what I was doing was running their  MBA program around the world. I mean I went everywhere from  Argentina to Russia to China and Malaysia and Singapore and all kinds  of places for them. I did that for five years, and then I developed cancer.  So I took off about two years and then OSU said,    Since you live here,  we need you to come back and teach again.    So I came back as a  Professor Emeritus and I started teaching two classes. I did that for  several years. Then I quote retired again, and then a couple of years  later, Kirk Jewell who is the CEO of the OSU Foundation called me and  said,    I   d like to hire you to come and work for the Foundation for a  year.    Now I   m in my fourth year of doing that.  Well Bob, one thing I want to back up in your career and pick up, in  addition to your administrative responsibilities and your teaching  responsibilities, you were for many years actively involved in student  organizations as a faculty advisor and served in different capacities. You  were known for a lot of those things through the years. Could you share  some of your work with student organizations and how you felt about  that and what it meant to you?  Student organizations to me are like frosting on the cake. When I was a  young guy I went to the movies on Saturdays for ten cents and they   d  show movies about college campuses. They always looked so intriguing  to me because we just didn   t have any money. And I thought,    Boy look  at that. Those people are dressed well. They have those really cool  sweaters on. They   re driving convertibles and the professors are so nice  and they   re having tea at the fraternities and sororities.    That was long  18  before Animal House. (Laughter) But anyway, so I thought when I get  there   well because I had worked for IBM, which I still considered one  of the most professional companies in the world to work for, I believed  in work. My dad was a blue collar union worker, so I believed you got to  the office at eight o   clock and you always stayed    til five. You teach  classes, and you know the students   if you do a good job, students come  and ask you to be their advisor. So I was advisor to Delta Sigma Phi  Business Fraternity, I was advisor to Business Student Council for  several years, and several others.   I always hope to improve any organization with which I advised.   Business Student Council is an example. They had a little banquet for  students and they   d have like forty people come. And I said,    You need  to have a big banquet. You need to have tickets that are the same color  as the college banner. You need to have programs. You need to bring in  some really dynamic speakers.    And pretty soon we filled the ballroom  with 700 people who came to these banquets. It became a huge deal.  One of my saddest stories of the years I was at OSU was one night I got  a phone call from a student I   d never met and didn   t know. But he knew  a person I knew. He called me and he said,    I need to talk to you.    And  I said,    Well great, come in tomorrow.    And he said,    No, I need to talk  to you right now.    I said,    I can   t. I   ve got to go to Business Council  Annual honors banquet.    In fact, it was the night that Martin Luther  King was assassinated. I said,    I can   t, I   m in charge of this banquet and  we   ve got 700 people coming. I   ve got to go.    I said,    Call me tomorrow  and we   ll get together. Or call me after, I   ll be through about 10:30, call  me then.    Well, anyway when I got home at 10:30, he never called and I  found out he committed suicide that night. That has affected me a lot.  That when people need you, you need to go to them. But unfortunately,  there was no way I could that night. His wife had had a baby that day,  and he was depressed and just couldn   t handle it, so he shot himself. But  you just can   t do everything.  In fact, in my Business Student Council groups were people like Senator  Tom Coburn. And people are always surprised: Well, Coburn   s a  medical doctor. How can he be a medical doctor and be in the business  school? Well, he was in the business school, outstanding student. When  he graduated, he went to work for his dad   s company that made glass  lenses for eyeglasses in Muskogee. He got cancer of the throat and he  worked with his doctor and he was so impressed by this doctor he  decided to go to medical school and did that. So we had some really  outstanding people. Don Nichols was not a student of mine, but he was  also a United States Senator. But he needed some help and he came to  see me. You develop a reputation, here   s a professor who helps students.  And I told you about Phi Gamma Delta. They needed an advisor and  19  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  they initiated me just to be an advisor, and that   s now one of the top  fraternities on campus.  And also Blue Key many years?  Blue Key. I was Blue Key advisor. They had Abe Hesser who was a vice  president and they had really top notch people. So when I took over Blue  Key it was still, ever since I remember in the    50s it was the top  leadership fraternity for men on campus and I loved that. We used to  have initiation in my house. We   d have the parents come. We   d fix  sausage casserole for breakfast and biscuits and stuff and made a big  deal out of it. In those days, they had to wear blue blazers and they had  badges that they wore. I insisted that they dress well, wear white. I mean  I was an IBM guy, and I wanted them to look the part. I instilled in them  the concept of    the Blue Key Man.    A Blue Key Man is a man who  proudly is a leader but he   s a servant leader. He looks after his people.  And that was   today as a fundraiser I go to those same people. Not only  are they multi-millionaires, we have several billionaires who were  members of Blue Key. So when I retired and we sent out 300 letters to  those students and we said we   re going to establish a scholarship in Bob  Hamm   s name, we got  250,000 in two months. That was exceeding our  goal  So we were delighted about that.  Bob, you had to spend countless hours of your personal time and you  enjoyed it. Truly it was a sacrifice. What motivated you to work   and  I   m not saying this critically, but some professors do a marvelous job  teaching and counseling students but don   t want to be engaged with  students outside of the academic environment. In leadership roles and  other ways you   re involved, what was your motivation for that?  I think it   s a Christian motivation really. I mean the Bible is always   I  always joked that I was born in a pew of a Baptist Church. The whole  concept of Christianity I think is to help make people better and to be a  servant leader. I just saw that this was a key time in people   s lives. It  was in my life. I mean, I   m indebted to all those professors who  encouraged me to get a doctorate degree and to get a bachelor   s degree.  Here is money. And I thought,    Here   s my opportunity to pay those  people back.    But you know a student often has potential. Charlie Eitel,  CEO of Simmons  Bedding  is giving me way too much credit. But he  was in pre-dentistry when he was a student and he was a Blue Key  member, too. I met him one night at an event and I said,    Charlie, I don   t  know what you   re majoring in, but you could make an outstanding  marketing guy.    He said,    You really think so?    I said,    Yeah.    And he  said,    If you make a D in some course in pre-dentistry could you still be  outstanding in marketing?    I said,    Those are the kind of people we  like.    (Laughter) So the next day he came over and we enrolled him in  20  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  the marketing program. Of course, he did really well and became  president and CEO of several companies. I think it was the ability to see  great potential in people and I didn   t want it to waste  You want it to  flourish. And I think they needed direction.  So we sponsored   I was always looking for something to sponsor. We  started on campus a National Prayer Breakfast. We   d have 600 or 700  people come, not to a national one really, but a Campus Prayer  Breakfast. And then some of the students and I went to the National  Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D. C. to inspire the students to do that.  We   d end up having 700 people come to those events. Well, over the  years, that   s dwindled down. But I think that   s all involved in leadership.  We also sponsored major entertainment on campus to raise money. We  made thousands of dollars back in the    60s and    70s. And then the  University decided, well we want to give that money to some other  group. We took transfer students from junior colleges and we had a  transfer student leadership program for them. That was eventually taken  over, and finally I realized what we were doing. We were being the  creative force to come up with ideas that other people wanted to take  over later on. So we let them. We didn   t fight it. We just said fine. We   ll  go come up with some other idea. So now they   re involved with some  project to help poor people in Mexico and other places like that. They   re  always coming up with new ideas, which I really like that concept.  Well Bob, you alluded to earlier, a lot of the mentoring and student  relationships that you did led to lifelong relationships later.  Yes.  And the purpose for developing them was not for what they would do  later, but it was in the moment. Yet one of the offshoots of that is the  relationship they had, coming back and serving on advisory groups and  business associates. Can you speak to the value of those kinds of  relationships to the college?  Yeah. Well, one of the things I think you have to remember is that you  can   t  mentor hundreds of students, but you can a few each year . What  you can do is identify some people that you can really mentor. You can  mentor four or five or six people a year. And during that year, whether  they   re a master   s candidate or doctoral candidate or an undergraduate,  you can mentor that person. And if you mentor that person for a year,  they will not forget you. If they just come to a class, they   re going to  forget at the end of a semester typically who you are. But then as they  continue on, you keep that relationship going maybe with Christmas  cards or maybe today it is really easy to keep up with email. Then, last  week I got a picture of a couple. I bet I   ve been in more weddings than  21  Gill  Hamm  anybody in the United States. But these kids get married and then they  invite me to be in their wedding. They   re out in California now and have  a baby. Well, they emailed me a picture of the baby.  Now, we didn   t do that to raise funds. That wasn   t a mission. The  mission was to help them out at a critical time in their life. But it turned  out that those relationships were really helpful in supporting the  University also. See I don   t believe a University has a heart. Only people  have hearts. And so the people who graduate and went on financially are  supporting the University, supporting it so we can invest money in more  students. So more students can receive the benefit of that. To me, that  has been the real joy of watching that. I was chairman, for example, of  Jim Hromas    doctoral committee. Then, he had eventually turned it over  to Julie Weathers; she had her doctor   s degree by then. So you have that  academic son, academic granddaughter and it goes on and on and on.  That   s a real joy in that. I mean some of my students are 60 years old  now. (Laughter)  I mean if you look at my BlackBerry you   ll see the 300 and some odd  names of people, some of which were students in the 1960s but we   re  still in touch with each other. We   ll call up for example one of them,  Dennis McNeal is married to the former President of Victoria   s Secret  fragrance division. He called me one day and he said,    Why don   t you  come down to our mansion in Antigua and spend a week with us?    I  said,    Well I don   t have a reason not to.    (Laughter) So I went down and  spent a week there. You know Charlie Eitel said,    Come down to  Naples, Florida and spend a week with us.    Well that   s my reward now,  for 40 years ago.  (Laughs) That   s great. Well, during the period you were there, you  worked with a lot of deans, a lot of administrators. Are there some  special personalities that stand out in your mind, people who made  tremendous contributions to the School of Business?  Well, I don   t think there is any question that one of the turning points in  the College of Business was when Dick Poole took over for ten years  because he was the one who permitted us to hire really outstanding  professors and sort of started off in a whole new direction of quality. He  understood the market system. You   ve got to pay good professors. At  that time, academics   I mean I started off making  10,500 a year. I  don   t think the deans were making a lot more. I know the President, I  think, was making  45,000 a year in 1966. But he really set a very high  standard for people. He told me one time,    I   d fire you except you   re so  productive.    (Laughter) And I always remembered that comment. I said,     Well, I feel the same about you.    (Laughter) But we   ve laughed about  that later on. Still laugh about it.  22  Gill  Hamm  But then we had some deans who lacked vision. They lacked the  professionalism, I thought, that we needed. A lot of people just wanted  to maintain. Universities are not like businesses. They are much more of  a consensus builder. I don   t agree with that philosophy very much  myself. I think we don   t have a lot of visionary people in the whole  world. If you   re lucky enough to get somebody with vision, you have to  go with them and their vision. And we like that in some cases. By what I  mean professional and just not in dress, just not understanding that we  needed to have a School of Accounting   that causes conflicts. And  eventually that dean, Dean Miller was fired because people just didn   t  see that he had a lack of vision. We had people who just maintained and  enjoyed the fact that we had a good School of Business. Then we had  again some people who were not very good, and now we   re involved in  trying to get a new building and reaching new heights.  You   re going in a direction I want to go and tell a little bit about your  perspective of the college, where it   s going and some things here.  Yeah, I   m not being critical necessarily of people. We just didn   t have  sometimes the right people there at the right time and it doesn   t help.  Having a guy like Dick Poole who was a visionary, he is a very strong  personality. It had benefits. I mean he was the one who saw the building  completed in 1966, the existing building. He ensured that it was well  taken care of. For example, even before we got the Breathe Easy  program, no smoking in the buildings, one day he saw a guy smoking     well he thought he was smoking a cigar in a classroom, it was a  professor. Actually he was holding a cigar in his hand. He went in the  class and told him he couldn   t smoke his cigar, and the guy wasn   t even  smoking. But that was quite a conflict  He wasn   t a business guy. So the  other dean I understand called and said,    I   d appreciate it if you didn   t  chew my faculty out in front of their class.    (Laughs) I didn   t hear that  conversation but it was well documented that that happened. But he was  a very strong person. I mean, everybody agrees with that. And I think he  would say the same thing.  But he  Dick Poole  accomplished a great deal. He was really, the first  guy that did any fundraising for us. Vergil Miller was a very nice guy.  Very dependent on me as a consultant and as an advisor. But he lacked a  vision. And I mean things like wearing white shoes and white belts   he  just didn   t ingratiate himself with either business people or faculty. He  was another one who got fired. I remember I was on a business trip and I  came back and I got called over to the vice president   s office, Jim  Boggs. And he said,    Bob, we need your approval. We want to have a  consensus to fire Vergil Miller.    Well, he was the one who appointed me  to extension, so I didn   t want to fire him. And we had a good personal  relationship. I always saw my job as trying to help people. So I told Dr.  23  Gill  Boggs,    You don   t have my approval to fire him.    He said,    Well I want  to take it a hundred percent to the president before we fire him.    I said,     You tell the president from me, or I   ll tell him, that it   s not a consensus.  You   ve got seven people, but you   ve don   t have eight.    He said,     Okay.    He didn   t argue with me. But anyway, he fired him for that  reason. I can   t remember all the presidents we had. Of course,  Robert   Sandmeyer was seventeen years, or eighteen, something like that as  dean. And then we   ve had several interim deans who were excellent.  The interim deans are mostly maintainers. Greg Mosier was an interim  dean. I thought he was a very capable guy. And he is now dean at  University of Nevada-Reno and is doing an outstanding job out there. So  we had some interim deans   John Bale was also an interim dean. But  most of them, they know they can   t come up with a great vision and  great objective because they are not going to be there that long. But  those people, I mean those incidences keep you from moving forward.  Now we   ve been very blessed in the last year that we had Malone  Mitchell who gave  26 million to start the Department of  Entrepreneurship. And we hired Dr. Mike Morris to head that up. Well,  that program should be one of the top two or three programs in the  country in four years. I mean it should just be tremendously outstanding  because he has the vision and leadership to make it happen. And we  have a new Director of the Center for Entrepreneurship which she  Nola  Miyasaki  is a very capable person also. So I   m expecting great things  out of that.  I   m a little disappointed that we have not been able to move forward on  our building. Three years ago it was decided that we were going to be a   1 high priority for a new building on campus. Three years later we still  don   t have the plans for the business building finished. So it   s been  difficult. Why is it that important that you   re a year behind or more?  Well, what we   ve learned in the last year, or the last seven or eight  months is that there is a point in time when a lot of your donors have a  lot of money. And then there   s a point where they may not have any.  One of the billionaires that I was talking about a while ago was willing  to help us with several million dollars. Well, now he   s saying that he  can   t do that. So there was a point we should have got the funds when  we were capable of doing it. That   s why I think Burns Hargis    vision for  faculty professorships, his timing was impeccable because we got the  money before the decline in the housing market and the decline in the oil  business. So we were very fortunate to get that.  Is the new dean, Dean Sara Freedman, supportive of the  entrepreneurship program and fundraising and the things you   re talking  about?  24  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Yeah, I think she   s supportive of it. It was not a pass for her. Sometimes  someone fortuitously comes in and says,    I have an interest in  entrepreneurship, and here   s the money to do it.    There   s the opposite of  that when the dean says,    I think we need to have a flagship program  and that flagship program should be entrepreneurship and you guys go  out and raise the money for it.    Well, we did it backwards, and it wasn   t  a design as far as I know that we were going to have that as a flagship  program. We have it as a flagship program because the donor wanted to  do it. Entrepreneurship is the undercurrent of all business because it   s  encouraging people of any level, particularly small business level, to go  into business.  In fact one of the programs I   m working on right now is to help disabled  American veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, we   re trying to  help them through this entrepreneurship program to get them into small  business so that they won   t be staying at home depressed and not feeling  valued. We   re going to develop a great program   the program   s are  already developed. It   s just raising money so we can carry it out. We   re  going to have a national reputation for this, but it wasn   t some master  visionary design. And I wish that we had that. I don   t think we have that,  on paper at least, to say our goal is to have the best School of  Accounting in the region or be one of the best fifty. We had people who  wanted to do that, but they didn   t know how to carry it out. It   s not easy  to get academic leadership. We   re not trained as academic leaders.  We   re trained to be researchers and we   re trained to be teachers to some  degree; we   re trained to do outreach programs to some degree. But  we   re primarily trained as Ph.D.   s to do research, and that may be a  totally different personality in order to be a leader of a group of  academicians.  Well, Bob, broadening our scope adding 30,000 feet and looking down  over the years, what do you feel like have been some major  accomplishments of the college and milestones?  Well, that   s a good question. And you know, one of the first ones I think  of is the transition from an old building, Morrill Hall, to a new building  which gave us new status. The faculty awareness and the awareness of  the University that you had to pay market rates to get good faculty, I  think that   s a turning point that we could go out and really hire good  people.  Compete nationally.  Yeah, you could have people with national and regional reputations as a  member of your faculty. I think that was a turning point. The School of  Accounting, which was the flagship program for a long time. I think  25  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  having a guy with great vision like Dr.  Wilton  Anderson really gave  that program so much emphasis. And every person in the department  met very high standards. He was a person of extremely high standards.  And Wilton was a good marketer wasn   t he?  Absolutely.  He marketed his department well.  And fundraiser. He promoted it. He fundraised. He hired people. He was  an outstanding teacher himself, a textbook writer. He really was the  epitome of the ideal person for a campus. But there are not many people  like that. Most people are one or the other. It   s difficult to be an outreach  person relating to the community, relating to the students, and relating to  the highest level of academic research. But I think hiring certain people  made a major difference.  Moving to a new building? Faculty hires?  Yeah, those were major things   the starting of the School of Accounting  turned out to be a major thing. I think that   of course I may be  prejudice, but I think the fact that we started really developing an  outreach program where we now have won national awards for our  outreach program. The business forums, the Tulsa Forums, the economic  outlook conferences, the oil conferences, all those things today set the  University apart from other universities certainly in the state and in the  region. And when you can win national awards for your outreach  program, that speaks very highly of what you   re accomplishing there. So  that has to be one of the major turning points.  The problem that we have is that we   re human. Eventually even good  faculty members are going to get old and they   re not going to be as  enthusiastic and vital and dynamic as they once were. And as I   ve said  to our new dean, they   re at that high peak now. We   re going to be losing  35  of our faculty in the next three years because of age. This is a great  time for us to hire really outstanding people with a vision in certain areas  where we haven   t had it in the last few years. So we   re at a very  important step right now.  And having that new building. I mean, faculty members are, particularly  young faculty members, like everybody else, they want to move into a  new building and have nice offices and that would be important. So  we   re really behind in keeping up with facilities  like our peer  universities .  26  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Following up on some of your comments, what are some of the things  that you think the college needs to do in the next three to five years? Ten  years?  Back to the same point. They need to hire the 35  that   s leaving. They  need to get some really outstanding faculty in those positions, and some  people who not only have great research but great leadership abilities to  lead in finance and marketing and management and some of those other  areas. In the future when the existing people are exiting, somebody else  can follow up and come right behind us. You need somebody who is a  young faculty member that you can develop to take over and keep that  momentum going. A new building is a critical thing. The Tulsa program,  by the way, the former dean of the business school who went there, that  program is a vital part of what we do on this campus, the main campus  because their MBA program is growing. A lot of the executives are  going to that program. It   s very well received in the Tulsa market. And  that program will continue to grow with maybe faster momentum than it  does on this campus. So that would have to be something that would be  identified not only as a major accomplishment but something that   s  really meeting the needs of Oklahomans in a better way.  Our doctoral  programs really help too as we send out professors who recommend us.   What, over the years, have been the strengths, the core values of the  college?  Well, I think a few people, unconsciously maybe, they were thinking of  their own area, but they did and they were role models for other people.  And primarily that is to be able to relate to the business community. So  what we were doing particularly in accounting and marketing, maybe in  banking, IT or MIS, they were trying to prepare students to do well in  industry. which I think is an important value. We   re not just trying to  train you to memorize something and regurgitate it back on a test. We  want to train you so when you   re in industry you   ll be able to make good  decisions. That   s why people are disappointed when they see somebody  who   s in the White House who has a MBA from Harvard. You say you  should have made a lot better decisions than that because an MBA is  supposed to be able to make good decisions.  And you should be able to make more money. (Laughs)  Exactly. So I think a core value is training people, educating people,  instilling in people holistic view points. We would like for students to  have an appreciation for arts and music, sports. So we have sports  management program, we have arts management program. We don   t  want a person to leave and say,    Well I don   t appreciate the other things,  just my little field.    And on the other hand we   re not trying to train sales  27  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  people, we   re trying to train managers and executives. That   s why we   re  increasingly looking for great internship programs. We   re increasingly  look for scholarship programs and we   re increasingly looking for  programs that will internationalize the students. Don   t just put your  blinders on and think you   re going to stay right here in Oklahoma. And  most of our students, in fact, don   t.  How important in going forward is the international component to  education?  Well, I agree with the Provost. We should have every student before  they graduate have some experience overseas. Ideally it would be an  internship program. Many of the students we have in marketing were  interested in international marketing. In fact one of our graduates from  OSU is the department head of the graduate program of the University  of South Carolina International Program. Some place along the way,  they were instilled in the importance of internationalism. But it   s really  critical.  As never before, we are more involved overseas, like my own son. I  adopted a little boy, six years old, when I lived in China as a Fulbright  Professor. Well, where is he today? He graduated in marketing from  OSU, of course. He had no choice on that, and then he attended  Thunderbird on the internet. And now he and his wife are living in  China running a corporation. It   s a strange world where one time you   re  here, or in Atlanta as he was for six years with Simmons Bedding  Company as part of their Eastern Hemisphere management program. But  now he   s back over in China running companies. That   s what we   d like  to see. We don   t want to see them just get a small job and a small  company and just stay there. We want them to have at least a vision to  do greater things than that.  Well Bob, reflecting back on your career, what have been some special  memories, special moments for you?  Well, you know a lot of things happen in 40 years. The night   I told you  about the man who committed suicide. That really impacts you. And  later on that night, just as we were having the banquet, someone came up  to me and said it   s just been announced that Martin Luther King, Jr. was  assassinated. I remember going into the business banquet and, we waited  until it went through the whole process, and at the end walking up and  saying we have a major announcement that tonight Martin Luther King,  Jr. was assassinated. Had nothing to do really with the University but it  was a very significant event that had occurred.  Of course, I   m not a great sports person, but I have a great love for  28  Gill  Hamm  Charlie Weatherby who was quarterback when we beat OU. You have to  throw that in the mix some place, that we   re always glad when we beat  OU in football even though it doesn   t happen often. I mean, I think  everybody has that enthusiasm.  The day a student comes in   I remember this gal, she came in and she  said,    I think I really want to be an airline stewardess.    I said,    Well  why don   t you contact the airline and tell them? Why are you telling  me?    And she said,    I don   t know how to do it.    I said,    Well, let   s get  out the phone book.    So we got out the phone book and found American  Airlines and we called them and asked them how do we apply for a job  there and they told us. She applied for the job and she came in a couple  of weeks later and put her arms around me and kissed me on the cheek.  She said,    Dr. Hamm, I got the job as an airline stewardess.    Well, you  know, those moments you don   t forget very much when your doctoral  student comes in and says,    Hey guess what, I got a job with Memphis  State University,    like Lee Manzer did. Or Tom Brown called me from  California and said,    I   ve just been named dean at a university in  California.    Well, those are great moments.  Lee Manzer was one of your students?  Lee Manzer, unfortunately, was a student of mine too. Stole a lot of my  better jokes I must say. I told him I   d never let him have a copy of my  book because he   d just steal my stories out of there. I love Lee, he   s a  great guy. But many of the pleasures I   ve had here, I know this may  sound almost cheesy, but for years at graduation, I stood at the bottom of  the steps so as a student came across they came down the steps. Well, if  they needed some support well I   d put my hand out. And I got, I don   t  know how many hugs over the years from the girl students. I thought,  you can   t replace that feeling. You know, when a guy comes in your  office and says   Rob Reynolds, for example. His father-in-law was  general at Tinker Field. He said,    I want you to come and read this  scripture at my wedding.    Well, how do you put a price on that? You  can   t. And now 27 years later, they come by your house with their  teenage children and say,    Hey I want you to meet the professor we had  in school.    There   s no value you can put on that. It   s just unbelievable.  Priceless, as they say in advertisement.  Most of the highlights in my life are not the highlights in my life as  much as the highlights in somebody else   s life that I feel like a part.  Senator Nichols, I remember, he was at a banquet I was at one night.  And he said I   d like to talk to you   or his aide came over and said  Senator Nichols wants to talk to you. I thought, oh he probably wants me  to go to Washington and help him, you know my ego. (Laughs) So he  and I go and get a cup of coffee together. He says,    You know,  29  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Professor, I never did really thank you for helping me in college.    Of  course, I don   t even remember helping him. But you know, when you  help people who are U.S. Senators, there is just a good feeling about  that.  I think one of the highlights of course is, academically, getting the Ph.D.  program here. I worked on that for a couple of years before we were  ever even able to get that approved. That   s something that goes on today  and a hundred years into the future. For me, the outreach program  starting at getting it to move, accepted by the business community and  Oklahoma, I think is a phenomenal achievement for our group that did  that. But it   s also something that   s going to continue on forever. Of  course, one of the biggest highlights for me personally was the  250,000  scholarship they established in my name for retirement. And then later  on being inducted into the Oklahoma Higher Education Hall of Fame  was a major thrill for me.  How about some of your recognition? Redskin, the student yearbook,  recognized you as a Distinguished Professor of the Year, Teacher of the  Year. You had several college departmental recognitions and then your  recognition or awards for different organizations. Have those been  special for you?  Yeah, I know it   s wonderful. Even after I retired and I came back and  they asked me to be a Blue Key advisor again, I think it was my third  time. They nominated me for the Outstanding Advisor of the Year and I  got that award at the national convention. You know, you have to be  really careful as a professor, you   re going to get criticized. You look at  Ratemyprofessor.com, for example, you have students who don   t rate  you very high. But then out here, you get these great accolades for  Distinguished Alum or National Advisor of the Year. I was National  International Faculty of the Year for somebody who works with  international students without that being part of their job, just as a  faculty member.  Those are nice things and uplifting but there is also criticism. But you   ve  got to level that and stay in between the fence post here because you get  to thinking too highly of yourself. I think that   s a potential danger as a  faculty member. It   s great to have those honors. You have to remember,  it   s your job. It   s your job to train students, to help students, to educate  students, mentor students. Of course, if you do that, you   re going to get  accolades. If you don   t do a good job you   re not going to get those. I just  always thought you need to have a really good understanding of who  you are. But, it   s nice to have rewards, too.  It is. Bob, part of your   to use the phrase    true north,    I mean your  30  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  spiritually. Do you care to share how some of that has affected your life  and your career?  Well, I think when you grow up and you go to Sunday school class  particularly, you don   t realize how much it is affecting your philosophy  of life. I always said that Jesus was the most outstanding teacher that  ever lived. And how did he teach? He taught using parables, he taught  using stories, and he used examples. That doesn   t mean he didn   t give  you great concepts, or he didn   t give great instructions. Go and give all  you have to the poor and follow me   that was pretty direct. Of course,  the guy didn   t do it. But it seems to me you have to have that whole  gambit of teaching. You need to inspire the students to do that. And to  me, following that example would be the absolute highest priority that  you could not only accept his philosophy and his teaching but also to try  and live that kind of a life. I know one day after class was over one  semester and the grades were in, this student came up to me and he said,     You have something that I want.    And I go,    Is it my Mercedes or my  house?        My good looks?     Yeah, my good looks. That was never a question. He said,    Well you  have a contentment about you that I   d like to have.    I said,    Well, the  only thing I can tell you is that I feel contented because I feel that God is  going to look after me. He has and will in the future.    And he said,     Well, how did you find that?    So I shared that with him and he  eventually became a Christian and eventually became a minister. And I  introduced him to a girl who ended up becoming his wife. That was one  of those Christian high points.  When he was baptized, I remember I was there. I was upstairs and he  was in the locker room getting dressed for the baptism. This bird flew  down and sat in the window. I was sitting there looking at this bird and  he came out and I said,    God is rejoicing tonight because you   re  becoming a Christian. And he sent this bird as a sign.     This dove come down.  It wasn   t a dove, but it was just a bird sitting there chirping away. I  belong to Christian faculty group on campus, and I belong to that and  talk to them. In fact, when I was on Semester at Sea, I even gave  sermons on the ship. When I was in the MBA program, we had a group  of students who used to go out to small towns and I   d lead the singing.  Even though I can   t sing a note, I can wave my arm really good and  smile and I   d say,    Okay, let   s all sing Number 87.    (Laughter) That  worked out really well. That was one of the neatest spiritual experiences  31  Gill  Hamm  Gill  of my life.  I remember one night, we were in this little church. It was sort of like a  rectangle box. We were back in the back and we started to pray about  the service that night, as students. We were all students. We hoped that  people would come and listen, that was all we were trying to do. We  opened the door to go out there and that church was packed. People were  standing up looking through the windows. The guy got up and did his  thing and we had songs. And a guy got up and told what Christ meant to  him. It was one of my most spiritual moments of my entire life.  But I think students, I think they sense in you that you have a spiritual  dimension. Later on in life, I was a fellow at the University of Missouri  and my subject was spirituality in the workplace. So I   ve done some  research in that area, too. But my whole life has always been   this is  really terrible to say, politically incorrect. I remember when I first went  out on dates and driving my parent   s car. My mother said to me,     Remember, Jesus is riding in the back seat.    I said,    Well, it   s going to  get awful crowded with three of us back there     (Laughter) She didn   t  think that was very funny. But the lifestyle that we had seemed like we  were supposed to do that.  And then my son, Kevin, eventually after he was here several years, he  was I think fourteen, and one day he came in to me and he said,    Dad, I  want to become a Christian.    I said,    Really? Why?    He says,    Well,  because of the way you have instructed me and the way all of your  friends are. I want to be like them and what do they have?    That was a  major Christian event in my life. But I don   t think you need to go and  make a big announcement,    Hey I   m a Christian    or I   m this or not. And  Bob Kamm, who was a major influence in my life here, he said to me     we had some Muslim students here, and he said they wanted to have a  place to pray. He said,    I told them there was a place in the Library, a  room they could go in and pray.    And he said,    You know, you should  always let everybody have their place to express their spirituality.    You  know, not in a march or all this other stuff. We used to have Religious  Emphasis Week on campus.  I remember that.  A long time ago. I can still tell you, an astrophysicist came and shared  his faith one time. And I still remember, gosh this guy   s an  astrophysicist and a Christian. So it   s always been a very important part  of my life. And particularly selecting your friends. You know, I think  you have to be careful with who your friends are.  What do you feel has been your legacy here at OSU?  32  Hamm  Well, besides the scholarships, I think   I was at Sam   s Club Sunday  afternoon and I ran into a lawyer in Edmond and he said,    Gosh, I am so  glad to see you.    He was one of my former students. He said,    You  know, you don   t realize how many students that you   ve had that still talk  about you.    I said,    Well, I appreciate that.    He said,    No I   m serious.  Do you know what your legacy is?    I said,    No.    And he said,    Making  people think.    I   ve thought about that a lot in the last few days. I  thought, you know,    If you can make people think, is this the right thing  to do? Is this the best I could do? Is this the right solution for, like the  Bob Kamm situation? Is that the best solution for everybody concerned?  Does it hurt anybody that they   re over here praying? No. Would it hurt if  we had rallies against that?    Yes. I mean, that   s what I   m talking about.  For example, when I was in China. I went there primarily to help start an  MBA program (which by the way recently was selected as the  outstanding MBA program in China). I   d been there like three or four  weeks and I had two groups. One was eleven students who were older  and they wanted to be faculty members. Then I had 40 students in a  class. And so the dean came over to my apartment one night with the  administrative team. He said,    Professor, we have some problems with  you.    And I said,    Okay, let   s talk about them.    Because I   m very  confident, not embarrassed to talk about problems. He said,    You may  not know this but we have somebody in your class who checks on your  class.    I said,    Yes, I know this. The guy sits on the far left.    And he  said,    Yes, he   s complaining that you don   t write on the blackboard  every word you say, and then you ask the students to tell you what you  said on the blackboard.    I said,    Yes, that   s true. What   s the problem  here?       Well, in the Chinese culture we write everything down and the  students tell us back what we told them.    I said,    Well, I   m not teaching  that way. I   m teaching people to think.     So you put the concept   and I said,    Over the centuries of education,  there   s been a lot of lies told. The earth is flat is one of them. And we   ve  learned since then that the earth is round.    I said,    We cannot stifle  education to occur by telling people this is the way it is. You have to say  this is what we know right now, you might come up with a better  solution or a better answer than that. And that   s while I   m here. Maybe  the way you   re marketing your product right now is wrong, and you  need to do a better job of this.     And I said,    Let me give you an example. A guy came and saw me the  other day, he went to New York, a Chinese guy worked for a trade  company, and he came back and he said    I didn   t sell one towel, I didn   t  sell one sheet.    And I said,    Well, do you have an example?    So he  pulled it out of the suitcase and said,    Here   s the towel we   re trying to  sell.       I said,    It was ugly, it wasn   t pretty or anything. It wasn   t heavy,  33  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Hamm  it wasn   t thick. And I took it and I just tore it apart. And I said,    This is  why your towels aren   t selling. It   s too thin. It   s okay for this culture,  but not the American culture. It   s not tasteful, it   s not pretty. It   s got to  be nice and fluffy. It needs to be big because they have bigger bodies  and everything.       I said,    You know, that guy didn   t think. All he  remembered is, I can make this, and I want sell this. He didn   t ask the  question,    What do they want so I can sell them that?        I was really rude, and I said,    How many teaching awards have you  won?    He said,    Well, we don   t have teaching awards.    I said,    Well,  I   ve earned a whole bunch of them. So I would advise you to let the  students find out how this works.    So at the end of the semester, the  dean comes back and he says,    You know what, you   re right. The  students love the way you teach. Now they   re thinking, but they   re more  critical.    And I said,    Oh, critical is a good word in education.  Not in their culture.  He said,    We   ve decided that we want you to teach all the faculty  members how to teach.    (Laughter) I said,    No, I am not going to do  that.    He said,    Why not?    And I said,    Because the faculty don   t want  to be taught how to teach differently, so I   m not going to do it.     Well Bob, maybe one last question. How do you hope people remember  Bob Hamm?  Well, I hope they remember that we cared about them. I hope they  remember that we had a purpose and our purpose was to make them not  only a business person but a spiritual person, a person of high quality.  Now I think that   s always one of my goals   sometimes we were  misunderstood, I think. People say,    Well, you were too hard on me.     Somebody else probably would say you   re too easy. But I always try to  figure out what do they need to make them better. Do they need to be  encouraged? Do they need to be chewed out? What do they need? And  that   s what I try to relate to them. What do they need in order to make  them better? To move forward? I think that was my major goal in life.  And I think in general I feel very, very comfortable that for a lot of  people that worked out that way. And you know   Christmas as it is the  season now when you get several hundred Christmas cards from people  you don   t see very often. They always write little notes in there.    Thanks  for making me take that course,    or    Thanks for chewing me out that  time.     I   ll give you an example. This guy, I   ve never been able to tell this story  before because I   d get in trouble. There was a banker I   d worked for. His  son was here and he said,    I want you to look after him.    Well, I never  34  got around to meeting him. I was in church one Sunday and I had my  arm on the pew. I was sitting there and had my Bible in the pew and it  turned out his son was sitting right by me and his girlfriend. I shouldn   t  be telling you this story, of course, but anyway the guy was on crutches.  He   d broken his leg skiing. We would stand up to sing and he looked  down at my bible that had my name on it. So as he was leaving, he said  to his girlfriend,    Did you see he was wearing a Rolex watch?    He said,     He   s probably not a professor.    She said,    Yeah, but what was his  name?    He said,    I saw it, Bob Hamm was on his bible.     We got out and I got in my Mercedes. He said,    That guy   s driving a  Mercedes, he can   t be a professor.    The next day, I was in the business  building and here he came on his crutches. And he said,    Oh, we saw  you in church yesterday.    I said,    Oh yeah, I remember you were on  crutches.    And he said,    Will you be my advisor? I want someone  successful to be my advisor.    I said,    Well what are you majoring in?     And he said,    Marketing.    I said,    Okay.    So then he told me who he  was and I said,    Is your dad a banker? Well, I was supposed to meet you  anyway.    (Laughter) Well, anyway, I had an apartment for rent, an  apartment in town that I   d purchased because I was afraid we couldn   t  live on our retirement   that turned to be true. (Laughter)  But anyway he lived in this apartment, and his girlfriend got pregnant.  So he came up to my office one day and he said,    Do you know my  girlfriend   s pregnant?    And I said,    No, I didn   t know that.    And he  said,    But I   m not going to marry her. I   ve got another girlfriend now.    I  just reached over and I popped him and said,    You ought to be ashamed  of yourself.    Of course, you   d get fired for doing that today. Probably  would have gotten fired then, too. Fortunately he didn   t tell anybody.  And I said,    I   m ashamed of you.    I said,    You know, you   re not acting  like I want you to act. Your girlfriend   s pregnant, and now you   re over  there sleeping with some other girl in our apartments.    I said,    You  know, you   re an embarrassment to me.    And so he left. A couple of days  later he came back and he said,    I thought   you   re right.     So school was out and they both moved back home to Bartlesville and  he decided after a while that they were going to get married. So they  went down to get married at the Justice of the Peace and it was too late.  So they headed to the hospital and had a little baby boy. On the way  back from the hospital they stopped at the Justice of the Peace and got  married. So later on, they had three more kids. Found God and have had  a great successful marriage with four kids. But every once in a while I   ll  see him, and every Christmas I always hear from him. He says,    Thanks  for popping me that day, you knocked sense into my head.    Well, how  much is that worth to you? And he   s told his children. Not the whole  story, but he   s telling his story.  35  Gill  Hamm  Gill  Rob Reynolds, who was Pistol Pete and one of my kids, he brought the  kids by and they said,    Dad, is this the guy you   re always talking  about?    I mean, that   s the legacy you   d like. You know, somebody said,     Hey, I had a great experience in college, this person mentored me and  son, I want you to meet him.    So when they get to heaven, I want them  to come and look me up.  Bob, is there anything we haven   t covered that you   d like to share with  the college?  I think you did a good job. One of the things that we would be remised  in if we didn   t talk about is perceptions of students today. You know,  what I see today we are much more selfish as students and faculty both.  We don   t have the interaction. We don   t advise students anymore, we  have professional advisors. A lot of the classes are dependent on   you  know you can go on the internet and find the professor   s lectures. So  you don   t have that opportunity to get to know students and to mentor  them and to advise them on internships and jobs or whatever. I see that  as a loss for both sides, for the faculty, as well as the students. And I  hope that somehow we will learn how to connect and have a relationship  with each other, because Oklahoma State University is built on  relationships. When I used to participate in the freshman week   first  week of school, and we   d have maybe 500 students at an event and I   d  go up and I   d say,    Howdy.    And they   d all start,    Howdy, howdy.     And I   d say,    No, I can   t hear you, say,    Howdy        And I   d get them  really, just really speaking, yelling out,    Howdy     That was always  called Howdy Week. I   d walk across campus and students would say,     Hey, howdy Bob        Howdy     I loved that. You know, I think we   re  missing that. I think Burns is a guy, I think, who could bring back some  of that    we do care about you    attitude. Well, thank you for letting me  do that.  I appreciate it.  -------  -------
