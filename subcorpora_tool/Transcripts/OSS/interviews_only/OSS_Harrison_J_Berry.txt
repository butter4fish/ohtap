 Gill. Today is March 18, 2010. I   m visiting with J.  Berry Harrison in his home in Fairfax, Oklahoma. This interview is for  the O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Berry, I appreciate you taking the time to visit with me today.  Jerry, I   m glad you   re here in the house today.  I know that your life has been steeped in Oklahoma State University  history. You have a strong historical background  on  both sides of the  family. Your parents have been prominent in the history and heritage of  Stillwater and the state of Oklahoma. Gosh, I   m thinking back, and  William Edward Berry, your great-grandfather, settled in the Indian  Territory in 1878. He was a successful cattleman, Indian trader,  businessman, and co-founder of Stillwater National Bank. Your  grandfather James E. Berry was president of Stillwater National Bank  and a five-term lieutenant governor of the State of Oklahoma. And, I  think an uncle of yours, William A. Berry, was Chief Justice of the  Supreme Court in the State of Oklahoma. So, you   ve got some good  roots here in Oklahoma.  I sure do.  Is this family legacy a source of pride to you?  Oh yes, yes. Our family has been real close, and I think our immediate  family   s close, but also cousins and aunts, uncles   we   re a close family.  I think that the family legacy goes way back, and we are a close family.  We had a big family reunion. I was trying to think of the year it was, but  we had it in Stillwater at a park. You went with your immediate family  group, and, actually, it was William Berry   s twelve kids all had a group  there. We all got together and took one big picture, and I think there was  something like 2,500 people at that.  5  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  How many?  Twenty-five hundred at the family reunion.  Wow  Mercy   It was quite a group, and everybody got along real well and enjoyed the  day.  That   s great. Your mother, Virginia, was the second, I think, of seven  children to James E. and Edwina Morrison Berry?  Yes.  She grew up in Stillwater in her home there on Duck Street?  Yes, 502 Duck.  Your grandparents were very special people. I know I   ve visited with  some folks that think very highly of them. Did you get a chance to spend  time with them growing up? Did you know them well?  Yes, I did. I used to   any vacation that I could, I would spend there at  the Berry house. My grandmother, particularly, in the evening in the  summer when I was there, we   d get in her car and we would go to a  watermelon stand. She loved watermelon. (Laughter) And it was like a  firecracker stand, but they   d had a horse trough in the middle of a square  with a cover over the top of the whole thing with seats around it. You  could sit there, and they   d cut a slice of watermelon and put it right in  the little counter and had a bench seat around it. You could sit there and  eat watermelon and visit. That was one of our special things to do, and  my grandfather would join us when he was home and could.  You mentioned your grandfather, the five-term lieutenant governor and  president of Stillwater National Bank for years, a very influential  individual. What do you remember about him as a grandfather?  Just his attitude, and he always had a nice smile anytime you   d see him.  When I was in college I   d go in the bank to cash a check or something,  and he   d be sitting in an office. It was down on South Main then. His  office was right just inside the door there on the right when you came in,  and he   d always see you and holler. He had trouble keeping all the  grandkids    names straight. (Laughter) Half the time he might call me by  another one, but then he would always think of which one I was and then  he would correct himself, but he always had a big smile. He was always  real friendly and motioned for you to come in and talk awhile, and was  6  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  always glad to see you.  I   d always heard in addition to being president, he was sort of the PR  guy for the bank. Like you said, his desk was close to the front where he  always wanted to greet people and meet them.  Yes, he did. He was like that, and when we would have our family get-togethers  on holidays at his house, he always sat at the head of the table  and visited and had quite a personality. I guess that   s why he was such a  good politician.  Did he have a good sense of humor?  Had a good sense of humor. He was pretty stern at times, but if you got  out of line, some of the little ones, he could speak gruffly to them, but  then he   d always have a good personality.  Do you remember some personality traits that he had? Some habits and  some things that you remember about him?  He was an avid reader. He and my grandmother loved to play gin  rummy. In their dining room, they had a bay window and a card table  right in front of that window. In the middle of the afternoon, if he came  home for a little while from the bank, they might start up a quick little  gin rummy game, or in the evening after dinner they might play gin  rummy. And you didn   t want to interrupt that if you were visiting, but  then he would go into his den and read after that and then go to bed. He  liked to get up early. He had honeybees. Loved honeybees and he took  care of them, and he   d bring in honeycombs. They always had honey  around, and in the morning for breakfast he   d have toast and honey.  Was that a family tradition? Did his father     I don   t know how that got started. But, I remember going into the  kitchen and he   d be sitting there at the kitchen table, and he   d have toast  and it was usually a raisin toast. My mother loved to make raisin bread,  and he used to have raisin toast and pour some honey on it.  I want to come back to your grandfather in a minute and talk about his  incredible career, but you mentioned your grandmother Edwina  Morrison Berry. I heard she was a pretty sharp lady. What do you  remember about her?  She was a very sharp lady. Just classy, well-mannered, and she liked for  you to be having good manners and good English. She would correct  you if you didn   t use correct English. (Laughter) I remember one year, I  7  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  had lace shoes on when I was visiting with them in the summer, my  regular visit, and I couldn   t keep my shoelaces tied. So, she took me to  town and bought me a pair of loafers and said,    Now, you wear those  and you won   t have to worry about tying those shoelaces.    But she had  just a really outgoing personality and just a friendly, warm smile, and  she was your typical grandmother. All the grandkids just loved her and I  think she loved them all. Never forgot a birthday of any of them and she  always knew all the grandkids    names. If twenty grandkids were there,  she knew them all and their birthdays and never failed to send a card or a  present on a birthday.  She was a pretty well-educated lady, too, wasn   t she?  Well-educated.  Graduated from Oklahoma State University, Oklahoma A M then, in  1908, I believe?  I think that   s right. I   m not sure about that date, but     Her family was a pretty influential family, the Morrisons, in the area?  Yes. Now, she had a sister, Virginia Murphy, and she was a well-educated  classy lady.  Were they related to the Murphys at the     Murphy was her husband   s name, and I   m not sure what kind of  business he was in.  The mercantile business there in Stillwater, Murphy   s Store, was that  theirs?  I don   t know. I don   t think so.  Back to your grandmother again, someone had indicated or heard that  she was almost a perfect politician   s wife, that she  had  a lot of teas  and entertained a lot of people. Is that right?  She could entertain. She had a nice house to entertain in and enjoyed  entertaining. Had enough help that she could entertain and be cordial to  all the people and still have everything that everyone needed. Even at the  family dinners that we would have, they were always fun for not only  the grownups but the kids, also.  She would plan some activities for the kids, then?  8  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Oh, yes. Yes.  We were talking earlier before we started the interview, and you said  you spent a lot of time in the summers, especially, there. Can you tell me  how     Summers, Christmas holidays, yes. My parents would put me on our  local   we called it the Doodlebug. It was just a three-passenger train  that ran from, I think, Kansas to somewhere in southern Oklahoma, but  it went through Fairfax, Pawnee, and then into Stillwater. The train went  right by the Yost Lake and then into the Stillwater Depot, and I would  ride that. My parents would put me on it here in Fairfax, and my  grandmother would meet me at the depot, take me off of it when I got  there. I started at a pretty young age going back and forth.  How old were you when you first made the trip?  I want to say I was probably six or seven.  Didn   t have any concern about you being on the train by yourself?  No, nobody was concerned about it. That   s probably about the age I was.  I did that quite a little bit.  How long did it take you to get there?  Oh, probably about two hours.  Was that pretty exciting for you?  Oh, yes  I enjoyed it. (Laughter) I got to see a lot of country.  You   d know the conductor?  You were always anxious to get there after a little while of riding on the  train. Then you started anticipating.  Did you have brothers and sisters that went with you?  No. I remember going by myself a lot, but I did have two sisters about  my age, and we would usually go by ourselves and stay. I don   t ever  remember going and staying with   I think my grandmother might have  had some rule that she didn   t want more than one or two kids at her  house at the same time to take care of.  Back to your granddad again, James Berry, did you ever help with any  9  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  of his campaigns?  Yes, I just kind of grew up campaigning with my parents. Our duty was  to keep signs out in this area as far north as Kansas and, of course, all  across the north part of Oklahoma, so I was aware of campaigning at a  pretty young age. It kind of continued clear up until I was almost  probably in high school.  Your job was primarily putting up signs and maintaining signs?  Putting up signs and maintaining them, and then we would have folders  or little cards to hand out. We   d do that on Main Street or different  towns around.  How far did you go, say, from Fairfax?  We would go all over Osage County and probably up into Tulsa County,  Washington County, and then we   d go west quite a ways.  Pawnee County?  And we   d go into Pawnee County.  Wow, so you covered quite a territory.  Yes.  You   d just load the signs up in the truck, put them up on the      In the car or truck. We would always take some of the handouts. When  we   d go through a city, we   d hand those out on Main Street and then put  the signs up where they   d let us.  What was one of the slogans you were telling me?  Always on the handouts it would have a picture of my granddad and  then it would say,    It   s Berry Picking Time    right underneath the sign.  (Laughter)  Did you ever observe any of his campaign appearances or speeches?  I did once, but I was young and there were so many people around that I  didn   t pay a whole lot of attention to that. I got more interested in it the  older I got and after I was grown and could think back at similar things.  Let   s see. You were born in    39?  10  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Yes.  And then your grandfather, his last year in office was in    52 or  something like that?  Yes.  Would you have been junior-high, high-school age when he was  lieutenant governor?  Yes. I think he went out of office in    55, wasn   t it?  Fifty-five, something like that. You started college in    57, so just right  before you went to college.  Yes.  Can you verify a story for me? I was talking to Sarah Jane Rogers, his  daughter, and she said that was it Cowboy Pink Williams that had beat  him in that last election, and said she took everything in her wardrobe  that had pink in it and threw it away. Does that sound like Edwina?  (Laughs)  Yes, that was it exactly. Now, then, I was in Boys State in    56 and our  speaker was the newly elected lieutenant governor, Cowboy Pink  Williams, spoke to our Boys State. I went up after and told him that I  was James E. Berry   s grandson. I shook hands with him and I  congratulated him on the victory. That   s pretty well confirmed when that  was.  I don   t think Edwina was that gracious. (Laughter)  No, she wasn   t. (Laughter) She wasn   t.  Do you remember what kind of campaigner your grandfather was?  He was a pretty strong campaigner. His idea was to shake hands with as  many people as he could and ask for their vote. He said the more people  you shake hands with, the better results you   re going to have in an  election.  So, he   d press the flesh and got out with the people?  Yes, he liked to do that.  He had a campaign caravan where he went around the state and     11  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Yes, he   d do that and then, of course, they had no television then, and I  don   t ever remember him doing many ads on television. A lot of paper  ads and a lot of signs and a lot of handshaking.  Did you ever go to his office in Oklahoma City at the Capitol?  No, I never did. I never did go to his office, but after I got there  as State  Senator , I saw lots of pictures he was in. He covered one hall where my  office was, all up and down, and I think I had a little resemblance with  his picture and mine. (Laughter)  You talked about earlier that you made a lot of family reunions,  specialty events, and Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc. Do some of the other  family members stick out in your mind that you remember? Aunts and  uncles, personalities that you remember?  Yes, my uncle Frank had a wonderful personality. After my grandfather  passed away, Uncle Frank took over at the bank as president. He also  helped organize activity at the Country Club, the new one out west of  town. Then, my uncle George had a wonderful personality. I enjoyed  being around both of them all the time. Also, my aunt, Sarah Jane. You  had the opportunity to visit with her and she   s just as warm and friendly.  Sarah Jane   s the kind that keeps up with your activity. She always kept, I  guess, summation of my activities through high school, college and  politics. She was always real interested in politics and could tell you  everything about every election. The whole family had a wonderful  personality and loved one another and loved to have you around. I think  that was the most outstanding thing about the Berry Family: the  warmness and their personalities.  Berry, what about your immediate family? We talked a little bit about  you and your parents and your sisters. Can you tell me a little about  your early life, where you grew up and some of your activities?  I was born half a block away from right here in an old makeshift hospital  that they called Hamel Hospital just a block east of here. We lived in the  country east of town three or four miles. I had two sisters and grew up in  that house out east of town. We had a great time mainly riding horses all  around the country out there. They were both older than I was, so they   d  bring some of their friends out occasionally and     You were on a farm?  They had a big ranch out east of town.  How large was their ranch at that time?  12  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  My father was partners early on with Gene Mullendore. That   s how my  dad moved to this county. Gene Mullendore had the ranch over at  Pawhuska. They called it the Little Chief Ranch out here close to  Fairfax, and he needed some cows for that ranch. He called my father  out in the Guymon panhandle area where my mother and father lived at  that time and said,    I want you to buy me some cows and send them  here.    Told him what kind he wanted and how many. Then, he called  back in a day or two and said,    Just come with them. I want you to  partner with me on them.    So, then my dad came with the cows and they  put them on the ranch out east of town, and he leased a place to live  from Lassley, an Indian that had some land and a house out by the  country club. We lived out there and he ran the cows with Gene for  several years. Started leasing up land around himself and running cattle,  and then he started buying cattle and sending them north to the feed lots.  We moved in here in 1944 and bought this house and moved in town  and then leased a place out north of town and ran cattle there.  He had a man that worked for him. I think he went to work for my dad  when I was born and worked for him until I think a senior in high  school. He retired, but I spent a lot of time working cattle with him and  doctoring cattle and building fence and doing all that the whole time.  You have got a lot of ranching, roping and riding in your background  don   t you?  I grew up, yes, working cattle all the time.  It was interesting. Your father, if I understand right, he actually was in  the Panhandle at that time?  He lived in Guymon.  He was in the ranching and cattle brokering business?  Yes. And he worked for the government. That was during the  Depression and he had to buy cattle for the government. They had a  program going, trying to shore up the economics of the cattle business,  so he did that. And then that   s when Gene Mullendore called and said,     I   d sure like you to come here and partner with me on these cattle.     Interesting. You grew up in that environment, spent a lot of time on the  ranch and     Spent a lot of time on the ranch, yes.  All the things that go along with ranching, that   s not as glamorous as it  13  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  seems, is it? (Laughter)  But it was a good life.  Can you tell me a little bit about your high school and community  activities?  I went to high school here in Fairfax. Played sports, was pretty good in  football. I graduated and had the opportunity to get recruited by some  schools around, OSU, OU, several other major colleges, and chose to go  to OSU.  Was that because you were influenced by your family on each side, all  the OSU alumni?  My father sat here when the coaches would come in from different  colleges and talk to me, and one time when Eddie Crowder  University  of Oklahoma assistant football coach  was here, my father thought I was  getting a little bit too interested in one of our local colleges, OU. After  Eddie Crowder left, he said,    Now, son, you can go anywhere you want  to go to school, but I don   t want you to go to OU.    (Laughter)  So, anywhere else you wanted to go, you could go.     Anywhere else you want to go would be fine with me.     Were you a lineman?  I was a lineman. I played at a line in high school and they had me out on  the end for a while. Then when I got to OSU, I was guarding tackle. I  had the opportunity to make All State. Played in the first All State game  in Tulsa.  And that was in fifty     Fifty-seven, yes. I met a guy named Pat Hutchins, and he was going to  OSU, so we lived together in Tulsa at the All State game and then lived  together at OSU. Then he lost a brother and dropped out of school, and I  moved in with a guy named Blanchard Reel that had an insurance  company after he graduated. We lived together for several years at OSU.  I want to pick up when you were at OSU, but I wanted to ask about your  mom and dad. What do you remember about your father   s personality?  My mom and dad had the best personality. They were fun people to be  around. I think about them every day now and how much fun they were  14  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  and how warm a personality they had. They got along well with  everyone and always had lots of people around. They socialized real  well and they were good parents. They encouraged us to associate with  kids our own age, and when my dad was a basketball player at OSU, or  A M College then, back in the early thirties, late twenties, he liked  sports. Really enjoyed football, so they would go to most of the football  games. I can remember as a pretty young child going to football games  with my dad, just to watch.  They always loved to have other children in the house, especially for  holidays. Right here in this room is where we always had all our holiday  meals, and we always had dinner together. We would talk over the  activities of the day growing up and that was always good.  Berry, you were talking about your dad. He played basketball at OSU?  Played basketball.  Did he come right before Mr. Iba?  Oh, yes. He was there. I think he started in    28, and I   m not sure who his  coach was  John Maulbetsch  but Bill Hiefel, I think, was one of the  players with him on the team, and I think Jack Baker   you remember  Jack Baker the football player?  Sure do.  Played football about the same time my dad was playing basketball  because he liked to go watch Jack Baker play football.  Jack was a tough guy, wasn   t he?  Yes, he was. (Laughter)  Berry, going back to your OSU experience, normally I   ll ask a question  like what influenced you to come to Oklahoma State, but I think I know  in this case, in addition to football, you had some pretty strong family  influence for Oklahoma State. You enrolled then in the fall of    57 at  Oklahoma State?  Yes.  What was your major?  My major was business administration and I had a minor in psychology.  Also, a minor in phys ed  physical education .  15  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  You   d been on campus before with your dad, but as a student what were  some of your early impressions of the campus and Stillwater?  I enjoyed the campus. I always thought it was just a beautiful campus.  My grandparents had their fiftieth wedding anniversary right there at the  Student Union. Had all the family in, had a big celebration, and so I got  to spend some time, before I became a student, there on the campus. My  dad was a Sigma Nu, so the Sigma Nu Fraternity was always something  that was on my mind, and I had the opportunity to go through Rush. I  lived in Cordell Hall with Moe Iba, Cecil Everly, several other boys  from Stillwater.  Did the athletes stay there in Cordell as opposed to Bennett Hall at that  time?  When you went through Rush, that   s where they had the boys going  through Rush was in Cordell.  Okay. I see.  But then the athletes all lived in Bennett Hall, and that   s where I had to  live even though I pledged Sigma Nu and was a Sigma Nu member then  after the Rush period. I always loved the OSU campus.  Did you have some favorite hangouts on campus?  Probably the Sigma Nu house, and the Student Union would be the place  that you   d hang out. You could always find a bridge game there on the  first floor of the Student Union or always dancing on the fourth floor.  The ballroom? The Starlight Terrace on the fourth floor, wasn   t it?  Yes, or you could find somebody to visit with in the Student Union or at  the Sigma Nu house. You had to go there on the weekends and clean  house when you were pledging, and then that became kind of a tradition  to go over on the weekends sometimes. But my roommate then,  Blanchard Reel, became a Sigma Nu, so we   d go together and it was a  long way to walk to class from Bennett Hall. We   d do that two or three  times a day. It was just a fun, fun place. Bennett Hall was nice and the  practice field and the field house.  Field house, the baseball     Yes. Of course, we had all the athletes in Bennett Hall all around our  rooms so there was always a lot of activity there and a lot of     16  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  What about the community? Were there some student hangouts? I mean,  Aggie B, Swim   s, what were the     Yes, you could go to the Aggie B, but mainly we just spent our time  right there on the campus. I know we   d go early for two-a-day football  practices, and after football practice when we were having two-a-days  and it was so hot, we would go by the fire station. They had a nice drug  store there. I can   t remember the name of it, but we   d hang out there and  drink some kind of cold lemonade or something and then go back to  Bennett Hall and get ready for the next practice that day.  Now, the head coach of your team at that time was     Cliff Spiegel.  You played on some pretty good teams.  Yes. My sophomore year, we had a good team. I can   t remember the  record, but it was something like eight and two maybe. We went to the  Bluegrass Bowl in Louisville, Kentucky, and defeated Florida State. It  was a cold, cold day. We had to play in Converse tennis shoes; I  remember that. It was really cold. The ground was just frozen solid and  then there weren   t that many fans in the stands it was so cold.  And some of the guys you played with, do you remember some of them?  Forrest Campbell was the outstanding player that game. I remember that.  And Jim Wood from Tonkawa, Jim Wiggins, Larry Randall, Don  Hampton. Dick Soergel was our quarterback. He had a good game.  That   s about all I can remember about that, but I can sure remember the  cold. (Laughs)  Are there any other student hangouts? Of course, as a student athlete  you didn   t have a lot of free time, but besides the Sigma Nu house, were  there any other organizations or activities you were involved in?  I played a little bit of intramural sports with Sigma Nus, and I was in  ROTC. Well, that would take up two years. I was in Air Force ROTC,  but did run for vice president of the freshman class. I was defeated by  one vote, and I didn   t get to vote, and my roommate didn   t because we  had class. Then, I had to go back to football practice and then the polls  were closed by the time I got out but    (Laughter)  Oh, so you and Blanchard cost you the election?  I think then I was living with a guy named Pat Hutchins, but a gentleman  17  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  named Dan Draper beat me, so     Pretty good politician  (Laughs)  Pretty good politician. (Laughs) He defeated me.  And that   s Dan Draper, Speaker of the House?  Yes, that   s who defeated me. (Laughter)  Good story  Did you accuse him of rigging the election? (Laughs)  Yes, I did. (Laughter)  Oh, mercy  Are there any favorite professors that you had, people you  remember, administrators that influenced you while you were there?  Yes, I took business law under Glen Laughlin, and I always enjoyed  him. Then, I had a speech teacher named Gil   I can   t remember his  name, but I just really enjoyed him. I had several. I thought most of our  professors really did a good job and taught you a lot.  Oliver Willham was president while you were there?  Yes.  And who was Dean of the College of Business?  When I was there it was   was it Zimmerman? Or was that later?  I don   t remember either. So, are there some favorite memories that you  think about your undergraduate years you were there, in addition to  football?  I think the overall activity at the Sigma Nu house was heavy on my  mind. They had the Frontier Ball. I went to that one time, and I had three  other cousins, Malinda Berry, Anita Arrington, and Judy Meyers were  all at the ball, so we all dressed western and had our picture made  together. That was one of the highlights and some of the extracurricular  activity. Then in Bennett Hall, you were at the field house all the time to  the basketball games. I knew all the basketball players and the wrestlers,  so we were supporting all of them anytime they were participating.  I guess, speaking of baseball, Toby Greene was the coach. Were they  national champions when you were there in    59?  18  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Toby Greene. Yes, they were, and they had some really outstanding  players.  You remember Joel Horlen pitched for them and then pitched for the  White Sox for several years.  Oh, yes. One of them that lived right by me was   well, I   ve forgotten  his name now, but he was an outstanding player and pitched. It   s been so  many years ago.  They had Horlen as their starter, and then they had, of course, the two  brothers, Don and     Well, Dick Soergel pitched.  Dick was in the main rotation.  Yes, and then of course Dick played basketball and football.  He did it all.  Yes, he did it all.  Some of your favorite memories are athletic events and things you did at  Sigma Nu and     Sigma Nu and then I dated a girl that was a Chi Omega, so we had a lot  of activities at the Chi Omega house. It just seemed like there was  always plenty of things to do.  You graduated, then, in    61?  Sixty-one is when I left, yes.  Can you share a little bit about your professional life and personal life  after you left Oklahoma State University?  After I left Oklahoma State, then we bought the ranch out west of town   Fairfax  and     And that was with your father?  My father and I were partners, and my brother came on then. He was  eight years younger, and after he got out of college he came on with us,  but we had a lot of work to do, getting the ranch ready to stock with  cattle. That was the main thing I did, and then we did some farming. Had  19  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  the wheat ground and had to work and put it in, and then we put cattle on  the wheat, so     Had some pasture land?  Had pasture land that we ran the cattle on, so there was always a lot of  work around the ranch, and I did that for a long time.  When you said you bought the ranch, that was a pretty good sized ranch  wasn   t it?  Yes, we had a good-sized ranch. The Huffacre family had the ranch, and  they were guys that grew up here in town. They didn   t really want the  ranch anymore, so we bought it from them and then I moved right out to  the ranch.  About how large was the ranch?  When we got it, it was about 6,000, 7,000 acres and then we added to it.  As the land around it came up for sale, we   d buy it. It   s still that size  today, and my brother and I have it now.  It was hard to ride across your ranch in one day, wasn   t it? It   s a pretty  good-sized ranch.  Yes, yes it was. It   s a nice-sized ranch and a good ranch. We had the  best grass on the grass part, and then the farm ground was right on the  bank of the Arkansas River, so it   s good farm ground. It used to flood  every now and then, but they put the dam in up above us at Kaw Lake,  so that kept it pretty well under control for flooding. But it   s a good  place.  Berry, have you had other business interests in your life other than just  the cattle and ranch business? I want to get to your political career in  just a minute, but in terms of your business and other things that you  did?  No, but they put me on the local conservation board, Osage  Conservation Board, and I served   I think I started out there in about  1975. Before that, I served as president of the Osage County OSU  Alumni for a year or two, I think right before Tex Bayough took over.  Was Murl Rogers alumni director at that time?  Yes, I think Murl Rogers was the director.  20  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  He was one of the most optimistic men I ever met in my life.  Sure was. Yes, he was fun to work with and I enjoyed Murl. And then  they put me on the conservation board and I served on our local board.  Then, they put me on the state board and I was elected president of the  state board for a couple of years before I went into politics. I did a lot of  work at the Capitol.  You were talking about some of the things that you had done in terms of  civic, and you mentioned that you   d also served on the school board?  Yes, I served on our local school board here in Fairfax for about five  years.  You served as the county Alumni Association chapter president. Did you  serve on the larger board, the national board, too?  No, no, I just served on our county board and enjoyed that. We had a  good group and it was well attended.  So, Tex took over     Tex Bayough took over, I think, after I went off. Tex did a great job.  Well, let me back up. I have to ask now, is there a story about how you  met Jackie? You said you didn   t meet her at OSU. That   s your wife.  I went after OSU to Northeastern to finish up and met her there. We  dated awhile and she was from Muskogee. I just said,    Well       I  proposed and we got married, and I moved her out of Muskogee to the  ranch. She never had lived in the country before but she really became  accustomed to  it . She had her degree in speech pathology and went  right to work here for the co-op, I guess, in Bartlesville that provided  speech therapy to different schools around in the county. She traveled  around and then she volunteered at the Opportunity Center in Ponca City  for retarded kids and just really fell in love with those kids and enjoyed  that.  She  always liked the country until I got into politics, and she  hated that I had to stay in Oklahoma City a lot. So, after that we moved  in here, but that   s a different story. There   s a lot leading up to that, but  we raised our son and daughter in the country.  There   s one son and one daughter, and their names are?  Berry Jr. and Tracy Lynn Harrison. They both went to OSU, got their  degrees. My son was a Sigma Nu, also.  21  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Did you tell Junior the same thing your dad told you? (Laughs)  You know, I guess he always knew that OSU was the only place he was  going to go. He grew up loving OSU.  Now, my understanding is he   s kind of taken over actual operations.  He   s running the ranch right now, yes.  And is Tracy involved with the family business in any way?  No. She got her degree in teaching. She left here and went to Dallas and  taught for fifteen years and then became a flight attendant for several  years. Then was married and divorced and moved back here to Fairfax.  She   s raising her two kids, a boy named Harrison and a daughter named  Jolie. Jolie   s in the first grade and Harrison   s in the fourth grade.  Does Berry Jr. have some kids?  He has two boys. One   s in the eighth grade and the other one   s at OSU  right now. He lives in the Sigma Nu house. He   s a sophomore this year  and just absolutely loves college and is doing a good job.  Great. So, we want to go back to your political career, Berry. What  influenced you to get involved in politics and run for office?  After I lived in the country and got into the conservation business and on  the conservation board, and then they elected me president of the State  Conservation Districts, that required me to do a lot of politicking. We  had to lobby the legislators a lot, so they thought that I was kind of a  natural at it and talked me into running for office.  What was the first office you ran for? The first position?  It was the Senate.  The Senate? So, you didn   t start with the House. You went straight to the  Senate?  Didn   t start with the House. We had a Senator that had been in office  about twenty years. They thought that we needed somebody that would  represent the county a little better than it had been represented, so they  talked me into running. I knew the gentleman pretty well but formed a  campaign committee and we got things rolling. I was fortunate enough  to be successful.  22  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Berry, what year was your first election?  That was in 1990. We campaigned about half of 1989, and I went in  office in    90 and served until 2006. Four terms.  How supportive was your mother? She had this in her blood; you  must   ve got it from her.  She was very supportive, my mom and dad both. And I remember on the  day that I was sworn into office, my son, his wife and my grandson who  was one year old then (Beau, the one who   s at OSU now) and my father  and mother all came to the Capitol and, of course, my wife and my kids,  to see me sworn in. My mom and dad enjoyed that day at the Capitol  very much. They talked to all the legislators that they could come in  contact with.  I   ve got to think that your mother, all the campaigns she sure must have  helped her father with, probably was good counsel for you.  Yes, she was and they did a lot of campaigning for me. They knew how  to do it and really, really helped our campaign team.  You already had a pretty good built-in campaign team there. (Laughs)  We did  (Laughs) We had a good, big family, so that always helps in the  campaign.  Did Sarah Jane help you out some?  Yes, she did  She really did. She knew a lot of people that were in the  Democrat Party. She worked for  George  Nigh for several years on his  campaigns. She knew exactly how to campaign and had a lot of advice  for me, and I had another cousin, Everett Berry in Pawnee, that had the  bank in Pawnee, was in my district, but he lived in Stillwater. He lived  out of my district, but his business was in my district, so I spent a lot of  time with him, and he gave me lots of advice. We had a good crew that  would keep up signs and had a crew that kept my ads in papers. I did a  lot of door knocking and Main Street handshaking.  Do you remember some of the issues of the campaign, some of your  campaign activities?  The main issue since my opponent had been in office for quite some  time was we needed change. That was one of the things I campaigned  on. We needed change in this area. Then, after I was elected, it became     experience counts.    (Laughter)  23  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  It wasn   t change anymore   But, of course, education is always an issue, economic development and  roads and highways. That was the main thing here. We pushed those  issues.  Roads and highways.  Highways and roads and county roads and county activity, but this  district was really pretty hard to campaign in because you had so many  cities and you had so many schools, one in every city. And then you had  four county seats with all the county officers that you had to campaign  and talk to and shake hands with, so it kept you busy just making the  rounds.  Was Jackie helpful in your campaign?  Jackie was a big help. She knew all of the education school teachers by  going to all the different communities around for her speech pathology  work and she was a big help. You get all of that. Of course, I had all of  her friends that were in education. Then, I had all the conservation  districts in each county and the district, and there are four district  directors in each district plus the employees of the district. Then, the  cattlemen pretty well supported me, so I had a pretty good basic  campaign crew. I think that was why I became successful in politics.  This ties right into that.  I was going to ask you, have you got some favorite campaign stories  you remember? So, you won that first campaign in    90, and you served  four four-year terms. Is that right? Sixteen years as a Senator?  Yes, sixteen years.  During that time, you   ve got to have had some great stories and  memories of some of your campaigns. Can you share some of those?  The one that is on my mind now   my last term, I had an opponent. I  was fortunate enough my middle two terms that I was unopposed, so I  didn   t have such a tough campaign. But the last one I had an opponent  and my wife became ill with a liver problem. We were going to  Minnesota for her routine checkups in this liver problem and they  discovered she had cancer in the liver. This was in August right before  the November election, and they told her that she was probably going to  have to have a liver transplant. Then, they said,    You have cancer in  your liver and it is bad. You need to go somewhere in a hurry. We can   t  do the transplant here, but we can send you to Mayo Clinic in  24  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Jacksonville, Florida, and we advise you to go right on now.    So, we left  Minnesota Mayo Clinic to Jacksonville Mayo Clinic. They had to do a  lot of examining to see that she did not have cancer anywhere else in her  body. After they were satisfied she did not, they put her on a transplant  list, and in a week   s time, she was transplanted. But, it took a couple of  months for her to recuperate.  So, from all of her operations and exams and treatments, we got back  here the day after the election. My crew that I had had in the past pretty  well carried the whole campaign for me. My grandson at the watch party  the night of the election   it was in Pawhuska and he would run over to  the election board office and get a tally on precincts coming in. He  would run back to the caf   where they were having the watch party right  across the street and call us in Jacksonville, Florida, and give us the  precinct numbers and the vote count. Finally he called and said,    You   re  successful. You   re elected.    But my grandson loved politics and he did  all that himself, and I think he was about a sophomore then in high  school. But we got home the day after the election and everybody had  prayed for us.  They were there  to welcome my wife home and then  congratulate me for being elected Senator again.  You had to feel good about that.  Yes. We were really appreciative of the people here in this district.  You had two terms where you were unopposed by your party or also in  the general?  In the general.  You had two terms where you had no opposition at all?  The first time I ran, I had a primary and a general election, and then the  next two times I ran I was unopposed, and then the last time I ran I had a  general election opponent.  With all those years, you must have some favorite campaign stories. Are  there some humorous stories that you remember?  Oh, I   ll tell you, I had one lady that was over by Keystone Lake that  used to call   she had a convenience store and had a big residential  development. She called quite often wanting advice or help with some  red tape to do something with her residential development, but she  called one night frantic and said,    Berry, they just killed a man right here  in my front door and he   s rolled right into my business     And I said,     Maybe you better not call me  You need to call the sheriff     (Laughter)  25  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  She must   ve thought you could get things done   I think she did  That was one of the shock phone calls that I   ve had, but I  had people from all around the district that would call and request some  things. One wanted me to get him a lawyer for a divorce, (Laughter) and  you just almost become a caretaker for the whole district, which that   s  what I wanted. I wanted to tell any of them that I could all the time.  That   s a great tribute, though, to you, to have a personal relationship, a  connection you   d made with the people.  It is. I enjoyed the activity and I enjoyed the people. Every year, we  always went to the Ralston Labor Day homecoming activity. I would go  to some of the farmers around that raised watermelon and get a pickup-load  of watermelon and ice them down. My son and his daughter and my  grandsons and my wife and I would slice watermelon a whole day at  Labor Day and pass them out, just give them out at the Ralston activity,  and that   s where you got a lot of advice on what to do and heard a lot of  people   s problems.  Some of them, probably, it was difficult to keep from rolling your eyes,  I   m sure.  Yes, it was. It was always 115 degrees on that pavement, passing out  those watermelons.  A hundred and fifteen in the shade, and it wasn   t in the shade.  Wasn   t in the shade. (Laughter)  Looking at the Capitol, did you have some leadership positions you were  involved in? Could you share a little bit about your role in the party?  I was a Democrat and we had a majority in the Senate and House at that  time. You did have an opportunity to pass a lot of bills, and I ran quite a  bit of legislation and was successful in getting most of it through. I  helped, just off the top of my head, a lot in transplanting, the  organization in Oklahoma and promoting it and really setting it up.  For organ transplants?  For all organ transplants and one girl comes to mind. The governor and  myself and a lot of transplants up to that point   I can   t remember what  year it was, but this young lady got killed in a rodeo. A horse fell on her  while she was running the barrels, but her mother agreed to let all the  organs that she could possibly let be transplanted, let the daughter  26  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  donate them. She had signed her pledge to donate her organs on her  license. But, anyhow, the governor brought into the Capitol to his office  everyone that an organ from this young lady went to to save their life or  to improve their life. We had a whole office full of people that this girl  helped by her donations of her organs. And her mother stood there the  whole time with her picture, congratulated all of the people that this girl  had helped, and that was probably the most touching thing I   ve ever seen  at the Capitol. Of course, there   s so many things that happened at the  Capitol.  Are there some other issues that were high priority for you, some  legislation that you helped pass?  Education was a big one. I helped a lot in education.  House Bill  1017  had just passed and I didn   t have the time to go back my last term. It   s  been almost six years ago, so I   ve forgotten a lot of things. But I had a  lot of activity or legislation in agriculture, a lot in education, a lot in the  water resources board on groundwater in Oklahoma or lake water, a lot  of legislation in conservation, and I did a lot on the Appropriations  Committee. I was, one year, vice chairman of the Transportation  Committee and did a lot on roads. When you get to be chairman or vice  chair of a committee, then you get a lot of help. Whatever that  committee pertains to in your local area, you get a lot of help to bring  back to your local area.  Over the years, I served mainly on the Economic Development  Committee, would do a lot to promote that and ran a lot of bills to help  with the economic development and kind of served on the Economic  Development Committee the whole time I was there. Education the  whole time I was there, transportation the whole time I was there. But  that was just really quite an experience. It   s one of the things that   s  probably more educational than anything you can do. It   s like every  evening   we start out the session every year filing several thousand  bills, and you   re constantly reading bills to see what   s in them that will  benefit you, what   s in them that you might not like. It   s just like a  college course. You   re studying bills all the time and that   s the main  thing, but it was quite an experience. I   m proud to have had the  opportunity to serve like that.  Were there some principles and priorities of yours that guided and  defined your political life?  It was always my political ambition to really be there for the people. I  thought, and I still think, that all politicians ought to be there to make  life as easy for the people in your district as you can. There   s a lot of red  tape in our world today. There   s a lot of things that people don   t  27  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  understand, but if you   re there to help them with everyday living, your  taxes, your income tax, your property tax, your insurances, your motor  vehicle registration and licensing, there   s just so many things that a lot  of people need help with and shorten the length of time it takes to do  anything with it. I was there for the people was the main thing and to try  to help them in their everyday life, help educate our kids to make jobs  available for the kids and try to encourage them to further their  education as far as they could and then help provide a good job for them  when they got out.  You were very supportive of higher education as well?  Very supportive of higher education. I knew the benefit of higher  education and how important it is for all kids. If it   s not anything else  besides technical training, it   s really all higher education and they need  that to secure a good job when they reach adulthood, and that always  promotes good families after they get out of college. Get a good job and  then their family   they   re going to see that they do the same thing, so it  helps to rotate our standard of living, I think.  Berry, were there some people or personalities either in the Senate,  House, governor or staff that come to your mind that you think about  during your sixteen years there?  I think the one that I probably enjoyed was Senator Gene Stipe. He  could entertain. When we were running lots of bills and things got kind  of testy and people ran out of patience, he always knew how to step in  and either start a little filibuster or do some debating. He might debate a  bill, promoting it for a while, and then somebody would say,    Now, that  isn   t the way you voted last time.    And he   d say,    Well, I was just  telling you the good things about it and now I   ll tell you the bad things  about it.    (Laughter) And he could turn around and start the other way,  but he could change the mood of the Senate when we were in session  real quickly. He   d keep everybody kind of motivated and going on a  long afternoon or an evening when you had to stay late.  Which governors did you serve under?  I served under  Henry  Bellmon, then  David  Walters and then   who  was the last one? Bellmon was in office when I first went in, and then  Walters took over and then  Frank Keating  and then Brad Henry. I  served with him in the Senate, and he was elected just before I went out  of office.  Which one did you enjoy the most? Have the most respect for?  28  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  You know, I liked them all. Nigh was a good governor and he could go  either way. He was big on education. He didn   t try to run down political  lines. He   d step over the line and help you. He looked at the issues and  then decided if they were good or bad. He didn   t look at politics and see  what party. Walters was really intelligent, did a good job. I liked  Walters. Keating did a good job. I probably enjoyed Walters and  Bellmon the best. I think Brad Henry has done an excellent job and did a  good job in the Senate while he was in there.  You have strong historical family ties, as we talked about, with OSU.  Are these connections a source of pride for you? Do you have strong  feelings about that?  Oh, yes. I just look at the things that my family has accomplished. The  four kids, my grandfather and his two sisters and his brother   Dora,  Jenny, Tom, and Jim Berry   those four children went out on their own,  and my great aunt, Jenny, went to Cleveland and married a Mullendore.  My grandfather   s sister, Dora, went to Blackwell and married a Goodson  and they started the bank, had a big ranch/farm in the Blackwell area.  Is that the family that Larry Cannon married into?  Larry Cannon, yes. Joe Berry Cannon. And then, Tom Berry had the  Berry Oil Company and they were just all quite successful people. I  always remember my grandfather, James E. Berry, would go   we would  have activities over at Blackwell. He loved Dora Goodson, his sister.  They could sit and visit, in a whole room full of people, to each other.  They would not get a foot away from each other and just visit. You  could tell they thought so much of each other, and I always marveled at  how close they were. I always liked to see that. I always admired the  family and what they had accomplished and the kind of people they  were, the family people and what they all accomplished and lived by.  You think they left a pretty good legacy?  I think they left a good legacy, and the cousins that grew up under them  have all been great people, good people, and I   ve enjoyed them. It   s  always a pleasure to run into them no matter where you are. The  family   s so scattered out that you hit the opportunity to run into cousins  about everywhere you go.  It   s  just always fun to see them, and they   re  always great people that have such good personalities, and it   s an honor  to be part of their family.  How has that legacy, you think, influenced your life?  I see the kind of life they   ve lived and it just makes you want to do that  29  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  and to treat people really the way you want people to treat you. And  that   s kind of the way they are. They always just   great personality,  glad to see you, honestly worried about you and how you   re doing and if  you have health problems. They   re all there for you. They   re just top-notch  people, and seeing that has made me try to run my life the same  way.  I have sort of a two part question in closing. One of them I meant to ask  earlier, but as you were growing up and around your parents and Berry  family members and Harrison family members, what values did you  learn that helped shape the rest of your life?  I think how to treat people, how to work hard to achieve what you want  to in life. Mainly, be an honest person and work hard and be good to  people. Treat people just exactly the way you would want to be treated.  That   s kind of the way I   ve always wanted to run my life and pass on to  my kids. Honesty and hard work will get you a lot of places, and treat  people with respect.  Looking back, you   ve done a lot of contributions publicly and in your  business and to the state through your political affiliation. How do you  hope people will remember J. Berry Harrison?  I hope that they can remember me as an honest hardworking person that  was here trying to do my best and leave a good legacy of life. I feel like  I   ve had the opportunity to do quite a few things and I   ve enjoyed it. I  appreciate it and I hope people look back and say,    He lived a good life.  He worked hard. He was honest,    and leave a pleasant feeling to them  about myself.  What do you want to do with the rest of your life? You got some  hobbies     Well, help my grandkids and my kids and take care of my wife and  family and enjoy what life I have left. And enjoy the bank work and  going to the country when I can and seeing the activities of my  grandkids. That   s what I   d like to do with the rest of my life.  You mentioned just a second ago about Stillwater National Bank. Of  course, the Berry Family has been involved in  it  for many, many years.  Are you on the board there? Are you still actively involved in the bank?  I   m still active on the board. I   ve been on about twelve, fifteen years,  and I enjoy the bank work and serving on the board of directors and  hope I get to for several more years. The bank is part of the family and  we keep expanding now. The bank has grown so much. We   re up to  3  30  Gill  Harrison  Gill  Harrison  billion in assets and we run from Kansas City, up and down I-35, all the  way to San Antonio, Texas, so we   re in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas  with branches everywhere. The bank   s doing wonderfully well and I  hope that it continues to do so. It   s provided a lot of help and is  promoting a lot of communities all through here. So, that   s what we  want, to keep it going in good shape.  Is there anything else that you recall about your family that we haven   t  talked about that perhaps I ought to ask or that you   d like to add while  we   re talking?  I think we pretty well talked about everything. I just can   t stress enough  how good my life has been. I   ve had wonderful parents, a wonderful  sister and brothers, wonderful kids and grandkids. I just have really  enjoyed the opportunities that I   ve had to go to a good college like OSU,  to participate in sports, to serve in politics. I appreciate the opportunities  I   ve had, and it   d just be nice if everybody had the opportunity to do  some of the things I   ve done. OSU has just been a wonderful place for  me to have memories of and still enjoy. You just get a thrill every time  you go back to the campus or the city, and the same way in politics. You  go to the Capitol and you get a good feeling about it. I appreciate the  opportunities I   ve had in life.  Berry, I appreciate you taking the time to visit with us, and  congratulations on a life well-lived.  Jerry, I appreciate you being here today.  -------  -------
