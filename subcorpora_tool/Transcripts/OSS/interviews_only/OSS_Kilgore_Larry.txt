 Neurohr  Kilgore  Today is June 5, 2008 and I   m in Chelsea, Oklahoma at McSpadden    Associates office building. My name is Karen Neurohr, and I   m with the  OSU Library in Stillwater. I   m here to interview some gentlemen for the  O-STATE Stories oral history project of the OSU Library, and right now  I   m going to interview Mr. Larry Kilgore. Mr. Kilgore, thank you for  coming today and participating in the interview.  My pleasure.  One of the things that I want to start with is to find out a little bit about  you and where you   re from originally. So, could you tell me a little bit  about that?  Well, from the beginning   actually, I was born in Tucson, Arizona  because my father had been diagnosed with tuberculosis, and the only  cure or hope for anyone who had the disease was to go to dry country.  So, my father was in Arizona.  We were there for him to recover  I was  born on April the 13, 1927. He was not cured but he was listed as an  arrested case of TB and able to go home. So, we moved out of Tucson,  Arizona when I was eight months old.  Needless to say, I remembered nothing. But, we moved to a farm in  southeast Missouri because my father needed fresh air, and he was not  able to have any difficult labor   work.  Daddy   s health kept him from  hard work but he had been told to get a lot of fresh air.  So, we had a  hired hand  a wonderful man, Floyd, who did all the work  and we also  had some livestock.  On the farm  we had horses, milk cows, hogs and  geese. The hogs were supposed to be the money making crop. The  depression hit at that time and we could not afford to even haul the hogs  to market. My mother raised a big garden so we had plenty to eat. And,  we struggled along there until Daddy came to Tulsa to work in his  sister   s husband   s store. And, we stayed on the farm    til I was five.  5  A hired hand looked after me about as much as my mother did, but my  mother was a very strict woman. So, she knew where I was at all times,  and mostly I was out at the barn. The hired hand used to set me on  Daddy   s old buggy horse while he did the chores in the barn. The old  horse was eating, and he knew I   d stay right there on that old horse.  But, we moved to Tulsa, and I didn   t like the city life at all. I went back  to Missouri every chance we had. And, I fussed about wanting a horse  my entire period of life, and when I was ten, well, my aunt finally  bought me a horse. And, then I had horse from then on. I spent all my  summers back in Missouri on the farm. We found a nice small mare in  Missouri. The first summer on the farm with a horse, I got my first job. I  was the water boy for a thrashing crew.  When we brought the horse to Tulsa, we boarded the horse at the  fairgrounds. Mom would take me to the fairgrounds after school. Daddy  would pick me up when he got off work. I spent all my spare time with  my horse. The farm in Missouri was in cotton country. The mare was  from that area. Small mules were really popular in cotton country. The  first spring she had a mare mule foal. We did not expect that. We bred  the mare to Bob Wills    horse, Pumpkin. We raised a good looking  Palomino colt. We went back to the farm the following summer and  found a four year old gelding for me. This gelding raised me. I learned  to rope on him and when it was time, I took him to college.  At the Tulsa fairgrounds there was an organization called the Tulsa  Mounted Troops organized for boys like me. And the boys roped calves,  and they rode some bucking horses that people would bring in for them  to ride. They were a bunch of city boys who wanted to be country boys  or cowboys. Some of    em were quite polished calf ropers and therefore,  I wanted to be one of    em. My father was a little reluctant for me to join  this organization because I was   I guess I was about thirteen at that  time, and these boys were from fifteen to twenty. Daddy wasn   t sure  that I ought to be playing around with a bunch of old teenagers.  One day I was sitting on my horse with my rope. I had been taught how  to tie the knots in my lariat rope and how to throw a lariat rope and I had  the lariat rope on my saddle, and I was watching these boys rope. One  of    em  Jess Ray  rode by after he had roped, and he said,    Do you want  to chase a calf?    And I said,    Yes     He said,    Well, come on back.     Well, his father was the rodeo announcer, and he put my name on the  roping list. So, I rode around behind the chutes, and they called my  name   the first time I   d ever heard it over a loudspeaker. And I chased  a calf, and I thought,    Boy, that was fun. I don   t know whether I could  rope one or not, but that was sure fun.    I had a horse that actually  followed the calf, but   and I don   t recall whether it was that week, but I  was considered a member. I was on the roping list every week, and it  6  wasn   t long    til I roped a calf. And I had no idea what to do about it.  (Laughs) I knew I was supposed to get off and throw him, but I didn   t  know how and I wasn   t all that big.  So this fella that had asked me first if I wanted to chase one, he jumps  over the fence, comes out, shows me how to throw the calf, and shows  me how to tie the calf. Needless to say, I had an idol in that gentleman.  After that, Daddy could not deny me the privilege of joining them. I felt  like they adopted me. The war came along shortly. I think I was fourteen  when the war started. And these boys, every one of them went into  service. Most of them sold their horses. I was in a very   I thought it  was a wonderful position because I still had a ropin    horse, and each  time any of them would come home on leave, we would rope someplace.  So, I got real close to all of    em.  Harold Emery was one of    em who comes up quite often in our  conversations. He was stationed in Monroe, Louisiana as a tower  operator at the airport   an Air Corps airport. He came home about  every six weeks and he was roping in Monroe, Louisiana all this time.  Harold would come home, and we would go to jackpot ropings. And as  time wore on, the war was still going on when I became eighteen and as  Clem  McSpadden  said, neither one of us wanted to get in the Army  because there was a lot of walkin   . So I joined the Navy. Well, I   ve  forgotten just when Germany gave up, but the Japanese part of it was  still going on when I joined. I went to boot camp at Great Lakes and  went overseas. I was going overseas the day Japan surrendered. I  thought,    Surely they won   t send me overseas now. The war   s over.     But, they did. We went on to the Philippines and I was assigned to a  gasoline tanker. I discovered there was reason for that. I relieved a man  on a ship who had been on that ship for five years. I really felt my  efforts were justified. So, I stayed over there for a little over eleven  months, and then discharged in    46   August of    46.  The girl I was in love with and had been since I was fifteen   which is  another story. But, I got a buggy for my fifteenth birthday. Well, I also  had a harness, and my horse worked well wherever I put him. I put the  harness on my horse and drove the buggy around. The summer that I  was fifteen, I was headed across town to take a girl for a buggy ride.  And one of my close friends was with me, and he said,    Do you mind  going a block out of our way here? I have a cousin who would really be  impressed with seeing this.       Ah, no, this old horse on this pavement     I   d hate to keep him on it all day.    But, I thought,    That won   t hurt  anything.    So, we went over by, and I met this cousin of my dear friend  and she was cuter than a bug. It was summertime. She was barefooted,  had on shorts, and, naturally, she wanted to go for a buggy ride. And, I  said,    Well, I   m headed over across town, and the pavement   s real hard  7  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  on my horse   s feet. If you want to ride a block or two down the street  with us, and if you want to walk back, well you certainly can do that.     That suited her, so she got in the buggy and was just enjoying it  immensely, and we went about three or four blocks. And I said,     Remember, I   m not going to take you back. You have to walk back.     She looked back over her shoulder, and thought,    Well, all right, this is  far enough.    So, she got out of the buggy and I remember looking over  my shoulder, and here   s this real cute girl running across the hot  pavement to the grass   across the driveway to the grass, across the  sidewalk to the grass. And, I thought,    That   s a sorry thing you done,  making that poor girl go home barefooted on that hot pavement.    But I  went on over.  Well, the girl I picked up in the buggy acted like she had been for a  buggy ride every day of her life. (Laughs) So, I didn   t take her but  about a half a mile, then I turned around and took her back home. I had  all this time to think about what I   d done to that cute girl going back  across town to the fairgrounds. The next day, I hustled back over to her  house to see if she thought it was as bad as I did. She thought nothing of  it. So she was really the first girl I was ever around that I was real  comfortable with. The next spring, I invited her to go to the rodeo   I  was roping. We went out to the rodeo and I roped. After the rodeo we  took care of the horse. We went to a restaurant and had something to eat  and I got her home about 1:30. Her mother was not happy about this at  all, so I had another big challenge   was to make this mother think I was  all right. And anyway, that   s the same girl  Patsy  that I married.  When I came home from service, she had me enrolled in school at  Stillwater. I had spent a year thinking, well, that I was gonna rodeo for a  year and then go to school. She had plans for me to go to school and she  had me enrolled. Between Patsy and the G.I. bill I have no choice but to  go to college. Naturally I loaded Old Prince in the trailer and loaded my  car with necessities. So, we went to school. I took my horse. I knew I  could keep him at the fairgrounds. Mr. Blue  the caretaker    I had been  to a rodeo at Stillwater before at the fairgrounds, and I knew I had a  place for the horse. I didn   t have a place to live, but I knew the horse  was all right. And, I don   t exactly remember where I slept the first night  while I was in Stillwater.  What year was this?     46.     46   okay.  I ran into a cowboy who was a bareback rider  Bob Berger  and he said  8  Neurohr  Kilgore  he had a room  rented  in a house and that I was certainly welcome to  stay with him. So, I did, for about a week. By then, a close friend of  mine  Ralph  who was also enrolled in school, we found us a room off  of 6th Street on a sleeping porch with bathroom privileges. And, of  course,    46 was a tough winter and, a sleeping porch was a cold  bedroom. We had to go through the house to the bathroom, and the two  of us remember, and we still talk about   we came in one night with  snow on our shoes, got up the next morning, and they were frozen to the  floor. The winter of 1946-1947 was a tough one after spending the last  winter in the tropics. Our children never really believed that our shoes  had frozen to the floor several times that winter. We were fortunate that  their driveway was on a slope which helped us start the old pre-war Ford  on cold mornings.  Oh.  So, we stayed there    til we pledged to the Sig  Sigma Alpha Epsilon   House, and then we lived in the SAE house for a semester. We roped  out at the fairgrounds. As Clem said, he brought two calves. Well, that  meant we had two calves that we might get to run once. Our practice  sessions were mostly at somebody   s jackpot at Yale, Perkins or  wherever there was an arena, and they were having a jackpot. Well, you  know, a fifty cent jackpot was our practice. It normally cost a dollar     cause whoever owned the calves got fifty cents of the dollar. So  anyway, this group   all of us wanted to rope, and either knew each  other or had known of each other for years before. But we started gluin     together, and then my memory of hearing about the rodeo at Cameron  College   the college rodeo. We knew that there were college rodeos  and college cowboys, but no one at OSU was very interested in having  college rodeo cowboys   not interested is not really severe enough.  They didn   t want it. We voted on who would be on the team. So, we  managed to go to this first one, and we managed to win the whole thing  against   I think the article said there were twelve other colleges there.  They all wound up to be pretty good cowboys. Some of them were in  the PRCA  Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association  or RCA  Real  Cowboy Association  or the  Cowboy  Turtles at that time.  the  professional cowboys named their organization    Turtles    because they  were so slow getting started .  We managed to get our roping   not out of our system, but to get to rope  and go to school. Anyway, that worked through the college years.  Harold and Clem left, Turner  Meadors  and Leo  Roberts  and I and  Bud Reger were still there. I would like to have Clem talk a little bit  more about Bud Reger because Bud Reger was kind of fascinating, and  he was from a rodeo family   that   s all his family knew. I don   t know  enough to talk about Bud, but he was capable of   he could rope, he  9  Neurohr  Kilgore  could bulldog, he could ride bareback horses, he could ride saddle  broncs, he could ride bulls   not a champion at any of them, but he could  handle all of them and actually make his living as being a rodeo clown.  Hmm.  Bud was the only one I had never heard of when we all got there. He  was from a total rodeo family and from Woodward, Oklahoma. His  father had announced Wild West shows back east and Bud worked all  five events in a rodeo and also trick rode. Bud made his living clowning  and fighting bulls. Both sisters were trick riders and ropers. None were  short on nerve. Bud was a good hand at every event. The only problem  being, you never knew what was going to come out of his mouth.  And, so, that was rather impressive, meeting Bud Reger, but he was also  very mouthy. And you weren   t ever sure what he was gonna say. And  Clem left out the part that was kind of interesting about this Cameron  Rodeo. We understood the more events you could enter, the more points  you could get. I don   t know why it didn   t dawn on us that you had to  win the events to get the points. But, we thought if five of us went, and  we all entered three events, we   d start out ahead of the game. Well, they  talked me and Leo into entering the bareback ride   which was really the  highlight of my experience there, other than I actually won a go-around,  and I won a second go-around in calf roping.  The highlight of the whole rodeo was when they put me on a bareback  horse, and I remember it as though it were yesterday. Dee Burke was  there, who was one of the Burke brothers  from Duncan, Oklahoma, all  very good ropers . Clyde was the world   s champion calf roper. Dee was  a good steer roper. Jigs was a good steer roper, and they were all  characters. Clyde was the sensible one. But, anyway, they lived at  Duncan. Dee was there helping at the chutes, and they put me on this  bareback horse, and they said,    Well, which hand do you ride with?    I  said,    I don   t know. Which one should I ride with?    And, so, one of    em  said,    Well, if you   re right handed, you ought to ride with your left to  keep your balance with your right.       Okay, I   ll ride with my left hand.     So they kept asking me questions   where   d I want the rigging?    Well, I  don   t know.    And, they asked me about eight questions, and I didn   t  know the answer. Finally they got down to the question,    Are you  ready?    And, Dee said,    Hell, he don   t know  Open the gate.     (Laughter) So, they opened the gate, and I made about one jump. I   m a  relaxed person anyway. I had a good hold, but nothing else was tight.  And, I wound up a good hand-hold of the rigging with my feet on the  horse   s rump. I knew this was a bad position, so I turned loose of my  hand-hold and did a flip and landed on my feet and thought, well, I  saved my life. So, that was the end of my bareback riding. (Laughs) I  don   t know. Generally, it was the friendship that was made.  10  Neurohr  Kilgore  Everybody placed either in the roping or bull dogging and Bud won part  of the bull riding. There were about 12 colleges represented and we won  more than any of them. We won the trophy and I won the All Around.  They called it the Outstanding Cowboy award. We were all elated.  However, we did not impress any of the    powers that be.    Our missed  classes were counted as cuts. Fifty years later the  Oklahoma  House of  Representatives honored us with a designated day and Dr. Halligan  excused all our absences.  You heard the stories   the rest of the stories. And, Turner and  Harold   well, see I can   t figure out which one I could consider one of  my closest friends, so I   ll just accept all of them. Leo was the nearest  one to my age, and then Harold was older, Clem was older, Bud was  older, Turner was a little older   Turner and I rodeo   d together because  we did not ever go professionally. We went to the small rodeos close to  home. And so Turner and I saw a lot of each other during the    50s. And  then, as I mentioned, I think   if I remember correctly   I was 29 when I  tied a calf in 10.3, and I was normally a fourteen to seventeen second  calf roper. I tied a calf in 10.3 and thought, by George, that   s the fastest  I ever tied a calf. I wound up with splitting a third, and that meant there  were several people who had tied as fast   or faster   than I had. And, I  thought, I   m not going to get any better than that.  I complained about getting old and turning 30. I had such a group of  close friends that they got tired of listening to me cry about gettin    old  and they, behind my back, planned and executed a funeral for my youth.  They had a policeman, who was a friend, escort them with the  procession. They had borrowed a casket from one of the funeral homes,  and they wore their black clothes and brought their folding chairs. And  the policeman sounded his siren, stopped in front of the house with the  light flashing   he runs up to the door, opens it, takes his hat off   and  I   m not there. He doesn   t speak. He doesn   t look. He looks straight  ahead. They came in the house   no one speaks to me. They open their  folding chairs and carry the casket in, then open the casket. Inside, they  had my boots, my hat, my lariat rope, a Playboy magazine, and they all  claim a little bit of horse manure   I don   t think there was. (Laughter)  And then they preached a sermon   we still have the sermon in the  scrapbook and, it was classic. They haven   t spoken to me yet. But I  never complained about my age.  Oh, that   s a good story. Well, let me hear a little bit more about your  years at Oklahoma A M College. Any professors stand out in your mind  that you had?  My first year, it was in animal husbandry and I felt like, that that   s what  I wanted. That   s what I   but there   s really no future unless I had a  11  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  ranch. Every pencil you could put on paper, you could not buy land and  cattle and make    em pay off. If you had a college education, you could  go to work for somebody. I didn   t think about the old established  ranches, but I also knew that I was gonna get married. I also knew that  my wife was not a country girl, and I better change schools. Two people  stand out in my mind, and Glen Bratcher was one of em   , the first one.  He referred to my ropin    horse as the Perchen  Percheron  (Laughs) in  the proper manner. He had a lot of fun with me, and he was the first one  that I knew.  My family was involved in the retail business and pawn brokerage. I  changed my major to general business. For the rest of    em that I had, Dr.  Sweringen, who wound up coming to Tulsa and being president of one  of the banks and a leading citizen here, he was the other excellent  professor that I had. And, the rest of it   s just kind of a blur. I was not a  good student. I did have an experience that was a little bit frightening. I  still hauled a horse back and forth when I went home. I remember one  time, I had the horse loaded in the trailer and the car loaded with the  wife and the child   this had to be    49. We were leaving, and a police  car drives up with a warrant for my arrest for a bad check. I had not  written a bad check, but that   s   no one ever has. And he said,    Well, I  tell you, can you go with me for a little while?    Or,    I   m asking you to  go with me.    I said,    Well, of course, we can straighten this out.    So,  he took me to the store, which was a furniture store and kind of an  antique store on 6th Street, east of Washington. Washington   s the north-south  street, isn   t it?  Mm-hmm.  And, the lady there   I remembered the name of the store for years   and  I walked in. He said,    Is this the man who gave you the check?    She  said,    No.    I could have kissed her. (Laughs) That lady went through  the yearbook and found the face and showed it to the man, and then they  had the person they were looking for. That was a little bit frightening.  It would be.  We were here in school when the hail storm destroyed all of the tile  roofs on all the buildings. I was returning home from practicing bull  dogging up at Red Rock. The hail tore up the canvas top on my trailer  and put dents all over my car.  We all pulled our trailers with automobiles. Trucks were not very  comfortable at that time. As I recall, they did not even have heaters. It  was in the early 1950s they started getting popular and more like a car.  12  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Did you ever try your hand in any other rodeo events besides that one  time?  No, I loved calf roping and bulldogging. Only other roping events were  wild cow milking and ribbon roping. They used a picture of Leo and me  wild cow milking for several years after we were gone. They put it on  the Block and Bridle rodeo program. A big old Hereford cow, I was  mugging and Leo was milking. I was a high school wrestler, and I felt  like that helped me with bulldogging, a leverage sort of thing.  Where did you go to high school?  Tulsa Central. I was third in the state championships, but I should have  been first.  What weight class did you wrestle?  That weight class for the state meet was 138. I had been wrestling 145,  and coach wanted me to go down a weight.  So was wrestling a big sport at OAMC when you were there?  I went over and it was a lot different than   Coach Griffith was different  than Coach Perry. Coach Perry was my high school coach. I came out  of the Navy   I jumped from my normal weight which was around 145  to 150. I came out of the Navy weighing 175. I had several high school  teammates in the wrestling program  at OSU . I went over and worked  out about three times with them and thought I   d rather rope calves. So,  that   s what we did. And you know, we think about that   roping calves  and how little we got to practice. These boys that are champions today,  they probably   some of them are roping fifty or a hundred head a day,  and we never had that much practice. I wanted you to ask Clem about  the goat roping. We went to Clem   s one time to gather goats to rope.  And, I think they had about fifty goats and there was a big bluff. They  were in the pasture by this bluff, and it was all brush. We started trying  to gather goats, and I think we got to the pen with maybe ten of    em.  But that didn   t bother us   all we wanted to do was rope.  Mr. McSpadden told the story about signing the form so that you all  could enter the Cameron Rodeo. Did you all have to do that several  times that way?  I understand   I   m either na  ve or they tried to keep the truth from me. I  actually understood that Bud and someone else were taking a  photography course, and they talked the instructor into signing the  forms. I will bow to Clem   s memory, because Clem and Bud were kind  13  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  of in charge of it, and if that   s how it happened, well that   s probably  how it happened. I   ve always been somewhat na  ve about some things.  (Laughs)  Did you have transportation when you were in college?  Very fortunate   I had a car, and I had a trailer.  What kind of car did you have?  Well, I had a    41 Ford for the first couple of years, and then I got a new  Ford. Turner and I were the ones that had the cars, and we both had  two- horse trailers. Leo and his brother Bob had a Model T. I am sorry  he did not tell you about that. It was an experience all by itself.  And so those cars would pull the trailers. That   s unusual these days,  isn   t it?  Yes. Yes, well, pick-ups weren   t very comfortable.  Were they mainly just for farm and work?  They were mainly for work. I remember   we had Henrietta Trailers,  which were made by a man in Henrietta named Red Holmes. His  daughter was a trick rider. He made these horse trailers, and they were  stout and heavy. If you didn   t use the stand when you unhooked from it,  you had to get a car jack out to raise it up.  Oh.  I remember Turner impressed me by being able to lift his up, and I  strained enough    til I could lift mine   but I tried to remember to put  bricks under it. And, there were no ball hitches at that time. They had  the flat hitch, and you dropped a pin down through the hole. That  always worked all the time while you were travelling. And the springs  on the backs of cars were not good enough to hold, so you were driving  about like this most of the time, unless you put overload springs on the  back of the car. It was interesting times.  Do you have any stories about your teammates on the rodeo team?  Oh   Turner told one of the best ones. (Laughs) Understand we drove  all night to get to the Kansas State rodeo. Turner and I stayed together  and he convinced me that we did not have any time to rest after that long  trip. I was so exhausted that whole rodeo. I had trouble staying awake  while waiting for either my calf or my steer. It was over Sunday night  14  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  and we drove back to Stillwater and attended an 8:00 a.m. class. I was  hazing for Harold at Kansas State, and he was bulldogging. I didn   t  recall that the steer went over the pitcher   s mound, but I assume he did.  There were, for some reason, when Harold got off this   got down on the  steer, he rode over the steer right in my path. Everybody claimed that  every foot on my horse hit him at least once. He was riding with Turner,  and we drove home that night   which meant we drove all night. And  when we got there, he told Harold to get out and open the gate. Well,  here   s Harold so sore that he could not navigate. Of course, Turner  convinced him he better move or he   d never be able to   well, he got  out, and he fell down the bar ditch. And, Turner started laughing so  hard   Harold trying to get up. And we all got there at about the same  time, and we all were so exhausted and poor Harold was hurtin   . It was  a horrible experience. (Laughs) We did take him to the sick bay.  Infirmary?  Yeah. The infirmary, the next morning. And, they actually even figured  out that he was just kind of bruised and banged up. But, that was the  worst experience that we had, and I ran over him. I didn   t do it on  purpose. (Laughs)  No. (Laughs) Accidents do happen   around livestock.  But, I couldn   t afford to go to the rest of    em, the big one was going to  be in California in 1949, I think, when Eldon Dudley got there. We had  several more, but Eldon went out there and won everything they had,  every rope roping go around, I understand.  Harold, Leo, and I were all city boys that learned to rope at the Tulsa  Mounted Troops, an organization for boys. It was just a wonderful  period, but the greatest part about it is the guys that we   ve all talked  about. We   ve been that close all of our lives. And I   ve even got the  same old gal I married.  It was just a wonderful period, but the greatest part about it is the guys  that we   ve all talked about. We   ve been that close all of our lives. And  I   ve even got the same old gal I married.  How do you feel about Oklahoma State University and the impact it had  on your life?  I couldn   t have been comfortable in any other school. I couldn   t have  handled a social life. I was not a good fraternity man. You know, our  fraternity was   we were each other. Where it should have been the  15  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  fraternity people   I had some good friends and still have. But I   ve often  jokingly talked about my relatives who went to OU  University of  Oklahoma    I had some gates on the place that   you know, everybody  has gates if they   ve got any land at all. Some of    em are just like you  want    em, and some of    em are just gates, or gaps. But these kids that  went to OU, they spent ten minutes going through the gate. And then  when they closed it, they wouldn   t close it right, and I   d let each one of     em know that I wish they   d just gone one semester to Oklahoma A M  and learned how to close gates. So, that   s still kind of a big joke with  everybody. But I doubt if there was any other schools that had as much  mud as we had. And looking back, you get a lot of experience driving  through mud.  Well, what is it about rodeo you think that bonds people together?  I hope it   s happening today. I think they   re too money mad today to be  able to spend the time really bonding. With the money now, it has  become more business and I suspect some petty jealousies have  occurred. We all were real happy for any of us that won some money.  It   s just the way I look at it.  Mm-hmm.  You know, money was important to us, and I guess mainly we didn   t  have any. But if we had any, we knew how to spend it and enjoy it. I  look back and think I should have been a bit wiser about it. But today, I  think money has overtaken most everything, and that bothers me. I hate  to see it happen. I watched it take over the American Quarter Horse  Association. I worked many years with the American Quarter Horse  Association and watched it grow from a brotherhood of horse lovers to  become a brotherhood of self-serving individuals. They quit promoting  the quarter horses, and everybody   s self promoting. That   s an opinion     I   m not sure you want opinions.  Opinions are fine. Is there anything else you want to say about the  rodeo team or about your friends from   ?  I don   t want to forget the crop of cowboys who made up the next team.  Eldon Dudley, Dick Barrett, David Miller and Bob Roberts, Leo   s  brother, Neale Vann and Lee Alred. They were all good friends. They all  won their share of rodeo contests. All came after the original bunch.  I think it   s all been said. I still think they   re the greatest people on earth,  the greatest friends a fellow could have had and when it boils down to  just Clem and me being left, it really gets a little tough at times. We  have been talking about our times together years ago. I am proud we  16  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  Kilgore  Neurohr  stayed together all of those years. But, faith gets us through this world,  and we better keep it.  Yes, that   s true. Well, I appreciate your participation in this project and  the opportunity to interview you. This has been very nice and a  privilege. I want to thank you for that.  Well, I appreciate it. My oldest daughter did graduate from OSU and as  I mentioned, because Patsy got pregnant, she didn   t get to finish school.  And, that daughter, when she graduated, she stepped out away from the  procession and pointed at her momma. This is for you Mom  (Laughs)  Awww.     Cause she felt like it was her fault that her momma didn   t get there.  Oh. Well, I bet that made you both proud, that she     Oh, yeah, and she   s still making us proud.  Oh, yes. Absolutely.  She majored in child development, and she has managed   directed the  childcare center at St. John   s hospital. She   s been there for almost thirty  some years now. So she used her education.  Well, good. Well, thank you. I appreciate hearing your stories.  I hope it   s worthwhile, dear.  Yes, sir.  -------  -------
