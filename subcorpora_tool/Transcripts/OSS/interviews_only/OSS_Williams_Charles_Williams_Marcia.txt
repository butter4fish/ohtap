 Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Today is Friday October 19, 2007, and my name is Karen Neurohr, I   m  with the OSU Library. We   re at the ConocoPhillips OSU Alumni Center  today and I have a couple of special people here that we   re going to  interview for O-STATE Stories, an Oral History Project of the OSU  Library. Thank you for coming today for the interview. I   d like to start  by having each of you introduce yourselves for us.  I   m Marcia Stinnett Williams, from McPherson, Kansas.  I am Charles C. Williams from McPherson, Kansas, and I graduated  fifty years ago.  Fifty years ago, this is your fifty year reunion.  Yes.  Okay, well I want to start our interview today by finding out a little bit  about you, and where you were born and raised. Marcia we   ll start with  you.  I was born in Billings, Oklahoma. My father was a rural mail carrier and  my mother taught piano in her home. I graduated from Billings High  School, went to nurses training in Ponca City and stayed there for three  years until I started working. We got married and then Charles wanted to  go to OSU for the last two years of his college experience, and I worked  for Dr. Fry in his office while Charles went to school.  Charles, where were you from originally?  I was born and raised in Osage County, and graduated from Ponca City  5  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  High School in 1949. Then I came here to college in the fall of    49. I  went the fall of    49 and the spring of    50 or that year. And then the next  year and a half I went to Northern Oklahoma Junior College. Then from  there, why Uncle Sam came along, and I spent three years in the 508th  Airborne. I got out of the service in 1954 in January, and the second  semester here had started. So I worked at Johnson Grain Terminal in  Enid Oklahoma building the new elevator. I fell and got hurt, and broke  an arm and so forth but I was able to start to college the next fall here. I  found out while in the service what college really meant. I think I made  the honor roll all of the last three years I was here, but I couldn   t say that  the first year I was here.  (Laughs) When you say you were building an elevator are you talking  about a big grain elevator?  Grain elevator, yes. I was on the maintenance crew and this elevator fell  from one floor to the next and tore up my left arm.  So how did you two meet each other?  Well he   s from Ponca City and he was home on leave, I think, from the  service and I was still in nurses training there, so we met through mutual  friends   blind date pretty much. Then we started corresponding because  he still had some time in the service and I still had another year of  training.  Charles, let me find out a little bit about what it was like for you as a  student here, you were married at the time and you were working  Marcia?  Mm-hmm.  So, were there a lot of married students going to school here, when you  were here?  Well, that   s mostly who we knew, were married students.  Where did you live?  Over on North Husband, what was it 412 or 214 or something North  Husband?  I think it was 207.  207 North Husband.  6  M. Williams  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  It was in a duplex.  You know, back then nobody had any money, and so we were all in the  same boat. They could either come to our house, we can go to their  house, and we   d play cards and do this or that. But we all realized why  we were here.  I think they started growing up a little bit.  Oh. (Laughter) You didn   t have any children yet, at that time?  We had one child while we lived here.  But studies came first, and we played afterwards.  And, Marcia, were you working full time?  Yes.  And Charles you were just going to school full time?  No, I worked for the Park Department. And that was interesting. The  superintendent of the city parks owned the duplex that we were in. So he  found out who I was and what we were doing and he insisted that I come  to work for him, and so that worked out real well.  It   s kind of amazing. It was very amazing when we first started to school  here. I started and went to work for the college sweeping out some of the  old Army buildings up here every afternoon for fifty cents an hour. And  you know, we thought that was a lot of money   got along just fine.  Then came back and went to school on the G.I. Bill after I got out of  service, but did quite well with Marcia working, and me working, and  the G.I. Bill. I don   t know, a lot times we thought we had more money  then, than we do now. (Laughter)  Who was the park superintendent that you mentioned that owned the  duplex?  Do you remember his name, Gene   I   ve got to think.  His first name was Gene, okay.  Yeah, and it was kind of amusing when we rented the apartment it said  no children, and when she got pregnant, why we really sweated to have  to go tell him.  7  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  We thought we were going to have to leave the duplex and move to  another place, but this couple did not have any children of their own.  And so they were very nice about it. They helped us a lot with little  Rosemary.  Did they live in the other part of the duplex?  They lived right behind us. They had their home right behind us and  they were always very, very nice. They did not make us move.  They were always wanting to take care of Rosemary. (Laughs)  Yes.  One of the interesting things   we always remember about that  apartment. One night during the summer, we had a tornado come  through and the sirens went off. We had to go about a block and a half  down the street to a basement. We both ran out the back door and got  about half way down the street and realized we   d left Rosemary   (Laughs)  She was asleep.  So we had to turn around and go get her, and by that time the storm had  passed over. (Laughter)  So you must have had a car when you were here.  Yes.  And you were able to use the car to get to your job?  Actually I didn   t know how to drive. I never did take driving when I was  in high school, but I did learn to drive while we were living here because  the doctor   s office was clear on the other side of town, up where the  hospital is now. I had Wednesday afternoons off. That   s how the doctor  operated his practice. So on Wednesday afternoon I learned how to  drive. Charles didn   t really use the car, he walked to school.  It was about three blocks over there and so she really needed it. When I  first came down here to school we lived in the Army barracks at the  south end of town. We were kind of looking at them down on the wall,  the Army dwellings   yes these were Army barracks.  Was that part of Veteran   s Village they called it?  8  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  Uh-huh. And I was assigned to just one building along with four  Koreans. You know they were good people, fine guys.  But you had just been in the Korean War.  No this was the first time, before I went in the service. Yes they were  over here. The only problem with those guys was they liked terrapins  and they like snakes and we had to walk back and forth from that area up  here to campus. They   d bring the damn terrapins in. You   d get up the  next morning, put your shoes on   you had to have the terrapins out,  bugs and so forth (Laughter), but I tell you they were nice guys. They  only stayed down there one semester. Then, the next semester three of  my buddies just lived right around the corner here and they had the  upstairs of this two story house rented, so I spent the rest of my time  there.  You said that you wanted to come to school here at OSU, after you were  on the G.I. Bill. Why is it? Did you have family members who had come  here before you?  No.  What was the connection there, the draw for you to come here?  Well I came back to become a veterinarian and chemistry kept me out of  vet school. That was the primary reason I came back to OSU and it was  in the home area here. I was the first one out of our family to go to  college or graduate from college. My parents didn   t, their parents didn   t,  then two brothers   a sister that never graduated from college, but I have  nephews and nieces that have come down here or gone elsewhere and  graduated, but I was the first one in the clan to go to college.  Was your family supportive about your decision to go to college?  They didn   t care. They had this kind of mentality that you   re growing up  now   you can do whatever you want to do. As long as you can afford it,  do it.  So when you turned eighteen were you pretty much expected to find your  own way, go to school or start working?  That   s right.  That   s him. My family was maybe a little different, but I don   t think that  he had that much family support.  9  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Did you always want to go into nursing?  Well not always, but it finally came to me. In those days women were  pretty modest, and even my grandparents thought it was a terrible thing  for me to be taking care of men, but they came around. They could see  how much I enjoyed it.  What was the name of the program you were in, in Ponca City?  Well it was St. Joseph   s School of Nursing. I think it disbanded about     77 or so. It was a three year diploma program under the Sisters of St.  Joseph.  I hadn   t heard about that before. Had it been there a while when you  started?  Oh yes, I think it had. I think it cost my father  175 to get me into school  there and then after you start progressing in your training, they give you  twenty dollars a month. So I don   t think the nuns made anything, really,  by the time that you finished school. You probably used all that money  up, so it was kind of interesting. I always think about how much it cost  to be educated any more.  Charles, what degrees did you end up with   what did you study?  I had a double major in animal husbandry, and Ag econ. I lack nine  hours having a master   s in Ag econ.  What professors do you remember especially?  Totusek. I was trying to remember my favorite one in Ag econ last night.  He was killed in a car wreck, I can   t remember   I can   t tell you what his  name was. But he was up in Kansas on a summer tour or something and  failed to stop at a railroad track and it killed him and another professor.  What do you remember about Professor Totusek.? I   ve heard some other  alumni talking about him?  Oh, Tot, he   d feed you the line or this or that, but Tot said we were  gonna do this   and that   s the way we did.  What classes did he teach?  Oh, I had judging under him and I think that   s all the classes I had under  him was judging. But Tot would say,    Now boys, this is the way we   re  gonna do it.    You may not like it, but that   s the way you did it. And the  10  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  boys respected him for that.  Were there very many women studying agriculture at that time?  Oh we probably had two or three in our class, but most of the others  were boys. And the same way for Ag econ. There there   d been a couple  in those classes but the rest of it was all boys. But I understand it   s  changed considerably since then.  Yes, I think there are a lot more women that go into agriculture now,  than used to. My husband had a similar experience. He went to Texas  A M and he wanted to go into vet school and I think the chemistry class  down there made it difficult for him, and he wasn   t able to get into vet  school there, so he went a different direction. But things do have a way  of working out for you in the end don   t they?  Yes.  Certainly.  Okay.  I   d go to summer school and take chemistry. I was just as proud of my  C   s as those guys that were taking it the second time with their A   s, and  there was a lot of them. Ninety percent of the class in the summer in  chemistry was vet students taking it over again to get into vet school.  Those types of classes   probably didn   t have much of those in high  school to prepare you for that.  Like none.  Yes, like none. (Laughs)  I wanted to tell you about a botany class and the botany professor that  we had here. When I first came here in    49 it was right after World War  II. A lot of Veterans were here and I knew most of those buddies. Well,  in the botany class, the bell would ring. I tried to think of that old  professor   s name, but anyway he locked the door into the classroom.  That went on three or four times or maybe longer, but one time he made  a mistake   the veterans came in and didn   t quite get there by the time  the bell rang and he locked the door, and they kicked the door down.  Needless to say, he never locked that door again. (Laughter)  Well when they kicked the door down did they just come in and sit  down?  11  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  M. Williams  They just came in and sat down and class went on. (Laughter) But that   s  the way those old professors were. If you weren   t there when the bell  rang, time was over with.  So being a married couple   Charles was taking classes, you were  working, didn   t have a lot of extra money probably. So what did you do  for fun, did you go to any dances or movies or anything?  Well they used to have some very nice big band dances on campus in  those days, and if we could afford it   we did go to two or three of  those   Tommy Dorsey, and Vaughn Monroe and things like that.  So they came to Stillwater and performed?  Yes, they did.  Where were those dances held?  Well, I think the Student Union.  I bet that was fun.  It was. But otherwise, I think we would buy a watermelon, and split it  between two or three couples and we played a lot of Pitch  card game . I  had a baby to take care of finally and so we had plenty to do. Charles  was taking like twenty-one hours, and so we didn   t have television or  anything like that. We were kind of close to our families so on weekends  we could drive home and see them or they   d come to us.  Did you have a telephone?  Yes.  Did you talk to your families very often?  Oh I think so.  You know sometimes the students now, they   ll call home every day and  talk to their parents.  Oh, well it wasn   t like that.  Wasn   t anything like that.  No.  12  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  Where did you shop for groceries?  Safeway.  I think so. And we thought Stillwater was a nice town. We used to enjoy  going around town.  We used to do a lot of hunting and fishing.  Around Stillwater, you did? Where did you go for that?  (Laughs) North of town. We   ve eaten a lot of duck, and we   ve eaten a  lot of frogs and we   ve eaten a lot of     Goose.  Geese, yes. A bunch of us old buddies we all liked to hunt, so we   d hunt  and we would use to go frog hunting in the fall and     Well Marcia did you cook that     We hadn   t been married too long and we caught     (Laughs) He   s gonna tell this story.     we got a bunch of frogs and brought them home and she said,    I   ll  cook    em.    Once we got them cleaned and she put one bunch in the oven  and those frog legs began to move and out the back door she went. The  cooking event was over  (Laughter)  Well I had never seen them cook before.  Oh, gosh. (Laughs)  I had no experience.  You probably weren   t very eager to eat it either  (Laughs)  It was pretty scary. (Laughs)  One of the things that I certainly want us to talk about a little bit has to  do with the current mascot that we have here at Oklahoma State  University, Pistol Pete. He was modeled after Frank Eaton, who was a  real person. Marcia if you will start and tell me about your family and  the connection with Frank Eaton?  13  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Well my grandfather was Ed Stinnett from Enid, and he and Frank Eaton  were old friends. I can   t tell you exactly how   I think they were  probably in the Cherokee Strip Association together. They used to ride  horses at the beginning of the parade on the 16th of September every  year to celebrate the opening of the Cherokee Strip. He was an old friend  and he would be at my grandparents    every once in a while. He lived at  Perkins which is close to Stillwater. So after we were married, why we  would see him on occasion and maybe help him with rides because as  far as I know he didn   t drive, and he was quite elderly by that time.  We would see him on occasion and he was always a great storyteller. He  would tell us things about his childhood. He always dressed like that     he had the long braids and the big hat, and always wore his guns. And I  guess one experience maybe that you want me to talk about is when I  took care of him in the hospital. Before I started working for Dr. Fry, I  worked at the hospital for a while and he would come in as a patient.  Most of the time we could hardly get his hat away from him, much less  his guns, because he was just a stayed-old cowboy. So usually we had to  get special permission, and he   d keep his gun under his pillow while he  was a patient there, so that   s something that you can   t forget. He was a  great old cowboy that we kind of grew up with.  So you knew him as a child?  Mm-hmm.  What else do you remember about him?  I guess just being the character that he was. Even in those days you  didn   t see people dressing like that very often. I just thought that he was  an interesting storyteller and I didn   t think too much about him, actually.  He was just an old friend of my grandparents. I have a great picture at  home with them leading that parade. We had the picture blown up, it  14  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  was a rather small photo, and I had the picture blow up to an eight by  ten, and then I realized that both of them had their guns pointed. It   s  really a cute picture and I really treasure that.  Oh yes, I bet you do. Did he like children, how was he around children?  Why yes, he had children of his own. In fact, I met his son one time. I  happened to get to meet him in a restaurant over in Enid. Sure, he   s very  friendly, very nice to children. He always accepted us as part of his  extended family in a way. He liked Charles too.  Charles, will you tell me what you remember about him?  Well I had seen Frank, or Pistol Pete, for three or four or five years prior  to coming to school down here. It seemed like annually the college  would invite him on campus to speak to the English class. Well it  happened to be an English class I was in that day and he came in and he  always pulled his old pistol. Well that day he forgot to take the bullets  out of it, and there was a hole shot in the ceiling in Old Central over  there. So from then on the college made him check that pistol in when he  talked to the classes. But that was quite an experience that day. It didn   t  seem to bother him a whole lot, just like an everyday event, but it was  quite interesting.  Visiting with old Pistol Pete, why you only had to say,    Hello, Pete,     and conversation was on, he   d do the rest of the talking. He always liked  to tell me about the old boy that came through Perkins and shot his dad  and rode on to somewhere in New Mexico. And old Pistol Pete would  always say,    Well I got on ol    Bowlegs, followed him out there and  found him, shot him, got back on Bowlegs and came back to Perkins.    If  I   ve heard that story once, I   ve heard it twenty-five times, about when he  went out and killed the old boy and got on his horse and came back.  It seems like he spent about half of his life avenging his father   s death.  He was determined to get the men that had done it, because I guess they  just shot him in the doorway, didn   t they?  Yes, they used to have a blacksmith shop in Perkins.  And that was his father   s shop?  They shot Dad right in the doorway. And our recollection is that that  was probably one of five that he killed. But back in those days if you  were defending yourself, that was all right. The lawman   that was the  thing to do. He was never ever involved in any trials or arrests. Well,  I   m sure he was arrested a time or two for overindulging, but you know  15  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  that   s part of life too.  They say you have defining moments in your life, so     Yes.     the death of his father would certainly be classified as a defining  moment.  That   s what he wanted to talk about and that   s what he spent his life  doing, I think.  So you said that you gave him transportation periodically when you  were going to school here?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yes. We   d know when we   d go from here to Enid. We   d get a hold  of him, and boy he was ready.  You   d go pick him up at Perkins?  Yes. Or if we   d be in Perkins and he happened to be up there and needed  a way home why       Well darn it, why wait a minute      He knew we were here so he would count on that. He had a chance to go  visit with my grandparents.  And he was talking when he got to the car and talking when he left the  car so you didn   t go to sleep. He kept you well up.  What were some of his other favorite stories that he told?  Oh, just rustling cattle or how he was always after somebody that had  broken the law, or their law. He was always telling those kinds of  stories, how they used to go after old Bill, or old Frank or whatever his  name was. He had all these other buddies, I can   t remember their names  but you know he   d name them all off,    Well we spent nine days or  twelve days chasing old so and so.       Well, what   d you chase after him  for, Frank?    You know, he   d tell you what they   d done, and that they  thought that he needed to correct it, so.  Did he wear a badge? Did you ever see him wearing a badge?  No   I never   I don   t think     16  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  No, I don   t believe he did. By the time that we really were around him  very much, he was probably past that. You know he probably wouldn   t  be allowed to wear the badge.  But he still had his gun with him.  Oh yes, oh yes. He wore his holster.  And you kind of wondered whether the poor old boy just owned that one  change of clothes or not because every time you   d see him that   s what  he had on (Laughs).  Oh, he had on the same clothes?  Oh yes.  What color was his hat?  Oh it was tan, wasn   t it?  Yes, an old tan hat and once in a while he covered it with an old black  hat. I guess he put on whichever was closest to the door (Laughs) when  he   d come out     Was he married? Did he live with family at this time period or was he  alone?  Well, he had to, but I   m not sure if his wife was deceased at that time or  not. He always seemed to be alone so she could very well have not have  been alive at that time   when he was an older man. But I never did meet  her. I never did know her.  Lee Allred, who lived just south east of town was in our class   is  deceased now. I can remember when we were down here and we   d be  talking about old Pistol Pete. He can remember Pistol Pete from being  just a kid, so that was fifteen   twenty years prior to the time we were  here. I have no idea how long they lived in Perkins or where they came  from, or anything. I   m sure he   s told me but it   s kind of slipped by.  Did he have any unusual mannerisms or way of speaking at all?  Just old-fashioned cowboy   just probably had no formal schooling at  all. He probably didn   t have very good grammar. (Laughs) But just little  things like that   just old-fashioned good guy.  Loved horses?  17  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Oh yes.  Very much.  Did he talk about horses a lot?  Oh yes.  Uh-huh.  I don   t know how many he had or how many he   d known but it was  quite a bunch.  And so he punched cattle too, did he work cattle too?  Oh yes.  I   m sure, oh yes that was     They had to back in those early days to survive. Wasn   t he a deputy  sheriff a time or two through the years?  Probably the reason he was chasing criminals. What was your  grandfather like? Was he similar, was he a cowboy and     Well, yes he was, but he did other things too. I think he was a cattle  inspector at one time, but those were early days. Then later on he  worked for the Wichita Eagle. He helped take papers all over the county  area, around Enid. That   s where he lived. I think my grandmother  worked at the courthouse. She registered deeds   I think that   s what she  did. And my grandfather ran for sheriff a couple of times, but I don   t  think he ever made it, but he did run.  Where were they   they were from Chandler, is that where they came  from?  Yes, they did live in Chandler. He was also a butcher because I  remember him bringing meat into my grandmother   s house   he   d bring  meat in. There was a sale of a butcher shop in Billings, where I was  raised, and I think that   s how they got to Billings, and so they lived  there. I have some great old pictures of them in that shop.  You knew the Bellmon family?  Well, yes     18  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr     in Billings?  My dad was a rural mail carrier and so when I   d go on the route with  him, we   d always pass their farm, and we knew him   sure. Not real well  but as I said my mother used to teach the girls piano.  Okay, I   m going to switch back to Frank Eaton here, do you know if he  could read?  I have no idea.  I really don   t know for sure if he did, but I would just guess it, because  even my granddad, I don   t think he had more than about a fifth grade  education.  That was common back then.  Sure, sure. And so if Frank had that much   if he went to school he  would have known how to read.  Well it   s great to get some stories from people who knew Frank Eaton. I  met one other person who graduated from school here. Henry Bedford.  He   s a rancher in Montana, and he remembers Frank Eaton coming to  class, as well, and talking to students, so that must have been a fairly  common occurrence during that period. And that tells me that the  professors sort of appreciated his background and his history. What did  he talk about when he came to classes, just his experiences?  His experiences, that   s about all.  And were the student   s just spell bound to listen to him?  Oh yes. So many of the students weren   t from around here. I can   t  remember whether it was English or Oklahoma history, but you know  they both fit in and it was quite interesting and quite an experience for  those students who hadn   t been involved in any of that before   just to  hear him.  Or just to see him, because he was quite something to look at.  Do you think he was proud to be selected as the model for the mascot?  Oh, sure. I   m sure he was.  Do you remember anything in particular about that at all?  19  M. Williams  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Did he ever say anything as far as his lectures were concerned about  that? I don   t remember hearing him talk about that, but I can just very  well imagine   he probably took it all with a grain of salt but then I   m  sure he was.     Oh hell, son, look what they   ve done now     (Laughter)  That   s something he would have said.     Look what they   ve done now     (Laughter)  Well, there was a picture in the paper today of him in a classroom, and  some students were around him, in the O   Colly and it makes me think  that he must have enjoyed being around the college students.  Oh, I   m sure he did.  Oh yes.  Yes there's an article about him, there's a big picture right here      Neurohr shows newspaper article  Oh my goodness  Oh yeah, isn   t that  great? And those students look like they   re just intrigued. He   s showing  them his gun. Oh yeah, that   s great.  Did any of your kids come to school here?  No.  Not because we didn   t try.  Well we lived in Kansas then, so they went to several different schools  in Kansas.  Grandchildren?  We were really glad when our granddaughter came to school here. She  graduated last year.  When she said I had gone to school here, they waived part of her out-of-state  tuition.  Oh good. Does she know your stories about Frank Eaton?  Well, I don   t know if we   ve talked too much about that. We have some,  but maybe not too much.  20  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  I think she would find that very interesting.  Oh sure, sure.  Yes, to know that you knew him like you did.  Oh well, she knows that, but she probably doesn   t know too many  details. As the generations go, they kind of take a lot of that for granted,  you know. They don   t think too much about it.  You said you would take him home or pick him up in Perkins, what was  his house like?  An old shack.  It was an old shack? (Laughs)  Kind of back behind the blacksmith   s shop.  Oh the blacksmith   s shop was still there at the time, was that in  downtown Perkins then?  Yes, ma   am. And the old blacksmith   s shop wasn   t in operation, but you  knew what it was.  I wonder if it   s still there.  We haven   t been back to Perkins for years.  Have you ever talked to anyone else about him? Has anyone ever asked  you questions about him before?  Not very much.  Well some people have tried to do some research about him before, and  I just wondered if they made the connection or knew about you all, and  your connection with him.  Well, we don   t know too much.  Knowing him as a child though, I think, and that your grandfather being  friends with him is probably pretty unique, and that you knew him across  a long period of time like that, I think that   s pretty special.  Well, I guess we didn   t realize how special it was, I   ll try to remember  some more.  21  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  That   s okay. (Laughter)  It   s true.  Yes and just trying to get your reminiscences about just different things  about him so people who don   t know him can really visualize him and  just sort of get a good idea about his personality and things like that.  I don   t think that we really appreciated what he was and who he was  until we actually came to Stillwater. And we realized then, I think, how  special he was to people and how unique he was. We started realizing  what a special guy he was.  Like that one picture there, that shows him with all the students around  him   looks like he   s really concentrating. That was what he liked, was  to really get up there and explain these things to you, or whoever was  around him. And he   d spend all afternoon telling you,    That it   s two  o   clock,    and things like that. He wouldn   t say,    Its two o   clock let   s  go     He would talk half a day on whatever you wanted to know, or  whatever you were interested in. He   d always find the time. He was very  good that way.  Did they just ask him over once a year?  Mm-hmm.  I think he used to be in the parade here too.  Oh yes, oh yes.  Oh probably.  Oh yes, he probably led the parade.  Do you remember anything about Homecoming? This is Homecoming  weekend, so what was Homecoming like when you were living in  Stillwater?  The orange door, remember the orange door?  All the sororities and fraternities were all decorating something, not as  elaborately as they are today. But we had the parade and     Where was the orange door? I haven   t heard of it before.  Well wasn   t there a song by that name?  22  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Oh I don   t know   I think there was, and that was kind of part of the parade for a while. It  was a song.  It was a song?  I still kind of associate that with the parade in those days. It was always  nice and the celebrations on campus were really special and it was so  pretty around here, even then. My one special remembrance was how  pretty the magnolia trees were because I don   t think I   d ever seen them  before, and how very pretty they were in bloom. Theta Pond was always  so attractive to me. We enjoyed our time here.  It   s nice the campus has retained the beauty, I think.  Yes. Those trees are still here.  Well, after you graduated with your degrees, your double major, which  that had to have been difficult to do   taking extra classes like that, what  career did you end up with? Or did you have several different career  paths?  Well, when I graduated from here, my first job was I managed Gooch  Research Farm at Manhattan  Kansas . I went in to primarily farm  management and appraisals. After I left there, I went to Texas and  managed part of a large turkey, broiler, feeder pigs, cattle operation for  this large company in Texas   Tyler, Texas. I was in charge of their beef  cattle, their swine, and their turkeys   fifty thousand turkeys. The day I  went to work there, the boss called me in and said,    Charlie, these are  your two hired hands.    They were with me constantly.  Then after we left there I went to work for Prudential Insurance  Company in the mortgage loan department, and that   s where I became  an appraiser. My first assignment was Fort Smith, Arkansas, and we  were there for about three years and they transferred me to Hutchinson,  Kansas, then to Emporia. In 1970, they decided to get out of the  mortgage loan business and the finance business, so they terminated  about three hundred of us over the United States. At that time I went to  work for McPherson Bank and Trust. I headed their Farm Management  department. I was with them almost twenty years. Then I went to work  for Farm Credit, as an appraiser and stayed with them till I retired which  was about ten years ago. And after I retired from them, I started my own  appraisal business and farm management business. That   s what I   m still  doing   have stayed quite busy.  23  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C.

Williams  You continued to use the training that you received here, then it sounds  like, in all the different jobs that you did.  Yes.  So do you think that the university or the college prepared you well for  your different positions?  Yes and no. You got out of it what you put into it. I always wished that I  had taken more appraisal courses when I was here, but they were just  barely getting started and it felt like the professors who were teaching it  didn   t know a hell of a lot more than I knew. So we thought we better  spend more time doing other classes and I didn   t take any appraisal  courses here. One thing I always missed, and always have regretted, that  I didn   t learn to fly while I was here. I could have done that under the  G.I. Bill, but I couldn   t get it worked in.  Sounds like you had a demanding schedule, as many hours as you were  taking already.  He did.  I told myself I was going to get out of there in three years, but we didn   t.  Did you continue in the nursing profession Marcia?  Well, yes. I   ve worked off and on for fifty years, too. But I had five  children so I did take some years off because of that but yes, I have  worked in the nursing field, in different things   the office, hospital,  taking care of disabled. A lot of different areas   loved it all.  When she decided to quit, she just sent her license in and said,    This is  over with.    No one else could call her and ask her to come to work  because she wasn   t legal anymore.  Well, nurses are so much in demand anymore that if you don   t   the only  way I knew to completely leave that field was to let my license go. So  that   s what I did, but I worked until I was seventy.  How many times have you come back for Homecoming over the years?  Well, we   ve been here a few times, when the children were little.  You brought your children down to Stillwater?  Mm-hmm.  24  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  I bet that was fun. Did you take them and show them the house you used  to live in?  Yes we   ve driven by there, and showed them through the Student Union,  and they loved that.  The Library was fairly new when you were going to school here wasn   t  it?  Yes.  What do you remember about the Library?  I spent a lot of time there.  Did you? (Laughs)  We walked through there this afternoon     Oh good.     just to see what it looked like.  How has it changed?  You   d have to answer that.  It doesn   t appear like there's as many books on the second floor as there  used to be.  We have a lot of offices on the second floor, now.  That   s what it looked like. You know we used to spend a lot of time  down in that southwest corner of the Library, where there   d be three or  four of us in there. I always remember, I had an old buddy from Ponca  City that would come down and see us every once in a while. There  were three or four of us in there working on some kind of econ  problem   determining the economic life of a bull. And this old buddy  from Ponca City till ,I think, the day he died was wondering how we  could figure the economic life of a bull but that was the problem  assigned to us, and it was the problem we were working on. (Laughter)  Oh my.  I thought about that when we walked in over there, I said    Well, I  wonder if ol    John is   ,    we walked in here thinking. He   s been dead ten  25  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  years or so.  Oh that   s a good story. Well someone said earlier that there were few  buildings on campus that were air-conditioned but the Library was.  That   s right.  The few places that were popular places for students to go     Of course.     during that time. Do you have anything else you want to talk about for  the interview today?  I don   t. Do you?  I want to try and find out if the doctor I worked for is still alive. I don   t  know whether he might be or not. I haven   t heard from him for years.  Will you look in a phonebook maybe?  Well that   s the only way I know. Of course the hospital over there is so  big and different than it used to be, because where I worked was the old  hospital, and of course all that   I don   t think there's any of that even  left. So all that has changed a great deal.  But it was basically in the same location on Sixth Avenue?  It was. So, it   s just grown.  Yes it has, it certainly has. Do you have any advice for students today     that you would share with students?  That you get out of it what you put into it.  Work hard, and enjoy.  If you   ve come to play that   s what you   re going to get. If you   ve come  to get an education, you   ve got to work just a little bit.  It must be hard though, at eighteen to settle down and work that hard,  because most of them are not too mature to really know what they want  at that age.  No, they change their majors a few times, but that   s part of the process  at that age.  26  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  C. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  M. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  Neurohr  C. Williams  Neurohr  M. Williams  That   s right.  Yes.  Trying to figure out   part of the growing up process.  Yes.  But you know what   today you can almost go three years without  declaring a major. Back then, why you declared it the day you come on.  I guess that   s to give them a little time to figure things out, take some of  the basic English and history classes and try to figure out what direction  they want to go in.  You know a lot of students and a lot of parents today are sending their  kids to junior college or even taking a lot of it on the computer   English  and the basic courses that are required before they get there. Particularly  in Kansas where the expenses have gone up there. They can go two  years at junior college for what one year cost at the state college.  But I   m sure OSU probably has plenty of satellite schools, too. They   re  bound to have.  There's actually a partnership between Northern Oklahoma College and  OSU. There   s a partnership with them and they have a branch campus  here in Stillwater, so some students will start out taking classes there  and then start taking classes here. In fact, it   s on Hall of Fame, right  here close to our campus and those students can use the Library and it   s  another way for those students to get started with their education.  Well that   s what I mean. I think the big schools are trying to make it  easier for kids to save some of their expenses and to still get their  education, maybe a little closer to their homes, so they won   t have to  have that immediate expense, maybe for a while.  It   s been a great interview, thank you so much for participating in this  project. We really do appreciate it.  Well, I feel kind of honored to be asked.  I know you   ll have a wonderful reunion, in a little while at the  Foundation.  Yes, we appreciate this. Thank you, Karen.  27  Neurohr  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
