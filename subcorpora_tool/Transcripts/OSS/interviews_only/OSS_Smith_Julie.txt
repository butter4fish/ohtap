 Finchum Today is August 23, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma State University, and today I am in Ottawa County. Did I say that right?  Smith Yes.  Finchum In the town of Miami, to interview Julie Smith. This is part of our Cowboys in Every County Project, so thank you for having me today.  Smith Thank you for coming.  Finchum Let   s begin with learning when and where you were born.  Smith I was born in Joplin, Missouri, May 11, 1978.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Smith My parents were both educators, and they were in education until they retired. My dad is still an educator. He retired from public school, and now he works for a federally-funded program called Talent Search.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Smith Yes, I have two sisters. I   m the middle of three girls. My older sister, Jennifer, she was three years older than me. Then I have a younger sister, Jill, who   s two years younger than me, and she went to Oklahoma State also.  Finchum Did the older sister go?  Smith She didn   t. She went to Missouri Southern in Joplin.  Finchum That   s okay. Did you have to share a room?  5  Smith We did in our sorority house, but we didn   t     Finchum Growing up.  Smith    growing up. Well, I take that back. We had to share a room for a little bit. (Laughs)  Finchum With the young one or the older one?  Smith I did with the younger one. My older sister got her own room.  Finchum I   ve walked down those paths. I   m the middle of three too, so shared with the younger. (Laughter) Where did you go to elementary school?  Smith I went to elementary school at Kelsey Norman Elementary, and it was two blocks from my house.  Finchum Walked then.  Smith Because both of my parents were teachers, we would be dropped off at a friend   s house a block from our house. That was too far to walk, so we had my friend   s mom drive us to school every day. (Laughs) Then we would walk home because it was just up the hill.  Finchum Was that grades one through six?  Smith It was one through five, and then middle school was sixth, seventh   sixth and seventh grade at South Middle School. Then we had junior high, which was seventh and eighth grade at Joplin Junior High. Then we went on to Joplin High School for   . No, we didn   t. It was seventh, eighth, and ninth, and then nine through twelve, or ten through twelve was at the high school. It   s changed now, so I   m getting all my years   .  Finchum Four different buildings, basically.  Smith Yes. Then there was a kindergarten center that I went to.  Finchum About how many were in your class each year? Size of the school?  Smith Gosh, I don   t remember, maybe like twenty kids. They weren   t large classes.  Finchum When you graduated from high school, how many was in your graduating class, roughly?  Smith Goodness, 375 maybe. 6  Finchum Pretty decent-sized high school. What year did you graduate?  Smith Nineteen ninety-six.  Finchum Joplin High School, and did you have a favorite subject?  Smith I don   t know that I really had a favorite. Had a favorite teacher, so history. I really enjoyed history, but I don   t know that I had a really favorite subject.  Finchum Maybe we   ll go the opposite then. Any that you really struggled with?  Smith Oh, I don   t   .  Finchum Math? (Laughs)  Smith I think everybody struggles in math though. (Laughter) No, I really enjoyed my math teacher also. I don   t know that I struggled with anything in particular.  Finchum Did you participate in extracurricular activities?  Smith Yes. I was a cheerleader from eighth grade through my senior year, and I swam all three years in high school, was on the swim team, so yes.  Finchum That kept you in shape for the cheering.  Smith It did.  Finchum How did the teams do?  Smith We did okay. We had shirts for the swim team. We had our little t-shirts made. We weren   t the best swimmers, but it said,    At least we look good,    because it was a bunch of cheerleaders that were on the swim team. (Laughter) Anyway, it was a little joke.  Finchum What was the school mascot?  Smith The Joplin High School Eagles.  Finchum Eagles, and the colors would   ve been     Smith Maroon and white were the main colors, and then navy and gray were accent colors.  Finchum Did you do a part-time job while you were in high school? 7  Smith I did. I worked at   when I first started high school, I worked at a store called Tuxedo Junction. We did tuxedo rentals, and then my parents put a pool in in our backyard. My mom and I started our own swim company, and I taught swim lessons every summer. I did that all the way through college. I would go back to Joplin every summer, and our company was called Aqua Academy. I really enjoyed that because I love working with kids.  Finchum Sunscreen was important even at that point, wasn   t it?  Smith Yes.  Finchum It   d already become important.  Smith Yes, sometimes the water   the summers would start out so cool. We would be in the water in a wetsuit just to get through the day. (Laughs)  Finchum Did any of the ones not be able to swim? I know some people can   t ever learn to do it.  Smith I think all of our students were pretty successful. I even taught a little girl with spina bifida how to swim. It was obviously a modified version, but she was able to float, and take breaths, and enjoy the water.  Finchum Keep her head above water. Cool, and you had a pool in your backyard that     Smith Yes.  Finchum    that   s neat too. You didn   t get blistered, hopefully?  Smith Not too bad. (Laughs)  Finchum Would the family take family vacations?  Smith We didn   t take too many vacations. There were two memorable vacations. I remember skiing whenever I was in elementary school, and then we went to Disneyworld whenever I was in, I think, maybe middle school.  Finchum That definitely sticks with you, meeting Mickey Mouse. (Laughter) Take me through how you decided to go to OSU. How did it come up?  Smith My parents were born and raised here in Miami. Oklahoma was never out of the picture of going to school, but my parents were also in school the time Steve Owens was a big hit. OU was always in our blood, but my mom had gone to OSU and so did her sister. There was always a little bit of orange 8  and black around, (laughs) and I had aunts and uncles that went to Oklahoma State. When it came time looking at colleges, I went and visited OSU and felt at home. I think everybody there was so friendly, and everybody seemed very genuine. I think that   s really what drew me to Oklahoma State.  Finchum What year did your mother graduate from there?  Smith She actually didn   t graduate from OSU. She went   I don   t even know what the years that she was there, but she graduated from Pitt State, ended up coming back and graduating from Pitt State.  Finchum Was she majoring in education at OSU then, or did she switch?  Smith I   ve never ask her. I think. I can   t believe I   ve never ask her. I assume that it was education.  Finchum Would you go down to Stillwater before you actually even went to look at the college?  Smith No. It was just   well, my senior year. Before my senior year in high school, I was selected to be an NCA  National Cheerleading Association  cheerleading instructor. I thought that I might try the cheerleading at OSU, but then I got cold feet, and I didn   t go through with tryouts. That was really the first time that I spent any amount of time on campus was in the spring, going down to their cheer clinics. Then I was involved in the Greek system, so I went down to Greek Discovery Day, and that was the most fun.  Finchum Before classes actually started, you had some familiarity of the campus?  Smith Yes.  Finchum The first time you went, did anything stand out as far as buildings, or places, on campus that   .  Smith No, I don   t know if   . I liked how the campus was kind of compact, at the time. It didn   t feel overwhelming.  Finchum Theta Pond was nice.  Smith Theta Pond was beautiful, yes, and Library Lawn. I think the Library probably stood out to me. It   s just such a beautiful building, right there in the middle of campus.  Finchum Have you been back lately to campus?  9  Smith We were there just   we go a lot during basketball season.  Finchum The grounds have changed     Smith A lot.  Finchum    a lot since    96, I   m thinking, or since we came, so for you too, I   m sure.  Smith (Laughs) It has. New buildings have popped up.  Finchum Some under construction now. The business building is huge.  Smith I can   t wait to see it. All of my classes, while I was at OSU were in the Colvin Center, and that doesn   t look anything the same.  Finchum Your major was   .  Smith My major was physical education.  Finchum Okay, and what had you intended to do with that, teach?  Smith Yes, I taught for four years after I graduated. I taught a year in Dallas at a private school, and then my husband went to law school at OU, so I taught three years while we lived in Norman. Taught physical educations, pre-k through eighth grade.  Finchum You had to spend some time at    the other    university     Smith Yes. (Laughs)  Finchum ...down south as they say. While you were on campus at OSU, where did you live? I know the first year, you   re not in the sorority house.  Smith Until fall break, I lived, I think it was fall break, it may have been until Christmas. It was the first semester. I lived in Drummond Hall, and then after that semester, I got to move into the sorority house.  Finchum Which one did you pledge?  Smith I was a Kappa Alpha Theta.  Finchum Do you remember your room number in Drummond?  Smith I remember my first room. It was on the twelfth floor. Then I got to move down to the third floor with a pledge sister of mine, but I don   t remember room numbers. 10  Finchum That   s okay. Twelfth floor   was that the top, or was it close to it?  Smith It has to be close to the top, yes. Actually, one of my very good friends, she and I, we were just   I saw her this weekend. We were talking about being on the twelfth floor of Drummond Hall. (Laughs) So lots of memories.  Finchum Was it communal bathrooms?  Smith It was. Yes, that was one of our topics of discussion over the weekend. (Laughter)  Finchum You like it or you don   t.  Smith Yes. I don   t know that it was my favorite. (Laughter)  Finchum Did your room have a phone, or did you have to go down the hall for that too?  Smith I think we did have phones in our room, yes. I remember through Rush, they took our phones out, so we didn   t have phones. Only certain   they were pulled out in the hall.  Finchum Why?  Smith I don   t think they wanted us really to have a lot of outside influence while we were going through Rush. We had to make our own decisions, which I liked. I think nowadays they can use their cell phone any time they want.  Finchum Too much, yes. How often would you call home?  Smith Every day.  Finchum Would you?  Smith Yes, every day.  Finchum How often would you come home?  Smith Maybe once a month. It depends on   it really depended on how many activities were going on on the weekends. If there was a home football game, you   d never go home. You   d always stay around for the football games, so maybe once a month.  Finchum More than once a semester?  11  Smith Yes, and with Joplin being just two and a half hours, three hours away, it wasn   t that bad of a drive.  Finchum Would they come down to visit?  Smith Yes, and it was always so fun having them down, showing my parents around campus, and convincing my little sister to come to OSU. (Laughs)  Finchum Did it take much convincing?  Smith Oh no, not at all.  Finchum She saw how much you enjoyed it.  Smith I think the first Homecoming probably sold her.  Finchum Homecoming does that. It   s huge.  Smith For sure.  Finchum Was it as big in    96,    97?  Smith I think it seemed pretty big.  Finchum It seems to get bigger.  Smith We had   . Let   s see, what was the carnival   . I think it   s at the Fairgrounds now. What is it called? It   s probably not even called a carnival. Anyway, I   m trying to think what other activity   well, we did all the   being involved in a sorority, we did the house decs and the sign contest. Oh gosh, it   s been a long time. What else is involved in Homecoming? (Laughs)  Finchum Did they do the floats and parade?  Smith We did the float. Though now, the parade, I think, was just getting started, to the extent that it is today.  Finchum You had to pomp?  Smith We pomped several hours, but it was so fun because you really got to know everybody in your sorority. Then whatever fraternity you were paired up with, you got to know those guys and form some really good friendships.  Finchum I   ve always wondered how they come up with the designs.  12  Smith Yes. Whoever is the chairman for Homecoming, the Homecoming chair for the houses, they have to come up with it. They   re always   .  Finchum They   re becoming more mechanical     Smith Yes, that   s the guys. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s the guys?  Smith Yes, that   s the guys    job.  Finchum Doing the welding at three o   clock in the morning?  Smith Yes.  Finchum Would you miss classes in order to pomp?  Smith I don   t think that I ever missed too many classes. Probably a few eight o   clock classes, but not too many.  Finchum Did you have to do so many per week? Did every girl have to   .  Smith Yes, or so many hours total. However you got those hours in during Homecoming time was good. It could be in the afternoon or the evening, whenever you had free time.  Finchum Had to be a good time manager then.  Smith Oh, yes. I don   t know that I was always a very good time manager, (laughs) but you learn quick.  Finchum Would you have study hours?  Smith We were not required study hours, unless our grade point fell below probably like a 2.5, but I never   . Grades were always important to me, especially having parents as educators.  Finchum Would they get your grades, or would you have to show them your grades? At some point, they changed that.  Smith I think they got them. I don   t remember ever really having to show my grades. Somehow they always knew.  Finchum They mailed them to them?  Smith Probably. 13  Finchum They   ve changed that now. I   m not sure when that happened, so when you were there, your parents got them?  Smith Yes.  Finchum Okay, did you have a favorite class at OSU?  Smith I think all of my classes, once I got into my major as physical education, I think I loved all of my classes. Now, I think one of my favorites, it wasn   t   I don   t think that I got credit for it, but it was a program called Share the Wealth. It was through the Wellness Center, so we were peer educators. That was probably one of my favorite classes because we would go out to a lot of different organizations, the resident halls, the Greek houses, and talk about different health topics. Alcohol use and study skills, and we had to do presentations. It was fun to go in, and it was just a way to meet more people, and it was a way for me to see how I could use my degree, besides just in the classroom.  Finchum What were some of the P.E. classes that you would   ve had?  Smith We had elementary P.E. and outdoor education. That was a very fun class. I got to learn how to do archery, and they taught us how to fly fish in the gymnasium at the Colvin Center. I don   t know that we ever did a ropes course, but we did   . Well, I was probably too chicken. I probably did the low ropes because I don   t like anything too adventurous. (Laughs)  Finchum I would think as petite as you are that archery would   ve been tough, to pull the bow.  Smith It really wasn   t too bad. It was a lot of fun to learn, a lot of fun. I   ve got two boys, so I   ve told them, not that I practice archery, (laughs) but I told them,    I remember this from school.     Finchum You could hit the bullseye if you had to?  Smith Yes. Well, maybe. (Laughter)  Finchum Did they have dance? Was dance a part of it?  Smith We did dance, yes. I actually found a VHS tape of me, teaching adaptive dance, from whenever I was in school. It was funny to see myself up in front of my peers, teaching them how to dance.  Finchum If you hadn   t been majoring in P.E., would you have been required to take a P.E. class? 14  Smith I don   t think so.  Finchum That had changed too.  Smith I did have to take first aid and CPR, but I think, I want to say maybe, that was probably a basic that a lot of people had to take.  Finchum Then you took the state test or whatever to get certified to teach?  Smith Yes, three different   yes. I don   t even know if it   s the same process that they have to go through, taking the three different tests to become certified. I haven   t followed up.  Finchum You had to do anatomy? Would you have had to do anatomy?  Smith I did anatomy and physiology, exercise physiology.  Finchum I imagine that one would be a tough class.  Smith Anatomy was interesting. I actually enjoyed anatomy. We had to evaluate or breakdown a movement. I did a swimmer starting from a starting block, and we had to write a paper about every muscle, the whole process that your body would go through to get you off of that starting block. It was really   . I enjoyed that, so I guess I like science.  Finchum Teaching how to swim, you wouldn   t think necessarily to that depth. You tie it all in together.  Smith Yes, they made us tie it together. (Laughs) It was good, I really enjoyed all my teachers. I thought they were really helpful. They really let us apply what we learned in the classroom, out of the textbook, to what we would teach in the classroom.  Finchum Besides studying and the sorority, what would you do for fun?  Smith I enjoyed going and walking the lake.  Finchum Boomer?  Smith Yes, Boomer Lake. We would go and walk the lake.  Finchum Exercise again?  Smith Yes, I really liked exercise, (laughter) and intramural sports. It was   . Lots of memories with intramural sports, it was so fun. 15  Finchum What sports?  Smith I did flag football, whiffle ball, inner tube water polo. That was a lot of fun. I was actually telling my boys about that the other day, with the Olympics being on. I said,    I don   t know how those water polo guys   I don   t know how they can constantly swim for that amount of time.    I said,    We did it in college, but we were in an inner tube, so we didn   t have to swim.    (Laughs)  Finchum Do it in the pool there at the Colvin?  Smith Yes.  Finchum I hadn   t heard anyone talk about that. I don   t know if they still do that or not.  Smith I don   t know if they do it or not either, but it was so much fun.  Finchum Mostly females or were there both?  Smith It was co-ed. I think there were both just   . I should look back because I don   t remember if that was co-ed. I think it was a co-ed sport. Then football we did both, co-ed and just girls only, so it was a lot of fun. I like being active.  Finchum You probably don   t take elevators then, if you   ve got stairs.  Smith Right, not too many. (Laughter)  Finchum Do you have a favorite building on campus, besides the health-oriented ones? Like you said the Library, did you spend much time in the Student Union?  Smith I didn   t, I really didn   t. It seems like all of my time was in the Colvin Center or the Wellness Center because that   s really where my classes were, so many of my classes.  Finchum Would they do nutrition too?  Smith I had to have nutrition, and originally, that was my major until I took my first nutrition class my first semester my freshman year, and it was a little overwhelming, because I didn   t have the best study skills. I didn   t make the best grade, so I thought,    Well, I better change my major so I can be successful.    (Laughs) I didn   t stick with nutrition very long, but I did have to have nutrition.  16  Finchum I would think with the health, you would need some.  Smith Yes, and I   m trying to think what building that class was in. I don   t even remember what building I had that in. It was a big lecture hall. I think that was my only class that was in a big lecture hall.  Finchum I   m guessing probably in HES or Human Sciences. It should have a big lecture hall.  Smith It probably was.  Finchum You didn   t mind walking from the sorority house all the way to the Colvin. That   s a little bit of a hike.  Smith It was nice because at the time, they had a parking lot, so I would drive over. (Laughs) Especially on those really cold mornings, I would just jump in the car and drive over. Plug the meter because it was, I think, a quarter meter.  Finchum You mentioned you went to football games. Did you go to basketball games too?  Smith I did, yes. I loved going to basketball games.  Finchum Did you have a circle of friends that migrated with you at these various places?  Smith Yes, mainly   . Well, my boyfriend at the time, but my late husband, we would always go to all of the sporting events together.  Finchum Was he from Miami?  Smith Yes, he   s from Miami. He was born and raised here in Miami.  Finchum Did you know him before you went to OSU?  Smith Sort of. Our parents, I said before, my parents were born and raised here in Miami, and his parents are born and raised in Miami. They all graduated high school together. At probably their twenty-year-class reunion, we met, but we were young, so I didn   t remember Greg. It was my senior year. My mom and I ran into his parents at the grocery store in Joplin. We were talking about where I was going to go to school and mentioned Oklahoma State. They said,    Oh, our son goes to Oklahoma State, so we need to introduce you to him, so that you   ll have a familiar face. Maybe he can show you to your classes.    We met Memorial weekend, right as soon as I graduated, so that was in    96.  17  Then that summer passed, and I never   . I just knew who Greg was. He was a really nice guy. Actually, his family lived   . Their yard and my grandparents    yard kind of touched, so I would always look out in my grandparents    backyard to see if Greg was home, to see if his car was there. It wasn   t until I went through Rush that he called, and said,    Once you finish Rush, I   d love to show you around to your classes.    Then on bid day, he showed up, so that was the start.  Finchum How much older was he?  Smith He was just a year older.  Finchum So he was a   .  Smith He had already gone through his freshman year.  Finchum He had been a sophomore.  Smith Yes.  Finchum Was he in a fraternity?  Smith He was, he was a Sigma Nu.  Finchum I   m not sure what a bid day is. I didn   t go through   .  Smith Bid day is the day that you are invited into your sorority. It   s a big party atmosphere, and people are all over the streets, and your parents are there, and friends are all around. It   s a lot of fun.  Finchum That was from the   and that started   .  Smith Yes, that started, and so he showed me to all my classes the night before school started. Then we actually had our first date August 23rd of    96.  Finchum What did you do?  Smith We went to Applebee   s, and then we went and saw a movie, Tin Cup.  Finchum Kevin Costner. (Laughs)  Smith Yes, a golf movie. My husband, he loved golf.  Finchum I met my husband on the twenty-third too. We went to see, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Tin Cup is a little better. (Laughter)  18  Smith Yes.  Finchum What was his major at OSU?  Smith He majored in finance, and his minor was international business.  Finchum Was he always headed toward OSU, or was there a college he debated back and forth?  Smith I think he looked at OSU     Finchum From the get-go?  Smith    quite a bit.  Finchum Did he have brothers and sisters that had gone before him?  Smith He didn   t. His parents and his sister went to Tahlequah  Oklahoma . They went to NSU  Northeastern State University .  Finchum No OSU, no orange there. So you dated through your whole four years     Smith Yes.  Finchum    or did you get married along the way?  Smith We got married after I graduated from OSU, so July 22, 2000, is when we got married.  Finchum You waited until you were finished.  Smith Yes.  Finchum Parents    requirement or just your own?  Smith It was our own. We got engaged October of    99, so Greg had graduated and was working for Bank of Oklahoma.  Finchum How did that work in the sorority house? I know they used to throw them in Theta Pond or something when you got engaged or pinned.  Smith No. In the sorority house, you announce your engagement by candlelight. After formal dinner on Monday night, all the girls in the sorority would circle up and sing a song. You would pass a flower bouquet with a candle in it. You would pass it around the circle, and then the person that was making the announcement would blow the candle out. Yes, and you keep it a secret 19  from everybody, you try to. Obviously, my sister was in the house, so she knew, but nobody else did.  Finchum She pledged the same as you did.  Smith She did. She pledged Theta two years after I did.  Finchum That would   ve been neat to have her that close too.  Smith It was. It was really special.  Finchum Get along pretty well?  Smith Yes.  Finchum What was her major at OSU?  Smith Her major was interior merchandising.  Finchum Did she graduate?  Smith She did.  Finchum Two years after you, so     Smith Yes, 2002.  Finchum    two thousand two? There   s several of you from OSU, that   s good   Smith Yes.  Finchum You   ve got a closet full of orange.  Smith That   s right. (Laughs)  Finchum Do you remember your graduation day?  Smith I remember it a little bit. I remember just a little bit. (Laughs) It was   . Yes, I don   t remember it too much.  Finchum It was probably mixed emotion.  Smith It was for sure.  Finchum Was it in the arena or in the football stadium? Don   t remember that either?  20  Smith Oh my goodness, I think we were still outside. I think we were at the football stadium. That   s terrible, I don   t remember.  Finchum That   s okay. It   s been a few years.  Smith It has, and a lot   s gone on.  Finchum Once you graduated, take me through what you   ve done since.  Smith As soon as I graduated, got married and moved to Dallas. After Greg went through training with Bank of Oklahoma, he was moved to Bank of Texas, which is a subsidiary of Bank of Oklahoma. He was   . As soon as we got married, I moved to Dallas and applied for teaching positions, and got hired on as a pre-k through eighth grade physical education teacher at Hillcrest Academy, which is a small private school there in Dallas. It was nice. Being my first teaching job, I got to team-teach, so there were two of us that taught. I was in charge of, or the head teacher, for pre-k through fifth grade. Then she did the middle school, and I assisted her. Then I was asked to coach volleyball, which I didn   t know a whole lot about volleyball, but I learned quickly, and ended up taking our small team to whatever division that we were in with the private schools. They ended up winning the championship.  Finchum Your first year?  Smith My first year. Unfortunately, I didn   t get to go to the championship game because I had to have my appendix taken out. (Laughs) But it was all good, I was really proud of them. That was my first coaching experience, and it was a great one. After we lived in Dallas for a year, Greg decided to go to law school and went to law school at OU. We moved to Norman, and I applied again for teaching positions, and got hired on at All Saints Catholic School in Norman. Taught pre-k through eighth grade, but this time, I was on my own. It wasn   t anything out of the ordinary, having that wide of an age span. I taught for three years there, until Greg graduated, and we had our first son in May of 2004.  Finchum Since you lived in Norman for a while, you had an opportunity to visit that campus too. Did you compare it to OSU at that time?  Smith Not too much because the law school is south on campus. We didn   t spend a whole lot of time really down on campus, and we lived on the west side of town. It wasn   t   . I don   t know. We just kind of did our own thing.  Finchum Did you go to Bedlam games when they were there?  21  Smith We did, and we wore our orange, and not many people liked us that sat around us, (laughs) but yes, we did.  Finchum I would wonder about that. Proudly wore your orange.  Smith Yes. Still proudly wear our orange.  Finchum Once he graduated from there, you moved back to here?  Smith Yes, so after we had Spencer in 2004, we stayed in Norman for just a few months so Greg could take the bar exam. Then we moved back to Miami, so he could start   . He came back to work with his family here at Larco Enterprises, so we   ve been here ever since.  Finchum I   m not sure what Larco is. Do you want to explain that a little bit?  Smith Yes, my father-in-law started this company several years ago. I don   t know how long. I don   t know when they actually established the company, but they   re Sonic franchisees. From there, it   s grown into smaller businesses underneath that. There   s a real estate aspect, and we actually opened a freestanding restaurant called Stonehill Grill about eight years ago here in Miami. There   s lots of   .  Finchum His background in finance, and then legal too would   ve come in   was a good fit.  Smith It was a perfect fit.  Finchum That was his plan, to come back to     Smith Yes, his plan all along.  Finchum    to come back to Miami?  Smith He definitely wanted to come back and work with his dad.  Finchum Did he have brothers and sisters?  Smith He had a sister, Amy. She went to NSU. She was a few years older than he was.  Finchum Is she in the family business?  Smith Yes, she is. She and her husband are.  Finchum Cool, that   s neat. Sonic, didn   t it start in    22  Smith Shawnee  Oklahoma .  Finchum    Shawnee, but it was called something else.  Smith Top Hat. Yes, Troy Smith started it. It was called Top Hat, then the first Sonic was in Stillwater.  Finchum They   ve redone that particular   .  Smith That   s what I heard.  Finchum It looks really nice, a new sign and even a statue, I think.  Smith Is that right? We   ll have to go by next time we   re in Stillwater.  Finchum It   s neat. You always see someone taking pictures. It   s a good photo-op. (Laughter) Being from Miami   I   ll switch gears a little bit too. The Glass House, it   s not called that anymore, but where the arch  over the Will Rogers Turnpike  is near Vinita.  Smith Yes.  Finchum Do you remember anything special about that when you were growing up? It was the  McDonald   s  Golden Arches, probably when you were    .  Smith It was yellow. I just always remember that we were close to home, whenever we would come back from somewhere, when you would cross underneath it.  Finchum Did you remember anything about inside of it?  Smith I don   t remember too much about the inside. We   ve been in it since they   ve redone it, and it is very, very nice.  Finchum It   s not golden anymore though, is it?  Smith No.  Finchum It   s gray.  Smith Yes, but it is very nice.  Finchum It was called the Glass House back when it was first built, and it was a restaurant business.  23  Smith Yes, McDonald   s was up in it.  Finchum Later, yes. In the   80s or early   90s, it switched to McDonald   s. I   m learning. (Laughter)That   s a different county though, I think. Craig County, I guess, isn   t it?  Smith I think so.  Finchum On the way to Ottawa. Since we   re talking a little bit about the county, is there anything special about Miami that you want to make sure we hear about?  Smith Yes, the Coleman Theater is our jewel, here in Miami. It   s a beautiful theater, and my husband actually sat on the board there, and it holds a special place in our heart. Our boys have both been on stage, and they were involved in Miami Little Theater, so they   ve done a few productions there at the Coleman Theater. It   s just a beautiful jewel here in our town.  Finchum Did they act, or sing, or dance, or do all of that, your sons?  Smith I guess they do all of it, whatever part they have to play. It   s usually just a small role, with them being still pretty young.  Finchum We should probably   it   s Spencer, and then who   s the second one?  Smith In 2008, we had our second son, Sutton     Finchum Any particular reason you chose that name?  Smith We get asked that a lot. Eddie Sutton is our favorite, that   s who coached the basketball team when Greg and I were at OSU, but we didn   t name Sutton after Eddie Sutton. (Laughs) I wish we had some great story to tell, but we just   something about that name, it stuck with us.  Finchum You wanted another S?  Smith Yes, and a unique name.  Finchum Well Spencer, did it come from any particular   .  Smith No.  Finchum Okay, so they   re equal there too. Four years apart, and they will probably go to OSU?  Smith I hope. 24  Finchum At least encouraged that way?  Smith Absolutely. They have a lot of orange and black, (laughs) and they sing the alma mater.  Finchum I usually ask people if they know the words.  Smith I   m training them.  Finchum Do you know the words?  Smith Oh, I could probably rattle them off.  Finchum Want to?  Smith Proud and immortal   I hope I don   t mess up.    Proud and immortal, bright shines your name.    (Laughs) See, I have to be singing it at a basketball game to get it all out.  Finchum Something about    we herald your name,    but I don   t   .  Smith See, we   ll have to   . (Laughs)  Finchum    Loyal and true    is in there somewhere.  Smith Yes,    to our alma mater, O-S-U.     Finchum There you go. You   ll come with the words later. They know it, that   s good. What is that you do here at Larco? What   s your role?  Smith I come in a couple a days a week and help pay bills, so that   s what I do now. After we had Spencer, I decided, or Greg and I decided, that I would stay at home to raise the boys.  Finchum And keep them active.  Smith Yes, and on top of that, I   m very involved in PTO  Parent Teacher Organization  and different boards around town.  Finchum Have you taught them to swim?  Smith I have, yes. We have a pool in our backyard.  Finchum They can go for the gold one day.  25  Smith Yes. After watching Michael Phelps, they were ready to be the next Michael Phelps.  Finchum That   s good. (Laughs) You can get out there with them. They can   t do it through the winter though.  Smith No. NEO  Northeastern Oklahoma A M College  has an indoor pool, but we don   t have a swim team here in Miami. Just through the high school, not for younger kids.  Finchum We   ve got the Coleman. Is there anything else that   s historical? I noticed the street sign said something about Goodrich, the tire company?  Smith Yes, part of it is still here. They   ve started tearing it down. It   s pretty contaminated site, I believe.  Finchum It was a big deal back then.  Smith It was a big deal in the   80s, I believe. My grandfather-in-law, Greg   s grandfather, worked out there, so it was   . BF Goodrich was vital to this town, so it devastated the town when they closed down.  Finchum When they pulled out. Since you really didn   t grow up in the town, you don   t have memories of it from younger days. Joplin is, what, maybe thirty minutes from here?  Smith It   s just thirty minutes down the road.  Finchum Really close.  Smith We were in Miami a lot, because like I said, my parents were born and raised here. My grandparents, they lived here forever, and I still have family that lives here.  Finchum Did it have a theater downtown, besides the Coleman, a movie theater?  Smith We do now, didn   t always, but we do now.  Finchum I usually look for marquis, and I didn   t see an older one, or if I did, I missed it, which is okay too. Where   s the public library from here?  Smith It   s just straight down     Finchum It was a Carnegie?  26  Smith    Main Street. Library? It was? I sit on the library board, and I didn   t know that. You know what, I take that back. I do know that, yes.  Finchum I think that building is not being used as a library, I don   t think. It   s a law firm   s office, I think, the Carnegie. That   s the extent of my knowledge, too, of the Miami library.  Smith It   s a city-county library, our public library is.  Finchum It   s a little different now. It was a Carnegie way back in the day. And the county fair, I   m assuming they have one?  Smith Yes, it just wrapped up over this last weekend. It   s always a big deal. It   s always the first week the kids are back in school, and a lot of fun.  Finchum Take yours and go?  Smith Yes, we don   t miss it. When the boys were younger, they would participate in the bucket calf show, so they would raise a calf. They weren   t old enough to be considered in the real beef show at the fair, so for the younger kids, to get them involved and to keep them involved, they let them have a bucket animal. My boys would raise a bucket calf with a lot of help from Mom and Dad, and then they would show it at the fair. They would ask them questions about raising their animal, so it   s a great learning experience for them because they have to learn what responsibility is.  Finchum Then did they get involved with 4-H or FFA?  Smith They have not. They haven   t since then. They   re ready to jump back in. My father-in-law has a farm, or a ranch just south of town, so they   re ready to get their hands dirty again. (Laughs) I don   t know if I   m ready for the commitment, (laughs) because it is a big time commitment. Not living on a ranch or a farm makes it a little bit inconvenient, but not too bad because it   s not too far south of town.  Finchum Their ages, they   re old enough to do 4-H, I guess.  Smith Spencer is, he   s in middle school, but Sutton, I think he has to wait another year. I think you have to be nine to participate.  Finchum I think that   s right, somewhere in there. That   s another reason that they   ll end up at OSU, if they get involved in 4-H Roundup and go to campus some, so maybe get your hands dirty. (Laughter)  Smith I think I enjoyed raising the calf as much as the boys did though.  27  Finchum It sure would be hard to part with it though, wouldn   t it?  Smith Yes, it   s very hard.  Finchum I would have trouble. I probably couldn   t. (Laughter) So they go to school here in Miami?  Smith They do. Spencer is at Will Rogers Middle School, and Sutton is at Rockdale Elementary.  Finchum Then the high school is just Miami High School?  Smith Yes.  Finchum What   s the mascot?  Smith The Wardogs, and I believe that we are the only Wardog mascot in the United States.  Finchum I   m not even sure what a wardog is.  Smith It is   . They   re bulldogs that they would send into the trenches. I hope I   m accurate     Finchum That   s a good guess.  Smith    during the war. Yes, the Wardogs.  Finchum I bet they were tough. (Laughter)  Smith That   s what my dad always told me, I believe. Yes, they   re tough.  Finchum How often do you get back to campus, on a regular basis or just on occasion?  Smith We go a few times a year.  Finchum Football games or   .  Smith Football and basketball games.  Finchum We   ll see how the basketball goes this year with a new coach. He looks like he   s going to be good.  Smith Yes. It   s always exciting. Bring somebody new in, see how the year   s going to turn out. 28  Finchum When you were there, do you remember who was president? From    96 to 2000, I   m not sure.  Smith President Halligan was the   .  Finchum Halligan was there, okay.  Smith Of the university, yes.  Finchum Yes, so did you have an occasion to meet him?  Smith I never got to, no. I never got to meet him.  Finchum I didn   t either. We came about that time. I just remember seeing him around campus, now that you mention his name, and then  David  Schmidly came after that, I think. He may have been   . You were already gone by then, I guess.  Smith I think so. I think President Halligan was there for all four years.  Finchum Then he went on to be in the state legislature, didn   t he?  Smith Yes.  Finchum I think he   s finished and not doing it again. I got off track there. Besides being in a sorority, were you involved in any other   like student government or anything like that at OSU?  Smith I was involved in the Education Student Council. That   s about the extent of my involvement.  Finchum It gives you some leadership experience too, and the sorority gives you that too, because you have to be in charge of various things there. I think it   s always interesting that they have similar colored dresses. You   ll see this group goes by.  Smith Yes. (Laughter)  Finchum It   s pretty. You get to see which colors they picked out and    hmmm, something must be going on,    carrying their high-heeled shoes and wearing their flip- flops.  Smith Yes, you   ve watched them go through Rush just not too long ago. (Laughter)  29  Finchum Yes. They must have had a drone to take a picture looking down. It was just a massive amount of people on  the corner of  Monroe and University.  Smith I bet. I hear the numbers are huge.  Finchum Massive amount of people, but it   s good for the University. The town seems more alive when they show up.  Smith Yes, I bet. (Laughs)  Finchum A lot more alive, yes.  Smith I know just having NEO here in Miami, when summer comes and all the students leave, it   s   . I live close to NEO, so it   s very quiet. It   s always fun to have those students back on campus and activity.  Finchum Makes a big difference. Did you have a housemother? I   m assuming you had a housemother.  Smith Yes.  Finchum The same one all four years, three years, four years?  Smith Actually, my freshman year, Mom Copeland, she was an elderly lady, so she was my first year. Then we had a new house mom, Mom Eades. Peggy Eades was our house mom for the final three.  Finchum That   s what you called them? Mom?  Smith Yes, we did. They   re so sweet to be our mom for the time that we spend in the house.  Finchum They keep pretty good tabs on you?  Smith Pretty good, yes. They had their own little living quarter though, so we wouldn   t disturb them too much. They would come always join us for dinners, and so it was   .  Finchum Share advice, or   .  Smith Yes.  Finchum Would they?  Smith Yes, when you would sit at their table at dinner. It was on Monday nights at formal dinner, you could go and sit at Mom   s table, the head table. 30  Finchum You got selected to, or you could just volunteer to, or did it rotate?  Smith I think it would just rotate through.  Finchum I wondered if they would offer too much advice, or just if you came and asked them for something.  Smith I think just if you went and asked, yes. (Laughs)  Finchum They were usually just the women? The husband wasn   t   . No, mainly single women for whatever reason. I think that would be a neat job too.  Smith Oh yes, I think it would be so much fun.  Finchum Have to teach them how to do their laundry, I guess. (Laughter)  Smith Yes, and to be there if somebody wanted to come in and just needed somebody to talk to.  Finchum Did you have a curfew?  Smith No curfew.  Finchum None?  Smith Not that I can remember, but I   m not a night owl.  Finchum What would the two of you do for dates then?  Smith We   d go to a lot of movies and Applebee   s a lot. It seemed like it was about the only   . El Chico was in town. We would go to El Chico all the time. Yes, and then different fraternity and sorority parties.  Finchum There were several   well, I don   t know about that several, one or two movie theaters. No, probably by that time just one.  Smith Just the one.  Finchum In    96, Hideaway was already there.  Smith Yes, we frequented Hideaway     Finchum It had been there for quite awhile.  Smith    and Joe   s. Those were all fun places to go. 31  Finchum The Tumbleweed?  Smith You know, in all my four years, I never went to the Tumbleweed. I tell people that, and they cannot believe it. I said,    I don   t know why I never went. I can   t believe it either.    (Laughs) I   m going to have to take my boys, at least point out the building or something, but I   ve never been.  Finchum I haven   t either, or I haven   t even been by it. I have a general idea where it is, but go for a calf fry, I guess. It was dancing mostly, wasn   t it?  Smith Right.  Finchum Your sorority would have had dances. They probably would not have had them there, so there wasn   t any need necessarily to go. Closer to the Strip, there was a couple places down on the Strip, I guess, that   .  Smith The Wormy Dog was on the Strip. It   s changed now. What else was on the Strip, well, Coney Island was there. What else was on the Strip?  Finchum The Wormy Dog?  Smith It was a saloon. Our sorority would have functions underneath at the Underdog, because if you weren   t of age, you couldn   t go upstairs to the real saloon.  Finchum They would card you to make sure?  Smith Oh, yes. I think they would even give you wristbands, or mark your hand, something, but definitely they were sticklers.  Finchum That   s good to know too. When you come out and look up, you see the Library, (laughter) after a night out. I think the other place on the Strip that   s not there anymore was Ron   s.  Smith Oh, yes.  Finchum Ron   s was on the far end, a burger place?  Smith Ron   s Hamburgers.  Finchum Then the laundromat was there. I don   t know if it   s still there.  Smith Duds and Suds. My husband used it all the time, all the time, and I used it a few times, when I was too lazy to do my own laundry.  32  Finchum Would they do it for you?  Smith Yes, you would take in your bags of dirty laundry, and they would wash it and fold it. Yes, you paid them to do your laundry, or you could stand there, and do your laundry yourself.  Finchum I didn   t know they had that.  Smith When it got back   you know, when your laundry was really backed up, yes     Finchum And you didn   t want to?  Smith    and you were in a pinch, yes. (Laughs)  Finchum It must have been reasonably priced for students to do it.  Smith Oh, somewhat. (Laughs)  Finchum Or you were just desperate?  Smith Yes, you were desperate.  Finchum Would he do his or just drop them off?  Smith No, he would drop it off.  Finchum Did he work while he was on campus?  Smith No, he didn   t. He would just work in the summers.  Finchum Tuition-wise, did you have scholarships, or your parents paid, or how did that work?  Smith I had financial aid, and then my out-of-state tuition was waived. At the time, they had a fee waiver if your ACT and GPA was a certain number, so that helped.  Finchum That helped, yes.  Smith It helped a lot.  Finchum If that hadn   t been in place     Smith I probably wouldn   t have gone, yes.  33  Finchum    you might not have gone. I wonder if they still do that. I don   t know.  Smith I don   t know if they still do. It was a great deal.  Finchum A significant difference for sure. Was it still that way when your sister came too?  Smith Yes.  Finchum Your parents got a good deal with two smart girls   well, three, but two that went to OSU. What about Greg? Did he have scholarships or did his parents pay?  Smith He had the   I believe it was just his first year, the valedictorian scholarship, because he was valedictorian of his class, so that helped.  Finchum That   s the first year, yes. You got out without owing too much student debt then. By the time you got out of OSU, you didn   t have any, basically.  Smith Well, I had to take loans to go through school, so I did have student loans.  Finchum I should   ve asked that instead of just assumed.  Smith No, I had student loans that I had to pay back.  Finchum We   ll see if the presidential election changes all that, won   t we?  Smith That   s right. (Laughter)  Finchum When Greg graduated, you would   ve gone to his ceremony, and it was probably in the football stadium too?  Smith It was out, yes.  Finchum Everybody in the family come to watch?  Smith Yes.  Finchum Big deal  Smith Big deal. That   s such a special day.  Finchum Were they doing the bagpipes then, or is that more of a recent thing?  Smith I think that   s more recent. I can   t remember if we walked because they do   . See, I don   t remember. That   s terrible. 34  Finchum Currently, they   ll come down, and everybody take turns walking across the stage. It   s quick because there   s so many.  Smith I have pictures of that day. I probably should   ve looked through them to bring back some memories. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s okay.  Smith I still have my medallion. I do, I have my medallion.  Finchum When you moved into Drummond, what sort of things did you take with you, like a refrigerator, microwave, those kinds of things?  Smith I think we rented it through the dorm like a combo, a refrigerator/microwave combo. It was little. I didn   t take a whole lot of stuff from home. The internet, it was just   . I remember that was my first email address at OSU, and so it was kind of   I feel like it was still new. Maybe I was out-of-date going to school.  Finchum Then when you moved into the house, you wouldn   t have needed that sort of thing.  Smith No, the kitchen was there.  Finchum Did you and your roommate have matching bedspreads?  Smith We didn   t ever match. I didn   t know my first roommate in Drummond, so it was a stranger. We met each other, I think, the day we moved in for Rush. Then in the sorority house, everybody just brought their own comforter. We didn   t all   it wasn   t all matchy-matchy. (Laughs)  Finchum I wondered.  Smith Some rooms probably were.  Finchum We   ve had people tell us that they just went with one suitcase, that   s all they went with. Then of course, you accumulate things.  Smith You definitely do. I just remember taking like carloads. I would fill up my back end, and take it down, and then the next trip home, I   d take another load down.  Finchum When you registered for class, was it on computer or did you have to stand in line with paper and pencil? Do you remember?  35  Smith I think it was paper and pencil. I just sat down face-to-face with a     Finchum With someone?  Smith    with someone.  Finchum They probably punched it into the computer then. That   s changed a lot too.  Smith It   s probably all done. Do people even have to go on campus anymore?  Finchum I don   t much think that they do really. Not even to   maybe to pay your bursar account, and maybe not even then. I know registering you don   t, you just do it all online. Computers weren   t   they were just, you   re right, they were just beginning to switch. The Library, I don   t know. No, the card catalog was gone by the time   . You remember it?  Smith Yes, I remember the card catalog. (Laughs)  Finchum Okay, wasn   t sure in    96 if the big one there, as you come up the steps, if it was gone by then or not. I don   t remember seeing it there, when I started in    99, so it must have gone somewhere in that mix there. Change we can accept. It   s sad somedays.  Smith I don   t even think my boys know what a card catalog is. (Laughs)  Finchum If you want to show them one, I know where one is. It   s in the back, inner sanctum of the Library, just to have I think as much as anything. It   s cool though. I think they   re neat to see. That   s changed. Then you didn   t have a car? You had a car.  Smith I did have a car.  Finchum You had a car because you drove from your house to just up the block or two. Then most of your sorority sisters had a car, I guess?  Smith Yes, most of us did.  Finchum They didn   t have to bum rides too much.  Smith Yes, not too many.  Finchum Would you go to away games when you were there?  Smith Not too many away games. I remember   well, when OSU made it to the Alamo Bowl, I remember a group of us going to San Antonio, so that was a fun time. 36  Finchum Since you didn   t try out for cheerleading your first year, you didn   t think about doing it the second or third, just one and done?  Smith No, because I didn   t stick with any workouts or gymnastics, so no, I didn   t. I admire all the cheerleaders and pom girls because it takes so much of their time. I had some pledge sisters that were pom girls, and quite a few girls in our house were pom girls and cheerleaders, and they were gone all the time. It was very demanding.  Finchum Band wasn   t part of your high school and college experience?  Smith I wasn   t very involved in the band. I didn   t ever take up a musical instrument, so I wish I did now because it would be nice.  Finchum You were too busy cheering.  Smith I did, I did. (Laughs)  Finchum It   s different.  Smith I like to move, (laughter) so stay active.  Finchum What do you do today to stay active, besides swim?  Smith I walk a lot. I do Pilates two days a week, and I really enjoy Pilates. The Pilates studio that I go to, we rotate around, and we do barre classes, so that   s kind of a dance. Then we do silks, so it   s kind of an aerial   I don   t want to say acrobatics.  Finchum I   ve seen pictures of it.  Smith Yes, so I really enjoy all that.  Finchum You have to have upper arm strength to do those. That   s cool too.  Smith It   s fun that it   s mixed up all the time, so you don   t ever get bored.  Finchum Maybe your sons could be cheerleaders.  Smith Maybe. They were in gymnastics for a while, but then their schedules with other sports, it gets too   . Something had to go, and unfortunately, it was gymnastics this year.  Finchum Maybe we   ll work for them to be Pete.  37  Smith That   s right. (Laughs)  Finchum Be Pistol Pete. That   s a pretty good gig. I know it   s time-consuming for them too, but it   s a   they get to do and see so many people, make a good impression, and meet a lot of interesting people.  Smith A lot, and what a way to represent the University, to be Pete.  Finchum If your sons are, do my math here, one would be twelve, and then eight?  Smith Yes, twelve and eight.  Finchum In ten years, I   ll still be at OSU. I   ll expect to see Spencer or Sutton come through.  Smith That   s right.  Finchum Pistol Pete, we   ll work on that. We have some interviews with some former Pistol Petes, if they   re interested at some point, just to hear some of them detail what all is involved.  Smith I think one of the current Pistol Petes is   he   s from around here because he went to church with us for a while, and then they moved. I actually had him in my Awana group.  Finchum They do neat things, even do weddings and all sorts of things. Yes, neat part of OSU history.  Smith All events, yes. It is.  Finchum Do you have a favorite memory or two from your time on campus?  Smith Probably Homecoming is one of my favorite memories. I don   t know that I have a specific Homecoming, but there   s just so many activities that whole week. With it being fall, I don   t   just the change of season, I don   t know. There   s so much excitement and energy on campus, I think. I   m sure everybody says Homecoming, but really that is so special to the University.  Finchum Did your house win any of the house decs or any awards while you were there?  Smith Oh gosh, I   m sure. I think, I   m sure we probably did. (Laughs)  Finchum That was an exciting day. They get real excited in the stadium when the names gets called. A lot of hard work paid off.  38  Smith Yes, it does.  Finchum Did Greg propose to you on campus?  Smith He didn   t. We actually   we were in Miami. We came home, it was Halloween. I have twin nephews, or my sister has twin boys, and then my sister-in-law, she has three boys. I   m trying to think, it was    99, so we came home for Halloween because we wanted to see our nephews, three of them at the time. We were home at his parents    house, and he gave me a bag of Halloween candy, and he proposed to me.  Finchum Orange and black, that   s what comes to mind.  Smith Yes, orange and black.  Finchum Halloween   s orange and black.  Smith I ran over to my grandparents, because like I said, their yard   s kind of joined. It was     Finchum That   s sweet.  Smith It was, so we were around family.  Finchum What kind of candy?  Smith Oh, I still have it in my drawer. I don   t even know what candy   chocolate because I love chocolate.  Finchum Not candy corn? That   s what I think of for Halloween, so no.  Smith None of it   s melted. I just keep it in my nightstand drawer.  Finchum Did you get married here in Miami?  Smith We got married in Joplin.  Finchum In this part of the world. Then when you all came back here was in two thousand     Smith Four.  Finchum    four. You   ve been here twelve years so far. Do you plan to stay?  Smith Yes.  39  Finchum And your parents still     Smith Yes, they   re still close.  Finchum    in the area? The grandparents are involved, and OSU is close.  Smith Yes, it is. OSU is close.  Finchum Anything else you want to add before we close? Do you want to talk more about Greg? We can.  Smith Sure, yes.  Finchum He came back here and was working for  his  dad, and then.     Smith He was working for his dad. Let   s see, in 2014, in March     Finchum He was diagnosed with   .  Smith    of 2014, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and continued to work right alongside his dad. He went for treatment in Dallas, and then last July, July 2015, he passed away, but since then   .  Finchum I noticed that they had   . I looked up   came across a YouTube video, where all of your friends had done a video     Smith Oh, yes. I forgot about that.  Finchum    to the tune,    Happy.     Smith Yes,    Happy.     Finchum There were a lot of OSU fans in that.  Smith A lot  We have a lot of friends here that are OSU supporters or alums. Yes, so that was   . Greg had surgery in April of 2015, no, of 2014. My years are all mixed up. In May, we moved to Dallas so he could go through radiation and be closer to his neuro-oncologist. When we moved, all of our friends back here in Miami, they organized a flash mob. They recorded this flash mob and sent it to us once we got to Dallas, showing their support. My sister came up with the slogan of    Smith Strong,    so there are lots of Smith Strong shirts floating around. They   re orange and black, so it was incredible to see all the support from everyone. I   m sorry, I didn   t think I   d get this emotional.  Finchum It   s fine. We don   t have to if you don   t want to. 40  Smith Actually with Greg being from Miami, he had known Larry Reece because Larry is from here. Larry was very supportive of Greg through all of his treatment. When Larry was diagnosed with throat cancer, he actually invited us down to, the boys, and I, and Greg, to a game. He and Greg got to bond, so that was really special because the support was unbelievable, humbling actually. Since Greg has passed, this last weekend, we had a memorial golf tournament in his memory because I had the idea to   I wanted to make sure that children who had lost a parent to cancer could continue with their education, because it is so devastating.  With the help of Spencer Haines, who is a dear, dear friend, he helped me work with the  OSU  Foundation to come up with this scholarship. We wanted it to be an endowed scholarship, and so this first annual golf tournament that we had over the weekend, we were able to fully endow the scholarship. The scholarship will be given to   . First priority is to students who have lost a parent to cancer, or whose parents have been affected by cancer, or if they have personally been affected by cancer. We want to make sure that they have the opportunity to further their education, and especially at OSU because it is such a special place. It was such a special place to Greg and I, and always will be to me and my family.  Finchum What   s it called?  Smith It   s the Gregory D. Smith Family Endowed Scholarship.  Finchum And it can be any major?  Smith Yes. Students will have to self-identify themselves, but yes. We were able to fully fund it over the weekend, plus some. It   s incredible. It will just continue to grow.  Finchum I don   t have any idea how much it takes to endow.  Smith Twenty-five thousand  dollars  is the minimum to endow a scholarship.  Finchum Did Greg play golf?  Smith Golf was his passion. He played all through high school and continued to play. That   s actually one way he knew something wasn   t right before he was diagnosed. He could not get his golf ball to stay on his tee when he would tee off, because he had a little bit of a tremor in his hands. Then anytime he would drive the ball, it wouldn   t ever go straight. He thought,    I really need to practice my game.    (Laughs) Come to find out that   s not what it was. Something else was going on.  41  Finchum Did he ever get a hole-in-one?  Smith He never told   I don   t know. He never     Finchum You would know if he did.  Smith    told me if he got a hole-in-one.  Finchum That   s something they brag about, I guess, so you would know if he did.  Smith That   s why we picked a golf tournament because that was   .  Finchum Where did you have it?  Smith We had it at LaFortune  Park  Golf Course in Tulsa, so that people from Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, and his fraternity brothers from Kansas City   . It was kind of a central location.  Finchum Did we say what his fraternity was?  Smith He was a Sigma Nu. His pledge class is very, very close, and they   ve stayed very good friends since they graduated from OSU, and they   re very supportive of each other.  Finchum Do you play golf?  Smith I don   t. Greg tried to teach me, but I   m not very patient. I want to be good right away and golf takes time. I play a round with Spencer and Sutton now because I want them to love the game like Greg did.  Finchum Drive the cart.  Smith Yes. (Laughter) I can drive that golf cart.  Finchum That   s what I could do too. I couldn   t do the other. I tried, can   t do it. That   s a sweet   so that   ll go on every year?  Smith It will. We   re going to make it an annual golf tournament.  Finchum Then all the funds will go into this scholarship, keep growing so you may end up having two down the road.  Smith That is our goal, as many as we can because so many people, especially these days, are affected by cancer.  42  Finchum Yes, true. Would it be good for a year, or a semester, or a certain amount per   .  Smith I believe it   s a certain amount per year.  Finchum They could reapply, could get it a second time, if needed?  Smith Yes.  Finchum That   s neat. That was very tough, to go through all of that, and the family. That video was just priceless too, even had an OU fan in there.  Smith Probably, with him going to law school at OU.  Finchum OU is okay.  Smith It is.  Finchum Everybody likes their schools, and that   s fine.  Smith Right. So many people, after the Smith Strong shirts were out, they would send us pictures of where they were wearing their Smith Strong shirt, and who they got to put their Smith Strong shirt on. We have photobooks, two photobooks, full of pictures of everybody in their Smith Strong shirt. It   s very meaningful.  Finchum Smiths, are they from here? Were they originally from here, his parents?  Smith Yes, they were born and raised here in Miami. Yes, still here and yes, supporting the community.  Finchum The winners of this endowed should get a shirt that says,    Smith Strong.    (Laughs) That   s a very good idea. Neat and giving back, gives back.  Smith Yes.  Finchum I think he would approve, wouldn   t he?  Smith I hope so. I think so.  Finchum And golf, to boot.  Smith Yes.  Finchum Anything else you want to add?  43  Smith I don   t know, not that I can think of. I think we covered it.  Finchum Do you want to try the alma mater again?  Smith Oh, you   ll have to give me just a minute. I   ve got to get the tune in my head. I don   t know that I   m going to say it right.    Proud and immortal      . Oh my goodness. See, I need to write it down.    Proud and immortal, bright shines your name. Oklahoma State, we herald your fame. Ever you   ll find us loyal and true. To our alma mater, O-S-U.     Finchum That sounds right.  Smith I think I got it, (laughs) without it playing in the background.  Finchum You can sing it.  Smith I can sing it, but I   m not about to sing it. (Laughter)  Finchum I was going to give you an opportunity to.  Smith Oh no.  Finchum We   ll end on the note that you got the words right.  Smith I did.  Finchum Thank you for having me today and sharing your story.  Smith Thank you so much for coming.  Finchum It   s been great.  Smith Thank you.  -------  -------
