 Finchum  Mihura  Today is April 18, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum and I   m here with  Jim Mihura and this is part of the 1959 NCAA Baseball Championship  50 year reunion. Welcome back to campus.  Glad to be here.  What influenced you to come to OSU?  Well, probably because of the close proximity to Ripley, Oklahoma,  where I graduated from.  That   s not too far from here.  Not too far, 16 or 18 miles.  I   m assuming you played high school baseball as well?  In high school, we had baseball and basketball and nothing else and I  played those two sports.  What position did you play for baseball?  I was the pitcher.  Were you recruited by other schools?  I was not recruited by anybody. I just walked on here and then earned a  partial scholarship.  Did you have jobs as well while you were a student?  I did have a job for awhile at the Stillwater Feed and Mill, which was a  5  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  good incentive for me to get a college education because I didn   t want to  work there the rest of my life.  As a student athlete, did you have to work?  No, actually I came here one year and then I went to the Service for two  years, played baseball in Germany two years. Then came back on the GI  Bill and got  91 a month, which back then was a lot of money, and  survived on that so then I got a partial scholarship once I walked on and  earned a partial scholarship, I think books and tuition. That helped some  more. So that   s how I got on the team.  So what year did you enroll?  I enrolled here in    56 and I   d already gone a year before. I went to the  Service, which back then freshman couldn   t play on the varsity  team   anyway. But when I came in    56 I was a sophomore so I played three  years then.  And then graduated in   ?     59.  So you were here during the name change?  Yes I was. I believe that was in    58.  Did you have an opinion?  Yeah, I didn   t like the name change. But I like it now.  (Laughter) That   s what most folks say.  Yeah, got used to it.  What was your major?  Business education. My first job out here was down the road, at Perkins,  ten miles as a coach and taught and coached down there three years.  Then went to Murray State College seven years as a business manager,  then I was a high school principal in six high schools. Since then I  substitute taught in 50 schools, which I don   t know anybody that can say  that. I   m sure I am the best substitute in the world because every school I  taught in they told me I was the best sub they ever had.  Well, that   s a good thing.  6  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  But I get along with kids and do real well with them. My main  accomplishment I think is helping kids that other people were not able to  help. I take a lot of pride and put in a lot of effort to do that.  Encourage a lot of them to play baseball?  Not so much that but just to get along in this world.  Were you the first in your family to go to college?  I was the last in my family to go to college. I was the ninth of ten  children, so I was down the list. My younger sister didn   t go to college,  so I was the last to go to college.  Did they all go here?  No. I had two brothers that went here and another brother went to what  was then Central State at Edmond. A daughter went here and she got her  Doctor   s degree in only 15 years, after changing her major five times  and I had a son that went to MIT and got his Master   s there.  When you were playing baseball, let   s talk a little bit about the year  1959, tell us a little bit about that.  Well, of course, I started in    56 and the very first game we played I say I  was a pitcher, but more accurately I was a relief pitcher, but still a  pitcher. Very first game I was the fourth pitcher in the game in an extra  inning game and we won the game, so I got the victory was 1 and 0. I  visualized winding up my career being about 30 and 0. But three years  later, when it was all over, I was still 1 and 0, because we had some  really good pitchers and they almost always pitched a complete game. I  think in three years I only played in eight games and I didn   t get any  more win or loss decisions. I only got the decision in that one game. So  anyway, it was frustrating to not get to play any more than I did, but  surely we had about eight or nine really good pitchers. Of course, we  wouldn   t have won the National Championship if we hadn   t have had  them.  How   d you do the year before in 1958?  Well, actually I was injured in batting practice when I was in Arkansas.  They hit a line drive back to me and I threw my right hand up in front of  my face to keep from getting hit in the face and I wasn   t able to pitch the  rest of that year. I always pitched fine, except I didn   t get in games.  We   d have inter-squad games and like Dick Soergel, one of our main  pitchers, today he told me again, he says,    I   ve never beaten you,    but  7  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  we played inter-squad games. Dick Soergel was a three-sport letterman,  our last three-sport letterman. He was one of our three starters, him and  Joel Horlen, and Roy Peterson. Of course, Joel Horlen played in the  majors 11 years with the White Sox.  What was travelling like with the team?  Well, it was most enjoyable. We almost always went in cars. It was just  most enjoyable being part of the team because you couldn   t get a group  of guys that big in number that got along so well. There wasn   t any  bickering or cliques or anything. Everybody got along with everybody  just like truly one big happy family.  Any favorite funny stories?  Oh, I don   t have time to list all those. I might mention two or three little  things the teammates reminded me of, different ones. I always was kind  of the ring leader on razzing the other team or even the refs or the umps,  had to be careful about that. Like Jim Dobson told me he remembered  we were playing Iowa State and this left-handed pitcher was a big  heavy-set pitcher, overweight, and he would come off the mound kind of  sideways and every time he would do that I would holler,    Tilt     It kind  of threw him off.  Then somebody else said when we played Arkansas, they were the  Razorbacks, and their clean-up hitter was a big fat guy. Every time the  pitcher would get about halfway through his windup, them being  Razorbacks, I   d holler out,    You fat hog     He struck out every time  because I was throwing him off. Things like that, we just seemed to  harass the other team more than teams do today. They don   t seem to do  that so much.  Any practical jokes on teammates?  Well, I don   t think we did that very much like you might think. Or at  least, I don   t recall that.  What were practice facilities like then?  We were the original cavemen down in the basement of Gallagher-Iba  when the floor was red clay and it   d be dusty and looked nothing like it  looks today. It was just like a dungeon down there and looked like  maybe about three light bulbs. It was dark and dingy, but we had a  batting cage and we took batting practice down there. We could throw to  a catcher. The pitchers could throw to a catcher and take batting  practice. We   d sometimes get in the corner and take bunting practice but  8  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  it was really a depressing thing like one of the guys said today, we   d go  to Houston first thing every year, go down there where it was warmer.  We   d go down there looking like a bunch of Albinos because we   d been  down there in the dungeon. Everybody down there would have tans and  we   d be white. But we usually beat them so they didn   t say much about  that.  What was the stadium like then?  Well, the stadium was kind of, the stands were I say pretty much like  rodeo stands where you have these bleachers. If you   re behind them you  can see through them. They   re open bleachers just like you see thrown  up at a city park or ball park. Today the stadium looks so magnificent to  us and we hear talk about they   re maybe going to build another stadium.  We don   t see the necessity of that. This is so grandiose compared to  what we played, kind of like we played in a cow pasture almost. But no  comparison to the stadium today, it   s so much better.  Were there lots of fans in the stands usually?  No, there weren   t many fans. Not even like there are today when we  won the National Championship. It was kind of like nobody expected us  to, it came as a surprise. We had guys coming in here walking in from  little old towns, like I came from Ripley, Tim Green from Asher, and  from Coyle and just not even hardly recruited, just show up. And turned  out they happened to be pretty good ball players and just kept winning.  Some from big schools and mostly from the little schools, it didn   t  matter, everybody just seemed to hit it off. We really had a great  camaraderie.  Did the coach have anything to do with that?  Not really. The coach had his favorites and I was not one of them. I  wouldn   t practice on Sunday because I chose to not practice on Sunday  and he didn   t like that. I believe that   s one of the main reasons he and I  didn   t get along as well as we should have. I probably didn   t do my part  to get along either. I know before we went to Texas one time, I was  growing a beard, which makes no sense at all. I don   t know why I grew  a beard, I don   t even like beards. But anyway, the day before we went he  said,    If you   re going to go to Houston, you   re going to shave that  beard.    So I came and I shaved it. But we went out to the field down  there and somehow or another I got left behind, maybe on purpose, I  don   t know, but I finally made it out to the field and when I did they  were having a team meeting out in the outfield, sitting on the grass there  before the game. And I came walking across the field and Ben Bancroft  told me this later, I didn   t hear the coach say it, he looked up and saw  9  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  me coming across the field, he said,    Well, here comes Jesus Christ.     (Laughs) Because of my not playing on Sunday, I guess. Him and I  really didn   t get along and that   s all I can say about that. To say anything  more would be not appropriate so we just didn   t get along. But he  tolerated me and I tolerated him is about the kindest thing I could say  about it.  Did they have food at the games?  No. No, we didn   t have any.  Hot dogs?  You mean for the public or the players or what do you mean?  Either one.  Well, I don   t remember that. We didn   t have many fringe benefits back  then. (Laughs) You know like it seems like they do today. I don   t know  why that was, we didn   t miss them and we weren   t used to them. We  just didn   t have them.  When you weren   t playing baseball what were you doing?  Well, you being a librarian, you might be happy to hear this answer.  Many, many is the night I   ve been in that library when it closes at  midnight. Spent a lot of hours in the library and largely because I felt  like I had such poor preparation for coming to college. I just felt like I  was behind in every class that I ever enrolled in. I always did poorly in  every class at the beginning of the semester and finally by the end of the  semester I was kind of catching on to what it was I was supposed to  know. But it didn   t come easy. I was poorly prepared and I had to work,  I felt like, harder than most people had to work to get it. Strangely  enough, I didn   t mind studying. I liked to have my fun like anybody but  I don   t know hardly how anyone could   ve spent more time in that library  than I did. But if it stayed open later than midnight I   d have still been in  it.  It stays open until 2:00 now.     Til 2:00. Well, maybe it   s a good thing I went then and not now  because I   d have probably stayed    til 2:00.  Were there any other favorite spots on campus?  Well, the Student Union. We   d go there and back then they seemed to  10  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  jitterbug quite a bit. I never was a dancer but kind of wanted to be but   was  kind of too bashful to try it. But we   d go up there and watch the  girls dance. That was a favorite pastime, to do that. Probably should   ve  been in the library some of that time, but we   d go there daily it seemed  like and we had our favorite girls that we   d watch. There were two  girls   one was dark black headed, one was blonde. They were in  engineering. We didn   t know them personally but we watched them  every day, they were so pretty. They had their slide rules they   d carry  just like back then, they don   t even carry slide rules anymore, but back  then they carried slide rules just like the guys in engineering. I don   t  know if they did it for attention but they were sure getting the attention.  (Laughter) I don   t know their names or anything but we   d watch for  them every day at some hour they seemed to show up every day. But I  don   t know. I never drank, never got into the drinking parties and if the  guys did I didn   t know about it. As far as I know that wasn   t part of our  routine or anybody   s routine.  Did you live on campus?  No, I lived in an apartment down on Duncan Street, three or four blocks  from the school. I had a bicycle that I paid  2 for and I painted it with a  can of silver spray paint. I painted every inch of it silver, the tires and  everything, the seat, the handlebars, everything was silver. I   d get on  that bicycle and I   d say,    Hi ho, Silver away     (Laughter) I don   t even  know what happened to that bike but it was a small monetary loss  because I only paid  2 for it.  What can you tell me about your graduation day?  Well, it   d be nice if I could tell you something, but I can hardly  remember the graduation day.  Did your parents come?  No, my father actually died when I was one year old. My mother never  ever drove a vehicle. We never ever had a vehicle growing up in our  family. So to come to Stillwater from Ripley was like today going from  here to New York City as far as that goes. She had 10 kids graduate  from high school and most of them graduate from college so graduation  to her was no big deal, just another day, you know. It   s kind of become  that way with me. I   ve been a principal all the time and seen so many  graduations, subbed in 50 schools. I know it   s a very important day for  people but it   s kind of just become an old hat to me because I   ve seen  hundreds of them it seems.  How often do you come back to campus?  11  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Well, I came this year to every basketball game which I, for the first  time in my life, had season tickets to. Then I usually come to two or  three football games and two or three baseball games. I really was  interested in basketball more than anything. I actually played one year of  basketball here under Hank Iba when Eddie Sutton was playing. I played  one year with him. But I actually never got a suit for the main team.  Back then we had 27 guys out for the team and they had junior varsity  games or B games, whatever you want to call them, back then and I  played in those but I never got a varsity suit. That was really a grueling  experience. We had long practices, like four hours a day. Today, they  have time limits on how much you can practice. Back then they didn   t. It  just seemed to go on and on forever. That was a very good experience.  In fact one of my main regrets is that I didn   t come out the next two  years. I was out there as a sophomore and I really did enjoy it.  They had walk-ons in that too?  Yeah. Probably six or eight of those guys were walk-ons. I think I was  the last one and as far as I was concerned, I was 27th out of 27 on the  depth chart and I came up a few notches but not much so I just never got  a varsity suit.  Did you get to travel with them though for that one year?  No, none of the B guys. We didn   t have B games away from home. They  were all just at home. But one year, I wasn   t on the varsity, we did beat  Wilt Chamberlain, which not many teams beat Wilt Chamberlain. We  beat them  by  two points, it was 52 to 54 I believe or right at that level.  I think they had a walk-out the next day, the school did.  That   s exciting.  Yeah, that was exciting.  Any stories about Theta pond?  Well, I wasn   t involved in anything, but I observed a lot of people being  thrown into Theta pond. Even when it had ice on it in the winter time,  that didn   t slow anybody down from getting thrown in there. Some  people would be thrown in willingly and some people would fight  fiercely not to be thrown in. Saw all levels of efforts to be thrown in or  not thrown in.  Any favorite professors?  Well, I had a professor named Robert Lowry. I taught school at Perkins  12  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  for three years and then later I got a call from Murray State College  saying that Robert Lowry had recommended me to be their business  manager, which sorely surprised me because I had no idea he would  even remember who I was. It was a pretty big shock that he would out of  the clear blue sky recommend me to be the business manager and I was  the business manager down there seven years. But all those professors,  of course, are no longer here. They   re at least retired.  Do you remember any Pistol Pete stories?  No, not really, other than he was from Perkins and I taught at Perkins  three years. Seems like I had three or four houses pointed out to me  where he used to live. Everybody wanted to have credit for knowing him  or having rented a house to him or something. I know he was an actual  person, but I didn   t ever know him personally or anything like that.  Well, OSU has a very strong following from alumni. Do you have any  thoughts on why that is?  Well, I just think they have a different type of student that comes here in  general. A down-home type, kind of dependable person, reliable person,  one with the right kind of values more so than some other schools and  some whose names I won   t even mention. But I still think we have a  better quality of person that comes here, in general, than a lot of schools.  Everybody sports their orange.  Right.  Lots of orange.  See when I was in school here, they didn   t support the orange like they  do now. But I really enjoy the fact that they do wear the orange like they  do now. They wore some orange back then, but now almost everybody,  like to the football game or basketball game particularly, come in orange  and I think that   s pretty neat.  Did you have a favorite building? Besides the library.  Well, my heart is kind of warm for Old Central. I   ve had some classes in  Old Central, just kind of a nostalgic building. There are not many  buildings on the campus like that.  No. I   m looking forward to when they re-open it. I   ve not been in it.  Oh, I didn   t even know it was closed.  13  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  Finchum  Mihura  They   re renovating it.  Oh, I   d like to see it when it   s renovated. I had various and sundry  classes in there. Had a speech class in there and at least initially and I  don   t know about now but I used to really, really be poor at giving a  speech, but after being a principal all those years I kind of came up a  notch on that at least. But one thing I remember from speech class is,  when you get up to give a speech, don   t tell the people that you   re a poor  speaker. If you are a poor speaker, at least make them figure it out.  Don   t tell them. (Laughs) I thought that was pretty good advice.  Well we just got the signal. Is there anything else we haven   t talked  about that you want to make sure we cover?  No, I   d say that covers it pretty good and I appreciate your tolerance  with me.  Thank you very much for sharing your stories with us today.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
