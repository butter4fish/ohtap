 Milligan First off, this is Sarah Milligan with the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program at the Oklahoma State University Library. Today   s date is August  27, 2015. I   m in Altus, Oklahoma, which is Jackson County, and I am  talking with Glen Winters at the Jackson County Farm Bureau. We   re in his  office. We   re doing this interview as a part of the Cowboys in Every County  oral history project with the O-STATE Stories project. That   s a long  introduction. Sorry.  Winters It is   Milligan Now we   ll remember why we   re here. My first question, just tell me a little  bit about yourself, where you grew up, who your parents are, if you have  siblings, that good stuff.  Winters I was born in Mangum, Oklahoma, December 11, 1954. Grew up there in  Mangum. My mother and dad, Zane and Frena Winters, were there. I had  two siblings, an older brother, Greg, that does have a doctorate degree from  Oklahoma State and currently serves as the superintendent of the vo-tech  school there at Canadian Valley  Electric Cooperative . I have a younger  brother, Gary, that   s not an OSU grad. In fact, both of my brothers went to  school at Weatherford  Southwestern Oklahoma State University  and got  their undergraduate degree. Gary is a farm bureau agent at Weatherford, and  like I say, Greg, he   s the superintendent there at the vo-tech school.  I was the only one that went, after two years of junior college, went to  Oklahoma State and got a degree in vocational agriculture. I got a degree in  1977, and literally, of course, left the University and went out to my in-laws.  They lived out west of Mangum at a little community called Reed   Oklahoma , and we stayed with them for, I don   t know, two or three  months while I interviewed for jobs and wound up taking my first teaching  job at a little school at Central High  Oklahoma , which is a small, rural  school out between Lawton  Oklahoma , Marlow  Oklahoma , and Duncan   Oklahoma . I had students that had literally all three phone exchanges at the  time. Cell phones were nothing at that point. All of them had different  5  addresses with different zip codes. I had to learn all the zip codes for the  three different schools and taught two years there.  I then had the opportunity to, through a recruitment type thing, to come to  Altus. We had had somewhat, some success as a vo-ag instructor there and  had won some awards and done some things. With that said, the guy that  was teaching at Altus at that time was Larry McLaughlin. Larry and I had  went to college together at junior college, as well as Oklahoma State  University, and he saw, I guess, something in me that he wanted at Altus. He  heavily recruited me, and I came and interviewed with Dr. Morris Foster,  the superintendent of the schools. Morris was an interesting gentleman. He  had a psychology degree, and I tell everybody he used that degree against  me, I think, to recruit me to come to Altus. (Laughs)  At the time, because of our military base and the impact money that they got  because of the military, they were actually the highest-paying school in  Oklahoma at the time. And of course, that got me within thirty-five miles of  my hometown, which was interesting and an attractant, I guess, for my wife  and I to be able to come back home, so to speak. Her aunt and uncle  actually, where we landed out northeast of town in an area there, her aunt  and uncle lived a mile from us. So we had frequented that area quite a bit as  we were dating and then as we got married and would come to family  functions. Well, a lot of them were being hosted there. It was almost a  coming home event whenever we come to Altus  We started our family while we were at Central. My oldest son, Jed, was  born there in Duncan, and of course, as an infant, we moved here. He was  born in February, and we moved here in July, I guess. Kind of an interesting  story, a side note, the place we wound up buying was for sale. I being a  promoter a little bit, I had encouraged our Ag chapter at Central. Moving to  Altus, but I   m still helping Central. We had two students that I went out and  helped gather up enough money to take to the Washington Leadership  Camp, and one of the schoolboard members was the former Ag teacher at  Central. That guy, his name was Freddie Garrett. He   s deceased now,  Freddie. I was a pallbearer at his funeral.  Freddie, whenever he left the Ag teaching job, he went straight to high  school principal. I   m dumb, green, don   t know what I   m supposed to be  doing, but Freddie was a great mentor, I mean, and a good friend. He would  go to a schoolboard meeting and call me the next day or come out to the Ag  barn. He   d say,    Well, I got you a telephone for the Ag building    or    I got  you an expense account.    Well, then after he got off of that gig as being a  principal, he went to work for Farm Bureau, and then he got on my  schoolboard. That   s when the    cha-ching    went to happening. I mean, every  time I turned around, Freddie was getting me a new pickup, or he was doing  6  this or whatever. Very good to me and my family and to the Ag chapter.  Very dedicated guy.  Anyway, the opportunity at Altus came about, and that was a very tough  decision because those people had treated us well. Still got many, many  friends I talk to almost weekly in that community. Even after I came here, a  lot of those parents had so much loyalty to me that they wanted me to  continue to help their children, and it took quite a while to wean them off.  Mr. Curry that followed me, he and I became very good friends, and I know  it had to be a little bit of a   I don   t know, a slap in the face to him or  something,    Here   s this guy that   s already gone is still helping my kids.    We  got past that, and he and I, again, are good friends.  They never changed teachers. It worked out good for them. Of course, I  came on to Altus, and we were very, very, very successful here. Won lots of  awards for our students, whether it be in the show ring, whether it be in the  public speaking arena, whether it be in the parliamentary procedure deal.  We had two state champion parli-pro  parliamentary procedure  teams both  years I taught here. I contend that if we would have continued to teach we  would have had state champions several more years because we had the deal  figured out. We had the kids motivated. They were fighting to get on that  team. We coached three different teams. We had what we called a freshman  team, we had what we call the mixed team, and then we had a senior team.  Of course, the senior team was the one that would go compete, and even  across the state, Rick Davis is the president of the OSU Board of Regents  today.  Rick was the president of the Guthrie  Oklahoma  chapter that beat me  whenever I was at Central, and they went on to win the state championship.  I took seven freshmen at Central and competed against Mr. Muncrief,  another OSU guy. Has taught forty-three years, I think, at Marlow, and his  last year of retirement, he had Kent Boggs, which is now the head of or  executive secretary, I think, is his title of the FFA. That office is there in  Stillwater. Kent did his student teaching under Mr. Muncrief, but then Kent  came back and taught with Ernest, I think. Then he later on went to Elgin   Oklahoma , but Kent and I became very good friends.  For me to take seven freshmen and beat Mr. Muncrief in parliamentary  procedure was just unheard of. Ernest, he went on that year and I think won  four or six state champion public speeches in FFA  Future Farmers of  America , and I attribute to the fact that you didn   t have to participate in  parliamentary procedure. You could focus more on your public speaking,  and you did very well with that. (Laughs) Once we won there, we had to go  compete against Mr. Davis, and he beat us up pretty bad. Rick   s a sharp guy,  and his dad, Ernest, was a great guy.  7  Even after I came to Altus, Ernest Davis ran, in my opinion   I didn   t know  him personally. I never met the man but had a million phone calls from him.  They had a three-teacher department there, and all three of those teachers,  after that year, Raymond Cochran wound up being the southwest district  supervisor. Left Guthrie. You had the Stephens family, which became  legends in their own right at Chickasha  Oklahoma . Husband and wife  teaching team were there, and then Lloyd Fletcher, very, very good friend of  mine, came back home and taught at Mangum. He was raised at Granite   Oklahoma . That was his deal, and in fact, Lloyd wound up buying the very  first show hog that Jed showed that made the premium auction at Jackson  County that first year and had the pre-champion spot at Barrow. Got along  pretty good with that.  Anyway, Mr. Davis, like I say, while I was teaching at Altus, did everything  up to and including just about giving me a farm to move to Guthrie to teach.  I was home. I just stayed. Again, we lived out northeast of town, and of  course, as we taught here, Adam was born in    81. He   s my youngest son.  Both boys have got a degree in Ag-Econ from Oklahoma State University,  they both lived in the AGR  Alpha Gamma Rho  fraternity. Jed was on  several different deals. He   s probably one of the only young men that ever  attended OSU that was a top ten freshman that then was a top ten senior. Not  many kids achieve both of those, but his mother had a lot to do with that.  She got it done, and he accomplished quite a bit. Jed went on and got a law  degree at the other university. He   s never really practiced for the public but  uses that degree in his personal business. They have since partnered up with  Kent Gardner that   s soon to be the alumni president of OSU, and Kent, that  year that he graduated, was the number-one graduate at Oklahoma State.  Kent and Jed became very good friends. They   re now partners and own  Mangum Brick at Mangum. They have several Bobcat distributorships in  three different states and probably some things that they hadn   t quite told  Dad about that they   re doing. Anyway, might have to worry about them  boys. We had lots of conversation as they was growing up and maturing,  and I told Kent one day, I said,    You need to just go up there and buy that  brick plant. I mean, that   s going to be a heck of a deal. It   s cash cow.     That   s what happened. He went up there and bought it. Worked out good.  Adam came to work for me and worked for a couple of years and, of course,  married, and he drove back and forth forever from Duncan to Altus, which  is a pretty big task. His wife worked, and they wouldn   t let her get any  further west. He had a job with me, but we finally got him hooked up with  Edward Jones. I say    we.    He hooked himself up with Edward Jones and  studied and studied and studied and had been very, very, very successful  with them and their financial deal, and of course, today, the market has, last  three or four days, has plummeted. A lot of his clients may be on top of a  8  building looking where to jump, but I was by there this morning. There  wasn   t any blood landing on the carpet or anything. (Laughs)  Milligan That   s a good thing.  Winters Anyway, it   ll all come back.  Milligan He   s back in Altus. Both of your sons are back in Altus.  Winters Got both boys here. We have four grandchildren. Jed has two little boys,  Gage and Holden. Adam has a little girl, Brenna, and a little son, Luke, and  of course, we still live on the farm that we bought originally whenever we  moved here. The original place we bought was a house and four acres. Some  years later, I became friends with a particular gentleman. Became almost  like a granddad to me, and he and I, we were buddies. He worked for United  Supermarkets. Been through a couple of divorces. He was single at the time,  up in his years, and the farm that adjoined me that sold, the same day I  bought my four acres, to a neighbor that I became friends with, he was  having to sell it. We conceived the idea that maybe we ought to just buy that  and me and Byron become partners.  Byron Ford, he   s deceased now, but we bought that property. Of course,  Byron   s now retired, and he can   t do a lot in the dust. He   s dependent on  oxygen, and we got rigged up where he could ride around the pickup and do  his breathing treatments and all that right in the pickup. Back then, you had  to hunt that stuff. Today, I think you can go buy it off the shelf, but we  invented what we had to have to make that work. Byron   s the only guy I  know that could in retirement   we put together several hundred acres of  ground that were bought and paid for, and we had buy-sell agreements,  being in the insurance business and selling life insurance.  I had bought life insurance on Mr. Ford, and whenever he passed away,  those agreements all kicked in that I had the right to buy and he would sell  and vice versa. If I   d preceded him in death, his family and heirs would   ve  been able to do the same thing. I bought him out, lock, stock, and barrel, and  those kids got the money. We then had a trust set up that we helped  administrate for a grandson for him. Byron had a daughter that has deceased  now, but he knew that she couldn   t handle money very well. He entrusted us  to help with that grandchild, and we did get him educated and paid his entire  education. At the end, we had some money left over to give him. That all  worked out to Byron   s wishes, which I   m very proud of that, that that  happened. His son, Danny, memorialized his dad very appropriately at the  cemetery. I go by and visit Mr. Ford pretty regular. I   m a cemetery nut and  do that. Some people are not, but I go by and visit them. We have  conversation and talk. Very good tribute. Byron had adopted those two kids  and raised them as his own and had some issues and some problems, but we  9  all do. It worked out, and everything   s hunky-dory. Patty has deceased now.  Danny, I haven   t heard from in years, but that   s all right.  Milligan I think that   s a good example of your commitment to your community and  your neighbors. Maybe we   ll talk a little bit about that in regards  to   there   s a couple of things I   d like to get back to, but I think maybe we   ll  stay in Altus for a minute. Tell me a little bit more about what it was like  when you first got here, when you first moved to Altus and you were  teaching and what was maybe difficult or easy about teaching when you  were getting ramped up here. Were there challenges or things that were   I  know that you were already winning things pretty early.  Winters I had a principal that   me and him didn   t get along real well. I   ll put it that  a way. We became very, very good friends after I once got out of teaching,  but Howard King was his name. Howard   s a nice guy, but he was burnt out.  I would see him in the hallway of the high school scold teachers in front of  students, which I didn   t think needed to happen. If you   re going to get on to  me, that   s fine and dandy, but let   s go in the room there and shut the door.  You can do whatever you need to. That was one of my challenges.  We were getting along pretty good now, I   m telling you. We were winning,  and of course, we had Dr. Foster that used his psychology. He just called me  one day and said,    I need to know by tomorrow whether you   re going to  come to Altus or not.    Big time pressure in here, and I am crying because  I   m fixing to have to leave the kids I love so dear at Central to make that  change. Linda and I, we talked about it and visited. It   s an opportunity to get  home, so that   s what we did.  Milligan When was that that you moved here then?  Winters I got my degree in    77, and we taught the    77/   78,    78/   79 school year and  then moved over here that summer and then taught a couple of years at  Altus.  Milligan Just within a couple of years, then, you were here after being graduated.  Winters I taught two years right after college at Central and two years at Altus for a  total of four. I used to, could rattle all that off, how many State Farmers we  had, how many American Farmers we had. I was just really blessed with  Freddie Garrett and his leadership at Central. I was blessed that Mr.  Muncrief and I became very good friends, even though I beat him. It was  pretty tough for him to swallow that pill. He and I served on several boards  over the years, one of them being the Ag Teachers    Alumni Board, and took  care of most of the money in scholarship forms. He was a competer, but he  was a gentleman. I appreciate that about him. He was really quite a guy. He  was one of them that, I   m making these numbers up, but if he was a Lions  10  member, a Kiwanis member, he   d have been forty-three years without ever  missing a meeting. He had a philosophy. If you   re familiar with a Gold  Emblem chapter or Silver Emblem chapter, that   s the Danish method in  scoring you. A lot of times at the county fair, you get a blue ribbon or a red  ribbon or a white ribbon for first, second, and third. The FFA used the gold,  silver, and bronze. Ernest was of the opinion if you won a gold emblem one  time, you were always gold.  As I went forward in my thinking, I thought later on (of course, when you  get as old as me) he was a lot smarter than I gave him credit for because you  had to work hard to get all those applications filled out and scrapbooks  turned in. You couldn   t be a Gold but every other year, so every other year  you had to work a little harder. The first year I taught at Central, we were a  Bronze Emblem chapter. The next year, we were a Silver Emblem. I moved  to Altus. The first year here, for whatever reason, we were a Gold Emblem,  and a lot of that was just a lot of effort on several mothers    parts because  they had to help me accumulate pictures.  I had a lady by the name of Margaret Worrell which still helps me. I do a  deal for her every year, and we do a Cotton Pickin    Chili  Cook-off  that,  with the Main Street Altus people. I served on that board for several years,  with Margaret   s arm twisting, and I go out and raise the money every year  from my farmers that pay for the trophies we give away. That   s just a series  of phone calls. I   ve done it so many years that it just   not a problem. I  mean,    Yeah, you calling again for that hundred-dollar deal?    or whatever. I  don   t even know where I was going with that story, but Margaret   s been a  good friend, and we did win the Gold Emblem chapter.  Milligan When did you switch from teaching to, and how did you end up at the Farm  Bureau?  Winters Well, go back to Freddie Garrett, my old teacher. He went to work for Farm  Bureau in December of that year. We started school September, August. In  December, he went to work for Farm Bureau. Then he got on my school  board, and for many years, he and I would, he was lucky enough he   d had  the Grand and Reserve Grand lamb at the Oklahoma City Youth Show.  What do they call it now? OYE, Oklahoma Youth Expo, largest show in the  world.  Mr. Paul Tolliver, which became a House Representative member from over  the Lawton area, had a daughter, Denise, that actually won Grand and  Reserve Grand lamb one year, the same year, and then the year before, I  think it won grand. I stumbled into a school about sheep, and I had never  clipped a sheep in my life, let alone tried to go figure out which one was a  good one or a bad one. Freddie, again, being the principal then board  member and then friend, he went to work for Farm Bureau. You figure out  11  them guys that are winning, they know where to go. You know what I  mean? They know who   s raising the best ones or who can come up with  them, and we   d go plumb to Ohio to get those sheep.  First year we went, he had gotten me a pickup coming. My old pickup I had  was about to fall apart, which Freddie had drove and I inherited. We took  the school van. Me and him, we left and drove plumb to Indiana that first  night. Dumb me, I   d never been up there before. I   d hardly been out of  Oklahoma, and I didn   t even take a coat. I   m about to freeze to death, now  I   m telling you. I went down, and of course, at that time of the year, which  would be early spring, well, all the coats had either been put up or off the  rack. The heaviest thing I could get was just about a flannel pair of  underwear that was about double thickness, but I wore that sucker. (Laughs)  Man I   m telling you, it felt pretty good. We wound up going on to the city.  This Tolliver girl had another sister that was showing, and Paul had got  elected. Of course, if you   re winning, you   re cheating, is the mentality of the  general public. Paul, he had, being an elected official now, toned his deal  down just a little bit, but he still got the pick of the litter, so to speak and got  along. I think that girl stood fifth that next year in Class and didn   t have the  Grand again. I don   t think Paul fought it quite as hard, either. Of course, he  was in session, and having to play politician, and wasn   t home to tend to  them quite as good.  The first show I went to while I was at Central, I   d never clipped a dairy  cow. It   s a long ways around a Holstein cow, and it   s a lot longer around if  you   ve never been around one before. (Laughter) I think it was twenty-eight  head that showed up. I got schooled real big on clipping, how to clip. I  didn   t know nothing about them. Jimmy Benton was another family from  there that was just a tick older than me. Jimmy   s deceased. I was a  pallbearer at his funeral. Talk to his wife, Debbie, and talk to Freddie   s wife  pretty regular.  Whenever Freddie passed, I was the guy that they came to. Of course, I   m  there the day that he passes, and LeAnn, his oldest girl, said,    We want to  talk business after a while.    I said,    What better time than now?    Freddie  was an insurance agent. I   m an insurance agent. We both together probably  had sixty years of experience. I went through all of his life policies for the  family. There was one policy that was missing that we had entered into an  association as agents that we could buy some additional insurance, and we  couldn   t find the policy. I looked through everything, and this might   ve been  the next day. They were going to the funeral home to make arrangements.  I don   t know why, but I had the little girl   s cell number in my phone that  administrated those policies. She lived in Omaha, Nebraska, and I called  her. She answered her phone, and told her who I was and what had  12  happened and asked her to, Monday, give me a call back. She said,    No, I   m  not going to do that. I   ll call you back in a minute. I   ll go down to the  office.    I says,    Honey, I   m not asking you to go down there on the  weekend,    but she did and literally called me back. She had the policy  number, how much the face amount was, the whole nine yards, and gave all  that to me. Of course, I   m writing it all down, and the girls are in the funeral  home at Lawton making arrangements. I   m still at the house.  Freddie always fed his family on Sunday, and after we lost Freddie, I just  called Leola. I said,    I   m going to feed the family. I   m going to do Freddie  on Sunday.    I took a bunch of Holder   s aged beef that was from here. That   s  who I   m going hunting with here in a minute. It   s one of the Holder boys.  Then on Sunday we fed everybody, and after all that, well, got them all  done. Of course, the kids went over there.  Well, I get this good information. Of course, they   re fixing to spend funeral  dollars and make those arrangements and spend some money, and they don   t  know really, other than these policies that we knew about, where they were  at financially. Nobody answered the phone whenever I called, but I text  them. I did learn how to text finally, and my text was,    No problem with the  agent   s policy. You have x number of dollars. I   ve got all the details worked  out    or something like that. Literally they   re sitting in there making funeral  arrangements whenever that text hits their phone, and that would have to be  refreshing to know that you can do whatever you want to, you   ve got  enough money to write a check and pay for it. Made me feel proud to be a  friend to Freddie, and I don   t know whether I   ll ever get even with him or  not. I was working on it that day. (Laughs) Totally different story there, but  anyway, we got him fixed up and got him buried. That was pretty tough for  everybody.  I try to call his wife every time I   I don   t know why I do that, but if I   m  traveling, going through that old stomping territories, it seems a good time  to call and talk to his wife. We took care of her. I mean, my son Adam,  that   s with Edward Jones, and I went over and sat down with her and looked  at her portfolio, if you will, and I said,    Here   s what I can do. Here   s what  Adam can do. We want to do what   s best for you. You pick.    I think we had  all the family there, the girls and the mom and everybody. With what was  left behind, we done the best we could do for them.  Milligan I bet they know that.  Winters Oh yeah. There   s no question about that.  Milligan You inferred this, but I want to clarify. Did he lure you into the Farm  Bureau, and when did that happen, if it   s true?  13  Winters Oh, I was teaching, and me and the high school principal, I was telling you  about earlier, was bumping heads a little bit. I think he was a little bit  jealous, but the big thing, I think, more for Howard, he was burnt out. It was  ironic. After I submitted my resignation letter, my teaching partner, Mr.  McLaughlin, he submitted his. You just don   t understand how many hours  we were putting in. I mean, night and day, twenty-four/seven. I mean, I had  three parli-pro teams, twenty-four public speakers. We had all the livestock  judging teams that you can accumulate, from livestock to Ag mechanics.  I started an interscholastic meet in Altus held on or about Valentine   s Day.  That   s in February. Now the reason I picked that date is I wanted my  students to know their speech. I wanted my creed speaker to know his creed.  I wanted my quiz kids to know the quiz. I wanted all those kids to know  before we started stock showing, because whenever we left Altus to go to a  stock show at Oklahoma City, we   d take us two school buses with us of kids  and drive to the city, and everybody had to have a livestock project. Not all  of them could win, but they learned how to feed. They learned how to keep  the pen clean. They learned how to do chores. They learned how to manage  money. They learned what the difference between a gilt and a sow and a  weaner and a barrow. They learn lots of things, skills, life skills, get along  with people, how to play the game fair, I mean, do just lots of things.  You might get a blue ribbon. You may need a pair of binoculars to see who  got a blue ribbon, it   d be so far down the line, but somebody   s got to win.  Somebody   s got to lose, but I always like to win pretty hard. That  interscholastic meet in February kept us going. We then could take a break,  go livestock show, and then just as soon as you got through in March with  your livestock shows, you would have, your first contest would be the PI.  Professional improvement   s what that stand for, and you would compete  with kids in your district.  That interscholastic meet, we would do all of the schools in southwest  Oklahoma. Well, we had single-teacher departments, and we had multi-teacher  departments. Mr. Boggs, that was with Mr. Metcalf, wound up at  Elgin. Well, they were a multi-teacher department. We crossed paths again  at Altus. We were head-to-head, and I wasn   t about to let him beat me.  (Laughs) I mean, I wasn   t about to. We would overwhelm them with  numbers because you would get points. If you had three speakers in banking  and three speakers in dairy and three speeches in FFA or whatever, every  kid that participated got some points, and at the end of the day, you would  add up the points. We   d give away trophies that would about hit the ceiling  from here, and what we did not do with finesse, we did with numbers. We  would typically win that contest, and they   re still, I think, having that  contest.  14  That Washington D.C. trip, I didn   t finish that story, I don   t think, but the  day they sold my house out here, I was in D.C. with two Central High  students, Jamie Crauder and John Fisher. I had took two probably freshman,  soon to be sophomores. I took them to D.C. to the National Leadership  Conference, and the school, with Freddie   s help, paid my way to go as  teacher to sponsor them. As soon as I got home, well, I   m done teaching  there, and I come to Altus. We started that, same, two kids every year go to  Washington D.C.  My goal always was to sell a hundred lifetime FFA memberships in Altus.  The reason being, for every (I   m probably going to be wrong with this), for  every ten lifetime members, you got to send one to the Oklahoma Alumni  Camp free. If you had a hundred people, you   d got to send ten kids free, but  you   d get to send one to the FFA Washington Camp free. I got on a kick to  do that at Altus. We sold several. We didn   t quite get there, but then as my  kids started to school, we went to Navajo  Oklahoma  out there. Well, I tried  to get that accomplished there. We started a livestock booster club. I went  over and trained them in parliamentary procedure some and helped them  where I could, but I had a teacher that was a little bit maybe jealous of me  out there, that didn   t quite get it and still doesn   t get it. Anyway, they  haven   t performed as well as I   d have liked to see things happen, but that   s  all right, too.  Milligan You started that as well by talking about, you turned in your resignation at  school and that your   .  Winters My teaching partner turned his in, but then the principal turned his in.  Milligan Oh. All three of you right there. Oh gosh.  Winters He quit the same year, and it was funny. As I went to doing the insurance  business, I had his dad insured, lived over at Duke, and it wasn   t long until  Howard come out. It seemed like a breath of fresh air had hit him whenever  he didn   t have to have that challenge of that school, and we became really,  really good friends. He then later went back and taught across Red River for  another retirement at a little school called Midway down there to get a Texas  retirement, I think. It worked out pretty good, and Dr. Foster, he was always  kind. His assistant superintendent was John Buck. John was my junior high  principal and my football coach at Mangum, but he wound up, he was from  Altus originally. Made a little all-American at Southwestern, football player.  Married a girl from Mangum, taught up there, and then he came to Altus.  Worked his way up to assistant sup ervisor , and John and I are still good  friends. He comes by Mother   s. His wife is deceased, but he   s remarried.  Milligan Did you teach two years in Altus then?  15  Winters Taught two years in Altus. John was real hard  Whenever I   d go in, you had  to go see John for money, but he   s tighter than bark on a sapling. John never  would give me any money. I learned real quick as a young Ag teacher if you  wanted anything, just go around John because he wasn   t going to give you  anything. I hope he listens to this because he   s still pretty tight, I think, right  now, but that   s all right. (Laughs) He   s a good guy. He did give me a  paddling, I think, at about the ninth grade, but other than that. I probably  deserved it. (Laughter)  Milligan I was going to ask if you deserved it.  Winters Yeah, we might   ve been talking a little too much, but what the heck?  Milligan (Laughs) What was interesting to you about working for the Farm Bureau,  and what were you doing when you started here?  Winters They tried to hire me the year before.  Milligan After you   d only been teaching one year?  Winters Yeah. You ever gone from a guaranteed salary to commission sales?  Milligan I   ve only gone the other way. (Laughs)  Winters That   s what I   m saying. It   s hard for you to leave a secure paycheck every  month, a secure health benefit for your family every month. In that  particular deal, I had a vehicle they provided to me as an Ag teacher. You go  to work for Farm Bureau, you work on commission only. It   s been the best  thing I   ve ever done in my life, but at the time, it was a pretty hard hurdle to  jump over. The first year, I didn   t go, and as my relationship with my  principal got worse and worse, one of us wasn   t going to walk away one  day. We were going to get into a fight in the hallway and embarrass both of  us, and in fact, I told Dr. Foster, I said,    Hey, I done resigned. You just go  tell Howard to leave me alone. I   ll be out of here.     Apparently he went and talked to him, because I made a pretty good  impression on Foster, and he, I think he knew I probably was fixing to do  what I told him I was going to do. Howard just left me alone. I mean, we   d  walk down the hall, and we   d go around each other. That   s all right. We  mended those fences and got to be friends later on, but at the time, we both  probably were unhappy where we were at. Probably the best thing for both  of us to do, and we did, anyway.  Milligan Are you saying it took an uncomfortable situation to make you want to take  the leap to commission only?  16  Winters Well, that, and of course Freddie had come back into the picture. They set  up a meeting in Snyder  Oklahoma  at a little old restaurant, and about four  or five of those guys that had sold insurance for several days brought their  1099s with them. In most cases, a W2 form or a 1099 is what you made the  year before, and I   ve always been driven to want to make as much as I  could, I guess, maybe and never was satisfied. If a nickel   s good, I want a  dime. If a dime   s good, I want twenty cents, and that was the gist of the  meeting.    Here, we   re going to show you what we made last year.       Oh,  okay. How   d you do that?    Well, and then they threw a little bit bigger bone  to me, I guess, maybe as far as, they had a little bit of what we called an  unassigned book of business, which is, might   ve been fifty houses and three  hundred cars and whatever that generated in commission. We   ll give you a  little bit bigger book of business to start with, and anyway, first year, I  mean, just no problem. That was June of    81, and you can see some of the  plaques on the walls.  Been very blessed and very honored by my peers to sell, sell, sell, and you  win, win, win. If you   re in sales and you don   t sell, you don   t win nothing,  and a lot of people don   t get that. Had some things happen in our  community that allowed me the opportunity to sell more. We had an agent in  town that got caught, I   ll basically say, embezzling. Insurance commissioner  caught him. He was the old mayor of the community. He was the old  godfather of a lot of the community leaders, and he got his hand caught in  the kitty. That year, I probably insured every one of them because I was  everybody   s buddy. Had done a lot of things for our community, a lot of  things for their kids as students of mine and been blessed with those people.  We were all still good friends. I mean, we all still do a lot of things together.  We   ve been very honored to work with them.  I mean, we   ve done this caravan here in town. Probably the first project I  did, we raised sixty-six thousand here in Altus whenever they were building  the OSU Alumni Center. We   re the only chapter in Oklahoma that has a  room named after us. It   s upstairs.  Milligan On the Stillwater campus?  Winters At the Alumni Center on the Stillwater campus. That was a Jerry Gill deal,  and of course all of my bleeding orange people nickeled and dimed it  together. We raised sixty-six thousand, and my one goal in life that maybe  I   d like to get accomplished is to get all of those donors that are living to  stand beside that plaque and get a picture that I could hang on the wall. You  can tell I like to put some plaques on the walls or memorabilia. We thought  we had that accomplished a couple of years ago, but we didn   t. It   s just to  get everybody on campus, if it   s Homecoming or whatever, we   re doing a  big tailgate to get everybody to be able to go from the stadium back to the  Alumni, get a picture, get that scheduled, and then get everybody back. The  17  geographics of getting that done is almost impossible because a lot of these  guys are getting some age on them, and it   s not comfortable to make that  long walk across campus. I understand that. That may never happen. I have  got a picture of the plaque on the wall and one downstairs. (Laughs)  Milligan Good. That   s a start. Well, let   s talk a little bit about all those events you do  for your community because I think that is also really telling of a lot of  things, and you mentioned that you have participated or spearheaded  several events in your community that were fundraisers for either, in a lot of  cases, OSU or if there   s an individual with a need or a family with a need. It  seems like you   ve been very successful in that. Maybe talk a little bit about  some of the things you do and why you do that, how you do that.  Winters I don   t know. The why you do it is to help the kid. The how you get it done  is you just got lots of good folks, and we really have individuals in our  community that have hearts, have feelings, have desires to help people and  to   one of the events we did, a little boy   s picture over there, he   s, I think, a  senior this year. He was given, what I   d say, zero chances of living, and I  had three or four buddies. We were playing Moon, dominoes. You ever play  Moon? Well, it   s a fast game, and with my guys, if you   re not very well-educated,  they   ll take all your money away from you. It   s like playing poker  with dominoes, and cash is involved.  I had these people insured and got the word that Brian was diagnosed, and  that wore heavy on me. I mean, a three-year-old-kid, I mean, you can just  imagine how that would be with the parents, and they were hard-working,  farm community people. Here they   ve got this problem, and over that game  of Moon, we decided we were going to do a fundraiser. That turned into  everyone in about three counties. We did everything from a silent auction to  a live auction to basically free food. I mean, my cowboy cooks, as I call  them, and I have many, many, many aprons that I   ve built over the years and  stole Pistol Pete   s deal. That wasn   t copywrited, but I   ve never sold one. I  tell them if they ever say anything to me,    Well, I guess you can   t be in  trouble if you give them away,    and Jerry Gill and then Larry Shell and Kirk  Jewell, all of them have one. Most of the coaches that   s ever been here, I   ll  give one to.  That particular event that night was   probably been unparalleled in this part  of the country. We cooked everything that we had. We started serving. Had  the auction. People were lined up from, I   m talking maybe two or three  blocks. I mean, it was just unbelievable. My son had come in to help me.  Several of the other community leaders had helped. I just got on the phone. I  called every restaurant in town. I said,    I want everything you got, hot.    I  bought everything that Wal-Mart had, everything that United had. I had  every restaurant in town literally donated everything they had hot, and we  still run out of food. There were people that left that didn   t get anything to  18  eat, but they didn   t care. It was all for that kid and the benefit of that kid,  and we   re just thankful today that that kid, he   s a senior. You wouldn   t even  know he   s ever been sick, great big old burly kid. He could whup me in a  New York second right now.  Back then, the little boy you saw over next door, he was helping during a  Christmas vacation timeframe to put in some electric barbwire fence, setting  some corner posts. He somehow or another got tied up in the PTO  power  take-off  shaft of a posthole digger and caused severe injuries to him, and  the Eldorado  Oklahoma  community put that on. We helped with that. I say     we    and my cowboy cooks and everybody that, just your buddies. I mean,  we all just pitch in and do the deal. The caravan came along.  Milligan Talk a little bit about that. You   re talking about the OSU caravan. Explain  what that is and how you got involved.  Winters In the very beginning at Oklahoma State University, before the Boone  Pickens money came to play, a caravan was a caravan. They had vans.  Typically, if you remember back in the late    70s, early    80s, everybody had  a customized van. That was the deal. Well, some of the donors from the  University would let them have their van, and the coaches, in an effort to  sell more tickets   if you don   t win, you don   t sell many tickets, and back  then, we weren   t winning very often. In an effort to sell tickets, they would  van, caravan, around Oklahoma and talk about the football team and the  program and who, what we   re going to do, and all that other, and that turned  in from a van to really getting high on the hog. They got a motorhome, and  about the time I got involved, they were just changing from the van to the  motorhome. They would come to Altus.  The first year I ever helped with that, we fixed hamburgers, and we had  about thirty-five people from Altus show up. We   d already had these feeds,  and people saw, my God, they can get everybody in Altus and southwest  Oklahoma to show up with the help of all our guys and what have you. They  came to me and said,    Why don   t you take over doing this caravan?    I just  had a meeting with all of my cowboys and my cooks and my buddies and  their wives and spouses and extended family and everybody else, and we  were sitting in a meeting. My old friend, we called him F.B. His real name   s  Mike Stevens, and I told them yesterday, the lady that does the Cowboy  Journal, she wants to interview somebody. I   d already told them guys on the  board, I said,    I   ve got a guy you need to do a feature article on.       Well,  who is it?    I said,    F.B.    Well, two or three of the boys that sit on that board  with me, they know him, and he   s a really, really nice guy and a hard  worker. He has a lot of fun doing it. We   re maybe going to get that article.  Now he   s not an OSU alum, but that boy   s done more for OSU than most  alums do. I really think they ought to tell his story because I think he   s got a  19  good story, and hopefully one of these days we   ll get   I thought they were  going to do it before now whenever that girl come to our board meeting  yesterday. A, she wanted money to pay for the article, but she wanted  suggestions on who to do the article on. I reiterated F.B. yesterday. We   ll  see if that ever happens. If you have any influence on that, make it happen.  They really want to take an alum and do a story on them and stuff, but not  always do you have to graduate up there to want to support that university,  buy season tickets at university, to give money to that university. Even on  your vehicles, have maybe OSU on the front tag and be a life member of the  alumni. You don   t have to be a graduate. Some kids didn   t have that  opportunity, but by God, they   re going to let their kids have an opportunity  or they   re going to let their grandkids have an opportunity. They   re still  going to support that school whether they were an alum or not, and I think  we   re missing a little bit of the boat there of people that bleed orange that  never walked on that dirt or paid a tuition up there. They still love it. They  still participate. They have friends like myself that do, were fortunate  enough to stumble through up there and finally get a kitchen pass and get  kicked out, I guess you might say.  Milligan What do you think the draw is?  Winters I think it   s the people that work there, the people, the charisma, the  demeanor of those people. The friendliness of those people is probably, and  I don   t know how you buy that packaged up or bottle it. If I did, I   d be a  bigtime millionaire, but I really think that it   s just that Oklahoma friendship,  the Oklahoma kindness, the Oklahoma love and compassion that they show  those kids. Not everybody sees that, maybe, in the beginning. Not  everybody has as good of an environment. I mean, my mother had cancer  whenever I was growing up. I mean, my two brothers and I, there is no way  that we probably should have all three got a college degree.  I remember answering the phone as a kid many, many times, and it was bill  collectors.    Well, where   s my dad? Where   s Zane at?    I mean, they   re just  hardworking folks. Mother just had the misfortune of having cancer, and  back then, it was probably she shouldn   t have lived. She had three snotty-nose  kids at home, but by God, she was not going to leave alone. If you  meet her, you   ll   she   s still pretty feisty, seventy-nine-year-old. She still  substitutes at the schools up there. All those kids baby her around. If it   s  cold, they go start her car for her before she goes home.  Anyway, there   s no way we should   ve all got a college degree, but that was  their goal in life is for us kids to all get an education and do the deal. My  older brother that wound up with a doctorate degree went to Stillwater, and  of course, he had to be in the fraternity and run with the pack that he had  grew up with there. That lasted about a semester.  20  Milligan What happened?  Winters He had to go home and regroup and wound up at Southwestern, and he went  on ahead and got his degree and taught and made a principal and then went  back and got his administrative deal and got his doctorate degree. Whenever  he got into the vo-tech system that really kind of was his bailiwick. He came  to McAlester  Oklahoma .  Milligan We had some impressive stuff with the vocational technology centers.  Winters Well, he actually put one or two of your folks in jail, and some of your  locals didn   t like that. They fired him. (Laughs)  Milligan He came for that part of McAlester. (Laughter) There   s a few different sides.  Winters It wasn   t Gene Stipe. It was some teachers in the school that wound up     Gene and I, I   ll tell you a story about Gene Stipe.  Milligan It could go a lot of ways if you want to talk about Gene Stipe.  Winters Well, it wasn   t too bad.  Milligan He was around a long time.  Winters Gene was around forever, fifty-plus years. I got stopped one morning taking  my two boys to Navajo school. Didn   t have my driver   s license. I just had  on a pair of almost like pajamas almost, just a pair of britches, and I drove  the kids over and let them off. I was coming back, and we had a local  highway patrolman that was the Baptist preacher. I always called him the  pistol-packing Baptist. He was a highway patrolman. He did the license  examination. His name   s Madison Clinton, good friend of mine and married,  and he pulls me over just about three quarters of a mile from the house. I  thought,    What in the crap did I do?    I mean, I didn   t think I was driving  that fast. He said,    Glen, we need to get this fire department deal started  back up.    Okay. I said,    Madison, I   ve been to two or three of your  meetings, and we had two or three of these farmers out here that want to do  it their way instead of the right way. If I do it, we   re going to do it right, and  we   re going to put it together.    You got to play by the rules. Whether you  like them or not, you   ve got to play by them.  Getting stopped by the highway patrol turned us into forming the Friendship  Volunteer Fire Department. I served as chairman of the board of that  forever, three or four years, but we got some pork barrel money that Gene  Stipe didn   t know nothing about to pay for our first fire department. We  were so proud of getting this money. I   d worked under the scenes, politically  21  got involved. Well, Gene found out about it. Made him mad. You ever heard  of the term Little Dixie? Oh yeah. Well, I   ve got letterhead in my safe at  home that   s got the Little Dixie logo on it     Milligan Wow   Winters    that we exchanged back then. Not only did he stop our project, but there  were several other projects. I know Chickasha, at their college, had some.  OU had some things, little pet projects that these legislators that were in the  know that year, and Gene was on the out, had pork barreled that money  together and wanted that to be our fire station. Well, he shut all the money  down  Here we   ve got a building sitting at Friendship, needing to pay for it.  Bob Mills had ordered it, and we didn   t have a nickel to our name hardly. I  called a meeting of all of the people that had received the money statewide,  and my brother was the superintendent there at East Oklahoma County Vo-  Tech there at Choctaw. We used his building to meet in, and all these  people, I didn   t have a clue who they were or nothing about them  I just  said,    Hey, we   re having a meeting. We   re going to try to put a deal  together. I want my money      We had a retired senator that came to the meeting and took us on as a client.  He was really taking on Gene Stipe to beat him up is about what it amounted  to, but he represented us. We got our money freed up, and we got our  building paid for. That fire department today is still in existence. I tell  people believe it or not, we probably got as good equipment as Altus has  got. We played the political arena on that thing pretty hard. The wildfires in  the country a few years ago were big, and there was always money for these  little volunteer fire departments. We   ve done everything from incorporating  a city out there. We had an airplane zoning deal that we did. That   s a big  story in itself you   ll have to hear sometime. We   ve actually got the original  fire station, and we built a sub-station later on. After we got the zoning done  out in that area to help save Altus Air Force Base, and the community, very  instrumental in that. Got that accomplished.  I went to the leadership at the time. Jari Askins was the lieutenant governor,  and David Braddock was our rep. Him and Jari were big buddies. I went to  David, and I said,    I want some money.    He said,    What for?    and I said,     Those people at Friendship out there, our community, gave you that money  for that zoning or gave you the zoning for free. I want some money to build  a community center.    We now have a community center that has a fire  station tied with it, and the public can use it. It   s a nice building. David got  us seventy thousand dollars. Senator Bob Kerr, which has the building  named after him right north of Ag Hall, good friend of mine, Bob got us  fifty-thousand in a  redevelopment  grant, and then we raised about thirty-five  thousand locally for that particular deal and have that.  22  After I once got the money gathered up, I went to the community out there,  and I said,    Well, I got you some money.    They said,    Well, we don   t want  to have to cook hamburgers every Saturday night to pay for this building.  We don   t want your money     (Laughter) I went home that night and    Well,  what in the crap am I going to do?    I went back a few days. I said,    Why  don   t we give the money to the fire department? They   ve got a revenue  stream. Whenever they build their brand-new building, let them build a little  community center down on one end. They can use it for the training. We  then can use it for potluck supper, or whatever we need, we can use it.    We  got that built, and our family gave quite a bit of money to that to get it  finished. It   s nice. I mean, it   s there. It doesn   t serve its purpose as often as I  would like to see it used, but that   s a whole different story there that I   ll  have to tell you off camera. (Laughs)  Milligan We can do that. Is that where you have your fundraising dinners?  Winters No. Actually, we built another building. I serve on Jackson County  Industrial Trust Authority, and we built a Bar-S factory out here. After we  got it built, the Bar-S people, the location of it was real close to the old FFA  facility, and the fly problem around livestock and the manure and that type  of thing was not conducive to a place that made food, the Bar-S weenies,  corndogs, and so forth. I did take (I think I told you) 768 corndogs yesterday  from that plant up to Stillwater to feed to those freshmen yesterday, but     Milligan Thank you   Winters    they   ve been good to donate every year. The city decided they would  relocate not only the school farm but also maybe the former fairgrounds. We  were the second community in Oklahoma that put together a tax increment  finance district together. Guymon was first. How that works is you go into  an area. You can do it just about anywhere, and you draw the boundaries of  where the tip   s going to be. It can run any way you want it, and you try to  identify an area that potential growth will be in. We were smart enough with  that group, and with some advice from key people, to include the Bar-S  plant, to include some other grounds around that that would potentially have  some growth.  Then you have to go to every person that receives ad valorem tax. You have  to go to the schools, which has a huge benefit. You have to go to, in our  case, the library. It   s gets about a three-mil deal. Your county government  gets five-mil, on and on and on. You just look at your tax list, and you   ll see  whenever you get your bill on your property, if you own property, where all  that   s broke down at. You have to go to those people and say,    All right.  We   re not going to raise your income at all for x number of years. We   re  going to mark off this area, and we   re going to take whatever growth money  23  comes out of that, we   re going to put over here. The project is going to be  x.     The project we picked first was the fairgrounds, and we drew it in the sand.  We built that building. I had sheep that we raised. We actually raised, at my  house, the grand-champion lamb in 1999 at the Houston Livestock Show.  My boys were off in school. To raise the grand in Houston, that   s a pretty  big hurdle to get done. I thought to myself,    What better time to sell than  now?    I   m at the top of the mountain. I mean, we had an old buck we called  Sport. I had promoted him in every trade magazine. If you could buy a full  page ad in it, Sport was in it, and we   d done a lot of AI  artificial  insemination  work with the University. Doctor, oh, what   s his name?  There   s two or three of them up there. I donated semen to the University,  and then they would do this AI. We had Dr. Korley come in from Iowa that  would do the AI work, and we were trying to do it right. We spent a lot of  money to do the deal.  We had the first event in that new fairgrounds that ever happened. They just  finished it. We moved in. I sold a quarter-million-dollar worth of sheep in  one day, I think, but I   m out of the sheep business, which is all right, too.  Milligan Is that how you got out? Was that your last     Winters That was the last deal there, and then a year or two thereafter, I would let  everybody that bought something come back in. I   d host an auction for  them. The big deal, my kids were all out of   I mean, it was me. I had a  couple of guys that tried to help, but the kids were done. We showed until  we couldn   t show anymore. I mean, we   d go to Louisville and Denver and  Phoenix and Kansas City. We went all up, I mean, plumb up to the time they  wouldn   t let me go no more, and I was probably, at that time, so burned out,  I hadn   t been back  (Laughs)  Milligan That makes sense. I had another couple of questions. One, is it normal for  you to get pulled over just so people can ask you if you   ll get on their side?  (Laughs)  Winters That was probably the only time I ever got pulled over by the highway  patrol that says,    We need you to do something.    I had been to one or two of  those meetings, and they were my neighbors. Some of them were my clients.  I didn   t want to offend them, but they were just,    The state wants you to do  this or this or this to qualify for this or this.       Well, my God, I ain   t going to  do that     Well, whenever we started, I went to my group of guys. There was  seventeen of us that sat down, and we, in a few days, got our bylaws put  together. Basically, I   m always the guy that I want it equal for everybody. If  you show up, you came paying for your own gas on your own time, you got  just as big a vote   s I got, okay? You don   t want to have to be there, you  24  don   t have to be there. If you want to be there, you be there, but you   re  going to get equal time.  First seventeen guys got to seventy-seven hours of OSU-certified training,  fire training, okay? That bylaws is still in place. If there   s a new young man  that wants to join the fire department at his own will   now, back then, we  had no retirement. We had no worker   s comp. We had no liability on the  trucks. We had nothing. Not a big deal until you start accumulating a few  things, and you   re sitting there as chairman and you see one of your firemen  pull a dumb stunt, maybe running into a burning building that he probably  shouldn   t have been in, and I finally went to the guys. I said,    Hey, I   ll help  you any way I can. I   ll raise money for you. I   ll do whatever, but I   m not  going to be a fireman anymore,    because I was concerned about losing a  farm here or a farm there or whatever. That   s why I just, I   ve helped them,  still help them today.  There   s a lot of stories about that fire department, getting the old truck and  finding it, and finding the motor that weighed 432 pounds (it was solid  brass), getting it put together, throwing it under the truck, and I fed lots of  state meals, wining and dining some of those state people to get down to test  our truck, to score us. The first year, we went from a Protection Class Ten  fire department, which means you have no fire protection, to an I. Well,  what that meant to the homeowner, me being in the insurance business, is  their house insurance premium went down about 15 percent. Well, being the  dummy I am, I went to all of my guys that had my Farm Bureau insurance. I  said,    Hey, if I send you back your refund check, will you donate that to the  fire department? We   ll give you a check right now.       Yeah     Well, we  raised about ten-thousand dollars. We went with that money and bought  additional hose. The rules say you got to have twenty-five hundred feet of  two-and-a-half-inch hose to go from a class ten to a nine, and then you go to  an eight, seven, six, right on down.  We started a membership drive. We designed our own logo, which we still  use. I went to the rural electric people. Convinced them to let me have their  mailing list, which probably is illegal. (Laughs) I don   t know, but we sent  out mailing lists to every meter. We didn   t know how to get everybody  notified, and we charged, I think, thirty-five for a regular membership,  twenty for a senior citizen. We   ve since, I think, gone up on that a little bit,  but my gosh, that was a long time ago. It   s been good. We went from, the  first year, from a ten to a nine. Then it took us from that point to an eight.  Probably about eighteen months to get that done, but we needed some Scott  Air-Paks. At the time, those were about, I think, fifteen-hundred apiece. In  my area, at that time, we had some people that raised, very successfully,  racing greyhound dogs, and they had opportunities in all parts of the country  they   d send their dogs to.  25  They were rolling in the chips pretty good. I went to one of the guys, and I  said,    Hey, would you consider giving me some money to buy some Air-  Paks so if we get a call that your kennel   s on fire we can go in there and get  them puppies out?    He said,    I sure would. I   ll write you a check right  now.    We did. I went back and figured all of his meters and took that  number. In other words, he had three electric meters there for his dad, him,  and a hired hand, and I did the math and took his dues. It   s in the minutes.  He was given a letter that you   re going to get free membership to the  Friendship Fire Department for twenty-three years, three months, and six  days or something because you gave me x number of dollars to buy the Scott  Air-Paks, but that was the last thing we needed to get to that class eight.  David Lingle was the guy that did it, and some years later, whenever the  zoning deal come to pass that got us our community center, David got  bought out. He relocated his family and moved down on the lake somewhere  and retired, I think. He got paid well, I guess. (Laughs)  Milligan Not a bad deal. I just have maybe one more area to talk about, and that   s  your time in Stillwater. You were there for two years. Maybe talk a little bit  about what you did while you were there, what classes you took, if you  remember. You were vocational agriculture. I   m guessing   .  Winters I was Ag-Ed. Dr. Bob Terry, and his son was there last night and I went up  and talked to him, Rob. As I say, Mother had cancer. I went to school two  years here at the junior college right out of high school. I was my senior  class president from about the eighth grade plumb through my senior year  for whatever reason, and some of the classes prior to us had a school-sponsored  senior trip. They had some problems with the school sponsor part  of that. About killed a kid. The school quit sponsoring them. Being the  innovators that we were, we went down, and every time we   d go do a  fundraiser as a freshman class or sophomore class, we went and put money  in a different account because we wanted to take a senior trip. We   re  thinkers, boy. We   re really forward out there on that deal. (Laughs) We go  put that money down at the Guarantee State Bank at Mangum. If we made a  hundred dollars, we put ninety over here and ten over there. We put a little  bit in the school, but most of it went into our account.  I   m on my senior trip, and I get home. Everybody from the city manager to  one of my football coaches to my old buddy that always, kind of my  granddad I didn   t have growing up, Junior Tyler, all of them wanted to talk  to me. Mother had a laundry list. Boy, everybody wants to talk to me. A lot  going on here. Well, Tyler, while I   m gone, manages to get fired from the  City by his cousin, which is the city manager. Tyler had run the swimming  pool, the Teen Town. Kept me employed, the whole nine yards, as I was  growing up as a kid. Took me fishing. Took me hunting. He was my, the  granddaddy I never had. The manager wanted to talk to me. What they  wanted to talk to me about is they fired Tyler. Nobody knew how to do the  26  swimming pool but me and Tyler, and he wasn   t about to tell them.  (Laughs) He got fired.  They have since redone that. In fact, we helped get that done, too. My son  and Kent Gardner, they redid the whole pool. There were big deals. You  have to backwash those. If you   ve ever been around a pool, you have to, that  stuff goes in the skimmer, goes in there and gets clogged up. You backwash  it and dump it out. You can just imagine a municipal swimming pool. I  mean, the tanks were as big as this room. Make a long story short, I went to  Tyler first because he was my granddad kind of thing. He said,    I   ve got you  a job. Don   t have to worry about it.    I went then to work at Armco Steel,  which was a really good paying job. A lot of hard work, but I had made  enough money working there for two years, going to junior college.  I played a little baseball the first year or so. We had a pretty good team. We  got beat out in the state tournament one to nothing. The kid that beat us  pitched and knocked his own home run, and the day after we got beat, I  think he went to play pro ball. Me and him became good friends. He later on  worked for Farm Bureau. Joe Edelen was his name. Me and Joe, we was  buddies, but he was a heck of a ballplayer. With Mother   s cancer deal and  all that, it was probably good for me to get my, get grounded and get my  basics out of the way. We were down here at the old school, which was now  part of the high school, and we   ve since built a nice high school out here.  Get those two years behind me and had a buddy that was part of my  graduating class, and he   s since deceased. I was the pallbearer at his funeral.  I   ve been a pallbearer at a lot of peoples    funerals.  Larry was killed in a bad car wreck, but he and I and two other boys roomed  together in a basement apartment in Stillwater. They rented the basement out  and the upstairs out. That house was doing double duty income-wise. It   s on  Bella Street, I think. From McDonald   s, it was just about due west down  there. Went to school for that semester, and of course, I was lost. I really  didn   t have anybody to take me by the hand. I mean, my parents had never  had a college degree. I really didn   t have anybody that just would do   what  I think we ought to do is I think that Mom and Daddy ought to have to go  with that kid as a freshman, and I did with mine. We went over, and we  introduced ourselves to who our counselor was going to be. We talked to the  counselor, and then they   re still good friends.  Anyway, you just stumble around up there for a couple of years, and of  course, I was making close to twenty bucks an hour back in    73,    74. I mean,  that was pretty good money back then. The going rate was two and a  quarter, okay? Whenever I leave my good, secure job and the junior college  atmosphere, well, here I go to Stillwater, but I had enough money put back  to pay my way. I roomed with them three boys. I was dating my high school  sweetheart, Linda, and we decided it was time to get married. We did. Of  27  course, then she came to Stillwater, and I had been fortunate enough to  somehow or another hooked into a Dr. Bill Lebow. He was a physics  professor, him and his wife, and they lived north of the golf course, the  municipal golf course, not quite to the overpass up there. You turn and go  back towards Lake McMurtrey down there four or five miles, and I   ve been  by there several times. I   m just reminiscing and go by there, but they had  horned Hereford cows.  They were building a house. The day I went to work for him, we were  pouring the footer, which means the trench you dig and pour the concrete in.  Well, they were, at that point, living in a trailer house, and whenever I left,  they were living in the home. We had it bricked, and we did all of those  different trade skills from framing it to sheet rocking it to painting it to  laying the brick on it. This old man   s dad was a mason contractor from  Pennsylvania, Mr. Lebow   s, Dr. Bill Lebow   s dad, and he built post offices.  This old man wanted to relive his childhood more than anything, and I was  the laborer. He was the brains, and we built an octagon sunken living room.  I   ll never forget the day that, I mean, he just sat down there,    Pi r squared  times so and so and so and so.    He just drew it out on the concrete, and  that   s what we need to do. (Laughs) I   m thinking,    I   m not getting this real  good. I   m not a physics professor,    but he was. He was a real interesting  guy. Had a lot of research he had done.  You take a sixteen-penny nail, that sixteen-penny nail is three and a half  inches in length, and whenever we were framing that, he had done research  on how the angle of that nail driven into a two by four to hold it to a bottom  plate, which one of them held better in high wind, tornado-type settings. He  wanted that nail driven. That was before air guns and all that. You were  swinging a hammer. He wanted it to be a third of the length of the nail up  the board at a thirty-degree angle driven in, and if it wasn   t, pull it out. Do it  again. I mean, that was how eccentric he was. I mean, laying the brick to  you name it, it was always, it had to be just his way.  Milligan How   d you get roped into doing that?  Winters Well, as a kid, Dad and them, we never had any money. We had to fix  everything we had. If we wanted to add a room on, we had to do it  ourselves. I learned how to do those skills as a kid and just, like I say, got a  job working for him, and I   d been around cattle and helped. I got to tend all  the cows. If they ever took a trip, I was the guy, the cowboy that took care of  them and then just helped them on the farm, two dollars and a quarter an  hour.  Milligan How   d you meet him?  28  Winters Some way or another up at the school, and I think it was somewhere over  right across from Ag Hall used to be the Dairy Barn. They tore it down a  few years ago. Boy, you used to could get a real big old cinnamon roll in  there that was real good for breakfast. I think it was Dr. Bob Noble. He was  going to be my advisor in the beginning, but then after I switched because  he was animal science guy, Larry McLaughlin   what was his last name, the  boy that was killed? Larry Anderson. He had been up there and flunked out  and had to come home and get his grades better. His dad was an extension  agent. He had the OSU legacy going on, and that was probably the one  reason I went up there.  Larry and I were buddies, but whenever I switched my major to Ag-Ed as  opposed to animal science, well, that   s when you got out of the Bob column.  I think Bob might   ve been my connection. He knew Mr. Lebow and knew  he had a need for some, a strong back and a weak mind, and I fit that  category pretty well. Anyway, I went to work up there and worked for him  for the whole time I was there, and then I   d go back and see him. If we had  summer conference, I   d go see Mrs. Lebow and stuff, occasionally.  Milligan Why Ag-Ed? What made you want to major in that?  Winters I don   t know. I really don   t know. I had probably, one of the guys that  influenced my life a great deal was a gentleman by the name of Mr. Killian.  He was an old Ag teacher. His uncle was Byrle Killian that was head of all  of the vo-tech for many years back in those early days. Byrle gave his  nephew the job at the college of being the Ag teacher, somehow or another.  Mr. Killian and I, we were big buddies, and he was an old Ag teacher. Now  he   s teaching at the college, and I   m taking a lot of his Ag classes. We   re  still good friends. I need to go see him. He   s down here in one of the  retirement homes. His daughter sent me a deal the other day and told me that  he was staying down here. His wife is passed away, and he   ll probably never  go home. I   ve really got to go see him.  After I got up there, I probably just, I was the chapter president in my Ag  chapter at home, and the old Ag teacher at Mangum had passed away. We  got a guy that had never really been   he was always a 4-H kid. Never had  ever been in Ag. Didn   t know nothing about Ag, but he had a degree from  Oklahoma State so they hired him. He probably didn   t know enough to, you  could   ve went to some other Ag chapters and learned a lot more about FFA.  It   s almost amazing that after I got out and started teaching that   but I had  Freddie that had mentored me and different ones. Kent Metcalf, you may not  know Kent. Kent passed away recently, but Kent, it   s almost crazy. Kent  started at Central. Kent taught one year instead of two, but then he came to  Altus. Then he was God over here forever, and him and his wife divorced.  That created a little problem. He then went to Oklahoma State University  29  and worked for the state department up there. Then at the end of his career,  he worked for the economic people at the chamber. That was his big deal.  As I started having students, and of course, these kids, no different than  being at Central High. As we were winning, after Kent just left, well, those  were his students, and I mean, if we were at Stillwater at the Little Theater  in a parliamentary procedure deal, Kent   s there. I mean, those were his kids.  He was rooting us on just as hard as anybody, if not more, and his wife still  lives right down here. I was just in their house the other day, and I said,     Ruth, you remember meeting me the first time?       No.    I said,    Well, Linda  and I come to borrow money to buy that house, and you and Kent had just  divorced  Here I am, the new Ag teacher going to take Kent   s place.    She  said,    I remember that     (Laughs) I said,    Well, that   s what happened.    That  was a long time ago.  Milligan What   d you do while you were in Stillwater? Do you remember?  Winters Well, I never went to a football. I went to one game the whole time I was up  there. My wife went to all of them. I had student tickets, student passes, but  I worked, two and a quarter an hour. It took a lot of hours to make much  money, and I went to class. I had two or three guys that were my buddies  from high school that would come by the house, and Perry Clark was one of  them. He still lives here and farms, and back then, farmed some. He   d come  over and hang out a little bit. Larry Anderson and those boys were still up  there. We   d go hang out with them some. Hey, you   d go down to the bar and  have a beer and play pool and whatever college kids do. Big deal was hurry  up and get out of here.  I had a real good GPA because most of my credits were taken down here  whenever I transferred, and I didn   t do it any favors up there in some of  those five-hour chemistry courses that about beat me up. Wound up, and I  had to go get permission my last semester to get out in four. Most kids don   t  ever get out in four, but back then, you did, supposed to anyway. I had to get  permission. I had to take, I want to say, eighteen hours and then twenty-four  hours my last year and some during summer school. Went to summer school  one semester. I think took six hours or something. Of course, you do your  student teaching. You go to school, and you cram about eight weeks in real  quick.  Then you go do your eight weeks out in the field, and we did our student  teaching at Yukon. Mac DeVilbiss was there, and Mac was a legend in  himself, as far as Ag teacher, with the show steer deal. He was as good as  they get. Larry Moore, at the time, was there. Larry and I are still good  friends. The whole time I did my eight weeks, I might have saw Larry once.  He knew he was quitting. He was getting married to a little high school girl  30  down at Mustang, and he wound up in Taloga  Oklahoma . They   re still  married, and they   ve raised kids and raised awful good hogs.  Then Red Goodson was the other teacher, and they, I think, probably gave  me a pretty good education, as far as the real world and how things happen  in a real Ag chapter. Not all of it was fun. DeVilbiss, he said,    You need to  be here such and such day.    We didn   t even have to start until Monday, but     You got to be here on Friday. Our county shows on this day.    And I   m  telling you, Saturday morning, we   re there and my teaching partner. There  was fifty-something steers there. He said,    You got to do all the bellies and  heads on all them calves.    All day long, we   re clipping bellies and heads on  these steers. (Laughs) We were the slaves, literally. (Laughs)  Milligan They were probably happy to see you come then.  Winters Oh yeah, and Mac and I are still pretty good friends. I did hire his son and  probably made   my kids were showing at the time, and I called Mac and  said,    Hey, I want somebody helping with the steer deal. I   ve been out of  that for a while.    His son met me at a sale, and his son said,    You need to  buy that calf right there   , and he was red. I said,    I ain   t buying no red calf. I  want a black calf. My black calves always win.    That red steer was the  grand champion at the spring show that year, and I didn   t buy it. (Laughs)  My sons remind me of that pretty regularly. (Laughter) I have made some  pretty stupid acquisition purchases. (Laughter)  Milligan Did your wife go to OSU then as well?  Winters No, she actually went   they were raised out on the farm. She had a sister,  and she got a secretarial deal through the junior college here, basic office  typing. Of course, that was even before computers ever got   they was  probably invented then. They probably just weren   t used as much as they are  today. She worked there at the University the whole time we were there,  dealing with foreign students and getting them all to make sure they get to  their class and all. I really never was over there and know much about what  went on. Anyway, that was her deal, but she did not actually ever get a  degree from Oklahoma State or even probably ever attend a class up there,  to be honest with you.  Milligan She worked there, though.  Winters She is the hugest OSU sports fan, bigger than me  I played ball all the time I  was going to school, and I think I burnt myself out. I didn   t really care if I  went to a game or not. I   d played it.  Milligan Well, you got a lot of OSU colors in your office here. I   m guessing you still  root for them pretty solidly.  31  Winters Oh yeah. Yeah, I mean, I go. We have had season tickets for years and  years, and my friend Ross  McKnight  got me a trip one time. The  basketball team was going to the Sweet 16 in Syracuse. They were in  Buffalo. I called Ross, my buddy that became a legend in his own right there  at Stillwater and will continue to be a legend. On the Boone Pickens, they  give fifteen million to that deal, he and his wife, Billie. I never met him.  Went to a sheep sale one day. I   m raising sheep. The first sheep comes  through there brings seventy-five hundred. The next sheep brings fifty-five  hundred.  About two days later, I know where them sheep are. I know who has them,  and I know who owns them. About a week after that, I   m at his house in  Throckmorton  Texas . Made enough phone calls, and I go visit with him. I  said,    You need to let us boys help you with them sheep.    We went to  helping with a friend of mine. Trent, his son, his senior year, there   s three  major shows in Texas. You got your San Antonio, you got your Houston,  and you got your Dallas. Well, could you just guess who won all three of  those that year?  Milligan His son?  Winters Won every one of them. Never ever been done before, and I will bet a lot of  money it   ll never happen again by one kid winning all three shows in one  year. That   s just unheard of, but Trent  McKnight  did it. The next year, he  was coming to Stillwater. He just had to take a little detour. He just became  national FFA president for the whole United States and had to lay out until  he could serve that term. He had a pretty good run there for about a year and  a half. From here to Throckmorton   s about an hour and twenty minutes.  Whenever Trent got all done, well, I went to helping Megan, his daughter.  Being an old state champion parli-pro deal, well, Megan wanted to win state  champion with the Texas parli-pro. I drove every Sunday and every  Wednesday afternoon to Throckmorton to train their parli-pro team. We  didn   t win the state championship, but we got to the finals, which is the best  they   d ever done. Trent would come in and help us whenever he was not  tied up somewhere internationally with FFA. That was quite a fun time to  help those kids and a lot of driving. Anyway, Ross and I, we still talk and  visit. I   m going to be talking a lot more to him now. We   ve got our fund to  put money in. I   m going to hit him up for a little bit. (Laughs)  Milligan It sounds like you   ve been involved for a long time now in lots of different  campaigns at OSU. You   ve been a good friend to them.  Winters Well, we raised that money for the alumni, I think I told you to begin with.  Whenever we started doing that caravan, we started putting that money up.  32  We   ve given out, with that group of guys that   s helped me, and ladies, this  year, we   ve given out over a hundred thousand in scholarships to Jackson  County kids. With Boone   s help, whenever his estate settles and he fully  funds our match money we   ve got up there in the bank, we   re going to have  three-hundred and sixty-thousand-plus dollars that will perpetually earn  interest for Jackson County kids.  Whether I do another caravan, cook another steak, heat up anything or raise  another dollar, we   re going to be able to give away, depending on interest  and their wise investment practices up there in the stock market, you know  eighteen-thousand, twenty-thousand a year. We still have people that put  money in. I do a lot of things.  I have behind me here (I   ll give you one) an envelope that we designed that  if you want to do a memorial for a friend that passed or just honor  somebody, I have an envelope that we designed. You just put your check in  it. It   s already got the fund number on it. You put your check in there, and  you mail it up there. If you want to tell them who to send a letter to, they   ll  send it to them from the foundation. I mean, it works great. In lieu of me  giving flowers to a funeral, I send money to Stillwater. I know that those  kids in my county will be the beneficiary of that money perpetually, and you  can   t do anything with the principal. It   s all interest money. It   ll be there  whenever I   m dead and gone.  Milligan All those scholarships are for, to go to OSU. Is that correct?  Winters Every scholarship is to go to OSU. If you go up there and have to go to the  remedial part, you don   t get your money. It   s got to be OSU. If you are  awarded a scholarship and you attend and you, for whatever reason, and kids  do, decide you don   t like it, you come home, whatever, you don   t get all the  money. We have the Alumni Association matching two of those  scholarships due to our friendship with Jerry Gill. Larry and them, they have  the car tag money that they get.  The two big scholarships we   ve been giving are we give a thousand, the  University gives a thousand, through the car tag program. That kid gets two  grand. We give two of those a year. That   s the most they will match up  there, and then we will give away, depending on how many applicants we  have, every other kid   s going to get a thousand or every other kid   s going to  get five-hundred. We   re in such good cash position, we   ve got seventeen  students up there currently that are not freshman. We   ve already gave those  kids money.  They   re already up there. They   re sophomore, junior, senior. The motion at  our board meeting the other night was let   s give every one of those kids, just  decide how many there are. Make sure we don   t miss anybody. If they   re  33  seventeen or fifteen or eighteen, just take whatever we got, divide it by the  number of kids, and send them the money. That   s good and bad. You get it  all spent. Now we will have the interest income from that money sitting at  the foundation. We get those dollars in July. We award our money about  May at the end of school so those kids can be announced at their school  assemblies that they got a scholarship to OSU, but we don   t have to fund  that money until about September.  Again, we went from  218 in the account. Today, we   ve got over seventeen-thousand  in our local checking account. We   ve got, soon to have three-hundred-  and-sixty thousand sitting up there, and we   ve given away close to  a hundred thousand. I think we done pretty good in fifteen years of jacking  around and having lots of fun. (Laughs)  Milligan That   s a good reason to sell steak.  Winters Well, F.B., he built a cooker, and of course, you got to know my guys. They  decided they were going to see how many steaks they could put on this one  cooker, and it was featured in every book that Stillwater publishes. The first  time we used it was for the caravan. They put 432 steaks on that one grill at  one time and cooked them, which I think   s almost phenomenal, and of  course, it   s got Pistol Pete all over it and OSU Cowboy Cooks and  everything.  Milligan You all still use it?  Winters Oh yeah, yeah. A little side story, F.B. had a niece that got married. Burned  him out on cooking. The next day, he said,    I   m done cooking.    He gave all  of those cookers to another buddy of ours that now has taken over. (Laughs)  Jake Landers, he   s the one that gave me all the corndogs yesterday from  Bar-S, but he keeps them at his house. He stills cooks for me. He takes care  of, him and Gary Winsett. Gary Winset was Burns Hargis    roommate as a  student in college. We have a little connection there. They took the cookers,  and not only do they do that event but they also do the Senator Inhofe event  that we   ve done down here for, I can   t remember how many years we   ve  done it. We   re on year twelve or thirteen or something.  Milligan For fundraising?  Winters Well, it   s that, but it   s just a fun event. It   s the dove hunt that we do to get  our United States senior senator to come to Altus. Burns has been here. Dr.  Joe Alexander, the former head of the college of vet-med, Joe and I are good  friends. That   s a deal. They need to come, and I mean, those guys, Jim got  all of the money for your media bus deal there and all of that to be built. I  mean, that was all transportation money.  34  Milligan Are you going to keep having them then now that he   s exiting his role soon,  right?  Winters Who is now?  Milligan Isn   t Inhofe, isn   t he   ?  Winters Oh no, Jim, he   s   .  Milligan He   s sticking in there for a little longer?  Winters    still got about five more years before he has to run. He   s getting some  years behind him, but no, he   ll be there. His health   s good. He   s in great  shape. We   ve got our new senator, Lankford, the other United States  senator. James and I are good friends, and I drove down to Marietta the  other day to be there. He said,    What are you doing driving all the way from  Altus?    I said,    I just wanted to be here.    I went to Bill Brewster, former  Congressman Brewster. Dan Boren was there, the former congressman for  us, and those guys are real instrumental in helping me with my shooting  facility, which we haven   t said anything on the tape about it, have we?  Milligan Do you want to?  Winters That maybe needs to be another story because we   re not quite done with  that, but we   re working hard on it. I think we really have got, we   re to the  point that it   s probably, we   re going to start turning dirt here very quickly.  Milligan You can probably say what the general goal is that you would like to help  create.  Winters The vision that I had for the shooting facility     Milligan    at Oklahoma State.  Winters    at Oklahoma State University was to build a facility that would help every  4-H kid in America. Oklahoma primarily, but America because every kid  can come and for sure regionally come. We wanted to offer every discipline,  whether it be archery, small-bore rifle, air rifle. Not every kid   s parent can  afford to buy that ten-thousand-dollar show steer or that five-hundred-dollar  club lamb or three-hundred-dollar goat, or do they have the desire to do that  or the expertise to feed them or to groom them or to haul them or whatever?  I think we need to realize that our environment   s changing in the state of  Oklahoma, as far as the livestock industry goes and those kids, and I was the  biggest shower in the world. I mean, I hit every show that we could go to in  America with my kids and never missed a one and had quite a bit of success.  The 4-Hers now, as youth, I think they have to be ten before they can shoot  35  archery or maybe ten before they can get a shotgun in the hand, but we   ve  got a great wildlife department.  Richard Hatcher and his group, they have a    S.T.E.P    called shotgun  training education program, and they, with that program, will go out to the  local schools. They have the guns that they and other donors, the Foray Club  out of Oklahoma City, those people have been very good to the Wildlife  Department to buy them trailers, pickups, shotguns, clay pigeons, bullets,  the whole nine yards, and they go to a local club. That kid doesn   t have to  have nothing but his body and his parents    permission. Can walk out there,  and with adult guidance, they will show them how to properly shoot and  learn the safety aspect. Out of millions of shots fired, we   ve never had a  problem, injury. Even close, I mean, the safety is of the utmost importance  around guns, and, of course, even with bows and arrows. Those kids, at no  cost to them, can learn to shoot, and they have just as equal opportunity. If  you live in Altus, Oklahoma, or Muskogee or Boise City or Idabel, that kid  in all seventy-seven counties in the state of Oklahoma is given the gun that  his buddies in the other counties have to shoot. He   s given the same shell,  the same opportunity, the whole nine yards.  Every kid   s on a level playing field, which I think   s pretty amazing that we  start them out that way. They all have to compete with the same economic  value, I guess, maybe as opposed to that same kid going and buying a steer,  and he gets to the show. That one Hereford cost fifty thousand, and this is  twenty thousand. You got one from the neighbor for free. Well, who   s going  to win? That shotgun deal puts everybody on a level playing field, equal  opportunity, and the goal is to have that shooting facility that will have  every one of those disciplines. We have a shotgun club there at Stillwater.  We have our rifle club. We got an ROTC.  We have an archery program at Stillwater. We have a lady that shot for the  Olympic this year, competed, and we want to have every discipline, have a  place for them to dance, have them participate and play, to recruit now. You  take those kids from age nine and ten and start bringing them to Stillwater,  you   re introducing them to what I call the orange, bleeding the orange-type  environment. Those kids, they learn where the Boone Pickens Stadium is,  where Ag Hall is, where Gallagher Iba is, and maybe even know who  Gundy might be at some point. They will be your future students, and if we  can recruit them now and get them coming, take those FFA kids, that   s a  huge thing in FFA for those kids to shoot. If we have that place for them to  go and they start going up there and shooting and then you have a district  meet and then you start having the state meet.  We   ve got the wildlife department buying into this concept. Most every one  of those guys are graduates of the wildlife management program up there.  They all are game wardens or biologists or whatever. They all bleed orange.  36  We just need to build a place for them to take their kids and their  constituents, people they deal with, to go shoot. I mean, to me, it   s pretty  simple, in my opinion. I don   t know why we hadn   t already gotten it done   (Laughs)  Milligan This is your most recent endeavor.  Winters That   s my dream. I said,    That   s Glen   s dream.    Before I died, I   d get that  sucker built.  Milligan I like it.  Winters That   s my dream, and it needs to happen. We   re starting to get the right  people in the right places. It   s just a money deal now. We   ve just got to go  get some money. The projected cost for the shooting facility   s about five  million. If we go ahead and do the Camp Redlands renovation, if you  haven   t been out there in a while, it needs it, and I champion that idea. I just  didn   t agree to raise the money for that. I   m going to have to try to help  them. The bill on both of those is about a ten million five on each, which is  nothing whenever you look at the millions we   ve spent recently at  Oklahoma State. I don   t see the money as the big hurdle.  You get to doing this, and you start seeing people having territorial issues  and things of that nature. It makes you wonder how we ever got anything  built sometimes. As you look at the old picture, it   s all, I think, good at  Stillwater. Just the concept of doing what we   re wanting to do sometimes  frightens some people because we   re talking about guns and kids. I totally  understand and get that, but we   ve never had an accident. We   ve never even  had a close accident. We   ve never had a problem. Not to say we couldn   t,  but whenever you start doing these and you read the national news and some  guy goes in a theater in Columbia and shoots people and here you   re  wanting to do something with guns, well, that does create....  Milligan We can wrap it up right now. That was the last thing I wanted, anyway, was  where you   re at today.  Winters Well, that project will happen, and some things we   re doing with the  community, water was a big thing for us. We were dry, dry, dry for five  years.  Milligan What   d you all do to   ?  Winters I put together our first water deal. I mean, I   m talking about Inhofe   s people,  Lankford   s people, Lucas    people. Of course, Frank, big OSU. We do a deal  for Frank and Linda Lucas during bedlam baseball, and we host them at the  37  Bricktown. Buster Funk and I are good friends. Bob lets me have his suite  that we host people in.  Milligan What   d you do with the water? What was the deal?  Winters Well, our lake   s been dry. We hadn   t been able to irrigate. My farmers are  going broke, okay? They can   t raise cotton. They can   t do anything, but now  they   ve got water. We put together a deal and a very comprehensive water  plan for this part of the state, and our goal is to never let this state ever get  dry again, this part of the state which is the driest. We   re going to build a  new reservoir over here. That   s about a three-hundred million-dollar project.  It   s going to be built at the location that the former lake that was built     there was two locations at the time. I   ve got my oldest son, he   s chairman of  that now. (Laughs) I   ve turned it over to him, but they had a water meeting  today. You ought to go to it. What time is it?  Milligan It   s almost two. You   re going to have to go here soon.  Winters Oh, right. I   ve got to get around. Anyway, Jed   s in charge of the water deal.  We   re going to   .  Milligan There   s something going on right now with that.  Winters We got waterlines. We   ve got the governor to give us seven hundred and  fifty thousand dollars. We   re running lines to down in Vernon. We   re  running water up here. We   ve got the water treatment plant fixed. We   ve got  Tom Stead drilling new wells. We   ve got new water going up. I   m talking  about very, very comprehensive water plan. We   ll never be thirsty here.  We   re even doing a deal with our Air Force Base and Shepherd at Wichita  Falls to give them a part of the lake so that they will never have to worry  ever about their air bases being dry...  Milligan That   s good.  Winters    which is pretty huge whenever you look at the scheme of things. You hear  on the national news about dryness in California, and of course, they got lots  of people out there. We   re piggybacking on some of their legislation that  Barbara Boxer and some of them are doing. You hear all these names, but I  know all them people. We   re going to get some of the money.  Milligan Oklahoma has a long history of water, water rights debates and water rights  issues, too. It   s interesting.  Winters I tell everybody the tribes wants access to all the water, and they don   t really  want the water. They just want the power that that water controls. They want  to use that water as leverage with the state of Texas. They   re going to say to  38  Dallas, Tarrant County and all them others,    We   ll give you some water, but  you can   t build any casinos down there. We want to keep the casinos in  Oklahoma,    or    If we build one, the tribes want to build it in Dallas    or  what have you. It   s a leverage thing. They don   t care about the water. They  care about what the water gets you. (Laughs)  Milligan That   s a long topic. Well, in the interest of getting you out and out to your  antelope that you have coming up later on today, I   m going to go ahead and  shut it down, unless there   s anything else that you want to talk about.  Winters I don   t know of nothing. Hopefully, there   ll be something somebody  remember in that series of stuff I talked about.  Milligan I definitely think so. It was really interesting.  -------  -------
