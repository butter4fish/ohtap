 Finchum  Heath  Today is November 17, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library and I   m here in Stillwater to talk  with Dick Heath, a 1950 graduate of OSU/OAMC. Let   s start by having  you tell us about where you were born and then we   ll work forward.  I was born in Perry, Oklahoma on June 5, 1927, but don   t have a  recollection of it. My folks moved to Cordell, Oklahoma right after that.  I have no recollection of that. Then, we moved to Stillwater on January  1, 1930. My dad was the manager of Central State   s Power and Light  which is the forerunner of Oklahoma Natural Gas. He had been the  manager in Perry and then Cordell and then they moved him to  Stillwater. They wanted to move him back to Cordell in the middle of  the Depression. They  Heath   s parents  felt the only way my brother and  I would get a college education was to stay in Stillwater. He quit his job  in the middle of the Depression. He got another one at the newspaper  and life goes on from there, so only recollection is living in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. I was two and a half at that time.  Was your mother was a stay-at-home mom?  She was a stay-at-home mom, which most of them were in those days.  Are there any other memories you want to share about the Depression?  You would have been in grade school then?  I was six in 1933. I went through grade school basically during the  Depression and high school during World War II. Actually, didn   t come  out of the Depression really until after World War II. I grew up in that  period of time not wanting for anything. Nobody had anything,  basically. Some of my friends were kids of a university professor, but in  those days, they didn   t even make much money. So there wasn   t a lot of  money at that time, there wasn   t a lot. We had three meals a day and  5  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  grew up fine. Everybody was pretty much the same though, really.  And you had one brother?  Had one brother.  Had anyone before you gone to OAMC in your family?  My brother graduated from high school in 1940 and started   lacked one  semester of graduating when he went into service and then was killed in  Germany in World War II.  Did you have a choice as to where you would go to college or was it  always going to be here?  Oh, there wasn   t any choice in those days. I lived three blocks from the  university campus, so there wasn   t any question. The house that I grew  up in was at 520 Monroe which is the last house on the south end where  the development foundation built their building. They took my house  (laughs), but we moved up there June 1, 1933, right before I was six  years old. So that   s the house I grew up in. I went to grade school at  Eugene Field which is where the IGA is now at Sixth and Washington.  There weren   t school lunch programs at that time. I came home at noon  and ate and went back. The big celebration was, every once in awhile  my mother would have something at the church at noon. I couldn   t go  home at noon and they   d give me fifteen cents and the Aggie Barbeque  was right across the street there and I could go over and get a big  hamburger for a dime and a bottle of pop. And that was a celebration  when I was a kid growing up. Didn   t happen very often, but it did.  Since we   re talking a little bit about Stillwater itself, did you go to the  library very often?  Not too often, no. We did go to the library at times, but not too often.  Just kind of grew up.  I know in the early    30s it wasn   t the building that   s on Sixth Street. It  was a smaller white framed house. Do you remember?  I   m not even sure. I   m aware and remember when they built the one on  Sixth, but I   m not quite sure when it was.  So while you were attending OAMC you lived at home?  Oh, yes. I lived in the fraternity house one year, but the rest of the time I  lived at home and then even then there weren   t a lot of automobiles as  6  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  far as the students were concerned. I know my brother was also a Beta   Theta Pi  and before the war at the Beta house there was one car. Which  hardly, the kids today can   t fathom that. After the war, there were  probably eight or ten automobiles. Fortunately, I lived three or four  blocks from the Beta house. If I had a date, where I grew up was a  detached garage, I could go use the family car and then take it and put it  back in the garage and go back to the Beta house. It was three or four  blocks away. It was not anything. That was an interesting time.  What kind of things would you do for fun?  Growing up?  Or on campus. Either one.  There were a lot of activities on campus and a lot of activities connected  with the fraternity. And so for fun, the intramural sports, there were a lot  more dances, I think, than there are now. There was dance hour at the  sorority houses during the week. We   d go to those. Hung out at the Frat  Shop, which has been long gone. It was across the street from the Chi  Omega house. My wife is a Chi Omega. It was across the street from the  Chi Omega house and it was a hangout spot during that time,  particularly for the groups, the fraternities and sororities, that were close.  There were just maybe four or five booths inside, but the front porch  was always full of people and everything. No hard liquor of any kind.  Just soft drinks and coffee, but it was a hangout and I could say the  fraternity took up a lot of the time and I belonged to Beta Alpha Si,  which is the accounting fraternity. Member of Blue Key. Played in the  band at the football games. They didn   t do the intricate designs that they  do on the field now. We did some, but certainly it was not even close to  what goes on now.  And then sports. Oklahoma A M sports. I   ve been a sports nut since I  was a little kid and so I attended everything that they did at that time     football games, the basketball games, the wrestling, which basically was  it. In fact, growing up, I don   t know how many people are still around  that went to sports in the old gymnasium, which is now the architecture  building, but that   s where they played until    39 I think, when the field  house was built. In Stillwater, we didn   t worry about safety. We  wandered all over town when we were little. Didn   t drive all over town  because nobody had a car. None of the kids had a car, but you wandered  all over town. You wandered over the university. Went to the basketball  games in the old gymnasium. Went to wrestling matches in the old  gymnasium and so that was a real big thing in my life growing up.  Sounds like you stayed pretty busy.  7  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Oh, yeah. It was not a problem. Not a problem and then in my younger  years there weren   t organized sports, but you   re playing football in the  front yard or baseball over where the hospital now sits because that was  a vacant field, but it was an interesting time.  We did  things that  basically didn   t take money because there wasn   t much money.  Speaking of money, how did you finance your college education?  I got out of high school in    45 and World War II was still on. I went in  service in June of    45. I was in the Navy. War was over when I was in  boot camp and then they started letting you out. I was fortunate. I only  spent fourteen months in service and got out in August of    46, but it put  me through three years of school. I didn   t have to work when I was  going to school. I made enough in the summers at various jobs to pay for  the year that I didn   t have the GI Bill.  Pretty lucky there.  Yeah, very fortunate in the timing, very fortunate.  What led you to choose accounting as your major?  Well, not real sure. My brother was in accounting before he went into  service, but then I took aptitude tests and basically it said engineering.  My math has always been strong and I thought if you   re an engineer I  didn   t realize you might be able to work for yourself. I thought you   d  always have to work for somebody else, so I looked around. I thought  accounting was the best school in the School of Business, the best  degree I could get, so I went into accounting not really knowing  everything that they even did.  And you   re glad you did?  I   m glad I did. I graduated in 1950. The World War II vets were still  coming out of college. The economy really hadn   t picked up that much  and jobs were very scarce. I was fortunate enough that I had a job with  Southwestern Bell. They   d interviewed both here and at OU and hired  six people and I felt fortunate that I was one of them. Before I went to  work for Southwestern Bell, Peat Marwick, the international accounting  firm called and offered me a job and, kind of a funny story here   you go  through the interview and people can   t even understand it, but Mr.  McKeown, who was hiring, said,    What are they paying you?    I told  him I had another job. I said,     250 a month.    Well, he said,    That   s our  starting pay.    Actually, they were paying me  240, but I thought I could  slip in another ten dollars there at  250 a month. Now I tried to explain  that to my children or grandchildren, my hourly wage was a dollar  8  Finchum  Heath  something and now the minimum wage is six-something. But, at that  time I went to work at  250 in July of 1950. We got married in  December of that year and by then I   m making  275 and Marilyn got a  job at about  190 and they raised her to  210 and so we   re making about   500 dollars a month. We had more money at that time than we did until  the children were all gone from home. Things were inexpensive. There   s  no way that my children or grandchildren can even understand the  economy at that time. It   s all just escalated.  Have you stayed in Stillwater your entire career?  I worked for Peat Marwick in Tulsa for about four years. We had one  child and Marilyn was pregnant with a second one and we said,    Let   s  go home.    She grew up in Perkins   my wife grew up in Perkins, so she  said,    Let   s go home.    We went back here, not really sure exactly what  was going to happen. I worked with her dad and her brother at a  manufacturing business in Perkins a couple of years. Decided that I  wanted to get back into the accounting business and went to work for a  man here with the idea that I would buy his practice. After a couple of  years, I saw that wasn   t going to happen, so I opened my own office in  November of    59. We had  200 and three kids and started there. I had to  borrow out a couple thousand from the bank, which they wanted  everything I had secured plus my dad   s signature, which I thought was  ridiculous, but we had to start some place. That   s where we started and I  had my own office here in Stillwater and enjoyed that. The rest of my  working life after a number of years   and that was pre-computer  accounting and so it was very intense. I went to work January 1 and  worked through April 15   ten or twelve hours a day during tax season  because that is when you could make enough to survive the rest of the  year. I took in a partner and sold it to him in 1980.  At that time, we owned a nursing home which I had bought. One of my  clients had died and his wife was unable to run it. I had a nursing home  and we operated it until 1983 and then sold it because the staffing  problems and everything else. I wasn   t retired, but I was semi-retired  and doing a few other things and then in 1987, when Governor Bellmon  was elected governor the second time, we worked in campaigns and  became very good friends of the Bellmons and he wanted me to go down  as administrator of the Tax Commission. I told him I was really pretty  happy with my life but he   s a persuasive man and he had done his duty  and so I thought I could do mine. I went down for four years as  administrator of the Tax Commission. Probably the first Republican that  had been inside the Tax Commission in the history of Oklahoma and did  enjoy it. We got an apartment down at 6000 Penn and I   d go down  Monday morning and Marilyn would come down that afternoon and  we   d stay down there during the week unless she had some reason to  9  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  come back   it wasn   t far. But I didn   t want to commute and so that took  care of    87 to    91. After spending four years in state government, and I  enjoyed it, we made some changes that helped, but then about the last  six months I had all of it that I cared for and so in    91 I came back and I  did retire in 1991.  Completely?  Completely. I still do our taxes and a couple of things we   re involved  with and our daughter   s taxes, I do those. Did a couple of old friend   s  that lived out of town for awhile, but they   re gone now and so I   m down  to just the things that we   re involved with. I try to stay up enough to be  aware of the problems and then with the computer now you can get a  program that you can do taxes with. It   s pretty good.  Let   s back up a little bit and let you tell me how you met your wife.  How I met my wife. It   s really kind of interesting, like I say, she grew  up in Perkins eleven miles south or ten miles south of here. I   d known  her brother for awhile; he   s a year older than I am. I knew who he was in  college. I also knew who Marilyn was. I think she knew who I was, but  we had never dated or anything. The night I graduated from college in  May of    50, we were behind the Beta house  and  she was behind the  Beta house with a fraternity brother of mine in a car. We were all sitting  out there that night and that was in May and so on my twenty-third  birthday, the fifth of June, I called her and we had a date. We went to the  Fond Du Lac in Drumright, which had a good dance floor; also  prohibition  was in effect  in Oklahoma, but it didn   t bother them in  Creek County. We went over there and danced. I was going to work in  Tulsa. This was her sophomore year in college and very boring for her  because she was going with me. I was just here on the weekends and so  she went for awhile and then quit college. We got married on December  23 of that year, so this will be our 59th anniversary this year. We think  it   s going to work. (Laughter) We went together about six months before  we got married.  Must have been love at first date?  Well, you never know. Like I say, she knew who I was. I had gone with  a friend of hers that she lived in the dorm with, but I think it was time     both of us were ready to get married.  This happened after you graduated, so you didn   t get thrown in Theta  Pond then?  No. No, I didn   t, but a number of them did (laughter) but I did get to go  10  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  on the serenade that we always did when somebody became engaged  and went to the Chi Omega house and sang, so we did do that. But no.  And like I say, it   s been an interesting time. We like each other. We love  each other, so the last years have been absolutely unbelievable.  And you had three children?  We have three children.  How many of the three went to OSU?  All three of them have graduated from OSU. Janet has a degree here and  she   s been a teacher in the Tulsa School System for years. She taught at  Carver first which is a magnet school and now she teaches at  Washington High School. Second daughter graduated here, but she got  married and then made up her mind that she was going to get a degree  prior to the time that her second son got his degree here. She went back  and graduated in    80, I think, and is vice president of a bank here in  town. And then our son cunningly turned four years into seven, he   s a  golfer. Of course, a golfer growing up here you wanted to go to  Oklahoma State because of the golf program and he was a good high  school golfer, but they were loaded at the time he got out of high school,  so he went to McClennon Junior College in Waco for two years, won the  national junior college and then Mike  Holder  wanted him back here  and so he came back here the last two years and lacked a little bit of  graduating. Went out on the mini tour and then came back finally and  graduated after about seven years by the time he started and got his  degree here.  First grandchild is a daughter of the one that lives in Tulsa. She went to  TU and graduated there. Second grandchild is from the daughter here, he  went to Grinnell, but came back and spent his junior year, I think, here,  and then went back and graduated from Grinnell. The third grandchild  graduated from here and has just finished his doctorate of Pharmacy.  He   s just finishing up right now. Will be in pharmacy and so then the  fourth grandchild, the son of our   our son lives in California and he was  a pretty good high school wrestler and John Smith asked him to walk on  here. He spent his freshman year here with the wrestling team and  determined, I mean he loved wrestling, but knew he wasn   t going to be a  national champion, so he decided that after his freshman year he  wouldn   t wrestle anymore, went to a community college his next  semester in California and hated it. He   s back here now. He   s a junior  back here in Oklahoma State. He   ll graduate from here next year and  loves it. Then the next grandchild is a freshman in high school in  California. I don   t know whether she   ll come here or not. She may. She  talks about it and then we have a great-grandchild that   s five who lives  11  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  in Louisville, Kentucky with his mother and I have no idea what   s going  to happen to him. He   s a dandy. (Laughter)  So there   s three generations of OAMC or OSU graduates.  Right. You know, my brother would have been the first one in my  family to get a college degree, but then he was killed in the war and so I  was the first one actually to get a college degree.  What is it about OSU that keeps people devoted to it and generations  coming to it?  I   m not sure. I think it   s the atmosphere. It   s a friendly campus and the  people that go here generally enjoy it. We   ve had a lot of friends that  couldn   t wait to get out of here and get away from Stillwater and then   they  came back. It   s just a nice place. Stillwater is a wonderful town to  live in and raise a family in. When I was growing up it was a little town,  I knew practically everybody in town when I was growing up. It was  small. The school was small. The education   the seventh grade through  the twelfth grade actually went to school together in the place that   s the  community building now and the library and you actually went back and  forth sometimes for classes. Then the band shack and the shop were  down at South High and so you were going back and forth and it was  little. You started playing in the high school band in the seventh grade.  They needed you, (laughter) it was small. It has, of course, grown a great  deal now and there was very little industry when I was growing up.  There wasn   t any industry. Our business was the college and the college  pretty well controlled the town at that time. I   ve been fortunate. I didn   t  know Dr. Bennett, I knew who he was, but then he was killed during the  war. Dr. Willham  who  came behind Bennett and my folks were very  good friends and so basically I   ve known them all since that time. The  good ones and the bad ones.  (Laughs) We won   t ask which is which.  I think, right now we have the best situation that we have probably ever  had for the growth and the healthiness of the university with Burns  Hargis. I felt forever that we should have had a president and a provost  that handles the academics side and the other one that handles the  publicity side and the growth side. I think we have that at the current  time, but we   ve just now moved into it. We   ve always had an academic  that was president   well since Bennett. I don   t think he was and that   s  why it grew to start with, but that   s what I think you have to have, both  sides of it. When I had my accounting practice, practically all the vice  presidents and most of the deans were clients of mine. I had a close  relationship. In 1973 I was president of the Chamber  of Commerce  and  12  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  we had the chamber officers and the president of the university and the  vice presidents. We met once a month or once every two months   we  would host dinner one time or just a meal at noon one time and they  hosted the other time. We solved a lot of the problems before they  existed for Stillwater and for the University. I don   t know whether that   s  still going on and I hope that it would because it was a very healthy  situation. Actually, that   s when Dr. Kamm was president and it was a  good, healthy situation for the town and helped us grow in both ways.  It   s changed a lot since you were there, too, the campus itself has. Can  you tell us a little bit about which buildings you had classes in?  Yeah, some of them don   t exist because they were the Quonset huts that  we used after the war, terrible if you had a class that was at one or two  o   clock in the afternoon in the spring because it was warm and they  weren   t air conditioned. They were just there. The doors were open, but  most of my classes were in Morrill Hall because I was in the business  college and the majority of my classes were there. I   m trying to think  where the others might have been. Most of them were there.  Any in Old Central?  Had one class in Old Central, an econ class. It was whatever Dr.  Fred   Jewett taught. He wasn   t an econ professor, I   m not sure what he taught,  but it was up in the second floor of Old Central. I   m delighted that  they   re preserving it and making it the Honors College. I think that   s  very neat. At that time, it needed a lot of help.  Do you remember some of your favorite professors?  Gene Schauer was probably the best. He and Burl Austin were probably  the best accounting professors because I thought you learned more under  them than you did the others. It was relatively small. There weren   t but  four or five accounting professors at that time. And I   ll tell you an  interesting story about being a professor. When I opened my office in  1959, doing anything I could to feed a wife and three kids, but after the  first   in the summer, I guess it had to be the summer of    60,  J. Richard      Dick    Vandegrift died. He was the auditing instructor at the university  and B.F. Harrison was still head of the Accounting Department and he  called me and said,    We can fill all of Vandegrift   s spots except  auditing.    He said,    We don   t have anybody qualified to teach auditing.     I   d worked for Peat Marwick for four years. He said would I teach a  class? I said,    Yeah, I   ll do that.    I think they paid me  150 a month and  I taught a class the first semester and then an advanced class the second  semester and enjoyed it. I felt that you could teach and work a little on  the side, but you can   t work and teach on the side because it took too  13  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  much time away from my practice to teach the auditing course. I enjoyed  it and some of the people that I had in my class   Dan Draper was in my  class that later became Speaker of the House. He was a good student, he  just was having a little off year that year. He didn   t come to class very  much, but he was an excellent student and then you have interesting  things that happen later in life. John and Caroline Linehan have a house  right down from us here. When I first met them and they came back and  were building down here, he said,    Didn   t you teach a class? An  auditing class?    And I said,    Yes, I did.    He said,    I was in your class.     (Laughs) He later went on to a very successful business career and   became  very well known.  Small world and they come back to you.  Small world, right. But my teaching career was one class one year. I  enjoyed it. I enjoyed the students. The advanced class that I had just had  ten students in it. I really didn   t even need to give them a test when we  got through because we had open discussion to talk all year and I knew  their abilities very well because it was just ten of them. It was great.  Loved it. Loved it.  What advice would you give current students?  That   s pretty difficult. I   ve been removed so long. I would certainly  advise them to study and I don   t know whether their grading is easier  now. It seems like we have a lot more bright students than we had. I  think one thing, the university is harder to get into. Back then when we  were in school you could get into the university. Now, I think you have  to have pretty good credentials just to get into Oklahoma State and so  perhaps overall they are brighter. I would encourage them not to just  study, but to be involved in campus activities and other things that are  going on so that you do broaden your horizons. When I was there the  accounting students that were just the brains and virtually had nothing  else, people would hire them for their knowledge, but they had trouble  advancing because they weren   t able to handle people and become  administrators. They had a job and they had a good job, but a lot of them  were stuck in that good job and unless they had the skills to interact with  people, they didn   t advance like some of the others did that could handle  administration along with the problems in business. I   d say do it all. And  enjoy it, too. Enjoy that part of it too because you   re only going to go  through college once.  True. Do you get back on campus very often?  Well, for sports. We have basketball tickets and we have football tickets  and go to some of the wrestling matches when we   re here. We   re gone  14  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  from January first through March. We go to California now. It   s cold  here and so we like to get out of it. We spend three months a year out  there now. Even though we   ve got basketball tickets, I   m not here for  basketball season. Our daughter has the tickets when we   re gone. She  also has tickets but she sells her and uses ours because the seats are  better, but as far as other activities, not too much anymore.  I was just curious if you walked across campus, what thoughts you might  be having?  One of the thoughts that I have is,    My gosh, we have a bunch of new  buildings and construction going on all the time, and it   s a very pretty  campus.    I think back   Phil Wilber was the school architect back, gosh,  probably when I was in school and when I was an alumni. He was the  school architect for a long time and one of them had helped create the  Georgian atmosphere that we have on campus. I think we have a very  pretty campus. We have one that   s used by the students. It   s certainly  used on football weekends for tailgating and it   s crazy. That didn   t exist.  Of course, we were here   well I was in high school during the first  glory years. Bob Fenimore   s time and Neill Armstrong   s time where we  went to the Cotton Bowl and the Sugar Bowl and had one of the top  teams in the country during World War II. I was in high school, but very  much involved. I knew most of the guys that were on the football team  because it was little. The campus was small. We had service people in  here that lived in the dormitories.  Oh yeah, one story I did want to tell you, because growing up at 520  Monroe, which is Monroe Street prior to World War II where the  hospital sits now, was a CCC Camp   the Civil Conservation Corps that  some of Roosevelt   s things that he put in to try to pull us out of the  Depression, they lived there. There were barracks there. Then, during  World War II, the barracks were taken over   I think it was the Air  Force there and I don   t think they ate there, I think they ate on campus.  So early in the morning at six o   clock or six-thirty they   d come down  Monroe Street singing, which was kind of nice   came right down  Monroe and went up to campus and then started the day   s activities. But  during World War II we had a lot of service people and some of the Air  Force, some of the Army, some of the WAVES. I don   t know whether  we had the army women in here or not. I can   t remember, but you would  know more than me. You would have that in your history more than I  would, but we had a lot of service people. I worked at Mile   s Student  Store which is now the pizza place     The Hideaway?  Where Hideaway pizza is now. That was Mile   s Student Store during  15  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  World War II and I went to high school and I worked up there some  after school. On the weekends I worked back engraving on billfolds and  fountain pens and all that and then selling Indian jewelry. We had a  bunch   see communication didn   t exist then like it does now with the  computer and television. The service people came in here from the east  and were concerned   they still thought Indians were active in the area.  It was a fun time. I worked there and sold stuff for them and interacted  with the service people that were here. That was a student hang out at  that time, Miles Student Store was. One side was a fountain and  restaurant and the other side had books and, like I said, sold things to  people. It was an interesting time, but I don   t know, I think maybe the  students are a little more dedicated as a whole now than they were in  those times. Maybe not, but that   s my observation. Maybe there   s the  same group that existed at our time.  Right after the war was an interesting time on campus because we had  students coming out of high school. We had people who had been  overseas for three or four years in combat. In the fraternity house, we  had one guy that was like sixteen and one that was thirty. The one not  only had been in service, but was unable to finish his education  financially, but then the GI Bill let him come back to school so you had  a mixture. That was a very difficult time for perhaps at least the younger  ones because of alcohol. You tried to say there   d be no alcohol in the  fraternity houses and you   ve got guys that have been in war for three  years and overseas. It was a little bit difficult at that time because of the  difference in age and the difference of backgrounds, but we survived it.  What was Homecoming like?  It was great in those days. Everybody got involved with it. I can think of  the different floats   we probably had more floats then because there  wasn   t even the action much between fraternities and sororities that they  go together now. Each one would do one, it was bigger then. It was a big  day for us when I was in college, but it was also a big day after we were  raising the kids because you   d get up and you   d go to the parade and  then go to the fraternity house or the sorority house. Generally, the  fraternity house at noon before the game and then go to the game and  then come back and we had places we went afterwards. It was a big day  growing up and a big day when we were in school. And so I   m delighted  that Oklahoma State still carries it on as one of the few places in the  country because it   s big and I think it   s a great atmosphere.  Did you have opinion when the name changed?  Oh, not really. Even though I had grown up with Oklahoma A M, I  thought it was fine. I thought it was doing very well and, of course, I  16  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  graduated before they opened the Union. It opened in the fall of 1950,  after I had graduated in May of 1950, but when I was a kid, Washington  Street went right through the campus. The library didn   t exist, the Union  didn   t exist and when we went north of town, we went down to  Washington Street and went up Miller from Washington. There were a  lot of the buildings that are here were there at that time, but certainly the  library wasn   t there. The road went right through where the library is  now.  It must have been interesting watching the Union being built.  Yeah, oh yeah, it was. It was. And then we used it a lot. It was open  when Marilyn, my wife, came back for her second year. It was open and  then we went to a lot of things. A lot of things were held in the Union.  And so we   ve been in the Union a bunch. Haven   t been there too much  in recent years  The Starlight Terrace?  Yes.  To dance?  We held dances in the Union. Fraternity and sorority dances were held in  the Union. They were held in the old gymnasium, which is the  architecture building now. Had a great floor   had a basketball court, so  there were dances held there. There were dances other places. Some of  them mixed up because in high school   when high school had dances at  Hoke Hall, which is the building at Seventh and Husband downtown, on  the third floor of that  is where we would have  dances and high school  dances. Fiscus Hall, which is up over K   s, that was Fiscus Hall. There  were dances up there. The one thing we had prior to and just after the  war, there were three good dance bands here and there were three of  them right after the war. My brother played in one of them and it went  from three down to one as the guys went into service. He played in one  that started with the student entertainers. Jimmy Baker was the director  and then he had a band afterward too, but great dance bands on campus  of the big band era.  And an interesting thing, talking about money. My brother was the  treasurer of the dance band because the others weren   t as responsible as  he was. So, after they played a dance, well here the guys all come down  to the house to get their five dollars. That   s what they got for playing a  dance was five dollars. Then after the war, like I say, we had three great  bands on campus. It was still the big band era. Harry James came in here  for the junior-senior prom at the field house one year. I know my wife  17  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  has got a bunch of things that I   m skipping, but it was a lot of things that  went on. Like I say, I don   t know that they have the dances now like  they used to. Do they on campus?  I think they   re starting to have more.  I think that   s great. It was interaction.  Did they have the Howdy Dance?  Now that was the opening dance. In fact, I know they had it sometimes  at the old gym. They had it there. I don   t know whether they had it at the  field house or not. Mr. Iba was always very protective of the floor.  However, we used to go up on Saturdays and all played basketball in the  old gymnasium. It was not closed off to anybody. The kids from high  school, we   d go up there and play basketball at the old gym, at the field  house.  Interesting war story, of course,  during  World War II they had scrap  metal drives. They were doing everything to collect scrap metal and turn  them back into guns and ammunition and stuff. When they had moved  from the old gymnasium to the field house, they took a bunch of the  lockers that had been in the old gym and put them in the basement of the  field house. The basement of the field house at that time was dirt, there  was a track down there but it was basically just dirt and several of us  from the high school went up there with sledge hammers and beat the  old lockers into scraps where they could haul it out and turn it into scrap  metal and turn it into war needed necessities.  You were instructed to do that?  Oh, we were instructed to do that. They were doing everything they  could to get scrap metal. It   s a shame they don   t do some of it now and  clean up some of the spots that are around our country, but we needed it  then in World War II. Different time; a different war in that everyone  was involved. There were conscientious objectors who were people who  didn   t like to kill, but there were not people objecting the war.  Everything we   ve had since that time   Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, we have  people that object and protest   that didn   t exist in World War II.  Everyone wanted to be involved. We had victory gardens because things  were hard to get. Supplies of gasoline were poor. You had coupons to  get gasoline. You had red meat coupons to get meat. And so people grew  gardens and we had chickens in the backyard. My dad built a little  chicken house. We had six hens that laid eggs, provided those. It was a  different time. Everyone was involved in one way or the other. People  worked in the plants and so it was different.  18  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Stillwater actually had victory gardens?  Oh, yeah. We had one. When I was growing up, basically the west edge  of Stillwater, south of Sixth Street was Adams Street, which is just the  first block west of Monroe. Beyond there, there were a few things out on  Ninth Street and the hospital was built, I think, in the late    30s. I   m not  sure when the hospital was built there, but the area from Sixth to  Eighth   it was west of Adams Street. It was all   I mean they plowed up  little areas and people went out and worked there in the evenings and  raised vegetables. We had potatoes and tomatoes and all kinds of stuff  that we raised out there because there wasn   t an abundance. You  couldn   t go to Wal-Mart or IGA or the Food Court and get things. It just  didn   t exist. So then   see the west edge of Stillwater, north of Sixth,  was Orchard Lane, basically. There wasn   t anything west of there. When  we were in college, the paved road ended where Westwood school is at  the current time. I-35 didn   t exist and so there was a dirt road   we   d  party quite a bit at Lake Blackwell, but it was all dirt roads. You didn   t  want to go out there when it had been raining and so I don   t remember  when that was done, but Stillwater was little. I walked all over town.  Did they have movie theaters?  Yeah, downtown we had the Aggie, which was between Sixth and  Seventh on Main Street, on the east side. It was almost on Seventh  Street. You can still see a little eminence of the decoration there. Then  down on the next block was the Camera and the Mecca theaters and then  they built the Leachman, which was on Fifth and Main where they sell  bedding now   mattresses. And then the Campus  Theater , which was at  the corner of University and Knoblock which is now part of the pizza  place. But yeah, we had those and then the drive-in movie that was out  north of town, so movies were a big part of the recreation in high school  and college.  I know the Hideaway came into existence sometime in the    50s, didn   t it?  I believe that   s probably true. I   m trying to think when he put it there  because the original Hideaway was on Third. I don   t even know what   s  there now just east of Knoblock on the south side of the street. I don   t  know what   s there, whether it   s washateria or something, but the  original Hideaway was there and existed there for quite some time. Then  it moved to where it is now, but I think it must have been the    50s. It was  not there when I was in college.  Do you remember when you had your first pizza?  Oh yeah, but the first pizza that we had, we made. Marilyn made it. In  19  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  fact, I believe it was Joan Smith   Dr. Smith   s wife brought us the first  pizza, but people made them then. There wasn   t DiGiornio and there  weren   t a lot of pizza places even. You made it at home and we had  pizza parties. People would get in the neighborhood, a lot of little kids  running around and the women made pizzas and we had pizza parties.  But now we don   t go without having one in the fridge so that we can  pull it out. There   s just nothing in the house, so once a week we have  pizza.  Would you like to talk a little bit more about dancing?  Like I say, the dances were a big thing and there was one practically  every weekend or two, practically every weekend and sometimes you  couldn   t go to other fraternities    dances unless you were invited or  sororities, but they did have the dance hours at the university. The  sorority houses, as small as they were and it was jammed and crowded,  but from seven to eight on Monday nights or a certain night, you could  just go and it   s how you met people.  Did the women have a curfew?  Oh heavens, yes. The freshmen had to be in at eight o   clock in the  dorms. It was a pretty good deal for us, you could have a Coke date and  then you could have another date after eight, (laughs) keep you kind of  busy, but yeah they had to be in at eight o   clock. Marilyn lived in the  dorm the first year. Freshmen lived in the dorm and at eight o   clock they  had to be in, which was not all that bad. There wasn   t any co-habiting  either, which I think exists now. But it seems strange. I think there  should be a separation between the sexes, I think that   s a good thing  myself. Maybe I   m old fashioned, but I don   t think so.  I grew up close to campus. When I was a kid, I used to go up and catch  crawdads out of Theta Pond and then go fishing at Boomer when my dad  got home. We   d go out and fish from Boomer. We   d go out and use  crawdads for fish bait, when my brother was killed in    45, in Germany,  our mother was a big gardener and belonged to the Garden Club and the  Garden Club gave the folks a magnolia. It was probably four or five feet  high. We planted it in the side yard which was narrow and skimpy.  That   s the magnolia that is at the south end of the parking lot of the  Development Foundation. Now, it   s sick and we   re trying to do  something with it, but I don   t know that it   s going to survive. And also,  there   s a little plaque and bench down there that tells the story at the  south end of the parking lot there at the Development Foundation, but  I   m working with them and I appreciate it very much. That tree is not  going to survive because of the building around it and everything that   s  been done. They   re trying to capture a seed and plant another one on  20  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  another area of the Development Foundation so that it will continue to  exist, and we hope it does.  And what was the Rock Castle?  Oh, the Rock Castle. I   m not sure, you went into it from the west off  of   I   m not sure how you got there now, but it was down north of Sixth.  It may be the building that   s the Moose Lodge now, but there were  different roads into the thing, but it was one of the university hangouts.  A great dance floor. It always had music down there, so we   d take our  dates and go down there. Now, it wasn   t a bar because this was dry at  that time and you couldn   t sell beer, I think, within 200 feet of a dance  place   3.2 beer, which was supposedly non-alcoholic. So you could go  out back there 200 feet and right over a fence, you could buy beer and  then bring it back inside. There wasn   t anything against having it in the  dance hall. You just couldn   t sell it in a dance hall. But, that was a great  university hangout all the years we were in college and I don   t know  exactly when it disappeared. I think when they changed Perkins Road  and built Perkins Road up because then it virtually didn   t exist north of  Sixth there; existed south, but not north. And so that was a good  hangout, yeah.  And was Swim   s there?  Oh, yeah. Swim   s was a great place. It was a real big college hangout  because just the Swim   s store and then they danced all up above it.  Is that building still standing?  Oh, yeah. It   s the one that   s the corner of, what is that, Elm? Well, it   s  right across from Eskimo Joe   s. And the house where Stan  Clark  has  his business operation, that was owned by the Swim   s. They were a   I  was trying to think. There were three brothers. They   re older than I am.  Paul and Bustie and another one, but they lived there. I   ve been in that  house when the Swim   s lived there. They had two kids, one of them  older than me, one of them younger. They   re both deceased now, but I  was in that house. Swim   s was a real hangout. It was always full of  college students, particularly before the war. It was a hangout then. Then  it was still a hangout afterwards and then they built the Grey Fox up  above it later, I   m not sure when, and it was a dance place and a beer  hall up above Swim   s. Then, the laws had changed a little bit.  Jukebox or live bands?  Jukebox mainly. The jukebox was a big thing in those days. (Laughter)  Almost a lost art now with the way that the records come by. Stillwater  21  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  was an easy place to grow up in. I think maybe most places were in  those days when I was growing up. We didn   t have the crime that exists  today and it   s a little bit surprising because the country was much  poorer. During the Depression I can remember people coming by and  my mother feeding them. I mean they   d sit on the back steps and ask if  there was anything they could do. And of course, the houses weren   t  locked because you couldn   t lock the house because the ice man had to  bring the ice in and put it in the refrigerator. The milk man had to bring  milk in and put it in the refrigerator. The houses were not locked. We  didn   t have a problem that I can recall in Stillwater, of theft. You just  went to school and played outside and went back to school. And then in  high school we had high school dances. A bunch of them. They had high  school fraternities and sororities here in Stillwater. Had three of each  and they all had dances and so I had lots of activities. Didn   t have  television. Didn   t have computers. Didn   t have cell phones, but we  seemed to grow up okay.  I   ve heard other people mention Eugene Field school, but they haven   t  talked much about it. Is there anything you want to say more about it?   It was  grades one through six. Block and a half from my house, so we  went down there, had a dirt playground that had an outdoor basketball  court there on the playground, but we   d spend time on the weekends or  after school. And I don   t know, I think one of the things that I remember  more than any other is that they didn   t hesitate if somebody fouled up to  give them a spanking at school. (Laughs) They weren   t worried about a  lawsuit and if you got one at school, you might get one at home. And  then you   d talk about it. When I was in grade school, we had seven  teachers that was just split first and second grade. Then there was a first  grade, second grade, third, grade, and fourth grade, fifth grade, and sixth  grade. That was all that was there and the teachers, I still remember them  all from that time because you had them for a whole year. They were  good teachers. One of them taught all three of our kids at Westwood.  She ended up at Westwood and taught all three of our kids, Lillis  Lawhawn. But that   s about the only thing. I was sad when they tore it  down and made it a grocery store.  Did you have to practice for air raids?  Not that I recall. We were aware of the things, but being in the middle of  the United States, there wasn   t much of a problem about that, or  blackouts, either. That was just something you knew about and I think  one of the interesting things, of course, is the number of prison camps  that were in Oklahoma during World War II   a huge number. Because  they brought them in here thinking it was so far from the borders that  they wouldn   t have a problem with the prisoners even wanting to escape.  22  Finchum  Heath  There was an article a couple of weeks ago and there were a lot more   prison camps  than I thought there were. I knew there was one up by  Tonkawa, but I think it said there were something like thirty (I   m not  sure that   s the right figure) in Oklahoma. But they just brought them in  here. They were easy to keep track of. Where are you going to go? How  are you going to get back to Germany? Or Japan? I think we just had the  ones from Europe. How are you going to get back to Germany from  Oklahoma? No way. There were some sympathizers for the Germans,  but in this area, it was not a big thing.  You mentioned the CCC camp. Can you talk a little more about that?  When Roosevelt came in, of course in the depth of the Depression, or  the start of the big Depression, he started the number   he called it the  alphabet deals with WPA and the PWA and the CCC. The CCC was the  Civil Conservation Corps. There   s still remnants of their work. They  built wind rows  shelter belts  in western Oklahoma and here because  we were having so many problems with dust storms and they built those.  They did a lot of public works. It put young people to work   they could  do something and that just happened to be where they built the camp,  where they stayed overnight and fed them and all. I was a little young to  know too much about it. The WPA, another one of his and a lot of the  armories that are in   a lot of sidewalks that were built, you   ll see a  WPA stamp on them. I think all of these were later declared  unconstitutional, but it doesn   t matter. It put people to work at that time  because there wasn   t money. We   ve gone into a depression now   a  recession, I guess. We   re not in a depression,  rather a  recession. But  there   s still money in the United States that didn   t exist at that time. A  lot of people   the banks went broke. They lost their money that was in  the banks. They weren   t backed by the federal government like they are  now.  So like I say, it was an easy time to grow up.  The  Fourth of July you  did fireworks any place you wanted to   in the street, in front of your  house, in your yard   now it   s against the law. And now the kids have so  much broader education basically. We   re teaching kids in grade school  now things that we were learning in high school then, I think. Whether  that   s good or bad, I don   t know. I   ll leave that to the educators, but it  was just an interesting time because you didn   t think much about it. You  were just growing up. You were going to school and playing your sports,  which were not organized, but you played sports, you went to sporting  events, you went to school and you went to church on Sunday. Sunday  school and church and it was a relatively simple time.  When I went in service in 1945, the world that I had existed in   I had  been to Ark City, Kansas because we had just had some family reunions  23  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  Finchum  Heath  there. Been to Colorado Springs once when I was too young to  remember. Went to Carlsbad Caverns on a trip there. Went to Little  Rock, Arkansas because the dance band my brother was playing in when  he was in college was playing over there and went over there with the  folks for a week and took my brother and three other boys to camp when  they went into service just across the Texas line. The world was small  and you also didn   t know about other places because you didn   t have  television. You read about them, but you didn   t watch things on TV or  pull it up on the computer, you know. So it was simple.  Life was pretty simple and, like I say, my folks didn   t have a lot of  money but they always had enough that we had food. But I never  thought about   it never even entered my mind for them to give me  money. That didn   t exist. I thought, you got out of   I was fortunate  enough to have the GI Bill to get out of college and go to work and that  was great. My parents were wonderful. My mother died when she was  52. I was away from home. I had just gone to work. She had a high  school education. My dad was born in 1898, and in those days, as soon  as you were big enough to go to work you went to work.  He  had, I  think, an eighth grade education and he left home and went to work and  he was amazing. He was amazing because it bothered him a little bit at  first, I think, moving into a college community and here you had your  educated people. After living with them for awhile, I think it didn   t  bother him anymore. (Laughs) He figured out that and educated himself  basically and was very good with people. Spent his last working years as  a postmaster here in Stillwater. From    50s, I   m not quite sure what year,  whether it was    56 or    57 up to    73, he was postmaster here. Very good  at handling people, very good.  I   m sure they were proud of you when you actually graduated then?  Oh yeah, I mean that   s why they stayed here so that I could get a college  education.  Do you have memories of graduation day?  Yeah, just being there in the field house.  And being happy?  Like I say, it   s a good day because it   s the night I met my wife.  Did your mother sew your clothes or did you buy store bought?  Oh no, I think, the pair of overalls, and she certainly patched them if  they needed it and the darned socks. You didn   t throw your socks away  24  Finchum  Heath  when you got a hole in them. She darned the socks, most of them and  then what my brother outgrew and didn   t think much about it. You had  clothing and Marilyn made a lot of stuff for our girls   clothing for our  daughters. She made a lot of that, but we certainly didn   t go to  Oklahoma City or Tulsa to buy clothing for them even when they were  small. They   ve grown up pretty well. Our kids are pretty good kids. Our  children are smart. Our grandchildren are scary smart. (Laughter) All of  them, and it   s not a surprise. They think a B is outlandish. Everything is  A   s and so they   re going to do fine. They   re going to do fine. We don   t  know about the great-grandkid. He   s still five years old and having a  ball, but   well what else can I tell you?  We   ve covered quite a bit. If there   s nothing else, we usually ask how  would you like to be remembered.  I think, of course, first as a good father and grandfather by my family.  As a good person and an honest person by other people and I   ve pretty  well lived that way and, I think, mainly as a decent human being. And  like I say, mainly the remembrance by the family is a big thing. We   ve  been fortunate  because  we   ve had our family around a lot. The  grandkids still love to come here. The one that   s in New Jersey, who is  our first grandson, is flying in Thanksgiving to help his grandmother  decorate the house. She   s very good, he   s excellent and they have fun  doing it every year. They   ve done it for years, the two of them and I just  kind of step back and get out of the way. And then the others are good  children and good adults. They   re not children anymore. They   re 32, 30  and 27   20, 13 or 14. I think just as a good person.  We were kind of a strange couple when we got married. This is 1950.  We were both from Republican families. That hardly existed in  Oklahoma at that time, so we have enjoyed politics. We   ve been  involved with working in politics. We   re not dirty dogs or anything like  that. And we   re not ultra conservative people. We   re just middle of the  road and believe in the right thing and I wish everybody did. It would be  a lot better life, but we   ve worked in politics. It was a grand day for us  when Henry Bellmon was elected governor the first time.  One funny story on that, I was active in the Chamber and, of course, we  had been working on Henry   s campaign and six o   clock the morning  after he   s elected, the phone rang. It was Virgil Simpson who had an  auto agency here, but everything was Democratic. And he said,    Dick, I  find myself in an embarrassing situation. We   ve just elected a  Republican governor. I   m Chairman of the Highway and Roads  Committee at the Chamber and we don   t have a Republican on the  committee. Would you serve?    (Laughs) This is six o   clock the next  morning, so it   s really pretty funny, but how it has changed during the  25  Finchum  Heath  period of time to a healthier situation where now, I think, in Oklahoma  particularly, you   ve got somebody that fouls up, we get rid of them.  Oklahomans will get rid of them and it   s because we   re a balanced state  right now and for the first time in our life we have a Republican  legislature   both houses.  We   ve had fun with our politics. I   ve got friends who were dirty dog  Democrats that are now the other way. They   ve come around. They hate  to admit it, but they have and so it was early politics wasn   t even  pleasant. They were nasty. The Democrats were nasty. I had someone  when I opened my office on Main Street in    59, someone said to  Marilyn,    Dick going to stay in politics? It   d hurt his business.    Well  actually, it helped my business. I was the only option on that side for  people. The others weren   t all dirty dog Democrats, they just weren   t  committed. They wouldn   t get involved and we   ve always been involved  and I think in a proper way. We haven   t been nasty. We   ve laughed at  times when things went our way certainly, but I   m happy with  Oklahoma politics right now. I   m not happy with the national politics,  but I   m happy with Oklahoma politics because I think we   re a healthy  state and we have to have a balanced budget, which is healthy. It makes  us live within our means, which everyone should do   families,  government and all.  I think the thing in growing up that I   ve said before is that Stillwater was  a little town when I was growing up. It   s not now. It   s a nice sized town  now, but it was a little town then. There was no concern about going any  place you wanted to in Stillwater. You wandered all over town. You  walked. Gosh, I didn   t have a bicycle even. My brother had gone to  work and earned himself one making fifteen cents an hour and bought a  bicycle and when he got to college, well I got his bicycle.  And you loved orange very early?  Oh yes, yes, I   ve always said that   when the kids were growing up I put  on red and white if I wanted to whip them. (Laughter) And they   ve  grown up good. They   ve grown up very good. I   ve been an Oklahoma  A M/Oklahoma State fan forever because I   ve been here forever and  always will be. I love the place. Everything hasn   t gone smooth here all  of the time at the university and they   ve been headed by the right people  a lot of the times and by the wrong people part of the time, but we   ve  known an awful lot of our friends are university people and particularly  not so much now, but in my working days because they were clients and  they socialized with us. I mean, they didn   t just socialize with the  university people, they socialized with town people and a lot of them are  awfully good friends of ours, particularly Dick and Lynn Poole were  very good friends. We summered with them some. They had a place in  26  Finchum  Heath  Colorado and we had a place in Colorado and we   d get together. We  were the type of friends where you didn   t see them for nine months and  you stepped in the door and it was just like it had been yesterday and  that   s a wonderful feeling. But I think that hopefully the young people  today will make the friends that we made at college because those are  more your lifetime friends because it   s your last place of education,  more than your high school friends. Your high school friends you   re still  attached to in the reunions and stuff, but the four years you spend in  college, those become your friends for life. My best friend for life is  sitting right over here.  One of my fraternity brothers, Gene Jackson, the university is very  familiar with him because he   s given a lot of money to it in the arts and  sciences field. But in college, he was a fraternity brother, one of those  who I wasn   t real close to at that time, but afterward we became alumni  and became very close too when we started having reunions. He was a  successful business man back in Pennsylvania and started some  wonderful things, health-wise for the people back there, but he was just  a good friend. He was a good friend. We   d meet each other at reunions  and stuff like this. They took him into the Hall of Fame and he asked me  to be his presenter. I did that and then we had a reunion here about ten  years or so ago and he was going to come. He couldn   t and died shortly  thereafter. Then his attorneys got a hold of me sometime later. He had  left the university a  50,000 scholarship in my name and three other  fraternity brothers and so he left them another  200,000 at the time he  died, in our names, which you don   t get over those.  I think that   s about all. I   ve had a wonderful time. I love to talk about  old Stillwater. We spent time with some old high school friends the  other day trying to remember what stores were on Main Street at the  time and all, but I appreciate it very much and I hope this is of some use  to you.  It   s been great. I appreciate your time. Thank you very much.  You   re more than welcome.  -------  -------
