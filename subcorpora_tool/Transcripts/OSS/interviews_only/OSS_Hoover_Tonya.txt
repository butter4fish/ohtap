 Gill and today is January 25, 2010. I   m visiting with  Tonya Hoover on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Tonya, I want to first of all  say thank you for taking the time to visit with us this morning.  My pleasure, my pleasure.  I appreciate it very much. So you   re on the Oklahoma State University  campus today to talk to some student groups.  Yes.  I understand including the women in the College of Engineering,  Architecture and Technology.  Yes, I am.  Great. When you were you last on campus?  I was last on campus six months ago. I think I stopped in in July. I come  to Oklahoma, over the past few years, about twice a year, working with  IFSTA  International Fire Service Training Association  and Fire  Protection Publications on some work that they   d continue to do and I sit  on a couple of their committees, so I   ve been in Oklahoma City or Tulsa.  If I get a chance, I always like to come to Stillwater and visit.  Their international headquarters is in Stillwater, is that right?  Yes it is, yes it is.  Is it good to be back on campus?  5  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  It is. Every time I come back, there   s something new and exciting. I  remember when   the first time I came back after awhile, with all the  new buildings, the new Engineering building and then after the stadium  was redone, it was just amazing because it   s different than when I was  here. (Laughs) It   s grown so much. Stillwater has grown so much.  Do you have any other plans while you   re in Stillwater? Any friends or  professionals that you   re going to visit with?  Actually, yes. I was going to try to visit with one of my professors that   s  just down the hall. The first thing I did last night after I checked into my  room was I went to Eskimo Joe   s for my burger. (Laughs)  Did you get some cheese fries too?  Well, I thought about the cheese fries and I thought,    I   m going to  overdo it with the burger, I better just stick with fries.    (Laughter)  There   s always Eskimo Joes to pop into and the Hideaway to pop into.  Visit the fire station of course, walk around campus. I   m looking  forward to spending the day.  Tonya, you are currently acting fire marshal for the state of California  with all the intended responsibilities of that. We want to discuss these  but first I   d like to start with your early life. Can you tell us a little bit  about where you grew up, about your family, your parents?  I love talking about where I grew up. I grew up in a small south central  Pennsylvania town called Shippensburg. Shippensburg at that time was  about 15,000 people, it has a state college, it   s known as a teaching  college   pretty quiet life. My father passed away when I was thirteen so  my younger brother and I and my mom stayed living in Shippensburg.  When I was fourteen, I had the opportunity to become a junior member  for the volunteer fire service. My father, my godfather, my family was  very active in the volunteer fire service. So I joined as a volunteer fire  firefighter   my hobby, you could say, through high school. I spent a lot  of time at the fire station, developing a sense of community through the  fire service, basically.  I   m like any other teenager living in a small town. I graduated from high  school and had an opportunity   I looked at a couple schools that offered  fire protection engineering or fire protection engineering technology. I  decided to come to Oklahoma State right out of high school. I had  traveled with my parents   short trips, but never on my own. So right out  of high school my mom packed us up and we came to Stillwater. Two  days later she was gone and I was here and I was like,    Wow. Now what  do I do?    But I came to Stillwater after high school strictly for the fire  6  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  protection program. That   s what brought me to Oklahoma State.  Just the national reputation?  It has a national reputation. It still does to this day. It was nice because I  was here and there were so many of us from all over the country. We  had kids from California, we had kids from the East Coast, the Midwest,  the South; we had international students. For me, growing up in a small  town where probably the most international food I had was pizza (I   ll  tell you a funny story about the Chinese food), it was eye-opening. At  the same time, where I grew up at and Oklahoma, there   s some cultural  differences there. I learned how to two-step and I learned an  appreciation for the Cotton-Eyed Joe.  Learned to say    howdy    and    y   all   ?  Yes. I picked up a little accent for five years. (Laughter)  Going back to some of the principles that you picked up, maybe working  as a junior volunteer in the fire station, were there principles or values  that you learned growing up that have been important to you in your  life?  Well, earlier you asked me about my parents and my parents have  always been role models. My father is a guiding light in my head,  constantly. Both of my parents are very dedicated to community and my  father was very dedicated to public service. The fire service was his  passion, his love, next to his family. My mom used to tell a joke about, if  there was a choice, if there was something going on and they were  supposed to go someplace but there was a fire emergency or an  emergency where they needed the chief, he would take the emergency,  kiss her on the forehead and say goodbye. But she understood that.  (Laughter) Principles, it was about community, teamwork. The fire  service is a family. I still consider the fire service a family. It was  another family   an extension of my family. That was something that has  carried through to me. A passion   I come from a place in the fire  service where the craft is a passion. It wasn   t just a job. And as a  volunteer, it wasn   t your job. You chose to be there.  You were talking about some of your family being engaged in fire safety  and firefighting, but is your particular influence through your father, do  you think?  Yes, it was. My brother and I would spend Saturday afternoons,  Sundays, with my dad at the fire station. And you don   t think about  these things until later in your life, but I remember the first fire that I  7  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  went with my dad   now you wouldn   t be able to do this anymore. My  dad was babysitting my brother and I; I guess I was about ten and he was  eight. It was a grass fire. He went and parked the car someplace on a hill  so he could do a situational update. We   re sitting in the car and he says  to my brother and I,    Hey, if gets too close, I need you to honk the horn,  turn on the siren and I will come and get you and move the car. I   m just  right down over here.    And we   re like,    Okay.     So I   m watching the flames get closer and closer and closer. I   m looking  at my brother going,    I think we should do something.    He   s like,    Oh,  no. It   s not close enough.    It   s right up against us. Finally, my dad turns  around   timing was everything. My dad turns around, my brother hits  the siren, my dad moves the car. And what   s funny about that is now I   m  involved in that whole wild land urban interface or wild land  firefighting, I understand it. I think to myself,    Let me see. What were  we doing wrong?    First of all, we shouldn   t have been there. Second of  all, we weren   t in the black zone. (Laughs) I   m going through all these  situational awareness things in my head. But it was my first experience  being there with my dad. I used to watch my dad a lot. Within the  volunteer fire service, the women   s organizations and the junior member  programs, the family organizations, were support mechanisms for the  volunteer fire service. I remember a lot of activities that we did to  support the fire service: going to fires to feed the firefighters food and  water and things like that. It was just so much a family involvement. It  was about the community.  Back to your OSU experience, had you ever been on the campus before  your mother drove you to Stillwater?  No. (Laughs)  What were your first impressions of Stillwater and Oklahoma State?  Wow, it   s flat. (Laughter) I remember coming on campus and looking  around and thought,    There   s no mountains. Where   s the green?     because it was August. The waving wheat. It was different. One of the  things that sticks out in my head is dirt   red dirt. I looked at the dirt and  thought,    It   s red.    (Laughter) It was quite an experience.  So there was never any doubt about your major; you knew what you  wanted when you got there.  Never a doubt about my major. It became evident to me about two years  in that I was not going to be an engineer   I was on the five year plan. So  I had to do some modifications to my major. It took me what I would  consider a little longer than most. But I knew my passion was with the  8  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  fire technology aspect of the program. How I wove that into the rest of  my skill set, I needed to make some adjustments. The folks here   my  professors, the dean at the time, my counselor   they were very  supportive. I had some struggles; I had some maturing to do. I needed to  grow up. I was eighteen years old and I   m a firm believer that  sometimes you   re not ready to go to college until after you graduate.  (Laughter) I needed to grow up and they were very supportive during  that growing up phase.  What year did you enroll at Oklahoma State?  I enrolled in 1980.  Fall of 1980?  Fall of 1980 and I was here until 1985. That   s something I   ll talk about,  but I needed to take a semester off. Again, it was part of that maturing  phase. I was not doing well academically and I needed to make some  really tough decisions.  Was that after your first semester?  That would have been my third semester. My professor, who ended up  being a very good friend (I had some great professors in this school),  basically looked at me and said,    You   ve got to make some tough  choices.    And I was the kid   my friends laugh, they tell me I   m  stubborn. I just say,    I   m tenacious.    I came from the place that you just  hung in there. You just kept doing it and you didn   t drop a class, you just  kept going. Well, sometimes you need to drop the class before it gets too  late and restart, reboot. So I had to make some tough choices.  These were some engineering classes?  Yes, engineering classes. I knew I was not going to be an engineer.  When you take chemistry twice and you take physics once and you  know you have to pass it and that   s what you do, you pass it. There was  no way I was going to make it through calculus. I was great in calculus  for about the first, I don   t know, four weeks. Then after that it was all  downhill. (Laughs) Found out I needed to drop calculus and that was  part of my soul searching. Math was not my strong point. My strong  points lie in other places.  I kind of tease now that the kids within the school of fire protection have  it relatively easy when it comes to professors. There was a particular  professor that we had as freshman and I swear to this day, his role was to  weed us out. You know, you were either in or you were out and if you  9  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  could make it through him the first year, you were good to go for the  next three. He was very supportive. I spent time talking with him about  different things. I guess it was the tenacity. When he figured that I was  struggling in my math courses, I had made a switch to the College of  Education in technical education. He said to me,    You know, I don   t  want you taking easy classes. Why don   t you take another math class? If  you take another math class, I   ll support you as you take that math  class.    He was very helpful in pointing me in different directions,  helping me get help with my math class. He said,    You need to work on  that. Now, since the pressure is off a little bit, why don   t you go work on  that?     Tonya, you mentioned earlier that probably math wasn   t one of your  strengths. You said you had other strengths. What were those other  strengths you were referring to?  Well, I think my strengths come from team building, listening. I   ve been  told that I do more listening and asking questions than I do talking. I  research   I love to dive into research, find out why something is the  way it is, which goes back to the questions,    Why? Why do we do it that  way?    Writing, I love to write about things. My skills don   t come from  the mathematical computation of things. My skills come from, I think,  an intuition. Which, people may laugh,    Well, is that a female  intuition?    I work a lot off of feelings, something doesn   t feel right     Relational skills     Relational skills, yes.  You talked about some people that were helpful to you. Could you  mention some of them? Would you feel comfortable sharing names of  some of the professors and others?  Absolutely. When I was here at school, three professors stick out that  were very helpful. One is no longer with us, Professor John Harvey, who  taught Essentials in Electronics. He was a gentleman   s gentleman   very  supportive of the students, very engaging with the students. He gave me  an opportunity to work for him as a student aide. He was very supportive  when he knew that I was struggling through things. The other two, one is  still here on campus, Professor Pat Brock, still teaching for the School of  Fire Protection. In fact, I think Pat is probably going to retire soon,  which will be a loss to the school, but I wish him a lot of luck. He was  very supportive. Pat was one of the people that knew I was struggling  but he hung in there with me.  The other one, who   s no longer here, is Professor Larry Borgelt.  10  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Professor Borgelt I classify as the professor that was the person who was  weeding you out. Larry was tough. You needed to be on your game and  he kept you on your game. I used to laugh as students   this a great story  to share. He was one of the few people that I knew that when we had a  four hour lab, he could talk for four hours. We   d have him for class in  the morning and then we   d have him for lab in the afternoon. That was  part of that weeding-out process, I think. (Laughs) Those three  individuals stick out in my mind as being the three that really kept me  focused and kept me here.  Looking back, in class, out of class, just your total undergraduate  experience, were there some special memories that you have? Some  special OSU experiences that come to mind?  Oh. I can   t say that there   s one special experience, because most of it  was centered around the School of Fire Protection and the people in the  program, folks that I met in the program, the study times we spent at the  campus fire station. In fact, I was just at a working conference this  weekend and I   m there with OSU alumni, folks that I went to school  with. We were sharing stories about the campus fire station and just  laughing about that whole set-up, what it was like to be at the campus  fire station interacting with the guys that lived there, studying, struggling  through classes, long nights learning   I can remember when we learned  how to use a computer; oh, my gosh. My daughter now laughs at that;  she thinks that   s really funny. I had a program we were supposed to  write for sprinklers and I goofed it up so bad and I lost the program in  the computer. Here I am, we   re down to the deadline date of trying to  get this in and I don   t know what I   m doing and I   m so confused. But,  there   s a group of guys that I   m studying with, there   s like four other  guys I   m studying with and they   re like,    Tonya, we   ll help you.    And  we all pitched in and worked on getting my project done. I thought,     You guys have projects, too.       Oh we   ll get it done, we   ll get it done.     They were so helpful. It was so much about making sure that we all got  through it together. Those types of experiences. And football games.  You mentioned working with the guys. What was probably the ratio of  women to men in the Fire Protection and Safety Program?  Oh, my gosh. When I went through, there were, that I remember, four of  us  women  and maybe forty guys in the program.  What was that like?  Interesting. You couldn   t miss class   well, if you missed class, let   s just  say people noticed. (Laughter) I remember sitting in an EET class   a  lecture class   in this big lecture room. The fire protection students, we  11  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  always hung out together. Our schedules were always typically together.  As freshmen, you came in and moved through the program together.  You started off in your program right away. There was none of this, you  know, the first semester was general and your second semester and then  you got into your major maybe your second year. You were a fire  protection student from the day you walked on campus; we were all in  classes together. So in this EET class, the fire protection students   I  don   t know why I would do this with them   but they   d all sit in the  back. We all sat along the wall in the back in a group. And the guys  knew what they were doing. They were pretty sharp   most of them  were pretty sharp. They would yuck it up back there, you know how  guys do. I   d be back there trying to do my thing. The professor in this  class of like, I don   t know, 250 students, he says from the front of the  room, way down in the front (at the time, my maiden name was Snyder)  he says,    Ms. Snyder, do you have any questions? Do you understand  this?    I   m looking around,    I   m fine.    And I   m looking at the guys  going,    Shut up. He   s picking on me. It   s you guys.    (Laughs) It was  just so funny. We all hung around together. It was not easy to go  unnoticed. It had its challenges at times.  What other ways was it different for you being a female and being in fire  protection and safety?  Well, being a female in the fire service during that time period was  different. I had some tough learning lessons as a female teenager in the  fire service. So when I came to Oklahoma State understanding,    You   re  a girl among all these guys,    I can   t say once that any of them were  disrespectful. They weren   t. I didn   t have the experiences that I   ve heard  about from other folks. They were respectful. I didn   t live in the fire  station. I didn   t want to live in the fire station. I lived on campus and  they   d pick and they   d say funnies. I never took it seriously. It was like,  just one of the guys, whatever.  You said you stayed elsewhere. I understand there   s a story about where  you stayed?  I actually lived in this building. (Laughs) It was a dorm. My freshman  dorm was in the building that we   re interviewing  in  today. It was on  the other side of the building we   re in today at the end, in the corner  room, which was a three-person room. So I came here and had two  roommates and actually lived in Cordell for my first year. I lived on the  first floor for the first semester and then transferred to the fourth floor,  which was more of the upper-division students. Part of maturing was  understanding that I needed to be away from noise and a lot of crowds to  focus. My daughter laughs at me now, she says I suffer from attention-deficit     it   s kind of like,    Oh look     (Laughs) I can be distracted at  12  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  looking at other things. But during that time period, I knew I needed to  be some place a little quieter, so I moved to the fourth floor where it was  a little quieter. But it was in this building.  Well did you have some favorite hangouts on campus and off campus?  Most of us, we all hung out at the fire station as fire protection students.  But there was Eskimo Joes, of course. The Fox, at the time     Hideaway is right across the street from you.  Yes, Hideaway was right across the street. Everybody went for fried  mushrooms. People spent time on the Strip bopping around. There was  the dance club outside of town, which actually it was kind of funny  because the dance club outside of town was owned by somebody else  that ended up being owned by a fire protection student after he  graduated. He ended up having two places, the one out of town and then  there was a place in town that he owned. We hung out at the lake when  the weather was nice   so many different things.  You worked as a student, as did other students in your major, at the fire  station. Could you tell us a little bit about what that was like and what  your experience was?  Well, I worked actually for the University Safety Department. I became,  I guess you could call it, a student inspector, so I became an inspector  fairly early. While we had live-in students   with what we call part-paid  firefighters, they lived on campus in the fire station. They helped to  cover and assist the Stillwater Fire Department, so they either lived at  the station or lived at one of the other stations pulling a shift duty when  they weren   t in class. I chose to work   because I didn   t live in the fire  station   I worked for the university in the safety department where I  was an inspector. So I did the fire life safety inspections for the campus  buildings, which was kind of interesting because I, so many years later,  went back to the university system and actually did work for another  university later on in my career.  What does that entail, being an inspector?  Being an inspector, my job was to go around the building using the  codes that were enforceable on campus at the time, making sure that the  buildings were fire safe, that the fire protection systems were operating,  that storage corridors were clear, that exit doors worked, that exit lights  were lit, hazardous materials were stored correctly   basically doing the  oversight of code requirements on the campus and in the campus  buildings. What that did, though, is it got me into every building on  13  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  campus, practically every space   I was in areas of campus buildings  that I bet you half of people don   t even know exist. It was because it was  part of the inspection process. Any door that I couldn   t   and I had this  massive ring of keys to get into every building, every door   it was huge.  If I couldn   t get into a door with one of my keys, it made me a little  suspicious and I   d go looking for the manager,    What   s behind that  door?    I also responded to emergencies on campus as part of safety     when the fire department responded on campus, we were responsible to  respond also, to do things like reset the fire alarm, help them get into  certain areas that maybe they couldn   t get in with their keys. So we had  that liaison with the Stillwater Fire Department, as well.  What were some of the most interesting things you found behind those  closed doors? That you can tell about     Stuff. (Laughter) The Student Union always had stuff. Storage from the  old Post Office   the old brass mailboxes with the brass mailbox faces,  paperwork, old furniture. And I think,    Why don   t we just get rid of  this? Why are we storing it?    Just all sorts of stuff. You name it, it was  there. (Laughs) Funny.  During your undergraduate degree, did you have a specialty area or  field that interested you more within your broader field?  I would say I developed an interest in codes and standards. Here at  Oklahoma State we spend a lot of time in the National Fire Protection  Association codes and standards. One of those was what   s called the  Life Safety code. I think that   s where I developed this interest in  regulations, code work, code enforcement. That seemed to be the place  that I focused a lot of my energies.  Did you also have some experience working in pipeline supervision as  an intern one summer? Did I see that on your resume?  One summer I actually worked for Amoco Oil in the oil field. I was a  roustabout in Watonga, Oklahoma, which was interesting. I didn   t know  anything about Watonga, Oklahoma. They had a Pizza Hut. (Laughs)  That was an interesting experience. But yeah, it was a chance to get  involved in the petroleum side of our profession. At that time, the  petroleum industry had a lot of interest in fire protection, as they still do.  So we had a lot of the petroleum industry interviewing for summer  students to either work out in the fields or work at their production  plants. In fact, my ex-husband worked for Mobil Oil for two summers.  He spent a summer as a summer intern in California at one of their  production facilities and he also spent a summer in Kansas at a  production facility in Kansas. So Oklahoma State students spent a lot of  14  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  time with either power plants, the oil industry   we had kids that went to  Alaska and worked their summer in Alaska with, I think it was Arco at  the time. It was a great opportunity to get some real world experience  before you even got out.  You mentioned your ex-husband, did you get married right after  college?  Got married about   yeah, right after college. I met him here. I actually  met him in line. He was registering   he had just gotten here. He had this  Hershey Fire Department, Pennsylvania t-shirt on and I was like,     Somebody from Pennsylvania  Oh, my gosh     (Laughs) So I went over  and introduced myself and it was kind of funny because he looked at me  like,    Yeah, whatever.    (Laughs) He was actually enrolling in the  School of Fire Protection. The school has a program   it   s like rookies,  you   re an incoming fire protection student and they have an association,  The Fire Protection Society. The more senior members of the program  take on an incoming student, and it   s almost like a fraternal  organization   it is like a fraternal organization. You find out about the  program, you meet upperclassmen, you find out about campus   Well it  ended up, he just happened to be what they call my    rat,    which means  he was the lower classman that I was responsible for. That   s how I got to  know him.  Interesting story.  Met him here.  Do you stay in touch with your fellow graduates here at Oklahoma  State?  All the time. In fact, the one thing I would say that the School of Fire  Protection has that many other schools don   t have is the connection with  each other. As I said, earlier this weekend, I was in Oklahoma City  doing some work with IFSTA in fire protection publications. I sit in a  room with folks that I went to school with or folks that graduated way  before I did and we still stay in contact. We ask each other questions, we  email each other; we call each other on the phone to find out what   s  going on,    Have you ever ran into this problem? Have you ever seen this  problem?    A very connected group of folks, because it is such a  specialty.  How has your academic preparation and training you received at OSU  helped you prepare for your career? Does it influence you in your  career?  15  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Very much so. And again, you don   t think about these things until way  after but I always tell folks I started my code enforcement part of my  profession here at Oklahoma State. I was a student inspector. Later on in  my life, I became a deputy fire marshal at UC Berkeley, where I  managed an inspection program and had responsibility for inspecting  buildings and meeting with professors and doing training classes. All of  my Oklahoma experience helped me fit nicely into the academia world. I  had already been there; I understood that. Oklahoma State, the School of  Fire Protection spent a lot of time with petroleum production and we  talked a lot about power plants and fuels.  Now as the assistant   well when I came into my current job, I came in  as the assistant state fire marshal and now as the state fire marshal. But  the state fire marshal   s office has responsibility for hazardous materials  pipeline in the state of California. I never thought that I would draw  upon my Oklahoma State experience in hazardous materials pipeline in  the petroleum industry to understand what I   m doing now for my  pipeline safety division.  A lot of the folks that I meet on my pipeline safety division side of the  house, some of those guys   in fact, a couple of them I met last year at a  conference   were Oklahoma State grads. It   s like,    Oh you went to  Oklahoma State?       Yeah, I went to Oklahoma State. I regulate you.     (Laughs)  It   s really interesting. So much of what I did here at the school or what I  learned here at Oklahoma State, I   ve been able to use through my entire  career: connections that I   ve made, people that I never thought I   d see  again pop up some place else in some other area of the country.  Following up on that, can you share a little bit about your past  firefighting experience and positions and how it   s helped you to where  you are in your career now?  Well, starting out as a junior member firefighter, I didn   t spend a whole  lot of time on what I call,    fighting fire,    because as a junior member  you   re not allowed to really fight fire. But I engaged in the training  activities and went on emergency calls and became an EMT fairly early  in my fire service   I don   t want to call it a career, but maybe my  passion. I understand, I have a comprehension, I   ve pulled hose   I  haven   t done those activities extensively like a firefighter would do, but  I have an understanding, an appreciation for what it is.  Then, things that I did here at Oklahoma State, such as being an  inspector and public speaking and training folks on how to use fire  extinguishers and training them on fire safety, that translated into the  16  Gill  Hoover  next phase of my life where I took on working for a sprinkler company  doing inspections of sprinkler systems. I could pull upon my education  on sprinkler systems. Then the next phase was working for a fire  department as a plans checker and doing the engineering component of a  fire department. That pulls upon your technical ability, your education in  fire protection systems that I got here at Oklahoma State.  The next phase was going to a university and basically managing a fire  life safety program and pulling upon everything from my interaction  with the fire department because I was the campus    fire department  liaison to things. I learned about academia and how academia needed to  work in a regulated environment. Everything just kind of started  weaving together. Then moving on, I had an opportunity to become a  fire marshal for a local jurisdiction for a fire department. Again, pulling  upon my fire service experience, my educational background, my  networking, in that position   working with architects, engineers,  designers   until today, where it   s like everything comes together. I have  to pull in everything that I   ve learned or I   ve been exposed to on a daily  basis.  It   s not just about fire protection. It   s about fire protection, it   s about  relationship building, it   s about negotiations, it   s about understanding  the different world and the political environment that people are in. It   s  more of a big picture outlook on things. I think that if I look back, from  the time I started at fourteen to where I am today, I   ve had to pull upon  all of that to get to where I am today. I never, in my time, have ever  taken one experience for granted. Because every experience, whether it  was a success or a challenge   I don   t like to say failure, because I don   t  think any of them were failures   taught me something that I can use  today.  Out of all these different experiences, what part of fire safety excites you  the most, that you really enjoy the most?  That   s a hard one. I think it   s because I think fire safety speaks to  everyone. I think everyone deserves it. I think everyone   s entitled to  safety. It   s kind of two-fold. It   s an opportunity to reinforce components  that people take for granted, that they don   t think about in their day to  day life. It   s about giving folks information to prevent accidents, to  prevent incidents. We talk about things like fire deaths, fire damage, fire  losses; those are all preventable. I think we as a society take for granted,     Well, it was just a fire.    That fire cost    x    amount of dollars, had an  impact on the community, an impact on the family and an impact on  firefighters. There   s the potential for loss, not just in property, but loss of  life to people that were involved in that business or that home but also  the emergency responders that respond. So I look at it as an opportunity  17  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  to reduce loss and start thinking about putting our money in the  prevention aspect to support the efforts of our firefighters and of our  communities. We don   t have a lot of spare cash to be throwing around  for losses.  Have there been some highlights in your career, events that stand out in  your mind more than others that you should share with us?  There   s a few. My first NFPA  National Fire Protection Association   conference stands out and it was in Kansas City. It was the year after the  walkway fell at the hotel   we were staying at the hotel where the  walkway fell in Kansas City   and talking with folks at the conference,  being part of the conference. The NFPA conference was the place where  all the, what I   ll call the heavy hitters go, the big names in fire protection   were . The National Fire Protection Association has a conference  annually and my first one was a chance to go and sit and listen to what  I   ll call the    big boys.    And to meet alumni that were involved in bigger  things than I was at the time   to draw upon their experiences. That  stands out.  Through my career I   ve met a lot of folks, some of the bigger names in  the fire service. Meeting folks like John Hogland, who is an icon in the  School of Fire Protection, in fire safety. I have an opportunity to work  with IFSTA now and FPP, Fire Protection Publications, that   s a  highlight of my career. I was recognized by my peers a few years back  and received an award and that was a highlight of my career. I mean,  when your peers give you an award for efforts     What kind of award was that?  It   s called the Charlie Gray Award and it   s named after a fire marshal  out of Santa Rosa. He had a passion for fire prevention as well and did a  lot to promote that in Northern California. So the Northern California  Fire Prevention Officers, which is a section of Cal Chiefs   California  fire chiefs   gives an award annually to an outstanding member that has  continued to promote fire safety, fire prevention. You   re nominated by  your peers, it   s all a surprise. I was nominated and awarded that award.  It was a big moment. Being in my current position; I never thought in a  million years that I   d be doing what I   m doing now. It never, never  crossed my mind. Ten years ago, if somebody said to me,    You   re going  to be the next state fire marshal.    I would have laughed at them.    No  way. I   m going to be a fire marshal in a local jurisdiction? No way.     Picking up on that, you   ve described it to a certain extent but how have  these career assignments and experiences prepared you for your current  position, first as assistant state fire marshal and now as fire marshal for  18  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  the state of California? These are some pretty big responsibilities that  you have now. How have these prepared you for that?  Well, the things that I   ve been involved with, the things that I   ve done  through my career have given me an opportunity to listen to a lot of  different outlooks   given me an opportunity to speak to a lot of  different folks from different demographics. So when you have the  opportunity to do that and then you move into an environment that deals  constantly with the broad brush, the big picture, multi disciplines, multi  demographics, you get a feel for balance. In my position as a state fire  marshal, it   s about balance. I can   t just look at one community. I can   t  just focus on L.A. city or San Francisco or Humboldt County. I have to  look at the benefit for the state as a whole from the standpoint of fire  safety, fire protection, as well as its economic impact on the state. So I  would say that everything I   ve done up to this point, that balance   being  able to draw upon different views and being associated with different  groups of folks that have different views, helps me where I am now.  Because you can be focused in your mission, but you can   t always be  focused in how you get there. As they like to say,    There   s many ways  to skin a cat.    I sometimes have to use all of them. (Laughs)  You said earlier, did you ever envision that this little girl from  Shippensburg, PA is going to be fire marshal for the state of California?  Never. (Laughter) Never. I mean, my big thing was,    I   m going to be a  fire marshal someday.    I was happy being a fire marshal in the  jurisdiction I was at and doing my thing and supporting the state   s effort  in promoting fire safety and traveling around and doing that with folks  that I knew. I never thought, ever. When I was here, I never thought. It  never crossed my mind, because I looked at the Oklahoma state fire  marshal, or the fire marshal in these different areas when I would go to  meetings, as being beyond my reach.  I remember the first time I was invited to sit in a committee in California  with the fire marshal of California at the time. I was speechless   well,  for about the first two minutes. (Laughter) Here I am at this table, I was  an inspector. I was part of a statewide organization. But here I was  sitting with the state fire marshal for the state of California   at the time,  the fifth largest economy in the world, in the world   and I   m sitting at  the table with these big names in fire science and fire prevention, not  only in California, but throughout the country. Folks like Ronnie  Coleman   in fact Ronnie Coleman was the fire marshal at the time.  Ronnie Coleman is known throughout the fire prevention world and  throughout the United States. I was sitting at the table with him and he  was asking me what I thought. It was just,    Wow.     19  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  What are some things that led up to your appointment first as assistant  state fire marshal then now as fire marshal?  Well at the time, two and a half years ago, I was the fire marshal for a  medium-sized jurisdiction in the San Francisco Bay Area, a place called  Moraga-Orinda fire district. I was very much involved in the wild land-urban  interface fire problem. Through an organization that I was active  with, I was asked to co-chair a committee. I co-chaired a committee with  a woman by the name of Kate Dargan, she was the Napa County fire  marshal at the time. So she and I developed a very close friendship and  camaraderie and a passion for the subject area. Well she was so much  further ahead than I was in the subject matter. She was a twenty-five  year CAL FIRE CDF person, knew the wild land-urban interface inside  and out. She was bringing me along for the training and education     She was a mentor for you?  She was a mentor for me. She and I worked very closely on a number of  things. In fact, we were working on a risk assessment and an Oklahoma  State grad had just released a big risk assessment that was being  recognized throughout the country. I told Kate,    I know him. I went to  school with him. We need to make a trip to Colorado Springs.     Who is he?  Brett Lacey. So she   s like,    Well, okay. We   ll go to Colorado Springs  and see what they   ve got.    So we went to Colorado Springs, met with  the Colorado Springs Fire Department. Their fire chief had come from  Oakland Fire so there was the California connection. Brett and I had  gone to school together, there was the OSU connection. Kate and I just  worked through this wild land-urban interface thing together. About two  years after she and I started working together, as local fire marshals, a  good friend was appointed fire marshal for the state, Ruben Grijalva.  Ruben had come to talk to the FPOs  Fire Prevention Officers  and he  had seen Kate and talked to Kate and had asked Kate a few months later  if she would be his assistant state fire marshal. She took that job and she  became his assistant state fire marshal. Well shortly   it was like eight  months, not even a year of her being the assistant state fire marshal     Ruben went off to be the Director of CAL FIRE. Everybody kind of gets  bumped up. Kate now becomes the state fire marshal and the assistant  state fire marshal at the same time. She had to hold two positions.  She said to me,    I   d like you to be my assistant state fire marshal, if  you   re interested. I   d like you to put in the governor   s application and go  through the process.    At the time, I was going through some things at  home and trying to take care of some business in my personal life, and I  20  Gill  Hoover  said,    You know, I don   t think so. I can do so much for you at a local  level and I can do so much more with you from a local level than being  in the system. I can promote the things you want with local fire service  being on the outside.    We had this discussion for almost eight months  until one day, eight months later, she calls me on the phone on a  Monday morning   we had these regular phone call conversations in the  mornings, like our girl time. She   d be going to work and I   d be sitting at  my desk and she   d say,    I   m going to ask you one last time. I have to go  meet with the Director and I need to give him an answer because I have  your name and two other names that I would put forward. But you  would be my choice. I need to know, for sure.     I said to her,    It   s funny you should say that. I had the weirdest dream  last night.    And seriously, I had a dream about being the assistant state  fire marshal and how cool that would be to be able to help her move her  things forward, to have an opportunity to work for her. She is a mentor.  To learn from her every day, to watch her every day and how cool would  that be for that opportunity? I think I could do a really good job. She  said to me,    What are you telling me?    I said,    Well, let   s talk.    She was  like,    Well, we could talk today, tomorrow.    I said,    No, I can   t talk  this   I   m in meetings all week.    And she was in meetings. Finally we  were able to get together on a Friday and I told her,    Yes, okay, I   ll  come to work for you.    (Laughs) And went to work to be the assistant  state fire marshal and held that position for two years.  The plan was that she and I would go down the road together side by  side until the governor   s term was over. Depending on what happened,  whether she would be reappointed or she would retire, that I would go  out the same time she did and the new administration would bring in  their new people. Well, she retired early. Actually her mother was very  sick and she went to spend time with her family. Timing was good, she  felt comfortable retiring. She retired, which gave me the opportunity for  my boss, the director, to appoint me as the state fire marshal, which is  why I   m in what we call an acting role until the governor   it   s up to the  governor to make the final appointment.  So your boss is the director of     Of CAL FIRE. Right. He is the Director of CAL FIRE. The system  works, there   s the governor, there   s the secretary of natural resources,  my boss, the Director of CAL FIRE reports to the Secretary of Natural  Resources and I report to the Director of CAL FIRE. The state fire  marshal   s position is interesting as in, I typically walk in two worlds   or  walk a fence. I have responsibility to my fire department, which is CAL  FIRE, I work for CAL FIRE, but I also have statutory and regulatory  responsibility to the local fire service, the 900 fire departments that are  21  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  in California. Whereas, I may report to the Director, I also report to all  those other fire chiefs as their fire marshal and become their voice at a  local level on fire prevention and fire engineering issues.  Can you talk a little bit more or perhaps outline some of your major  administrative and management responsibilities as state fire marshal?  The state fire marshal is responsible for state wide policy on fire and life  safety   what we call fire and panic safety within the state of California.  With that comes the responsibility of staying connected with the issues  of fire prevention and fire safety, state fire training in California. The  staff is about 175 people and we have divisions in fire and life safety,  which is our code enforcement division. I have a law  enforcement/investigation division, fire engineering division, which is  all the fire protection systems, licensing, smoke alarms, installation  criteria     Sprinkler systems, et cetera     Right, sprinkler systems, special type of extinguishing systems. I have a  code and regulations division. The state fire marshal   s office is unique in  that we oversee all code and regulation as it pertains to fire and life  safety, and that includes in other agencies that are adopting or trying to  move forward provisions that deal with fire and life safety, their  adoption packages have to actually come to the state fire marshal   s  office for approval before they go to what we call our building standards  commission, who oversees our code adoption process. So I   ve got the  division of code and regulations and then I   m also responsible for  statewide fire training, so state fire training falls within the office of the  state fire marshal.  We   re responsible for overseeing a statewide training program for the  fire service. It is a volunteer program, volunteer as in voluntary program,  as in there   s no training mandate for fire service. We provide the base  education for the fire service, so we offer specialty tracks   a fire  marshal track, fire engineering, fire company officer, chief officer  tracks, mechanics. There are classes within that that the state fire  marshal   s office oversees and updates and delivers. It   s a part of a  delivery system. And I   ve got my pipeline safety. I   m responsible for  over 5,500 miles of pipeline transporting hazardous materials throughout  the state of California. We work with big and small operators.  That includes energy companies, shipping ports     Energy companies, Kinder Morgan   When the pipeline comes off the  port and then it   s piped throughout the state, we take it from the port. So  22  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  we work with a lot of operators. It   s a very diversified office. We also  have reasonability for almost a billion square foot of state properties for  inspection and code enforcement. We are very active in what I   ll call the  green building movement, providing information to the fire service on  green building and alternate energies, whether that be biofuels or  hydrogen.  We look at our office as anything that would affect the fire service,  whether it be training, fire protection systems or fire and life safety, we  kind of collect it and help distribute the information. Now the state fire  marshal   s office, like I said, is only 175 people for the entire state of  California, which is about the size of the Eastern coast. We do that  because we have a tremendous amount of partnerships and stakeholders  that work with us, such as local fire service. I could not do what I do  without the involvement of my local fire service peers.  You coordinate all the activities, all the fire marshals     Coordinate all the activities, right. They still have their jurisdictions. It   s  like I always tell folks,    The state has the tablets, the two tablets that  come down, and we bring them down to local government and local  government then has the ability to make those tablets more restrictive if  they need to.    But we have a very strong partnership with our local fire  service. They are extremely helpful in our code development process, in  our oversight programs, in our advisory committees   it   s incredible. For  us to be able to do it ourselves is an incredible workload and we  wouldn   t be able to, so we partner with our locals because we   re all in it  together.  What size budget do you manage yourself that you   re responsible for?  What   s interesting with the state fire marshal   s budget is there   s the  general funds and then there   s the special funds. My budget is  20  million   well it   s kind of hard to tell now. My total budget, if I use  general and special funds, is about  21 million dollars. Out of that,  10  million of it is general,  11  million  is special. We   re moving a lot of  our general funding over into special funds because the state fire  marshal   s office statutorily is supposed to be self sufficient. To do that,  we have to move some of our overhead into our special funds and spread  that in special funds.  We were talking about budgets and the state fire marshal   s office is  supposed to be special feed. In other words, we   re not supposed to draw  from the general fund. There   s a challenge with that. If you   re a small  department, you have to spread your overhead and your revenue  capability out over a smaller volume of folks, which then drives your  23  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  hourly rate or your hourly cost up. In an environment where you don   t  want to drive your cost up, you want to drive your cost down, there is a  balance of people and responsibilities and the ability to collect a fee for  those responsibilities. Well, one of the things I had (and I consider this  an advantage) my ex-husband is a fire protection engineer, owns a  consulting firm   a very successful consulting firm. So I was party to  discussions about setting up a consulting business and understanding  how that works and how overhead works and being able to recover costs  and that balance of spreading things out so that   you know, you have to  have the money to get the people, you   ve got to have the people to get  the money and that whole balancing.  One of my first tasks when I came to the state fire marshal   s office as the  assistant state fire marshal was to work through this so that we could  start lowering our cost or balancing our cost. It was the consultant side  of my brain, having listened to that and watched that happen, that I was  able to get my arms around the situation within my own office on our  fee structure or on our ability to collect fees and understand why our  rates were the way they were and what was missing that allowed us not  to be totally cost recoverable. You know, it   s another one of those pieces  that you   re pulling from life experience that you can use in your day to  day operations. But we   re working in the state fire marshal   s office to be  more self-sufficient and to be less reliant upon the general fund. In  actuality, if you look at California right now, with all state agencies and  different departments, the same thing is starting to happen: how do we  stay away from relying on general funds to support our efforts?  Are the budget shortfalls impacting your   ?  Yes. Yes, it is impacting everybody. California was the fifth largest  economy in the world. Our state budget is equivalent to countries  budgets. Most states don   t have the budget we have. Most states don   t  have the budget deficit we have. Right now we   re looking at   I think  it   s about  20 billion dollars.  In dollars, how has it affected your budget? You said you have roughly  around a  21 million dollar budget.  We   ve had to do things like, positions that we were planning on hiring to  fill for people that retired, not filling those positions. So you have a  sense of salary savings there. We   ve been asked to take a 5  cut in our  staffing as well as our cost. We typically go through a drill anyway  annually, five, ten and fifteen percent reductions. Now, it   s more than a  drill. We   re actually going through the 5  cut. The state fire marshal   s  office has always pretty much been a, I like to say a mean and lean  operation, especially within the last fifteen years. It really hasn   t had the  24  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  luxury of a big budget. So we   re doing things like not hiring into  positions that are vacant, which impacts our ability to do work for our  customers, i.e. local government. People have had to double up on some  of their workload. We delay purchasing of some equipment. We   ve  made do with some things that we do have.  The nice thing, if there   s a nice thing, is that the office of the state fire  marshal falls within the organizational structure of CAL FIRE. The  Director of CAL FIRE looks at CAL FIRE as a total force concept. So,  not one department, not one group, not one division will take the hit for  the department. We all work together taking that hit. Within CAL FIRE,  there   s our fire protection branch, which is like our operational branch,  our resources branch, which is our foresters, we   re responsible for all the  state responsibility land, which is millions of acres. Then there   s our fire  prevention branch, which is the office of the state fire marshal.  When the director talks about total force, he talks about whatever is  going to happen to one group is going to happen to all of us, i.e. the  concept of furloughs. CAL FIRE was blessed by the governor   s office.  The director went to the governor   s office and we were exempted from  furloughs during the height of what we call   well we don   t call it fire  season anymore   our burn time, our heavy burn time. Within that  exemption from furloughs was all of CAL FIRE. It didn   t matter if you  were a firefighter on the line or you were someone that was working  through timesheets   whether it was the accounts payable folks, whether  it was the office of the state fire marshal, the director said we all need to  be exempted because we all work together. We   re all integrated  together. One unit, one division does not stand alone. So through the  budget process, we   ve all had to look holistically at where those cuts are  going to come from.  Do you currently hold both positions as assistant fire marshal and state  fire marshal?  Yes. Because I   m acting, I   m still the assistant state fire marshal, that is  my appointed position. I   m still appointed by the governor as the  assistant state fire marshal. I   m filling the role acting as the state fire  marshal, but with that comes all the dual duties and responsibilities  associated with that position. Though the governor makes the final  decision and he has not made that final decision yet, I still have the  responsibilities attached to being the state fire marshal.  On a permanent basis, you   re referring to?  Right, on a permanent basis.  25  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Do you see that being made in the near future?  I hope so. (Laughs) I really enjoy my job and I really enjoy working  with and for CAL FIRE and for the Director of CAL FIRE. He has my  support; I believe I have his support. But, again, it   s up to the governor  of the state. He makes the decision. He   s kind of busy right now.  Was your appointment by Governor Schwarzenegger?  Yes.  Was that a special moment for you?  Well, actually he wasn   t at my appointment but he did sign my  appointment papers. In my office is my appointment certificate all  framed and matted with the seal and the governor   s signature on it.  Yeah, that   s kind of cool. My boss was an actor. (Laughter) It   s kind of  interesting because we laugh, Governor Schwarzenegger was involved  in the film industry and so my peers from out of state will say,    So,  you   re an actor, too.    (Laughs) It   s kind of a joke.  I   m sure the expression    Make my day    probably comes up.  Yeah, we try to stay away from that. I get asked quite a bit, have I ever  met the governor? And I have. I kind of joke around; I   ve said twelve  words to the governor.    Good morning, Governor,       Good afternoon,  Governor,       Thank you, Governor,       Good night, Governor.     (Laughter) And usually it   s because we   re in some sort of receiving line  or at some sort of event and I   ve had the opportunity to represent the  department. That   s always an honor, to represent the department.  Back on some of your earlier comments about your area, as fire marshal  of the state what are the ongoing and emerging issues for fire safety in  California that you see?  Well, I wouldn   t even call them emerging issues because they are just  issues. The wild land-urban interface fire problem in the state of  California, we   re still getting our arms around that. I believe we know  what to do. I believe we know how we can make the biggest impact. The  biggest impact on that is our fire prevention measures, our risk  mitigation measures. I think we are making headway there but there is  still much work to be done. Our fire loss situation, I think we will start to  get more of a handle on with our residential sprinkler movement. The  state of California is the third state now to adopt a statewide residential  sprinkler mandate that all one and two family and townhomes built in  California after January 1, 2011 will be sprinkler-ed. That has the hugest  26  impact on fire life panic safety in the state of California, not only for  residents and our visitors but also our fire service. It will have the  biggest impact in fire safety.  Budget challenges and how we look at the fire service   we talk about  emerging issues, I don   t think we can look at the fire service as we   ve  traditionally looked at the fire service. We still have old stock of  construction that have fire issues associated with it. But as we move  away from that old stock into newer construction, along with that comes  newer hazards, different philosophies in fire fighting and challenges  associated with that if you start looking at what   s going on economically  right now.  Communities are having to look at reductions in their public safety force  that haven   t happened in generations. I can   t recall and I don   t know too  many other people that could recall a time when a community looked at  laying off 147 firefighters. That   s almost unheard of. Every community  around the country is looking at their public safety staffing levels  because they   ve had to go through so many cuts everywhere else and  they   ve tried to keep their public safety whole, but they   re finding it   s  difficult to do that. So, when we start impacting our, what I   ll call    the  boots on the ground,    our public safety force, our firefighters, our  emergency medical folks, police services, we   re going to take a hit there  when those people aren   t available to respond, when our response times  are increased, when our get-out times are increased, when we   ve had to  brown out stations, when we don   t have the work force to handle the  emerging fire situation, the fire problem.  How do we mitigate that? Well, now we   ve got to go back to that  prevention. I firmly believe that we need to make sure that it doesn   t get  to the point where I need a large volume of people to fight a fire. That  balance of fire prevention and when do we call in the fire suppression. I  used to tell my guys, when I was a local fire marshal, every time their  wheels rolled out the door on a fire, I failed. Because my job   and it  seems like we   re at odds with each other   but my job is to keep them  safe and if they do have to go to a fire, that they all come home safe. But  my job is to make sure that we don   t have the fires. We are going to  have fires. It   s a natural occurrence in nature. So how do we mitigate  that natural occurrence? How do we keep the losses reduced? So I think  that   s going to be the challenge, the balance of what can our budget  stand? What are our communities willing to accept? And what can we  do? In my opinion, the bottom line is, what is your community willing to  accept? Philosophically, are you willing to accept a reduction in your  public safety force and do you understand the impact that that will have  on your community?  27  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  In having said that, can you outline some of your major administrative  and management responsibilities? You   ve alluded to some of these  indirectly but day to day what are your primary duties?  Oh, day to day. (Laughs) I always tell people my day to day is to go to a  lot of meetings. I spend a lot of time connecting with our stakeholders. I  call that    checking in.    I spend time talking to industry, emerging  technologies, talking with my counterparts in other state agencies, what  they   re doing, how that affects what I   m trying to do, so we can  somewhat stay coordinated. Sometimes it   s a challenge to stay  coordinated within state government, because there   s so many people  doing so many things.  Most of my time is interacting with our stakeholders, whether I   m  talking to fire chiefs, finding out what some of their issues are. How can  I help them with their issues? How can I be a voice for some of those  issues or challenges? If it   s within my own department or within my  own groups of folks, what are some of their challenges? Who are they  having problems with? Sometimes you need to bump it up to the next  level. Can I help bump it up to the next level? Those type of things.  That   s mostly what my day involves.  Policies, what I   m doing in the office of the state fire marshal, how that  translates over to the rest of my own department within CAL FIRE. How  can I help my fire protection side of the house with some of their tasks?  That   s typically what I end up doing   a lot of time on the phone.  As you alluded to earlier, you have a teenage daughter.  Yes, I do.  Is she interested in following in her mother   s footsteps?  No way. (Laughter) She appreciates it; she understands it and I always  love taking her with me when I talk because it gives her a chance to see  what I do day in and day out. Her passion doesn   t sit in fire. She spent  her life   her eighteen years   being subjected to her father and I. As I  said, my ex-husband is a fire protection engineer and she   s had to put up  with that for a long time. Her thing lies someplace else and that   s okay.  She has an appreciation; she knows it   s provided her a great life, a great  opportunity. She sees the camaraderie; she   s been around the fire  stations. She understands what gets done, but that   s not her love.  You   re following in the footsteps of another successful woman in the fire  safety field as you mentioned, Kate Dargan.  28  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Yes.  Though it   s changing in your profession, in the past it   s not had a  significant number of women in the top leadership roles. Was Dargan a  role model for you and did you have other female and male role models  in your career?  Kate is a role model. She   s an individual that spent thirty years in the  fire service, in CAL FIRE, which when she started was CDF, California  Department of Forestry. Someone that worked from being a firefighter  to being a captain, to being a battalion chief and then holding the  position of a four star chief within the organization. She is a role model  in how she presents herself, the tactics that she   s used over the years to  promote fire safety, her commitment to fire protection. I didn   t live in a  fire station, I didn   t spend part of my career on shift. Women in the fire  service early on had a tough time. There   s no    ifs       ands    or    buts.    Just  like any fraternity or organization when it   s all dominated by one sex  and you introduce the different sex, it can be challenging.  There are some folks that don   t want to see change, because change is  scary. I listen to some of those stories and I think,    I didn   t have to live  that,    and I thank people like Kate and some of the other females the  came before me for blazing that trail, because they basically opened the  door for me. They took the heat so that I can do what I do. Have I had  my challenges? Sure, but don   t we all? I try not to focus on the male or  female thing.  Can you discuss your leadership philosophy a little bit?  My leadership philosophy has evolved over the past couple years. And I  say that because where I came from, I was pretty much a one person  show. I was more hands-on and we joke about it at work, about being in  the weeds. I was very involved in all the little pieces of what was going  on within my bureau and that interaction. As you move through your  profession, you have the opportunity to work and have other people  around you, you have to let go and you have to trust that the people that  are working for you and with you are very capable. As my division  chiefs tell me occasionally, they   ll look at me and say,    We got it under  control, Chief.       Okay.    That   s the sign of,    Let it go. It   s okay. We  understand what you   re trying to do here.     What I find, I want to empower my people to do the best job they can  and provide occasional direction, provide vision. I get to provide the  vision and they get to help us all get there. They   re all different people  with different ways of doing things but that   s what   s good about it,  because I think in the environment that we   re working in, since it is so  29  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Gill  diversified, you have to have a diversified look at things. From a  leadership standpoint, I start pointing the direction and I have faith that  my people will get us there   that we will get there together. I   ve learned  to get out of the weeds. I think it   s important to get out of the weeds.  Does your perspective as a woman influence your management  philosophy and leadership style?  I think so.  In what ways?  I think I rely more on my interpersonal skills. I rely more on  relationships. I mentioned earlier about insight and intuition,    it just  doesn   t feel right.    I think that   s a little different than maybe some of the  folks that have served before me, which have been men. I   m the  fifteenth, I think it is, fourteenth or fifteenth fire marshal that we   ve had.  I   m the second woman. Kate was the first, as the fourteenth   yeah, so  I   m the fifteenth. With that, women bring a different leadership style.  Again, does it mean that they   re not as tough? No. I think we look at  things a little differently. I   m a believer that we   re wired differently.  (Laughter) It brings a different perspective on things.  Has there been any pushback? You mentioned two fire marshals in a  row now for the state.  (Laughs) No. I don   t think so. I think, again, we   ve had incredible  leadership and we had incredible leadership with Chief Grijalva who  came in and when he moved on and then Kate being the leader she is  and the visionary she is (and I   ll tell you a funny Kate story) and then  having worked for Kate for two and a half years and the opportunity to  see that, it   s been a pretty smooth transition. We each bring our own  piece to the table, our vision to the table. But it   s been a pretty smooth  transition. It   s kind of like just carrying it forward. I always tell folks,     Chief Grijalva, Ruben did this and then Kate picked it up and she did  this; my job now is to tie it off.    We   ve done so much work, pre-work,  in so many things, I look at my job as    let   s tie if off and get her done.     Do you mind me asking a candid question?  Sure.  You were talking about Kate went through the ranks as four star chief,  battalion commander, et cetera; one might suppose that there   s a little  more acceptance of her moving in the fire marshal saying she   s earned  her bank and through the ranks. Did you feel any sense of frustration  30  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  maybe, or question on some people   s minds that you had not gone  through the typical ranks?  That   s a good question and yes. I   ve got boxes that I check off, you  might say. After I leave this position, if I do not have the opportunity to  be reappointed under the next administration, I laugh and tell people,     I   ve got to go find a job, because I   m a long way away from retiring.     (Laughs) So one thing about doing this early is you   ve got to go find a  job afterwards. My hope is to go back into local government and I want  to go back as a fire chief. But, there   s still this sense, not everywhere,  but a lot of places that to be a good fire chief, you   ve had to have spent  your time basically on the line and you   ve had to be one of them. I have  an appreciation for that; I understand that. It took me some time to get  over that hump myself, in my brain. That no, I understand it, I appreciate  it, I   ve been around it, I   ve done it on a limited basis, but my job is to  make sure that you get what you want and being a firefighter does not  get you what you want.  Getting you what you need and what you want is understanding your  role and being able to speak to those people that can make sure we get  what we need and want. I think that   s what I possess is, I may not have  all the boots on the ground experience, but I   ve got this diversified  environment that I   ve worked in, in the circles, in the associations and  the connections, to be able to get the boots on the ground with any...  because I have a full respect for that. When you   re doing it and you   re  doing it passionately, there   s nothing else like it in the world. It   s been a  challenge at times, you know,    Well, you weren   t a firefighter so how  can you be a fire chief?    Well I wasn   t a firefighter in the typical  mindset, but I tell folks, no matter what we   re doing in the fire service,  whether you   re a public educator, you   re a fire marshal, you   re a fire  inspector or you   re a firefighter, we   re all fighting fire. We   re all fire  fighters, just doing it in a different way.  Tonya, what would you say to a young woman who   s interested in a  career in fire safety and what will you say tonight, perhaps, to some of  the groups that ask you that?  I   ve been very fortunate to have met wonderful people that have helped  me along the way, but in my mind, I can   t think of another profession  that I would want to do. I was fortunate to take a hobby; it was my  passion and I turned a passion into a career. It   s a great opportunity if  you look at it that way. Yes, there are challenges. Yes, there are harsh  things that get said and done. Yes, there   s a glass ceiling. But there   s a  glass ceiling whether you   re at IBM or you   re at eBay or you   re working  for some biotech industry. There   s always a glass ceiling somewhere. If  you focus on that, it distracts you from moving forward. I try not to  31  Gill  Hoover  focus on that. I focus on moving forward. So if I was to tell young  women today, I found the fire service to be quite rewarding the way I  went into it. Now, I know women that went into it through the operation  side of the house and they still find it very rewarding. It   s what you  make it.  You said you had a Kate story earlier that relates to that?  Oh, yeah. (Laughs) I mentioned earlier about visionaries. Two things:  Kate was such a visionary. Kate was so far out there. Kate was fifteen  years ahead of all of us. If you   ve ever worked for a visionary, they   re  out there running down the road; they   re gone. You can   t even see them.  (Laughs) You   re supposed to implement their vision. So soon after I got  there, she was late. She got caught on a plane. She had to give a  presentation. She called me on the phone, she goes,    Hey can you give a  presentation for me? I   ve got to go do this thing on the wild land-urban  interface. I   m not going to make it. Can you go do it for me?    And I  said,    Sure.    She goes,    Well tell them I   ll be there tonight for the  reception, but you can give the talk.    I said,    Okay, great, not a problem.  Where   s your PowerPoint?    And she says,    I don   t have a PowerPoint.        Okay, where   s your notes? I can get it out of your inbox. Is it on your  computer?    She goes,    It   s all in my head. Tonya, we   ve been doing this  for so long, you can just go and do it. You know exactly what to say.  Just go do it.    (Laughs) And I thought,    Oh, my gosh,    because there are  very big shoes to fill there.  Well soon after I started   that   s one of the    soon after I started stories     that kind of put me into the mindset of what I was in for. Soon after I  started, in 2007 California faced one of the worst fire storms in history.  We had over, I don   t know, 220 fires burning simultaneously throughout  the state, most of them in Southern California. Three of the largest  complex fires that California   s ever faced down in the San Diego area.  For the most part, we thought the state was burning. Most of the state  thought it was burning, it was burning, but when you look at California  it was like little blips on the map, but they were in highly populated  areas; very, very critical situation. This is October, I started in  September. She asked me to go sit with our state operation center, our  SOC, which is where the governor goes and the CAL Emergency  Management Group is at and where we run all of our information, our  public information and dissemination out of the Sacramento SOC.  She says,    Well, I   m a public information officer   public speaking,  television, all that stuff.    She says,    That   s where I want you to go. You  can go help with the information you bring, you can keep our locals  informed, you can talk for folks.    I said,    Great, I   ll go to Sacramento.     So I spent like three days in Sacramento doing that. I   m driving into  32  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  Sacramento one morning and she calls me on the phone, she goes,    Hey,  I need you to do something for me.       Sure, what do you got?    She says,     I need you to go to Southern California. I need you to leave now.    It   s  8:30 in the morning. I   m still trying to get through traffic. I said,     Okay.    She goes,    I   ve got some folks coming in from Colorado that  are going to do some advanced imagery for us, some advanced  technology. You know the folks coming in from Colorado. You   ve  worked with them; you   ve worked around them. I need you to be the  liaison for this special intelligent group I   m putting together and I need  you to work with the following folks.    Which were folks that I hadn   t  met yet. I was going to the Southern region office to do this. She says,    I  need you to be on the plane. I need you to be able to meet them today by  two o   clock.    I don   t know where it came from, because I was all set to  go to the SOC, and I said,    Do I have to?    (Laughter) I caught myself,  and she didn   t say a word. She just let me think it through.  She says to me,    You know this better than anybody.    She knew it  wasn   t that I couldn   t do it; it was that I was stepping outside my box.  She says,    You know this stuff better than anybody else I can send there  and you know these people. I   d like to have you go.    Which meant I had  transitioned. I said,    Yes, boss. I   ll have Sherry set up my plane tickets;  I   m on my way back. I   ll make sure I get everything done. I should be  there by two o   clock.    She goes,    Thanks, Tonya. I   ll talk to you later  on.       Okay, no problem.    Click. (Laughs)  It was, at that point, I had made my transition. I was no longer a local  fire marshal. I had other responsibilities   bigger responsibilities. I went  to Southern California, had a great time. Worked for the individual   my  contact down there happens to be now the Director of CAL FIRE. So we  had a very good out of the block relationship, you might say. We got  along well, we interacted well. Now he   s my boss.  I   m assuming that you will have a more extended career as fire  marshal     Gosh, I hope so. (Laughter)  What are your goals and visions for the future of fire safety in  California?  Well, I   ll start with the vision in the office of the state fire marshal, as it  is a part of CAL FIRE, is to work to integrate the office of the state fire  marshal more into CAL FIRE as a whole. The office of the state fire  marshal has been under CAL FIRE now for about fifteen years. Just like  any marriage, there   s been challenging times and I think we   ve made it  through those challenging times. We   re at the point where, now is a  33  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  good time to finish what I   ll call an integration. The state fire marshal   s  office has wonderful skill sets and wonderful people that they can bring  into the other side of our family. That   s part of my, and I   ll call that, as  long as I   m with the state fire marshal, whether it be a year, two years or  three years, that   s the internal aspects.  My other vision and where my passion lies for the California fire  services as well as fire service as a whole, is an understanding and an  integration of everything that we do in the fire service for our  community, whether it be operations, prevention or training, that (I call  it the new fire triangle) we feed off of each other for this fire. And that  operations needs preventions, prevention feeds into operations, training  takes from both aspects and that we need to continue to work together.  Operations needs to understand the prevention aspects because what  operations needs to do their job safely, prevention knows about. We are  the ones that are in the planning phases, we are the ones that are in the  development phases and the code phases.  Training, when new technologies arise that come out of buildings, fire  prevention knows about it; they feed it to training. Training needs to  provide that to the operations folks so that these three pieces make sure  that the operations folks can do their job as safe as possible. It is an  inherently dangerous job. People will get hurt. Unfortunately, sometimes  people don   t come home. But it   s my job to make sure that those are few  and far between. My vision for the fire service as a whole is to tightly  integrate those three pieces so that we   re working in concert.  Tonya, you   re obviously passionate about the fire safety profession.  Where does that passion come from? We talked about your youth a little  bit and your parents and background, but what motivates you to see and  accept these continually greater challenges?  I believe in the core value of the fire service. I believe in public servants.  I believe the fire service serves the public. We have a responsibility to  do everything we can to serve our public. Whether you   re a career or a  volunteer, you   re there to serve your public. I think that   s where my  passion comes from. We   re all entitled to safety. The fire service is part  of that safety piece. It   s hard to say where that passion comes from. But  I think, bottom line is, I believe in the fire service. I believe in what it  stands for. It   s morphed and changed over the years but I still believe in  its core value system.  Looking back on your career to this point. How do you hope people will  remember Tonya Hoover? What do you hope they   ll say about you?  Oh, my goodness. I hope they see a commitment to the cause. I hope  34  Gill  Hoover  Gill  Hoover  they perceive or they think I was a good listener, that I wanted to move  things forward, that I believed in what I was preaching    so many  things. It   s so hard. I think,    What do you want people to say about you  when you die?    I like shoes? I don   t know. (Laughter) I just hope that  they know and they think that I did the best I could.  Tonya, what have we left out? What have we not covered? Is there  anything you   d like to share with us that we haven   t talked about?  Boy, we   ve pretty much talked about my life in a very short time period.  I can   t think of anything, other than I can   t stress enough that I   ve had  wonderful opportunities and I   ve done none of this by myself. From the  people that I   ve met growing up to the folks that I   ve met and carried  relationships through from here at Oklahoma State to my family to the  help I had with my ex-husband   s family and him to my daughter. I   ve  done none of this by myself, so it   s been a great opportunity. And thank  you so much.  I appreciate you taking time to visit with us.  Thank you.  -------  -------
