 Finchum Today is May 23, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m here in Stillwater,  Oklahoma, to speak with Dr. Marvin Keener, and along with me today is  Dr. Charles Abramson. We   re going to talk a little bit about the Phi Beta  Kappa chapter at OSU, but we   re going to start with learning a little bit  more about you. Thank you for having us today.  Keener Thank you for coming.  Finchum Let   s start with when and where you were born.  Keener I was born on October 25, 1943, in Birmingham, Alabama.  Finchum Birmingham. Where did you go to elementary school?  Keener I went to Curry Elementary School, which is about six blocks from my  house. Walked to school every day... (Laughs)  Finchum Did you get to go home for lunch?  Keener    uphill, both ways (Laughter). No, no we didn   t do that in those days. We  just ate at the school.  Finchum In high school where did you go?  Keener I went to Woodlawn High School.  Finchum And graduated when?  Keener Nineteen  sixty-one .  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  5  Keener Not really. I was more prone to science than, say, history or English, but it  was more the teachers. Whichever teacher was interesting or would interact  with you, you liked that subject that semester. The next year you   d have one  you didn   t like, so you didn   t like the subject too much.  Finchum Were you involved with FFA or 4-H, any of those things?  Keener No. I was in the math club, although I don   t really know why. You were just  in clubs. It was about the only thing   I was in the band and the orchestra,  few things like that. I was in the band mainly because I wanted to go to  football games free. (Laughs) They got to go.  Finchum What instrument did you play?  Keener Clarinet. Yeah, I was okay. I wasn   t great, but I was good enough.  Finchum Had to compete for first chair?  Keener Yeah, I never did get to be first chair. We had a really good clarinetist at our  high school in those days. He went on, played professionally. He was  always first chair, but I did get on the first row by the time I was a senior.  (Laughs)  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Keener I have a sister, four years younger than I am.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Keener My father worked for the City of Birmingham as a license inspector.  Whenever you have a business, you have to have a license, and in those  days, there were a lot of businesses that were sort of on the fly. They would  sell stuff out of the back end of a car or whatever. Most of the time I was  growing up, that   s what Daddy did. He chased those people around. Like at  a football game, there   d be these vendors selling pennants and stuff like that.  Well, he   d have to go out there and make sure they had their license, all that  sort of stuff, then in regular businesses, too, restaurants and so forth. That   s  what he did. My mother worked as a secretary at the IRS most of the time I  was growing up.  When I was real little, my father wanted to be an electrician, and he was  doing his apprenticeship at a steel mill in Birmingham. You had to do  apprenticeships in those days. I don   t know what they do these days, but  they had to do that. He was standing on a bridge. The bridge is still there,  although the steel mill   s out of existence now. When they made the steel, the  6  pig iron would run off down a ditch someplace. I guess they collected it and  took it somewhere else, but it was very hot. I can remember as a kid, still,  driving over that bridge, and you could see the red trail. He was standing on  that bridge, and a spark flew up, hit him in the eye, and put his eye out. They  wouldn   t let him ever join the union, so he had to give that up.  He didn   t actually graduate from high school. He eventually got a GED.  Mother graduated. Mother graduated high school at sixteen. When they were  young, it was important to get a job, not get an education. Although he made  it very clear to me that   you see, he had this job. He was good at his job,  but he never got promoted. They   d always hire some college graduate for  the next job. I can remember him telling me,    You   re not going to be able to  make a living unless you get a college degree, so you better pay attention at  school.    It   s about the only advice he ever gave me. We had no idea what     doing well in school    meant. We didn   t have a lot of money. We   d  probably be called poor today, but in those days we didn   t think of ourselves  as being poor. I didn   t go without food or anything, but we didn   t have  things like vacations. That was crazy. (Laughs) Can   t afford to be going to  Florida. That was dumb.  Finchum Did he help you choose what college you were going to go to?  Keener No. My deal with my father was that he would save his money and he would  be able to pay two years of college, and then it was up to me. I felt like I  needed a scholarship, and I did get a scholarship out of high school, a small  scholarship to a liberal arts college there in Birmingham so that I could stay  home. That   s the way it was in my family. He could pay the tuition to  college; he couldn   t buy room and board and all the rest of it. I worked and  earned enough money to pay a guy that also went to Birmingham - Southern   College  to drive out, drive me to college every day and then enough  money to ride the bus home. That   s what I did. Then the last two years, they  still helped me some, but by then I   d had a couple of pretty good jobs that  you could make some money on. I helped pave interstate highways one  summer into Birmingham, and you made a ton of money because we went to  work at five in the morning and we didn   t even quit the job until it was dark.  Finchum Hard work.  Keener Yeah, and so you got   I forgot how much I made. I think it was like a dollar  and a half (maybe it was two dollars) an hour, but the important thing was  you got time and a half for every hour over forty hours because I had to join  a union, too. (Laughs) It was my first experience with a union. You got time  and a half for every hour over forty hours, and then anything on Saturday  and Sunday (and we often worked on Saturday and some Sundays) you got  double time. We   d have our forty hours in, you know, like, early Thursday.  (Laughs) I made quite a bit of money that summer. I also worked for the IRS  7  one summer as a file clerk, and that was my first experience with  government, a government job. It was very interesting to me. They hired a  bunch of us because they wanted a bunch of boys to move   in those days  everything was in paper, so they had these rooms of filing cabinets with  everybody   s documentation about their   I said IRS. I meant Social  Security.  Everything about their social security stuff was in these files. People would  send you all kinds of stuff, even Christmas cards or birthday cards. They   would send     Hope you   re feeling well    cards. Any kind of correspondence  that came in had to be dated and noted and filed. Then anytime anybody  wanted to know anything, you had to go get the file and put it someplace  somebody carried it off to or wanted. They had this idea they were going to  move offices, so they hired a bunch of college guys to move these filing  cabinets. We got all ready to do that, and then they decided they weren   t  going to move, but they had hired us. The government says,    Well, you  know, we hired you, so we   ll find something for you to do.    I spent the  summer being a file clerk.  Finchum Did you major in   what was your major in your undergrad?  Keener In college? Math, but it didn   t start out that way. See, when I went to  college, I thought I   d be an astronaut, but we didn   t have counselors or  anybody like that. It never occurred to me that the best way to be an  astronaut was to fly airplanes. (Laughs) I thought,    Astronauts, astronomy,  maybe I   ll major in physics. That   ll get me into being an astronaut.    Had no  clue. I went to college thinking I would major in physics, but that didn   t  work out so well because where I was doing pretty good in the theory side  of it, well, the professor told me and my lab partner if we burned up one  more ohmmeter we were going to have to start paying for them. It was the  labs that were so bad for me. The next year, I thought,    Well, okay I   ll do  chemistry.    Boy, was that a worse disaster in the lab than physics was.  (Laughs)  By the time I got to be a junior, you had to choose a major. The only thing  that I had a lot of that I could arguably say I could major in in four years     you had to pick something you were going to graduate in four years. Never  think of that these days, but in those days they did. It was math, so I said,     Well, all right, I   ll be a math major.    That junior year, I actually discovered  I did like math. I never really even thought about it very much. It was  something I could do, but I didn   t think of it as being something you really  liked. I was always much more interested in baseball or something than I  was in anything I was studying. That junior year, I had a teacher named Mrs.   Lola Frances  Kiser, who helped me understand that there was a lot more to  mathematics than just learning how to do these calculations. I really got to  where I liked it, so I just stayed and majored in math.  8  Finchum Was your goal at that point to teach, like, high school or to go on?  Keener No. There was a brand new thing in those days there at my college. My  senior year, my college got a gift from Burroughs Foundation of something  they called a computer. Took up an entire classroom. It was a huge thing.  Had all kind of lights going off on it and everything. Nobody had a clue how  the thing worked on the whole campus. They picked a psychology professor  to learn how to run it. He didn   t know anything about it, but he offered a  course in how to operate a computer. He thought if he taught this course to a  bunch of people that were analytically oriented, then it would help him and  be good for us. I signed up for it, and I   ll tell you, after a quarter of that, I  thought there was nothing ever good about a computer because it took us the  whole quarter to figure out how to add two numbers together.  What it was he was teaching us was, really, (I came to find out later) was  machine language, not programming. Machine language was really  technically tough. Later, when I was in graduate school, I learned how to  program and Fortran  Formula Translating System , and then everything  became clear. I figured out that there were other things you could do with  math, and so when I was about to graduate, I began looking for a job. All  these jobs had something to do with a computer. They all wanted you to go  to graduate school. You could do much better if you went to graduate  school, so I decided I would try graduate school. My father had a cousin  who lived in Ohio, and she was married to a math professor at Ohio  Wesleyan  University . His name was Bob Wilson. My father did decide to  go on a vacation to go see Bob Wilson so Bob Wilson could explain to me  about graduate schools.  He was very, very helpful, and he   s the one that suggested I not apply to a  big famous graduate school like Harvard or even Wisconsin or Michigan,  any of those places, because he said,    You   re coming from a small private  school in Alabama, and those places are going to overwhelm you. Why  don   t you try some place like Missouri,    which was a very good math  department, but they weren   t those huge departments. I applied to Missouri,  among other places, even Alabama. I applied to Alabama. I went down to  see them, and they said,    What   s your grade point average?    I told them it  was about a three five, three six. This guy had a stack of folders. He said,     You know, these are all four points. You don   t have a chance here,    but  Missouri gave me a chance. I went there, and it was terrific. I mean, I don   t  think there   s a better decision I could   ve made. It was exactly what I needed.  Finchum Did you have to work your way through there, or were you a teaching  assistant?  9  Keener I was a teaching assistant, yeah. That was a very good learning experience  for me because not only did they teach me a lot about mathematics   and it  was true when I went to graduate school. A lot of the other graduate students  had more exposure to mathematics than I did. They knew theorems. They  knew about things I   d never even heard of, but what I learned at Southern, I  really knew. What they had heard, they didn   t really know. They just sort of  knew. It turned out I wasn   t really that far behind. We were all sort of in the  same situation. Big room, our desks were just a desk in a room. You had a  guy over there and a guy over here, girl over there, and we   d get to talking  about not only our classes but how to teach, and what happened, and what  would you do    if   . That   s where I learned about everything I knew.  Finchum That was for your master   s?  Keener For my master   s.  Finchum Then for your     Keener Well, when I got my master   s degree, I looked for a job because that   s all I  thought I needed, was a master   s degree. I applied to a number of places.  The one I liked was Bell Labs, and they offered me a job in Greensboro,  North Carolina. The deal was that,    Okay, we   ll give you a job, but you   ve  got to go back to graduate school and get a PhD.    (Laughs) I told my wife,  Margie, I said,    You know, work all day and then go to school at night, and  you know how I am. I   m so concentrated, I   m not good at doing two  different things all the time. I like to do one thing and do it really well.    I  decided,    I   ll just stay in Missouri and get a PhD, and then I go to work for  Bell Labs.     Something happened between then and me getting my PhD, and that was we  landed on the moon. We landed on the moon in July. I got my PhD in  December, and there were no jobs because the government decided,    We  landed on the moon, we beat the Russians, we don   t care anymore.    They  fired lots of people at NASA, and then all these subcontractors and all these  engineers and mathematicians hired to do stuff, they were all on the market.  Bell Labs didn   t really want to hire brand new PhDs. They had their pick of  all these people coming out of NASA and Boeing, Douglas Aircraft, and all  these places that were much, much more experienced, knew a lot more than  I did. They didn   t want a brand new PhD. Not only that, but most of the  universities didn   t need you, either.  I only had two interviews: one at OSU and one at Tennessee. The guy at  Tennessee I lost out to not only had a PhD in mathematics, he had a master   s  in computer science and he had been in the business for ten years, well-known  guy. They hired him, but OSU hired me. In a lot of ways, I have to  say again, I was just really lucky because OSU   s always been a place where  10  if you had an idea, then they   d let you do it. A lot of places, you can have an  idea, but if doesn   t fit the way the older people want it to be, then you don   t  ever get a chance. You   ve got to do what they want you to do. OSU wasn   t  that way.  Finchum That was in nineteen     Keener Seventy, I came here. I was in Columbia from fall of    65 through the  summer of 1970. We moved here in August of 1970. It was 108  degrees . I  remember that. According to the bank clock downtown, the bank thing  downtown, it was 108 when we drove in here.  Finchum Here you still are   Keener (Laughs) Yeah, here we still are. Even then, when I came here, my advisor,  who was a very well-known mathematician   his name was Walter  Leighton, Harvard PhD, head of the department at Carnegie Mellon, a  member of the National Academy of Sciences, all that sort of stuff. He  didn   t really like it that I came here. He wanted me to go to   he understood  why I came here because I   d just had these two interviews, but he would  write me letters and say,    There   s a job at Cal-Davis  University of  California - Davis . Why don   t you apply out there?    He kept trying to get  me to move, but we really liked it here. It was a really good place, and we  had two little ones at the time. It was a good environment. My wife had a  cousin that lived in California, and we   d hear about stuff that was going on  in California. She said,    I don   t really want our kids out there.    (Laughs) We  just stayed here, and it   s been really, really good.  Finchum Where was your first office on campus?  Keener It was Math Sciences 425. It   s still there. Somebody else is in there now, but  that   s where I stayed until I became  department head .  Finchum While we   re there, can you just walk us through your career at OSU, just hit  some of the highlights?  Keener Well, I moved up the ranks in the usual way, you know, assistant, associate,  full professor. Became full professor in 1980, I think, about ten years after  I   d been here. I had a colleague named Jeanne Agnew, and she and I had  this idea about having a course where the students really worked on actual  problems, not the problems in the textbook, not problems where you were  given all the information you need and no more information than you  needed to do the problem, just sort of open-ended kind of things. Like one of  them was,    How would you compute the number of hours of daylight on  Mars, say, according to longitude and latitude? How would you go about  doing that?    Now, OSU was perfectly willing for us to do that, but they  11  weren   t willing for us to find these problems on their money. We were able  to secure funding from the federal government to do that. It made a big hit  around the world at the time.  Today, it   s sort of taken as,    Oh, yeah, you   ve got to have that sort of  element in your curriculum.    In those days nobody even thought about that.  Together, we produced a list of problems that were real problems from  Boeing or OG E. We even had a machine shop in Enid to calculate how  you adjust propellers at the bottom of a well on a pump. We had a lot  problems, and they scaled. I mean, some of them, all you needed was, really,  algebra. Some of them, you needed complex analysis to do and things like  that, differential equations. We were asked to give presentations all over the  country. It was sort of like all of a sudden we were a hit in the mathematical  world. I was pretty much involved in that with Jeanne.  I spent a summer at Eglin Air Force Base working on some of their  problems. Somehow, somebody in AFOSR  Air Force Office of Scientific  Research  thought that   d be a good thing for me to do. I went down there.  When I came back, I figured I   d just keep going the way we were going. We  were doing pretty well. I got a call from the department that said,    Smith  Holt wants to see you.    I was home at the time, and I said,    Oh, well, okay.  I   ll go see him tomorrow,    or something. He said,    No, no, no. He wants to  see you right now.    (Laughter)  Finchum Uh-oh. (Laughter)  Keener That was the thing about it. I was thinking,    Golly, what could possibly be  going on?    I got dressed, I went up, and sat down with Smith. He said,    Bus   William  Jaco,    who was the department head at the time,    is going to go to  Australia, and we need a department head. I want you to be department  head.    That   s not really the way; most of the time, department heads were  chosen, especially not today. There   d be a big uproar about it. I said,    Well,  okay. I   ll be department head while he   s gone.    Bus left and went to  Australia, and I was department head. Then Bus didn   t come back because  he got a job as director of the AMS, American Mathematical Society. They  were looking for a department head. I didn   t really apply, but everybody  they brought in, they didn   t like for some reason. Smith didn   t like them, or  the faculty didn   t like them, or whatever. Toward the end, I just said,    Okay,  if you guys don   t like them, then maybe you   ll like me,    so I applied. They  said okay, so Smith hired me as department head.  I did that for about two or three years, and then the associate dean, guy  named Neil Hackett, (he was a history professor) he decided he didn   t want  to be an associate dean anymore. I applied for that, and I got that. I was  there about three years, two or three years. John Campbell was the president  while this was going on. John got into some trouble and was basically asked  12  to resign. I think it   d be fair to say he decided he would resign. He resigned,  and they needed a interim president. The current academic vice president  was a guy named Ray Bowen, and I liked Ray. As an associate dean, I often  interacted with Ray, and I liked him a lot. Still do. Ray became the acting  president while they looked for a new president. Ray called up and said,    I  really want you to be the acting vice president.    Completely surprised me  because we had all these guys that had been deans forever at OSU, and any  of them could   ve done this, and any of them would   ve been the more likely  choice, including Durham.  Norm Durham had been working in Ray   s office and had been at OSU for  forty years or something. Norm had been there forever. Somehow or  another, (I don   t know why, but they didn   t want any of them) they come  way down to an associate dean in Arts and Sciences of all places at OSU,  not agriculture, for example, or even business. They asked me to do it, and  so I said,    Okay,    figuring it   d only be a year. Then a year came, and Ray  could   ve been president here. I mean, the board loved him, but Ray got to be  president at Texas A M. He was a Texas A M graduate, not only a  graduate but he was, like, whatever that corps is, he was the head guy in that  corps. He was a very big Aggie, so he went. He went to be president at  Texas A M, and that   s when Jim Halligan came here.  They had a search. Halligan was a candidate, and they hired him. Halligan, I  remember, called me on the phone one time, talked to me for, I don   t know,  thirty minutes. Said he   d like for me to just stay on while they searched for  another guy; said it might be a year. I said    Okay, it   d be a year, another  year.    I called Smith, told Smith,    It looks like it   s going to be another year,  Smith, before I come back.    Smith was pretty nice about it all, really,  because really in a lot of ways Smith should   ve been in that job, not me. He  had other people doing the job for him, so I guess he didn   t feel too bad  about it. They did a search, and the search failed. They did another search,  and it wasn   t going well. We were at a board meeting, and Jim just said,     Marvin, why don   t you apply? You   re doing pretty well. Why don   t you  just apply?     I applied, and you went through everything that everybody else goes  through. Then I apparently was okay, with the faculty council in particular.  Faculty council was the hardest group to satisfy. I don   t think Jim would   ve  been unhappy with some of the other candidates, but the faculty council just  wouldn   t have it. In some ways, I owed my existence in that position to the  faculty council, although we had a lot of trouble off and on, especially  toward the end. That   s how I became vice president. I was vice president  there from about    90   I don   t know when I officially became vice president.  I think it was    94 or so until 2003.  Finchum Almost ten years.  13  Keener Yeah. We did quite a bit. I really hadn   t thought about anything like that. I   d  never really thought of myself as an administrator. I always thought of  myself as a mathematician. I always taught classes. Even as vice president, I  taught classes until I had the job permanently. Then I thought,    Man, you   ve  really got to dedicate now. You can   t be getting up and going to class at  seven thirty in the morning and having office hours at eight thirty at night,     stuff like that. I sort of quit teaching when that happened. I   d always thought  of myself just as a mathematician, not really as a university administrator.  Then I began to see the possibilities, especially  Robert  Graalman   s  operation,  Robert  Spurrier   s operation, the Honors College. We got the  Rhodes Scholar. We actually won a Rhodes Scholar. (Laughs) You know,   David  Boren had said not as long as he   s around will OSU ever have a  Rhodes Scholar. We actually got one, even had his support. Of course, that  was due in large measure to the guy that got it, but that was a big event, I  thought. We actually had the FTE  full-time equivalent  for the faculty go  over one thousand while I was vice president. Faculty salaries, we moved  from eleventh to fifth during my time. We fixed it so that everybody got a  computer. About everybody had them when I was vice president, when I  first became vice president.  Finchum And it had shrunk by then, too...  Keener Yeah.  Finchum    size-wise.  Keener Yeah, but I meant a personal computer on your desk. We created these funds  where the deans could make certain that everybody   s was up to date. That  was another big problem, was you could get one, but you had it forever. You  could be a faculty member, but your software was ten years out of date.  (Laughs) We were able to do that sort of stuff. Then of course, the other  things that we tried like Phi Beta Kappa, I wanted to get us a chapter of Phi  Beta Kappa. I   d wanted that since I came. When I got here, I thought   my  little liberal arts college had Phi Beta Kappa chapters, and Missouri had a  Phi Beta Kappa chapter. I thought everybody had a Phi Beta Kappa chapter,  and I came here and found out we didn   t have one. I just thought,    Golly,  how do you   it   s sort of unfair to the really good students that they don   t  get this kind of recognition.     Finchum How had you been made aware of it at your undergrad? Were you a  member?  Keener Oh, well, no, no, I wasn   t a member of Phi Beta. I wasn   t that good.  (Laughs) Now, my lab partner in physics that got us in trouble, he was Phi  Beta Kappa in physics and math. It was definitely, I guess, me that burned  14  up the ohmmeters. (Laughter) I don   t know. I thought it was both of us. A  number of our friends were in Phi Beta Kappa. I don   t know what the  criteria was. In my mind, I was thinking you had to be in the top 10 percent  of your class, but I don   t know that that was true. I was probably like 12  percent or 13 percent or something. My grades weren   t all that much worse  than Frank   s, but he definitely made better grades in some things, especially  in the first two years. My first two years, I was living at home, and it took  me awhile to adjust to the expectations of college. I remember my very first  English theme was an absolute total disaster. I   d thought it was a good  theme (Laughs), but when that guy finished with it, it was awful. In fact he  told me, he said,    If you ever hand anything like this in, no point in coming  back.    Teachers had more authority in those days than they do now.  Finchum That would   ve, for the Phi Beta Kappa at OSU, been in the    90s that you  started thinking or working toward getting it here?  Keener Well, when I was in the Dean   s Office, I think I talked to Smith once about  it. He was for it, too. He thought we should have Phi Beta Kappa, too, but he  didn   t have much hope that we would get one. I didn   t really quite  understand why at the time. When I got into the Vice President   s Office, I  talked to several people about,    Let   s have one.    There was a good deal of  support in some areas, but there was also opposition from some of the Phi  Beta Kappa people. I never really understood it. I was just told about it.     You   re going to have trouble. There   s some people that don   t want us to  have one.    I couldn   t understand why you wouldn   t want to recognize your  really good students. It   s something nationally. It   s a national kind of  recognition.  Now, we had Phi Kappa Phi, and it   s good. No problem with Phi Kappa Phi,  but Phi Beta Kappa is also something you need. I talked to Spurrier about it,  and I think Perry. I can   t really remember the first time I talked to Perry  about it. Bob made an effort. He made an application. It was really Perry  Gethner who really, really tried hard. We   d talk, and he   d say,    I need  money,    to do this or that. I   d give him whatever he needed. I gave him  moral support because I wasn   t a member, so whenever they had a meeting,  I wasn   t there, and I shouldn   t have been there. Whatever Perry told me we  needed to do, we tried to do. I remember he was disappointed. At least  twice, he had to call me up and say,    We didn   t make it,    but he   d always  say,    But we got closer     (Laughs) I was just sorry I wasn   t really in the  loop when it happened.  Finchum It took like three or four tries didn   t it, maybe more than that?  Keener Yeah, I know that Bob tried and failed. I think Perry tried twice and failed.  Then he was going to try a third time, and that   s about the time I had to get  out of the loop or something. There   s time periods between. You can   t just  15  every year do it. You had to wait a certain period of time. Evidently there  were some people on campus who were members of Phi Beta Kappa, and  they were determined that we wouldn   t have one. That   s the story that was  given to me pretty early on. I do know that at one time we did   well, I  shouldn   t say this. This is not very nice to the person. We bought that IGA  building when it became available so that we could remodel it and have an  offsite storage facility for the library because things were changing. There   s  more computing coming into libraries, and fewer books were actually being  checked out. They had a lot of books that nobody ever checked out.  Although I had a lot of faculty members telling me,    Don   t do this, Marvin.  Don   t do this. I like to walk down those aisles and touch those books.     (Laughs) I could understand that. There is something about being able to  touch it that makes it somehow real, but that was not the way we were  going.  Ed Johnson was the dean of libraries at the time, and he was telling me,     You   re going to have to do this.    We bought that building, and they began  moving books out. It cost a lot of money because you have to not only have  the building and then secure it and all the usual things you do to any  building, but you have to have it, like, hermetically sealed almost. You   ve  got to have the right mixture of moisture and all these sorts of things. I  forget what it   s called right now, but you   ve got to do that to the building,  otherwise the books will crumble up. You have to have special shelving.  Really, you can   t just have regular metal shelves put in. It was costing us a  lot of money. We bought the whole building, but we only used a portion of  the building because that   s all we could fix up at the time. That   s all the  money we could do. We had this whole other big end of the building that  was just vacant.  The Athletic Department comes and says,    Golly, we need an indoor hitting  facility for the baseball team. Why can   t we use that end?    Why can   t you? I  don   t have a good reason why you can   t. It didn   t cost us any money, except  the Athletic Department had to put in all these screens and stuff to keep the  baseballs ready. I asked Ed. Ed didn   t really care. I said,    Now, they   re not  going to be hitting the ball into the books.    (Laughs)    Got all these screens  set up, and we don   t have to   doesn   t cost us really any money. We   re not  going to have to air condition it and all that sort of stuff.    I didn   t think there  was any real problem about it.  Well, we had an application into Phi Beta Kappa at the time, and somebody  called them up and said,    They bought the building for the Athletic  Department. They just let the library use a little bitty end of it. We don   t  deserve Phi Beta Kappa.    I   m saying,    That   s not why we bought the  building. That   s not what the whole thing is about,    but I don   t know  whether it influenced them or not. When I found out about it, I really was  unhappy about the whole thing because it was a misrepresentation, and the  16  only reason to do it is just to hurt our application. Doesn   t have anything to  do with it. I thought it didn   t have anything to do with it.  Finchum With academics or, yeah.  Keener I mean, what are you going to do? You   ve got the baseball team, and they   re  trying to do well, too. Here   s a half-end of a building that you   re not going  to use, and they want to use it. I just, to this day, don   t see anything wrong  with it. I don   t know whether that meant we didn   t get it or not, might not  have gotten it anyway. It was just that kind of attitude on the part of some  people that was kind of discouraging.  Finchum The application itself is quite detailed, and     Keener Oh, yes.  Finchum    they ask all sorts of questions, I understand.  Keener Oh, yeah. Perry handled all that. Now, we gave him whatever information  he wanted. He would maybe call up and say,    I need to know X, Y, Z.    I  told my office staff,    Whatever Perry wants to know, you give it to him.     We eventually got Joe Weaver into the operation. Joe was Smith Holt   s  financial guy. We eventually got Joe into Whitehurst on the information  end. Joe, I think, is a really, really friend of OSU, the faculty, everything  about the university. He   s a really great guy, and I think Joe, if you talk to  him about what you want and what information you need to get to there, he  can get you a better answer than other people will get you. I think that  might   ve helped, too. I don   t know if he   s ever been recognized or what, but  somebody ought to do that.  Finchum When they finally got it, how did you hear about the success?  Keener I think Graalman sent me an e-mail. I think that   s how I found out about it.  Finchum And your response?  Keener I said,    Great     (Laughs) I was completely shocked and surprised. I was  very happy about it, and I knew that there were people working on it, but so  many times you   re told    no,    then when you   re told    yes,    well, then it   s  really special.  Finchum Do you have any involvement with it now?  Keener No. They were kind enough to invite me to be part of the group when the  chapter was established. I forgot what they called it.  17  Abramson Installation.  Keener Installation, yeah, the installation. I got to go to that. I got to dress up in your  cap and gown, made to feel like you were a part of it. I was really pleased  with that. That was a really nice thing they did. Other than that, that   s about  the only interaction that I have.  Finchum Do you think it   s valuable for a student to be able to say they were a  member of that for job opportunities?  Keener Oh, yeah. I don   t think it hurts. My point has always been that when you   re  really good at something, it   s good to recognize that and have that  recognized, that you   re really good. You   ve done something really not very  many other people can do. I know that in our society we like to want  everybody to be winners and all that sort of stuff, but the truth is that you  gain a certain amount of self-esteem. I don   t want to call it pride because  that has some connotations that might not be right, but you get a certain  amount of self-confidence when you really  can  succeed at something. Not  everybody does all that well in college, and graduation   s important. I  understand that. It   s a measure of success, but this is something in addition  to that. Little bit like graduating cum laude or summa cum laude or  something like that. That   s a very nice thing to have done. It means you   ve  done something really special and that other people recognize that you   ve  done something really special. A person that   s achieved it ought to get  recognized for it. Phi Beta Kappa   s one of those things that does that, so I   m  very pleased.  Since my time here, I   ve known a lot of people who would   ve been Phi Beta  Kappa at any school they went to that had it, and then they don   t. I think  that   s really sad. Now, I   m probably more sad about it than they are,  (Laughs) but they didn   t know about it, so maybe they   re not too concerned  about it. A lot of people these days don   t seem to take academic recognition  as seriously as maybe they did when I was in school. My son did very, very  well here. He was a member of Phi Kappa Phi, but I bet if you asked him  about being a member of Phi Kappa Phi, he would sort of,    Yeah, I think  there was something like that.    He   s focused on other things. He might   ve  been Phi Beta Kappa. I don   t know.  Abramson Did you ever discuss Phi Beta Kappa with  L. E.  Dean Stringer?  Keener Oh, yeah.  Abramson Could you elaborate a little bit?  Keener Yeah, when I became the vice president, I don   t remember whether I was  actually the vice president, probably not. No, no I wasn   t, actually. I was the  18  interim at the time because Ray Bowen was still the president. I think it was  Dean   s last meeting on the board. He stopped me and Ray after the meeting,  and he said,    Now, I   m going off the board, but there   s something that   s  unfinished, and I want some commitment that it   s going to get finished. I  want to get a Phi Beta Kappa chapter here.    I said,    Dean, I do, too,    and  Ray said,    Yeah, that   d be really great. We   ll do that for you, Dean.     (Laughter) That   s Ray. Dean said,    Let   s have some kind of proof we   re  going to do this.    I went back to the office. I don   t know whether Dean  asked me to do this, or I just thought of doing it. I don   t remember.  I went back to the office, and I set down on a piece of paper, and I wrote  down,    OSU does not have a Phi Beta Kappa chapter.    Then I signed it,     Marvin Keener, Dean Stringer, Ray Bowen,    in some order. I can   t  remember exactly. Then I gave it to Denise Weaver. I said,    Denise, make  this look pretty.    (Laughter) She did, and then we made several copies of it.  I took one to Ray, and I sent one to Dean, and then I kept one. I kept it in my  desk drawer, the middle drawer there, so every time I opened it, there it   d  be. It would make me feel bad. It would make me want to have   saying it  didn   t have one, made me want to have one.  Dean wanted, I think it was his idea that if we ever got one, we would take  that and tear it up. It sat there the whole time I was vice president. Then  when I quit being vice president, I brought it over to the office in the Math  Sciences, and it sat in that drawer until I retired. Then I emptied the drawer  out. I brought I home. It was on my desk over in my office there, and it was  just sort of there. Then when Graalman sent that e-mail, I went looking for  that thing again to be sure it was still in the drawer where I thought it was,  and it was. I told Dean, (I think I called Dean) and I said,    You know, I got  that thing. Why don   t you and I meet at Applebee   s someplace and tear it  up.    Then he said,    Oh, no, no, no. We   re going to make a big deal out of  this.    He talked to Graalman and   did he talk to you?  Abramson Yes.  Keener He talked to you. Somehow maybe that   s why I got invited to the  installation. I   m not sure. Maybe that   s the only reason I was. (Laughs)  After the installation, there was a reception, and at that reception, (they  made kind of a production out of it) Dean and I tore it up.  Abramson What happened to the pieces?  Keener What happened to the pieces? Well, I don   t know. The last I saw them, Dean  had them. I imagine he put them on a table. Now, do you remember who  was running that? I don   t remember who was running the reception. It was  somebody who     19  Abramson Was it Bob Miller?  Keener Bob Miller. Bob Miller was running the reception. Now, Bob might   ve  picked them up. I don   t know. I gave Bob Miller a copy of the actual thing,  not the original one but a copy of it, because the one Denise originally did  after I told her we needed some more copies, she made, like, I don   t know,  half a dozen or something. I gave one to Ray, I gave one to Dean. I   m sure  Ray has no idea. I actually asked Dean I said,    Maybe we could call Ray,  see if Ray would come up here because that   d be something Ray might do,  and then the three of us could tear it up.    But we didn   t. We didn   t do that.  That would   ve been neat, too.  Abramson During your time, did you ever have a chance to speak with your  counterparts at Tulsa University and University of Oklahoma about their  Phi Beta Kappa chapters? Any assistance they may have provided, could   ve  provided?  Keener You know, I didn   t know Tulsa very well. In fact, didn   t Tulsa get theirs  sometime in the   90s?  Abramson I thought maybe even a bit earlier.  Keener Little earlier?  Abramson I thought so.  Keener Okay. For some reason, I found out Tulsa had one. That was another thing.  If Tulsa has one and we don   t     Abramson That   s what shocked me.  Keener Yeah, I just couldn   t understand. Then one year, Perry came back and told  me something like Florida International got one, and we didn   t. I   m  thinking,    Golly, I just don   t understand the whole thing.    I just had a lot of  trouble understanding it. Anyway, no, I didn   t. Now, I didn   t really interact  very much with Tulsa. If you remember, in the most of the time I was vice  president, OSU was heavily involved in political intrigue and so forth over  at Tulsa. There was Rogers State, Rodger Randle, Langston, Northeastern.  We were trying to deliver programs in Tulsa ourselves, and it was quite an  experience. It was difficult, is what I   m saying, to really interact without  there being all this background of what all was going on in Tulsa.  The University of Tulsa, while not directly involved, they were a private  school. There wasn   t really, there   s no organization that all of us went to. At  OU, Nancy  Mergler  was a nice enough person, but Nancy didn   t really  interact too much. If you asked her a question, then she would have to go  20  ask David. She   d say,    Oh, I   ll ask David.    Maybe she   d respond; maybe  she wouldn   t. I never got the impression Nancy was in the same position I  was. Jim pretty much let me run it. He didn   t want me doing anything major  without discussing it with him, and we had a lot of discussions about a lot of  things.  He was very much trying to raise money. We had our first capital campaign  of significance. He was always in on that. Then the startup of OSU-Tulsa,  that was very time consuming for him. Jim trusted me to do the right thing  in most cases, so I tried to do that. The answer to your question is I didn   t  really talk to any of them. Didn   t really have much opportunity to. If you go  to the meetings, like land-grant vice presidents meetings, they all have  section chapters of Phi Beta Kappa. We really stuck out like a sore thumb.  Abramson Many of us never understood why there was not a chapter here.  Keener Well, it wasn   t from a lack of trying. I mean we tried to make our  presentation good, and I   m told that the early ones, that the society itself  wasn   t pleased with certain aspects of the university. When I first came here,  we were on AAUP  American Association of University Professors   sanctions or something. I didn   t even know that when I came here, (Laughs)  but after I got here, they told me then. There were some, and there had been,  I guess, maybe things in the past that presidents had done or not done or  whatever. I don   t really understand that part of it, but I was told that there  were things like that. The times that I knew we were applying, I thought we  had a very good application. I thought we met their criteria of what I  understood their criteria to be, but we still didn   t get it. I guess we didn   t  meet it.  Finchum The fee each time was, what, ten thousand dollars or something like that?  Keener I don   t know.  Finchum It wasn   t hard to justify spending that much again and again and again?  Keener Wasn   t hard for me to justify it. That was the fee; we wanted it. Pay it and  do your best.  Abramson We did know that if we didn   t get it this go around, there were some that  were really seriously considering whether we should apply again.  Keener Oh, really? Oh, no, it shouldn   t...  Abramson In the end I   m sure we would   ve done it, but for the first time in my  participation, there were real cracks.  21  Keener Is this, you mean, in the administration or in the membership?  Abramson The membership, who was going to be doing the work.  Keener Oh.  Abramson Those applications are very long.  Keener Oh, yeah, now, I can understand that. That   s why every time I see Perry, I  just kind of want to hug the guy because he did it and for, essentially, no  compensation. We didn   t hire him half-time to do that. He never asked to be  hired half-time to do that or anything like that. I guess we can   you know,  you guys just now have   maybe we should have. I didn   t even think of it.  Abramson Bruce Crauder put a lot of work into it, too.  Keener Yeah, Bruce is another guy. You   ve got to go a long way to find an  administrator better than Bruce. They are special kind of guys. They really  are.  Abramson Are you enjoying your retirement?  Keener Love it, yes. I recommend it. (Laughter)  Finchum Do you miss anything work-wise, though?  Keener Not really. It was time for me to retire when I retired.  Finchum That was when?  Keener Two thousand nine. I think it was, like, June 2, 2009.  Finchum Coming up on five years.  Keener Yeah. I always thought of myself as a math professor. I never really adjusted  to all the other things completely. Recognized I had to do them, but what I  was, was really a math professor. Eventually, I just got to where I couldn   t  understand the value system of the students. The last year or so, just said,    I  just don   t understand how to motivate. I don   t understand what excites them.  I don   t understand.    Used to be, I could get with them. I could be a part of  their world. I might have to adjust my thinking, but I could figure out what  to do. The last couple of years, I just got to where I couldn   t figure it out  anymore. Maybe I was getting old, and my brain didn   t work as well as it  used to. I don   t know what it was, but it wasn   t the same.  Finchum Were you ever recruited to go to another university?  22  Keener When I first got here, yeah. When I was thinking about being department  head, I actually applied to Clemson University and had an interview. I was  seriously considering that, but before they made up their mind, they offered  me the department head here, so I took it.  Abramson Wouldn   t it be a step down? When I first came to OSU (that was in    93,    94)  the OSU Math Department was number one in the United States. It was  between OSU and Harvard, back and forth.  Keener Well, I don   t think we were number one. (Laughs) We have a lot of good  people, mathematically strong people, and it was true that one summer we  had a higher percentage of our faculty supported by NSF  National Science  Foundation  than Harvard did. That   s partly because Harvard counts a lot of  people on their faculty that we probably wouldn   t count. (Laughs) No, we  were doing very, very well. You don   t always leave because you want to go  someplace better. Sometimes you want to leave so you can go make some  place better. That was the appeal at Clemson. Clemson at the time was sort  of like OSU seven or eight years earlier. They   re right there. They just  needed a little more. I thought that wouldn   t be a bad place. You ever been  to Clemson     Finchum Yes.  Keener    all one block of it? (Laughs) I was thinking maybe that might be a good  thing. When I got the job offer here, there was no question: just stay here.  When I was vice president, I never thought, I didn   t even contemplate going  anywhere else. I didn   t want to be president someplace. I watched Jim be  president here, and I didn   t want to be president. One thing a lot of the  people that were vice presidents, that   s really what they were there for. They  were wherever they were long enough so they could be president someplace  else. That was not what I had in mind. I was going to do the best I could  while I was here, and then when it was my time to leave, then, okay, I   ll go  back to being a professor.  Finchum Over those forty years, you   ve seen quite a few changes     Keener Oh, yeah.  Finchum    physically on campus and otherwise.  Keener In every way, the campus is completely different than 1970, and the Math  Department is way, way different than when I came. It   s like the Boone  Pickens Stadium different. (Laughter)  Finchum The computer system is considerably different, too.  23  Keener Oh, yeah. I remember in something like    72 or someplace in there (I can   t  quite remember the year) John Jewett, who was the department head at the  time, paid  495 for a handheld calculator that could add, subtract, multiply,  and divide and had a percent sign,  495. He bought it for the department so  that we could calculate our grades better, make sure our grades were  calculated right. That was a marvelous thing. That   s the first time I ever saw  anything that small that could do anything. Of course, now you get those  things given to you. If you buy the right thing at Wal-Mart, they   ll give you  one of those. (Laughs) Then I remember when Bus Jaco first became  department head, we got two things. We got what was the closest thing  available to a personal computer. We had a room full of these, basically,  calculators. We had a room full of those, and then we got ourselves a VAX  computer.  We hired a guy named Ned something or other (gee whiz, too old) to run it,  bring it up. We were all enthralled with that. Boy, we really got into that.  We were computing fools, and as department head, I could use e-mail  because the Computer Science Department let me. (Laughter) They had e-mail.  We didn   t really have it the way that they had it. Of course, when Ray  Bowen came, everything changed because Ray, that   s his main way of  communicating is e-mail. If you wanted to see Ray, you could get a meeting  with him, but it might take a while. You could fire off an e-mail, and ten  minutes you had an answer.  Abramson I remember the extension on the OSU emails was    bubba    something. Do  you remember that? BCC something dot bubba.  Keener Yeah.  Abramson I   m glad they changed that.  Keener Yeah. That was somebody over in the computing center that probably  thought that was funny. We didn   t need that at the time. (Laughs)  Abramson When I arrived at OSU, Dr. Keener was my first provost.  Keener That   s been a long time now, hadn   t it?  Abramson Long time.  Keener I   m not sure   are you the guy that did bee research?  Abramson Still do.  Keener You do?   24  Abramson Still do.  Keener He was famous. We hired a guy that did bee research.  Abramson I   d always see him. He always made himself available. I don   t know if you  realize, but that was a big influence on young faculty members. Whenever  you were walking around, somebody could walk up to you and talk to you.  You never brushed them off. I always appreciated that.  Keener Well, that   s the way   that   s what I mean when I said I always thought of  myself as a math professor. I didn   t think of myself as some kind of real  important administrator. Partly, OSU has been like that. Most of the  administrators, at least when I was coming up, they were kind of that way.  Larry Boger was that way. You could go talk to Larry. He was the president,  but you could go in and see him. If he was in, he   d talk to you. Jay Boggs  was that way. I knew all those guys. One of the things that I really enjoyed  about my time at OSU was I was the chair of the Arts and Science Faculty  Council, the University Faculty Council, and then I followed all that by  being administrators in all those.  I knew what those discussions were like. When the administrator isn   t there  and there   s just the faculty sitting around a table and what they   re saying, I  knew because I   d been there. I always was kind of pleased with that. A lot  of administrators they never really struggled with the faculty side of it. They  only see the administrative side of it. Whenever a problem would come up, I  remember saying,    Now, let   s see. How is the faculty going to think about  this?    That would help guide the decision. Sometimes decisions had to be  made that I knew the faculty wasn   t going to like, necessarily, but I always  had a reason for them. Even if they didn   t like the reason, I had a reason.  (Laughs)  It   s been a really   I look back on my life, I just think I was very lucky so  many times. So many times when there was a choice to be made, sometimes  I didn   t really have a choice. I was always forced into making the right  decision in some way. Like I had to major in math because I couldn   t major  in anything I liked. (Laughs) When I went to graduate school, I just went so  I could get a better job. Then when I got ready to have the really good job I  wanted, it wasn   t there, and so I had to go into the university. That turned  out to be terrific.  Finchum Destiny, maybe?  Keener Oh, yeah. I mean, there is no Bell Labs anymore. Hasn   t been for a long  time. If I   d have gone there, I   d have been there, maybe doing very well. I  could   ve gone there, maybe been there twenty years, but then they went out  25  of business. My connections with Jeanne and I   s work, I got to know a lot of  those guys, and I still do. They were just on the street. There   s no tenure;  there   s no other Bell Labs to go to. You   re just there. Now, some of them  have hooked up. I know one guy that   s hooked up with Rutgers University.  He   s called research professor, which means he can have an office and  they   ll do his paperwork, make sure he gets paid and all that, as long as he   s  got a grant. (Laughs) If he doesn   t have a grant, then     Abramson You were the first member of your family to go to college. When you  received your degree, your parents must   ve been very proud.  Keener Yeah, I think so. Daddy expected me to college. Like I told you, he said,    If  you don   t go to college, you   re not going to make a living.    He expected me  to go to college. I   ll tell you what really, I think, impressed him was when I  got a PhD. My mother and father didn   t go to college, and of course  grandmothers and grandfathers didn   t either, except my father   s mother did  go to a business college. She actually worked for Deloitte and whatever,   Touche , that accounting firm, Deloitte something. She actually worked for  them for a year or two. They   re an accounting firm. My father   s sisters, (he  had three sisters) they all went to college, and they all were some kind of  teacher, kindergarten teacher     Finchum Were they younger than him or older than him?  Keener Younger, yeah, they were younger. Daddy, I don   t know a lot about his  childhood. He didn   t really tell me very much, but I gather he wasn   t all that  interested in school. Grandmother, my grandmother, her father, so it   d be  my great-grandfather, he was married twice, and his first wife had six sons.  They all went to college. In fact, one of them is a founding member of Phi  Kappa Phi, University of Tennessee. His name was Fulton. They all went to  college. Then he married again, and he had a bunch of girls. The last one  was a boy, and he didn   t go to college. He farmed. That   s what they did  those days, and the women all got married. I think that   s what they intended  to do.  It wasn   t like college was not in the thinking. I think Daddy, 1929 happened,  and,    By God, I   ve got to make money.    He did tell me that he would work  for fifty cents a day, and it cost him a dime to ride the streetcar out to work  and a dime to ride it back. Thirty cents a day was his job, and he worked  until he got a better job. I think from his standpoint, it was important for him  to make some money, so he didn   t see how a high school degree was going  to help him. A lot of times, and my mother verified this, that the first job she  had, they didn   t get paid. They did the job so they could get a reference, so  that you would have a reference to someone else who would pay you would  hire you.  26  That   s how it was done in those days in Birmingham. That   s what Daddy  concentrated on. Then he had picked out his career, and he got his eye put  out. Then I think he thought,    No point in going to school now.    He got his  GED, and he sold insurance for a while. I remember him talking about that.  He hated that, but that   s what he did. It was a different world. I admire him  for it. They raised me and my sister, and we   re not in jail. My sister   s retired  now. I think they did a really good job.  Finchum Anything else you want to ask?  Abramson Yeah, I actually have one more question about Phi Beta Kappa, which I   m  not sure you can answer. I think it   s more of a strategy question. When you  were provost and you heard about these faculty members trying to prevent  us from having a chapter, would you try to talk to them, or just say,    Well,  it   s better left alone   ?  Keener I asked Perry. I remember one time, I said,    Perry, should I just go   .    I   d  mention a guy   s name, and you would know it, but I don   t want it to be on  this.    I could go and tell him,    You don   t need this.       Perry said,    No, that  wouldn   t be   .    He didn   t think that   d be a good idea. He   s probably right.  Administrator come over and sit down in the faculty member   s office and  tell them they   re not doing something right, that probably doesn   t go over  well.  Abramson Because there was one case when I actually did talk to an individual faculty  member, and then when they had the site visit, I made sure that he was able  to attend because he had to have both. In fact, you could be one person I  would be interviewing. I would just like to know, to understand someone   s  thinking because I understand that every university has problems. Not every  university is going to be this or that, but why hurt students?  Keener Yeah, that   s the thing about it. I could understand why a faculty member  might say,    The library ought to be bigger,    or,    We ought to have this sort  of building,    or,    We ought to have this kind of equipment,    or,    My lab  ought to be bigger than it is,    or whatever. The chapter, in my view, wasn   t  so much for the administration. The administration   s going to be there  whether you have a chapter or not. It was for the students and their ability to  be recognized. That   s who I always felt were being cheated, not the  university. I just wanted the people to know. That   s what I would   ve said to  them, but I think Perry was probably right. If I had not been vice president,  that might   ve been different. Being the vice president might   ve not only  made him unhappy but it might   ve made other people unhappy.    What kind  of vice president do we have? The guy says,    We ought to do this,    and then  when we don   t agree he   s going to come in and try to threaten us or  something.    I could see why it might not have been wise.  27  Abramson Our program director, and one of the things that one of my faculty members  told me (maybe this goes along with what you   re saying): let other people  do those kind of work, those kind of jobs.  Keener Yeah, when you are a vice president or dean or any kind of major position  like that, I always felt like you needed not to be too rash if you disagree with  someone, rash in the sense of what your immediate reaction is. Just calm  down a little bit and think about if you do this, how is that going to be  interpreted, not necessarily by the person but by other people. During my  time, we had board members who wanted me to call up so-and-so and tell  him this, that, and the other. Then they   d find, they thought, somebody had  been mistreated, especially a student being mistreated or not given the  respect maybe they felt the student should be given. It   s a tough  conversation to have, to say,    Look, there   s probably not going to be a  solution that   s really going to work.     I don   t mind calling the department head or the dean (that   s who I usually  talked to, was the dean) about what   s going on because we don   t want it to  get to be an epidemic. (Laughs) We did have one or two of those when I was  there, some people that just every time you turned around, they were doing  something. We don   t need that. As a professor, when you   re standing in  front of the class, you have to be a little careful what you say to an  individual student because not only from their point of view but from the  point of view of other students, is it going to make them less willing to ask a  question, how you respond to that person. You have to think about these  things is all I   m saying. I learned all that, incidentally, in the bullpen at the  University of Missouri. (Laughter)  Abramson I guess the last question I would have is how would you see the Phi Beta  Kappa chapter at OSU in the future because now we have a lecture series,  and frankly it is a little bit difficult because of some of the requirements of  getting students. Also, some do not know the tradition of Phi Beta Kappa.  Keener Well, you   re going to have to educate the students on that. That   s one thing I  think the chapter could   with the help of the administration. The  administration should be willing to help you in reasonable ways, help get  students educated from the time they get to be, like, freshmen in here. A lot  of your Phi Beta Kappa winners might well come through Graalman   s  operation. I know it   s not Graalman anymore. In fact, who is the guy that   s  running Graalman   s thing now?  Abramson I think his name is  Tim O   Neil.  Keener O   Neil?  Abramson Yeah, I could be wrong.  28  Keener That doesn   t sound right.  Abramson I just talked to his assistant today.  Keener The guy that took Graalman   s place is an ex-student of mine. I taught him  honors calculus when he was, like, a freshman, and he would come to class  barefooted. In the middle of winter, he would be barefooted. He was a very  unique guy. Anyway, you want to be sure those people are well aware and  appreciative of what Phi Beta Kappa recognition means. You   ve got  members in the department, in most departments, don   t you? Quite a  number of departments. We   ve got two or three in the Math Department.  Abramson I believe the Math Department may have the most.  Keener Okay, well Lisa  Mantini  and those people, they need to educate our  majors. They need to talk it up. It   s not like being at Harvard or even at  Birmingham Southern where I was, where it was just part of the deal. You  didn   t have to   the students explained it to each other. You   re going to have  to build that kind of thing. It   s going to take a little bit of effort, and it   ll take  time. You want to get the students to understand that academic recognition  is worthy, and it   s special, and something that, if they achieve, they should  want. Some of them are going to say,    I want that. I   m going to try to get  that.    Some of them won   t think about it, but actually do it. (Laughs) I think  that   d be a very   that   s the biggest challenge, I think. Now, you do have a  lecture series, and I really ought to go to some of those. I don   t read my  email. That   s the way universities now communicate, so I only read my  email every so often unless I   m expecting something. If I can read about it  early enough, I can make plans to go, and I really ought to do that.  Abramson Your contribution was certainly   and without your contributions, I don   t  think we   d ever have Phi Beta Kappa here.  Keener Well, I appreciate you saying that. That   s a very nice thing for you to say. I  certainly wanted it. I was also really proud that all those guys that were  standing up there in the podium, I mean, Perry and Spurrier and Dean and  Crauder   who else was up there? Anyway, I looked up there, and I said,     You know every one of those guys.    I worked with every single one of  those guys, and that made me kind of proud. I was proud for them. I was  proud for the university. I was proud for the students. I was proud for  everybody at that meeting, even the guy that came down to give the talk, the  Phi Beta Kappa representative.  Abramson He was the president of Phi Beta Kappa.  Keener Cate   29  Abramson Bob Cate.  Keener That   s who I   m thinking of: Bob Cate. I hired Bob Cate, or recommended  him. Smith technically hired him. When I was Academic Associate Dean in  the College of Arts and Sciences, the guy that held that position was a guy  named Kyle Yates, and Kyle was loved by everybody. He was a very good  faculty member. I liked Kyle an awful lot, but Kyle retired. This position  came open, and there were quite a number of conditions about this chair. At  the time, it might   ve been the only chair in the college but certainly the first  chair in the college. It was a chair, basically, of religion. It needed to be a  Baptist orientation. There were lots of different views on that. We had a  search, and Bob Cate was the guy that was recommended.  I talked to Bob, and I just liked him. I said,    We   re not going to get Kyle,  but we   re going to get somebody that   s going to really be pretty good,    and  he was great  You   d go around campus, you could always tell when he was  close to you because he   d be whistling. He whistled everywhere he went. He  taught his classes, and he taught other classes in philosophy that other  people didn   t want, like world religions, stuff like that. He   d teach those.  Even as vice president, when you   re going across that graduation, you know,  you go across, every now and then a student will say,    I just want you to  know, Professor So-and-So made a difference to me.    While they   re going  across, they would say that. Cate was mentioned more than anybody, and  there wasn   t even a major. He just taught these religion courses. You  wonder about that. Then there his son is, right there in the Phi Beta Kappa  thing. There   s his son as a part of the program. I said,    Wow.     Abramson Full circle.  Keener Yeah  It was such, that night was such a memorable experience for me.  Well, I   ve enjoyed this; I don   t know about y   all. I hadn   t thought about a  lot of this in so many years.  Finchum Well, we usually conclude   is there anything else you want to add before we  close off?  Keener Well, I thank y   all for coming out and for doing this. Of course you know  I   m on the Friends of the Library board. Sheila   s  Johnson  always talking  about these oral histories, so now I   m part of it, I guess.  Abramson Maybe you can do us a favor. There   s supposed to be a table out there, a  display case, that we want to put some Phi Beta Kappa memorabilia that we  have.  Keener Oh, yeah, sure.  30  Abramson Maybe you can ask how that   s going.  Keener Have you asked for it?  Abramson I believe so.  Keener You have?  Abramson Yeah, it   s been a while.  Keener But nothing   s happened?  Finchum No, I think there   s something temporarily up for the moment, but if other  things come in, they   ll replace in that, too.  Abramson That   s why I mention the strips of the paper that was ripped up. That   d be  nice to have a little bowl of those    (Laughs)  Keener Well, yeah, I don   t know. I think if anybody has it, it   s probably Miller.  Abramson Miller. I   ll ask him.  Keener Yes. You know, I didn   t really think of that at the time. I know Bob wanted  a copy of it. He said,    We got to have a copy of it before you tear it up.    I  gave him a copy of it, but the original one we tore up. I   d ask Bob.  Abramson I   ll do that. If not, maybe we can make another copy, you know, a facsimile,  and put it in there.  Keener Yeah, you could do that. You could make a copy of one, and then tear it up  and put it in there. (Laughter)    This is a copy of the torn-up copy.     (Laughter)  Finchum On that note, we   ll say thank you for sharing your story with us.  Keener Sure. Thank you.  -------  -------
