 Finchum  Today is September 28th, 2007. We   re here in the Angie Debo room on the  OSU campus to talk to Neysa Eberhard. She was the Curriculum  Materials Librarian  CML  back in 1969 to 1973, is that correct?  1973, correct.  And this is part of the O-STATE Stories Oral History Project that the  library is conducting, so thank you for joining us today.  Thank you. The Angie Debo room is a certainly appropriate room to be  in. She was quite a lady.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about your childhood, where  you are from, and we   ll work our way up.  Well, I was born in the middle of the sagebrush territory in western South  Dakota. And at age of fifteen my mother died, and I moved to Kansas to  live with her sister and family. So I   m pretty much Kansan since then,  except for the four years I was in Oklahoma. And one of the things I  remember is how welcomed I was. Actually, I was given a little broach  about Andrew Jackson that was supposed to give me an emblem of being  a citizen of Oklahoma, and I couldn   t find it to wear it today. But     (Laughs)  Did you have siblings?  No, I was an only child, but my two cousins that grew up with me are like  sisters. In fact, they consider me a sister, and their children consider me  their aunt and that sort of thing.  How did you choose librarianship?  5  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Well it was kind of an accident. When my son started the first grade, the  superintendant in our school system had been asking me to come back and  teach and I wasn   t ready to until he started school on a so called full-time  basis. So I was teaching 6th grade language arts and science because I  happen to have a K-12 certification, and they needed a librarian and an  English teacher. I was a Speech-English major really, so they paid my  way to go to school that summer, and one of the first classes I took had to  do with school library administration. The assignment was to write an  essay about why I wanted to be a librarian, and I was angry because I was  away from my husband. I was sitting there typing away, and I said to  Mom B,    Is it all right for me to tell them the only reason I   m here is  because they   re paying my way,    and she said,    Neysa, when you were in  high school, that   s all you ever wanted to be was a librarian.    And she  was right, because as an only child with a working mother, I lived in the  library. They let me move up to the adult collection when I was only  thirteen years old because I   d read everything there was in the children   s  collection. (Laughs) You know, she was right, but I had kind of forgotten  it, and fortunately the right door opened. That   s it.  Back up a little bit too, what kind of work did she do, your mother?  Oh, my mother was a stenographer for the Standard Oil Company when  she died, there in South Dakota.  So what brought you to Stillwater then?  Well, I had been a school library supervisor in Newton  Kansas , in  Newton Schools. That   s the last position I had there, and I had  administrators who were very encouraging for me to go on with  administration. In fact, I was the only woman administrator in the central  office at that time. So, I decided to go for my doctorate because I was  going to be a superintendent of schools. I was assured in my own mind  that I could do as well as any I   d ever had. And I had a friend who was the  dean of Emporia State   s College of Education, and I was over forty. It is  not easy to get into a doctoral program when one is over forty, and he  recommended me to Homer Sorenson and to Boulder. I interviewed for  Homer Sorenson and he accepted me as a potential student. Then I  applied for a graduate assistantship. Roscoe Rouse gave me one by mail, a  three-quarter time assistantship, and so I came  to Oklahoma State  University . Well, I actually took classes during the summer of    68.  Here on campus?  Yes, here on campus, those are the first classes I took in the program.  And then I thought, well I need to get my year of residency over with. So  that   s when I applied for the graduate assistantship in the School of  6  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Library Science. I came down to see Gene Post who was my advisor and  talked to him about it, and he said,    You have a three-quarter time  assistantship?    which paid something like  275 a month and I said,     Yes.    And he said,    Well, you can only carry six hours.    I looked at him  and I said,    I can   t afford it   I can   t afford to stay here for that kind of  pay.    And he said    You know, there   s a position open over there in the  library that your qualifications fit very well for.    He said,    Why don   t you  call Roscoe Rouse, and ask him if you could apply for it,    which I did.  And Roscoe, of course, diligently looked over my credentials again, and  whatever he did, but I was given the position. I think I lucked out. I had  had school library supervisory experience and developed elementary  libraries in our school system but it was September, and the position  wasn   t filled and I think that helped. So, that   s how I got here.  So you worked and then took classes as well?  And I still could only take six hours.  Did you get your degree?  Yes, I got my doctorate in    74.  From OSU?  Yes.  And then you chose to leave?  Well I had planned to go back, and I had not planned to stay here quite  that long. I did have a very interesting position, and it was certainly  paying the bills. I could go home every weekend and I did have a month   s  vacation, that sort of thing. No, I started looking for positions. I was  offered one at Oral Roberts, but I didn   t think I   d fit Oral Roberts very  well. Then at home, I was applying for positions that opened up in  libraries and school administration, and I was just sort of feeling. And one  day my former superintendent called and said,    Neysa, we have a brand  new library   public library, and they need a librarian, and I think you  ought to consider applying.    Well, in the four years that I was here, Anne  Hoyt who was the director that was following me, she was teaching  library science   had been a school, elementary and public librarian, and a  library science teacher, and she was always telling me that she understood  me,    You would really like being a public librarian.    So I thought,     Well       and Nelson called me,       alright, I   ll look into it.    And I got it.  So my last seventeen years in the field of librarianship was fun.     public library?  7  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  I enjoyed it, because there's not all that bureaucratic nonsense that goes on  in the public schools and academia and all that sort of thing. You know,  there you have to be creative. (Laughs) Financially, you have to be pretty  creative, so I really enjoyed it.  Okay, so you were here four, then you went there for seventeen, and then  what?  I retired.  You retired, okay. While you were here did you have to do any grants to  get programs started?  Yes. Unfortunately I do not have good long term memory. The short term  isn   t great either, but I did have a grant that brought to the campus   at  those times I can   t remember what we called them, they were like  seminars   an institute that brought the audio-visual and the librarian  teams from public schools. We had resource people who worked with the  development and the focus and programs of school library programs at  that time. It was an interesting period because this was after the Title II. In  fact that   s when I became a school library supervisor. I was in the  classroom, which is another story, but I was in the classroom, and they  didn   t have any MLS   s except me. They asked me if I would come over  and direct, and implement the Title II program which was the building  and development of the facilities and the materials and the programs for  the elementary libraries. We had two junior highs and a senior high  library that were doing pretty well. We brought in some new people and  lots of exciting things happened after Title II because there were federal  funds to use for the materials. So that   s why I became a library supervisor  really, I guess, because they didn   t have anybody else. Fortunately, I had  an excellent superintendent.  How much was the grant, do you remember?  That was why I wanted that kind of a grant. Because it is so important in  the public schools, private schools, whatever kind of a school it is, even in  the university setting that the administrators really understand the role of a  library media center and the importance of it in the educational process.  And then the teams, who are very often in an audio-visual department,  which in this case was separate except for Della  Thomas , who had  materials, and the library, which was more print oriented at that time. I  don   t remember, but it paid for a number of teams who came here. We  had a couple from Puerto Rico.  It   s was substantial then     8  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  I mean they had to provide their own transportation, but we paid for the  on campus experience.  So you were the second person to lead CML  the Curriculum Materials  Library ?  Della Thomas is the one who created it. And she really, she started it in  1957 and I came in, let   s see. Well, it was twelve years old. I came in     69   it was twelve years old. She was very gracious to me. Della was an  awesome person with a great vision. And then Anne Hoyt, who was  teaching library science, took my place. And there were three more, well  Donna  Schwarz , and then there were two in there who I did not know.  And then Donna again.  What were the interesting books at that time? Do you remember what  students were focused on? They may or may not pop to mind but     Well of course we encouraged   no I really   I can   t think of titles right  off     And where was it then?  Oh, the CML was on the fifth floor.  Of this Building?  Of this building  Edmon Low Library . On the fifth floor there's a corner  up there, and I think that was the second place it was. I think it was  developed and started in some little glassed in enclosure. But of course,  Della Thomas was an aggressive, a gung-ho gal, and she outgrew that  space. And my understanding is that it was moved out of there because of  an asbestos problem.  That sounds right.  Then of course we were teaching library science classes here. The library  science students used it because it had all of the selection tools that school  librarians need and it was a laboratory. It really was. A materials  laboratory for teachers and students.  Did you teach classes yourself?  Roscoe Rouse let me teach Storytelling.  I bet that was fun, wasn   t it?  9  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Oh I enjoyed it. It was something I wanted to do. I liked to do it and it fit  in and the students actually did storytelling in daycare centers. And we  even did a few on cable television because I happened to have a friend  that was doing talk shows on a local cable channel and she let me have  some of my storytellers come down there. We had little groups of children  from some of the daycare centers.  I don   t think they do that anymore.  No I think it was gone when I left. (Laughs)  So what was campus like then? Do you have any memories of when you  here?  No, I think all I did was come to work and go home   and go to classes.  That was it, really.  Homecoming, did you do anything special?  Oh heavens no. You have to remember I had a family     Right     Though my son was actually at   he graduated from college while I was  here, he graduated from K-State  Kansas State University  and he was  working out in western Kansas. But I did have a husband at home. I had  to go home and get a week   s worth of cooking done for him.  So you had one child?  Yes, one child.  Let   s back up. I was going ask you about your first name.  Oh, my first name?  The story about Neysa.  Well I told you early on that I was born out in the middle of sagebrush.  My father and mother had homesteaded and there was a midwife that  attended my mother. My mother was absolutely sure I was going to be a  boy. And here this child was a girl and she had no names. One of the  neighbors that was a rancher   s wife and, well they were good friends,  knew Neysa McMahon. She was a portrait artist. She did portraits for  McCall   s magazine. I know you are far too young to know about that  McCall   s magazine, but it was an exemplary periodical. And she also was  10  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  a contemporary of Dorothy Parker, Alexander Wolcott, Moss Hart, and  some of those people in the New York roundtable. And she just told my  mother about the name, Neysa, and that   s it.  That   s very pretty     Mm-hmm. Thank you.  Donna  Schwarz  had asked me to ask you about a couple of other things  too, so we   ll switch gears a little bit. She wanted to know if then any  textbooks were a part of the collection.  Yes. One of the things that   Della did not have all that large of a budget,  but she had wonderful contacts. She was able to get a lot of review books  which helped build the K-12 collection. She also had a lot of professional  materials for teachers and librarians. And she was able to work out with  the textbook companies having textbooks sets here   sets of textbooks for  review and approval, because textbook companies wanted the school  administrators or curriculum directors   if it a was big enough school, to  evaluate the textbooks and use them in their schools. So she had this  library of textbooks. As far as I know they were all free. They were  coming by the time I was here. They were all freebies.  (Laughs) Those are always good.  Yes.  Okay and she was asking what your typical day would be like.  You mean in the CML?  Yes.  Well it just depended. We would schedule with the library science faculty.  The library science faculty was wonderful to work with. Their classes  would come in and then there were days that I had storytelling, and of  course there were always those meetings. I was on whatever it   s called the  council   Library Council. As a department head we had those meetings.  I spent a lot of time reading selection materials. The collection that I was,  of course, responsible for was so much broader than anything I had ever  dealt with in the public schools. When I was a high school librarian, it was  high school materials, and then I was pretty much responsible for the  development of the elementary library programs because we were just  beginning to hire qualified librarians for contact with the students, and the  high school teachers took their own. So, I don   t know why I remember  that. We did many of those little blurbs for all the books that we had in,  11  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  sent to the college of education faculty. Gee, do you know how long ago  that was?  You   re doing fine. (Laughs) You   re doing great   I do know I came to work everyday at eight o   clock.  At eight, and stayed till        till five.     till five.  Yes.  And they had faculty status then, too?  I had assistant professorship. That was primarily thanks to Della, I   m sure.  And well, I think things have changed a lot. Oh, what was it   I left here  in    73? That   s thirty-four years ago, something like that? A lot happens in  thirty-four years and all of it is not good.  Most of it is, I   d say. (Laughter)  So, well yes.  Did you have to interact with Roscoe Rouse very often?  Oh yes, oh yes. Roscoe was a good supporter. Of course as any  administrator he worked under a lot of pressure to please all of the  departments of the colleges of the university and the people that we  served. The library was open twenty-four hours a day. Yes it was, 365  days a year.  That doesn   t happen today.  No, I mean part of that was Edmon Low   s take on things because he  believed this was an important place for students to be all the time. But  Roscoe of course maintained that kind of a schedule. He had an excellent  staff, wonderful people here to work with, he really did. I enjoyed all of  them and there are not many left but Beth Holland, Jill Holmes and I,  because she was education librarian. I enjoyed working   and Heather  Lloyd. Of course we also had good times together too and Co-Ming   Chan  was here     She   s still here so maybe you can hook up with her today. Were you a  12  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  member of OLA, Oklahoma Library Association?  Oh, yes. I was also chairman of the Sequoya Book Award Committee, and  The Man in the Box was the winner of the Sequoya Book Award the first  year that I   well actually, I was only there two years because I left. I  managed to become chairman     Pretty quick     Well, really. But Oklahoma   s pretty open   The Man in the Box and  unfortunately I don   t remember her name.  Marylois Dunn  It   s probably  one of the few books that she wrote. She had been a school librarian and  this wonderful book was about a prisoner in Vietnam.  I don   t think I   ve heard of it, I   ll check it out.  Definitely.  When you started working in the public library, did you do storytelling?  Oh yes.  Did you do it yourself?  Well no, I had children   s librarians, but when they were on vacation, yes.  You volunteered quickly. (Laughs)  I enjoyed it.  That would be the fun part I think of being a school librarian, would be  storytelling.  Mm-hmm. Well of course our picture book collection was always  Caldecott awards and Caldecott potentials, and Newberry awards. Those  were the focus of our children and youth collection.  Your PhD was in Education or was it in     Education and Administration. No it was actually   well, I was here  because I was going to become the superintendant of schools, remember?  Right   right.  But the curriculum, I had several hours of curriculum and also had Paul  Johnston who was from the town where our farm was near, was my  13  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  curriculum instructor, and it was great working with him. He just  encouraged me to explore how the curriculum of a public school would  coordinate with a library program and all   so some neat things  happening.  Did you go through the graduation ceremony?  No. I was back in Kansas. I was working. I did have to take a week off to  finish my dissertation after I took my new job. I just absolutely wasn   t  able to quite finish it up. That part was probably a mistake for me to jump  in, because I was in the process of writing it. I did take, I think it was  about a week off to polish it up so I could get it published and then came  back to where I was.  And you were in your forties at that time?  No, I was older than that. Let   s see it was     Oh, no, forties were MLS.  Let   s see,    74. I finished in    73. I was fifty-one.  That   s even harder, to be that age and get a PhD.  Right and if people hadn   t given me a chance it probably would never  have happened   and encouragement, really.  Were you one of the few women in the program, or was it pretty  balanced?  I certainly was probably one of the few of my age. My study groups were  all men, especially in statistics, because statistics was almost a downer for  me. In fact we had a professor by the name of Means, who one day he was  looking at me, I know he was, saying,       that when people are past thirty-five  it is very difficult for them to understand the concepts of statistics.     That didn   t help. (Laughter)  And was he over thirty-five himself?  I don   t think he was quite there yet. (Laughter) Or maybe he was the  exception.  But you passed     Well, yes I did. (Laughs) And took two classes. The next professor I did a  little better under. He didn   t intimidate me as much as Means did.  14  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  (Laughs)  What did you do your dissertation on?  It   s a long title but basically it was to study schools in Kansas, school  systems that had school library supervisors. There were about twenty-six,  and those school systems with elementary library programs without a  supervisor, to see the impact on services and impact and development and  whether there were advantages of administrators. I remember one of the  conclusions was that there were better collections, better programs   I  mean having had administrators. But the direct services in the school  seemed to be better in those that didn   t have a library supervisor, but that  was one of things. The centralized services would speed up the processes  of collection or processing and we had to leave those things up to the  schools. We had centers that developed the materials a teacher needed to  have something created   laminated or created. We did that work in what  would be in the central office of the library supervisor position. Whereas,  in those schools that didn   t have that kind of a thing, the teacher or the  librarian in this case, would have to do all of that completely herself.  And did you make it to being a superintendent?  No   no. But that was fine.  No regrets?  No. I really didn   t mind at all.  Is this the first time you   ve been back on campus?  No, the last time I was really here was in    96 when the CML moved to  Willard. And I was back here in    97 for a wedding, but I don   t remember  that I came on campus. I don   t think I   ve been back here since then. At  least, I can   t recall any reason that I was back, so     Is your blood still just a little bit orange?  Oh yes but with KU  University of Kansas  and O-State playing, naturally  I   m just looking for the Cowboys to maul    em down.  I think how you ended up here is a neat story. Did you have a mentor?  On campus, or do you mean     Or before, either. Either one.  15  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  I had a lot of mentors, I really did. I had mentors in professional  organizations that encouraged me to be involved, and gave me many  opportunities. I had mentors here. I had mentors at Emporia State. I had  mentors in high school. I mean there was always someone who would  encourage me. I have a life long list of them.  You   re lucky then.  Yes, I am. And the other thing of course I think of, when doors open for  me   because I actually had an opportunity to become a   I was doing  consulting for the F. E. Compton Company. The University liked that,  you know, because I was representing the University, and travelling to  college campuses and education departments for F. E. Compton, who paid  the bill. It was just that I got to take some time off from the CML to do it.  They wanted me to come to work for them. And my husband and I went  to Chicago. I had a friend who was at Governor   s State University, who  was assistant vice-president, I mean he was second in command there, and  he was a friend of the family. Charlie  Neysa   s husband  went to talk to  them about getting a job with them. We would have had to sell the farm     well we wouldn   t have sold the farm. We wouldn   t have, because that  wouldn   t have been very practical. I came home, and I saw grass, and I  thought,    Why in the world would I want to move to Chicago? I would  never see a blade of grass again,    so I turned it down. And that was  probably, I think I had one more year here. I can   t remember for sure  when it was, but it was things like that.  And well, I told you Oral Roberts and there was another position out in  western Kansas that didn   t work out simply because the man who would  have hired me   it was a regional system. We have regional systems in  Kansas   became a state librarian and he called and cancelled he  interview. Well, of course months later I was on the library network  board, and worked with him very closely, and we   d always tease him  about,    Do you realize where I would have been       However, I did work  with him, so. And then it was just, it was a fluke, really it was kind of a  fluke because I didn   t particularly want to go to western Kansas. It was  just like when Nelson called me about this public library job. Before I  came here, the library position had opened up and my superintendent at  that time had said,    Neysa, if you want that job, you can have it, but it  doesn   t pay anything,    and it was an old Carnegie building     Cool. They   re nice.  Well yes, but he   s right, I didn   t want it. And then meeting Anne Hoyt,  because Anne saw the kind of thing I believed in, in libraries, the passions  I had, and my frustrations with some of the things that happened, those  restrictions and that sort of thing. She instilled in me this desire to try the  16  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  public library. I probably wouldn   t have without her. So Anne mentored  me in this. (Laughs) There were a lot of people that did. And Dr.  Sorenson was so good to me. I know a lot of people who had no idea how  they   I think they felt that he distanced himself from people. He was  dean of the College of Education, and here he looked at my record and  believed Alex when Alex said,    You ought to give her a chance,    and he  did. And when I had something I needed to discuss with him, the door  was open.  All those woven together have created        all of those        the end product.  That   s right. Good, bad it   s here. But people do make a difference in our  lives.  Yes they do.  I think one of the things we didn   t talk about was the importance of the  non-print collection in the CML, because this is when libraries are  emerging from being print centers into non-print centers, and how  important those non-print materials were. And at that time, I was thinking  about it because I was going to mention it today, although I think I  probably won   t   was if you were born in, well    60, you would have no  idea what the kinds of non-print materials were in those school libraries.  It was filmstrips, and slides and dioramas, tapes, records. We had records  on sex education, for instance. They were published by the Lutheran  Church   whatever it is that the Lutheran Church has that arm of  education, homemade materials. It was just the beginning of film coming  out. It was just emerging and look what's happened since then.  In the public library   s children   s department we had a toy library and of  course naturally we had early on the TI Computer 4K with all of these  little learning modules. We had those in the children   s library. That was in  the 70   s. You see, the PC  personal computer  didn   t really hit   except  for that   that was a PC, but which took basic programming and you had a  monitor and a keyboard and all of these learning materials. And we had  children by the hour.  Cable came in   we had access to cable and I remember one young man   Chris  we had who was a discipline problem in the junior high. His home  life was miserable. He lived in the public library days because he was  kicked out of school. And Chris would sit there and watch cable TV and  go over and play on the computers, and things like that, and never  17  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  disrupted anything in the least. Of course he should have been in the  school learning instead of being kicked out. But I   d give anything to know  what happened to him now. The last time I saw him, he came in all  dressed up in a suit, and he was about fourteen years old, things like that  that happened. Also we had a man who used to come in every summer  and buy his pants at the Goodwill and cut them off and sit there and sew  hems in his shorts. (Laughs)  In the library?  In the library, right.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  Brought his own needle and thread with him?  Yes, oh yes. We didn   t have to furnish needle and thread. (Laughs)  Well it   s a community center for sure then if people felt comfortable doing  that.  Oh yes. Of course I retired in    89 so it   s been eighteen years since I   ve  been there. It   s fun to go back and see that the print world   the world of  books is still alive in the public library. We have book discussion groups  there that will have thirty, thirty-five people, adults. We have youth  involvement in book discussions, book clubs, and of course the children   s  department has great story times and programs. We had a program for  adults, for parents, at the same time as children were at story time.  How big of a town is this?  Seventeen thousand. And all these things are continuing, or they   re  changing, and that they should. The library world is exciting. The few  school libraries I   ve been in the small communities, I   m always kind of  disappointed in the collections and being told,    We can   t afford these  periodicals,    and the emphasis on online searching, that sort of thing.  There's a place for both.  And it takes money to have both.  Well, sometimes it   s a cop-out. (Laughs)  Do you have any special memories from your time here? That you want to  make sure we get on tape? Any fun stories or anything that comes to mind  18  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  that     No. I think I   ve probably covered it. I mean we had great times at ALA   American Library Association  and OLA and     Did the library have social events?  I don   t remember that the library did, our little group did. We used to have  I guess what you   d call potluck supper events. We   d get together. We had  a little niche of Vicki Phillips. That   s before Vicki was married, and Jill   Holmes  and Heather  Lloyd , and     Vicki   s still here so maybe you   ll get to see her today.  Great. The younger set let me become a part of their set because they  were all considerably younger than I was. (Laughs)  Well you   re really easy to talk to, so I   m sure that was part of it.  Yeah, well they were open and that   s the important thing   people who  are open. And I like the campus, I do. I like being at college campuses. I  really did if I didn   t have to walk all those steps from the parking lot or  parking garage.  So where did you live when you were here?  I had an apartment over on Knoblock. I can   t remember the   it   s just  right over there.  Was it in walking distance?  Yeah, I left my car there. Got my car, which was practically brand new,  sideswiped in the parking lot one time, but that was about all the bad that  happened. Gas was only twenty-five cents a gallon.  And what was your salary then?  Oh, around  9,000.  Twenty-five cents a gallon? It was  2.69 this morning. (Laughter)  So, based on that I, if I were working I should have a salary of  90,000,  right? It would be ten times more? Wait a minute. It is ten times, ten times  twenty-five at least, it   s more than that. (Laughs)  Anything else you want me to ask or cover?  19  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Well, what kinds of things is it that you really want for this collection?  We   re just doing various things, people   s stories about being on campus  in different time periods to see how campus has changed.  Well, it has. Of course there are some other people I should mention, and  that would be Carolyn Croft-Baird, who was a delightful person with  whom to work. Nancy Amos     I   ve never heard that name   I haven   t heard that name either.  Carolyn Croft-Baird?  Mm-hmm.  Well Carolyn was teaching library science classes, and she then got her  doctorate here, and was very active in supervisory programs of student  teachers. She and her husband, John, did service education programs, I  remember things like, in Japan. She's going to be the   we   ll call it the  keynoter at the CML celebration this afternoon. Nancy Amos was head of  the  library science  department. She was one of those characters. Well,  you saw what you got. I mean she didn   t put on any airs, this was Nancy,  and this was what she believed.  So you interacted quite a lot with the faculty then.  Well the library science faculty was on the fifth floor. Library science  classes were taught up there, of course children   s literature, young adult  literature, cataloging. Anne Hoyt, who was the next director  of CML ,  was an amazing cataloging teacher. I mean she knew her stuff. Oh well,  all of the administration classes   selection of materials. Gee I can   t even  remember the other type of library science classes that were taught then. I  can   t even remember the one   s I took. But that was going on, on the fifth  floor, there were classrooms up there.  I don   t know much about the program, do you know when it stopped?  It was still going when I left. And I honestly couldn   t tell you, I mean I  knew it was phased out. And I   m not sure what was going on with it  behind scenes that brought that about.  Did the University of Oklahoma have theirs at that time?  This was an undergraduate program. It was an undergraduate program,  and there was very definitely a place for it. Of course, we had MLS  programs in almost every state. Denver had one, OU  University of  20  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Oklahoma , Emporia. Now I think Emporia, I don   t think Colorado has  one, I think Emporia is one of the few that survived an ALA accreditation.  I mean you could still have the program, you just wouldn   t have the  accreditation. But this was an undergraduate program and somehow I  think there   s still a place for the undergraduate program, because one  doesn   t have to have an MLS in every school library, or even every public  library. The small public libraries have a certification program for people  who don   t even have many college credits sometimes don   t have any  college credits. But it was phased out. Carolyn could tell the story. You  ought to interview Carolyn     It sure sounds like we should.  You really should.  I wonder where she lives now     Oh she lives here.  Oh, that would be easy to do then, okay.  John and Carolyn Baird, they live up    don   t ask me     That   s okay we   ll find them    (Laughs)  They live up that a way. I will see her at noon. We   re having lunch, I will  tell her.  So she retired from here?  She   s retired. Oh yes, and she remembers all of these people and all of  these things, and you know, she was here. I mean she tells me things as if  I   m supposed to remember them. I mean that was a wonderful time in my  life, but lots of things have happened since then.  It   s a stepping stone.  And I didn   t do much journaling then. I don   t know. I   m a sporadic  journaler but I do think that people should become journalers. I encourage  my younger generation, my grand-nephews, to journal. I have one who   s  doing a great job of it. He   s going to run cross country in the morning  at  OSU . But it is true, people who journal, keep track of things better.  Well I know it would help me, anyway, I forget a lot of things too. Okay,  the last question I usually ask people and it   s kind of tough on some, when  history is written about you what would you like for it to say?  21  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  She enjoyed living. I did. I enjoyed living and I enjoyed the people in my  life.  And seeing grass.  And seeing grass. (Laughs) Yes, I think so. I mean I have had a lot of love  from a lot of people, and I hope I was worthy of it.  I   d say you are.  Well, thank you.  I   ve heard stories that would confirm that, yes.  Oh  (Laughter) Gee, I have a good PR network out there don   t I?  You do.  Uh-huh, yeah, it pays. (Laughter)  Did your husband have a college education?  He had an associate degree, I mean he didn   t go to college he, of course  he graduated from high school in 1933, and went to a business college and  got one of the degrees of business colleges. And he had to come back to     he was in California. He had to come back to take over the farm because  his father was battling cancer. And he stayed with it, and he was a good  farmer.  One of the things that I happen to be doing today is talk about how  important it is to instill life-long learning, the desire for life-long learning  in students and the role of library media centers, or in this case the CML,  in doing that. I think of Charlie  Neysa   s husband  as one of the real  models of life-long learning because he constantly kept himself informed  in agriculture trends. And when he died, I still haven   t cleaned out all the  file drawers from all he   d kept   Kansas state extension pamphlets on  everything under the sun, (Laughs) from how to get rid of carpenter ants  to no-till farming programs. So, it is important. It isn   t necessarily  indicative of that because a person has a college degree they   re educated.  What kind of farming did he do?  Oh we had cattle and hogs and sheep and wheat and milo. I had little baby  lambs in my kitchen. In fact we have a movie when Terry was born when  we came home from the hospital. I   d been feeding three lambs, as best as  a pregnant woman can, and when we walked in Charlie was carrying  22  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Terry, and here come the three little lambs right behind us, running ahead  in the kitchen because they wanted to get their bottles. And Terry actually  bought two cars with his sheep projects in FFA and was a state farmer.  And he graduated from K-State  Kansas State University , and spent  fifteen years working for the Federal Credit System. But he always  wanted to farm, and he was in farming and after fifteen years Charlie gave  up. He had wanted Terry   he wanted him to stay in that corporate world,  where there was a salary and a pension plan, and you got off work at five  o   clock. Terry chose the nineteen hour days     I got here  Stillwater  about four o   clock Wednesday, because I was going  to see Carolyn, and I got this call on my cell phone    Mom, where are  you?       Well, I   m in Oklahoma.       Oh I forgot. I wondered if you could  move me from one field to another.    (Laughs) So then the next morning  the phone rings again,    Oh, I forgot you were in Oklahoma. I was going  to ask you if you       (Laughs) But it is soy bean crop and milo harvest  right now, and he has a lot of acreage, he has a lot.  He   s ended up at the family farm then?  Yes, he moved to the farm in    86 and we moved to town.  It   s stayed in the family a long time now, hasn   t it?  Yes it has. Charlie   s parents are the ones that acquired the farm.  How many acres are we talking about?  Terry farm   s about 2,000, I think something like that. I mean I could  figure that out, I don   t know how much of that is crop land.  Nineteen hours a day every day or just     Oh I think        during harvest and planting time?  Oh I think   oh it can be, when you have cattle, Terry has cattle. We had  cattle and we had hogs and we had sheep. Actually the day I was married,  we were, well that   s another story     That   s okay.  We were married on an Easter weekend because the minister     Nineteen what?  23  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Oh, well, no it   s another story, and it isn   t for taping. It   s a fun story. We  came to the farm, and the first thing we did was go to town and get 500  baby chicks, on my first day of marriage.  Forget the honeymoon, huh?  And I never did like chickens. I   m still not really fond of eating it, I do,  but of course I still smell all those chickens that we butchered. And I was  really a city girl. I had a lot to learn. Actually, I learned to drive a tractor  with what was called an  F-20 Farmall . It was a thing that scooped the  hay up, and Charlie had German prisoners working for him when I was  doing this because we had a satellite German prisoner camp in Peabody.  Oh, interesting.  I learned to drive and fly an airplane, and I learned to drive a tractor  before I learned to drive a car.  The airplane to do crop-dusting or just for yourself?  Oh no, there was a civilian pilot training program in college, and I was the  only woman in the first program, and that   s how I learned to fly.  And this was where?  At Emporia State.  Mm-hmm.  That would have been in    40? And I didn   t get a drivers license until  about    46 or    47.  So you haven   t been in a plane, behind the wheel in awhile.  No. (Laughs)  No?  No the last time I flew was in   I think was in the sixties.  Well still.  My son learned to fly and had a plane, but he never let his mother in it. It  was like he has a corvette and he doesn   t let his mother drive it either.  What prompted you to try to learn to do the plane work?  24  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Oh, this is another one of those mentors in my life. We had a woman pilot  instructor and she became a friend of the family. She was another one of  my mentors. I was a senior in high school and I wanted to be a pilot like  Ruth and the opportunity presented itself. They wanted to train these  young people to become civilian pilots, and that   s it.  And your parents were okay with you learning to do that?  Oh yes.  Encouraging too, that   s good. Anything else you want to say?  No. Well...  You can go on as long as you like.  Well I doubt very much it will help the collection as much as the rest of  them.  No, this is great   it   s women too, and it   s wonderful what you   ve been  able to do, being a minority in some cases like a pilot.  Well that   s another thing, a lot of these things happened at a time when  women were not given the opportunity to do things. Again, I was very  fortunate that I was given administrative responsibilities. There had been  an earlier period in public schools where women were elementary school  principals. Then that was not happening when I went into education. I  went back into education in    54. And it didn   t really start again until a  little after I would say probably in the seventies? It was almost in the late  seventies before there were superintendents in Kansas that were women.  And of course, the principals   it would have been the late sixties, early  seventies that there were more secondary women principals and now there  are quite a few secondary and elementary principals.  It   s probably still more     Oh yes, well it   s like it is in this country in which women are supposed to  have equal status. We are far behind other countries. Well, look at our  representation in state legislatures and at a national level.  That   s my other project that I   m doing     Mm-hmm.     women legislators in Oklahoma.  25  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Oh really? Oh wonderful.  We can talk a little bit off line.  It   s like Emporia State has Joyce Davis who was here. Even at local  levels, there are not as many women.  We   re going to change that.  One thing I remember about Oklahoma, it didn   t become a state until  1907, so many of the kinds of things that happen socially and politically,  they sort of have to metamorphose and grow and change. Where Kansas  had all those years ahead of it. There is something about, like a baby has  to grow up, a state has to grow up, and get confidence in itself, and when  it has confidence in itself then it will embrace these kind of changes. I  guess Oklahoma has a ways to go, this would be what?  It   s the hundredth year.  The hundredth year   Mm-hmm.  Where other states are celebrating one-hundred and fifty, well some of  them two-hundred, so. It was just something that I realized one day,  because when I came down here, politically this state seemed awfully  backward to me. I don   t mean to be critical of it, but it   s that   I didn   t  understand it. There was a lot of that old-boy crony-ism, and you know  that sort of thing, and when I realized the fact that, oh yes, this state is still  going through its growing pains. It   s still fairly new compared to what's  happening in other places like in Maine, which is one of the first to have a  woman senator, things like that.  We do have a female lieutenant governor.  Good.  This year.  Mm-hmm. I don   t keep up too well with Oklahoma politics. You   ve had  some women in Stillwater, haven   t you that were legislators?  There   ve been two.  Bernice     26  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Eberhard  Finchum  Shedrick.  Oh, because I knew her.  She   s still around.  Then I think you had some locally too.  Well, there   s Lee Denny from Cushing.  And then the interstate college campuses   are there any women  presidents?  In Oklahoma? I think maybe some of the smaller ones.  And, now your department heads here have been a good balance. Really.  Even when I was here, all those many years ago, there was a good balance  of women and men.  Well the dean of the library is a woman now, and she may be the first.  Well, they were all men. I think there were three. There was a Johnson,  and there     Ed Johnson was before she was     Right and there   s somebody and another man somewhere I think in  whoever this is.  Well, thank you for coming today and sharing your stories.  -------  -------
