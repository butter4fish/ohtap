 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Thursday, July 9, 2015, and we   re in Tulsa, Oklahoma,  interviewing Dan Winders. Dan is joining us as part of the Cowboys in  Every County oral history project. Thanks for joining us today.  Winders Appreciate it. I   m honored to get to do this.  Nykolaiszyn Dan, let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Could you tell me  the year you were born and where you were born?  Winders Yes, I was born in 1958, right here in Tulsa County.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your parents.  Winders My parents are both from Tulsa also. I believe they were both born in Tulsa  County but basically both grew up here in the Tulsa area. Both attended  Edison High School. My dad is, and always has been, an entrepreneur. He   s  been in so many facets of business and real estate and retail that just   he did  spend some time working for North American Rockwell back in the    60s  when the space program was booming. He was a quality control engineer for  North American Rockwell, which was really a big deal in Tulsa during the     60s space race.  My mother worked most of her life for Ford Motor Credit in their corporate  office, and then my parents actually split when I was very, very young. She  and her husband had their own company later in life that was called  Ameristar, that did industrial packaging supplies. They sold that, and  they   ve retired. My dad is still working, and right now he   s a land man, a  contract land man. He   s still going. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your early life growing up in Tulsa.  5  Winders Well, like I just alluded to, my parents split when I was very, very young. I  had a brother, and my parents were teenagers when we were born. My  mother had not graduated from high school yet. Kind of kids having kids  back in those days. I went to live with my grandparents after my parents  split, and my brother actually went to a foster home, Johnny and Esther  Custer, great people.  There was an attempt to kind of get reunited. My dad married another  woman, but we ended up living in the Tulsa Boys    Home for a few years,  not because we   d done anything bad, just because of our home situation. In  the Boys    Home, I will say, I made really good grades. I actually became the  spokesman at a really early age, and I used to do fundraisers for the Boys     Home, like at Southern Hills and the Mayo Hotel.  They would have, you know, charity dinners, and I would get up. They   d  put me in a suit, and I would speak and raise money for the Boys    Home in  the second, third, fourth grade. I am a businessman today, and people make  fun of me and say, well, I got my training early in terms of raising money  and giving speeches. (Laughs) At a really early age, I was kind of the  Shirley Temple of the Boys    Home.  Around the fifth grade, my dad remarried, and we actually moved in with  my stepmother and dad. It was Anne Pellegrino, and my dad is Bill Winders.  My brother and I, we had a family kind of from the fifth grade on through  high school. I attended Edison High School and my brother also, Steve  Winders, who   s now a police officer. That was kind of my early, kind of  getting from birth to high school very quickly. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Any memories stand out from your time in the Boys    Home, outside of being  their spokesman?  Winders I think it was, even though   it was hard, you know. We had chores and  things that we did. We learned a lot of early discipline living in a boys     home, in terms of getting up and doing chores and learning how to negotiate  and be in social situations with new people coming and going. I had some  boys that were really good buddies of mine, that we were really close. We  played softball, jumped on trampolines. I got exposed to boxing. I would  never want to do that, you know, as my profession. I mean, yeah, we had a  lot of good times, and I think I learned to appreciate comradery and social  fluxibility. Yeah, those were some things that stood out.  Nykolaiszyn Would you have interaction with your parents or grandparents during that  time?  Winders Typically, they would come see us on the weekends or we would go home  on the weekends. We   d miss some weekends, but for the most part, we were  6  there during the week to go to school. Then many weekends we would go  home and do things at home. It was a hard time. I don   t want to paint it as a  joyous picture. It   s tough to go through as a kid.  Nykolaiszyn Oh, sure, absolutely.  Winders You know, it was a learning experience.  Nykolaiszyn When your family was reunited, you   re going to high school. What were  some of your early activities that you were really drawn to during that time?  Winders Well, in high school, I was drawn, I was a wrestler. I started wrestling in  about the fifth grade. I was never that good. I sure was not of a talent level  to be, for OSU to come looking for me, I can tell you that, but it was real  important to my development and athletics and team building experience. I  had some great coaches, Ernie Jones and Ray Nunley, who were really good  wrestling coaches and really good with boys. Wrestling was a really  enjoyable part of my kind of growing up in junior high and high school.  Music was a big part of that, good old    70s Eagles and all of the good    70s  music that   s still on the radio to this day.  I had some really close friends, Booth Taylor, Charlie Doty, Blake Roads,  Zack Davis, Kirby Hunt, that were kind of a    stand by me    (you know the  movie Stand By Me), group of guys that I still talk to to this day. Still friends  with them and still talk to them this day. That was real important, and then  another interesting part of my high school experience was working at a  grocery store in town, Petty   s Fine Foods. That was my high school job.  That   s where I met a guy named Jim Corbett, who has actually recently  passed away, who became my roommate in college and is the reason that I,  is really the catalyst in terms of why I picked Oklahoma State is my Petty   s  Fine Food coworker and high school friend, Jim Corbett.  Nykolaiszyn While you were working at Petty   s, what were some of your job duties?  Winders I started out at Petty   s as a sacker, we called them, and in those days, you  sacked the groceries. We did have a lot of elderly clientele at Petty   s, so we  did a lot of carrying groceries out for big tips. That doesn   t happen much  today anymore, but almost everyone   s groceries got carried out or we  offered to carry them out. Especially Christmas time, we made a lot of tips.  Then I got promoted to assistant produce manager and learned how to make  the strawberries look good, get the lettuce just right, you know, pick out the  bad stuff, and keep the produce shiny so we could sell it for as much as  possible. (Laughs)  I kept that job even through college. I would come home a lot of weekends  and work on Saturdays. They had great hours because they were only open  7  on Saturdays nine to seven and closed Sunday. I   d just come home and work  nine to seven on Saturday. You do that four times a month, that gives you  some walking-around money. Since Oklahoma State   s only an hour down  the road from Tulsa, it made it real easy. My time at Petty   s, oddly enough,  was really a fun part of my growing up. Really fond memories of that.  Nykolaiszyn When you were working your way through high school, did you have  aspirations to attend college?  Winders No, because of my family splits. My mother was remarried. My dad was  remarried. My brother and I kind of got shuffled a bit. Really no one in my  family had ever gone to college. I have to tell you. I was a wrestler. My  family, we weren   t sports fans. We didn   t watch a lot of football. We used to  watch the OU-Nebraska game from time to time on Thanksgiving back in  those days, but I really didn   t know the difference between OSU and OU  when I was in high school. When people said OU, I thought they were being  lazy and leaving the S out. That   s true  I didn   t know that there was a  Stillwater. One night, Jim Corbett and I were approaching being seniors, and  he said,    Have you ever thought about going to college?    I said,    Well,  actually, I really haven   t.    He said,    Well, my uncle, whose name is King  Casey, is head of financial aids at OSU.    If you look that up, you   ll find  King Casey was, I don   t know his exact title, but he was definitely kind of  the head guy over financial aid at that time.    Thinks he can get us some  money to go to school if you   re interested.    My response was,    Sure     He  said,    Well, we   re going to, we   ll head up there next week.     We got in his car one evening. I was exhausted, and I slept all the way there.  I woke up, and I was in this city called Stillwater and at a guy   s house  named King Casey. It was a really nice house. He got us, you know, put to  bed and said,    We   re going to get up early and head to the university.    We  got up and had breakfast, and the next thing I know, I   ve got my first look at  a college campus. Never seen a college campus. He arranges for a tour, and  we tour around. We looked at dorms, and specifically Stout Hall had sinks  in the room. Jim and I said,    Wow  If we had a sink in the room, we   d really  be something compared to these other dorms. We   d have our own sink     We  had acne, both of us, and we had to use scrub and all this stuff. We thought a  private sink for a couple of guys with some acne was a better deal.  (Laughter) I   m not exaggerating that. We picked Stout Hall, if we were  going to get in this college.  I hate kind of this being in the record, but it   s just the truth. King had me fill  out some paperwork. There were no online programs back in the    70s. This  would have been in 1976. Said,    Hey, you need to take this home and have  your parents take a look at this and give their information.    They wrote a  note that said,    We don   t think Dan is serious about education, and we   ll not  support him financially to go to college.     8  I took my paper back to King because we made another trip back. He looked  at it, and he said,    Well, if you want to go, there   s this deal called the Lew  Wentz Foundation, and I think we can get you some money through the Lew  Wentz Foundation, given this, to go to school.    He did, and he said,    Now  you   re going to have to pass that ACT test.    I made a twenty-three, which,  back then, was good enough, and I did make an effort. I went to a training  class and got serious about taking the ACT test.  I didn   t do so well in high school. I graduated from high school with a 2.7. I  really wasn   t very serious about education in high school. I was busy  wrestling and listening to music and having fun, and I just didn   t take school  seriously. I loved Edison High School, which is where I went. It   s where my  dad went. It   s where my mom went. I went. My daughter   s there now, and  I   ve got a son that went to Edison. Lots of Edison High School in our  history. I took the ACT test, and I still have my, got in the mail an  acceptance certificate. It was very official looking, had a great logo on it,  and it said,    You have been accepted to Oklahoma State University.    I still  have that to this day, and it was a big deal to me.  My roommate, Jim Corbett, and I moved into Stout Hall, only there was one  catch. They had remodeled the basement of Stout Hall, and the basement  were all brand new rooms, brand new carpet. Even the bathrooms were  remodeled, and there weren   t any sinks in those rooms. (Laughter) We got  in Stout Hall but had to do our acne routine in public, in the bathroom.  (Laughter) Ah  I kind of lost track of the original question, but in terms of  kind of my path to OSU, the general question, that   s Jim Corbett, Petty   s  Fine Foods.  As fate would have it, it all worked out. I found myself enrolled and living  in Stout Hall, and it was the best, probably one of the best feelings. I used to  go to Willard Hall to eat in the basement, and I still remember the, just that  feeling of getting up in the morning those first couple of weeks. I thought,  you know,    I   m a college student. I am a college student  I   m not even  working     I   ve worked my whole life, paper routes, and I   d washed dishes  early. I   ve been working, working, working. I wasn   t even working  I was  going to college. It was really just a freeing, uplifting feeling that I had that  I   ll never forget those first few weeks of being a freshman at OSU,  especially based on what I   d been through.  Nykolaiszyn Absolutely.  Winders That kind of gets you up to, I   m at   .  Nykolaiszyn You   re at OSU.  9  Winders I   m at OSU, yeah.  Nykolaiszyn In the    70s.  Winders Yes.  Nykolaiszyn What was the environment on campus like?  Winders Well, you know, in the    70s, without social media and without the Internet  and without, you know, only landlines, I mean, it was really a social place  where people just got to know each other on face value. Who you hung  around with was just more than likely who was really in your proximity. I  mean, that was your networking, you know, people you met in class, people  that you met in the dorm. I just remember it being a very, you know,  easygoing, kind of carefree time.  Certainly there was no Vietnam War on. There was some issues with Iran  and the Ayatollah Khomeini, and there was some protests going on. I  actually made the front page of the O   Colly standing in front of a protest. I  really didn   t have anything to do with it. I was just standing there, and it  made it look like I was   I was just walking to class and stopped to look, and  I got my picture in the paper. (Laughter) There was no repercussions from it,  but I was like,    Wait a minute  I was just walking to class  I just stopped for  one second     (Laughs) That was the only sort of turmoil I remember  associated with that was when Iran had some issues, and there were some  students there and some protests. Honestly I didn   t even really understand it  at the time. I just stopped and observed it and remembered I saw two or  three of those things and thought about Vietnam and that that might have  been what that was like. I wasn   t a very political guy, so I just went on.  Other than that, it was just a   Terry Miller was our, I think he was a  Heisman candidate, and we had a decent football team. I learned to love  football, even though I   d never really been exposed to football much, except  a few high school games. My roommate taught me how football worked,  and I was like,    Oh man, this is a lot of fun     Then I think most importantly  is I turned over a new leaf and made the Dean   s Honor Roll every semester.  I graduated with a 3.6 in accounting, so I really knuckled down on my  academics. I would leave football games at halftime if I thought I needed the  study time. I really took seriously making those grades. Plus, I was paying  for it, so no scholarships and not much parental help at all. When it   s your  money and you   re borrowing and you   re running home on the weekends to  work, I really took making grades very seriously, as did my roommate. I  really was focused on academics a lot. I had great fun. Loved football  games, loved the campus.  10  My buddies in the basement of Stout Hall, we just had more fun than you  should have in college. Nick Wareheim and Ken Ridings, in particular, just  were the most hilarious guys ever and did crazy antics and stunts. No one  ever, nothing that hurt anything, nothing that damaged public property, but  just pulling shenanigans all the time. Then I moved to Willham, and it was  the same thing. We had eighth floor Willham. One of my best friends from  high school, Zack Davis, was on that floor, and we just had a great time. I  had great fun just with people and hanging out and laughing and going to  games and the Student Union. I was really focused on making grades, and I  actually got to the point I was tutoring people in accounting classes because  I just got accounting. I don   t know why, but I just kind of got it. People  would come to me and sit in my dorm room and I   d answer questions.  Now my junior and senior year, my roommate and I both got married, and  we lived in married student housing together, right next to each other. We  met. We had girlfriends. We   d been dating them for a couple years, and we  ended up getting married.  Nykolaiszyn While you were in college?  Winders While I was in college and moved to married student housing, and we  continued to have a great time  (Laughter) I walked to class (what a long  walk) and still met up with people in the Student Union. I got married, you  know, early, and that was part of my experience, too.  Nykolaiszyn How did you meet your wife?  Winders I knew her from high school. She was a Memorial High School graduate.  We did not stay married. We had two kids, and in the late    80s, we, as a lot  of kids from the    70s and    80s, divorce rates are about 50 percent. Nothing  tragic or really bad, it just, we didn   t stay married. Had two great sons, Josh  and Jordan. Jim and his wife (I think I mentioned Jim just recently passed  away), they were still married to this day, Sherry. It   s just how life goes.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk about how you selected accounting.  Winders Well, being a guy that really didn   t have a lot of family influence or  experience with how to select a college major, I was enrolling. I don   t know  remember where I was but in an administrative office. I was asked the  question,    What would you like to declare as a major?    I hadn   t thought  about the answer to that question until I was asked the question, and there  was a family that I was close to in town, the Davises, that owned a  marketing and advertising company. It was kind of like the    mad men    of  Tulsa, and I thought,    Boy, that sure is a fun lifestyle.    I look down the list,  and I saw marketing. I said,    I   m going to be a marketing major    just  because in an instant I connected into someone   s life that I knew that I  11  thought,    That would be fun to be in that business.    I looked down. I said,     Marketing.    I was actually enrolled as a marketing major my first semester  freshman. Of course, to be a marketing major, one of the requirements is  accounting, Principals of Accounting.  I enrolled in Principals of Accounting my first semester, and the head of the  accounting school was named Wilton Anderson. He was my teacher because  even though he was the head of the accounting school, he would always  teach at least one beginning accounting class is what I was told, just to kind  of stay close to the new students. I had the head of the accounting  department as my teacher, and all of a sudden, I don   t know what it was. I  just got accounting. It was just intuitive to me. I made A   s on everything and  didn   t really even understand what marketing was.  After about four weeks, I marched upstairs and said,    I   d like to change my  major.    (Laughs) They looked down. They said,    Well, yeah, anything  you   re enrolled in now   s going to count, so sure.    They rechecked the box,  and I became an accounting major because of my experience with Wilton  Anderson as my teacher and because I just got it  Like I said, later I ended  up tutoring people, would come to my dorm room and say,    Can you  explain this stuff to me?    (Laughs) I still don   t understand it, and I   m not an  accountant today. We   ll talk about that, but that   s how I got to be an  accounting major.  Nykolaiszyn It   s interesting you mention Wilton Anderson. Did you have any other  interactions with him?  Winders Yes. He actually was my advisor. Wilton Anderson was actually my advisor.  I got assigned to him once again, serendipitously, as my adviser, so yes, I  met with him. Those were my only interactions with him were as my  adviser. He saw my grades and was quite happy to have me in the  accounting school. Another skill set that some of my teachers did recognize,  even though I wasn   t a real serious student as I grew up in junior high and  high school, I   ve always been somewhat of a writer. I do have a letter that  when I took, after I   d taken a couple of composition classes, the head of the  English Department (I don   t recall his name) tried to recruit me to change  my major to be part of the English department because I just do have good  writing skills. I don   t have basketball skills. (Laughter) There   s a lot of skills  I don   t have, but I do have good writing skills to the point that they tried to  also get me to, in my freshman year, change my major. Wilton said,    I don   t  think that   d be a good idea for you.    (Laughs) I said,    Okay. I   ll stay here.     Nykolaiszyn Were you hoping to graduate and go become an accountant?  Winders For all you current OSU students that don   t have a plan, I didn   t really have  a plan. I wasn   t even sure exactly what you would do with an accounting  12  degree, but I did have, I was starting to pick up on that you could probably  get a job, that it   s a real specific kind of skill set and that if you had an  accounting degree, you could probably get a job. That gave me a lot of hope  and confidence, so I didn   t really have a plan. I was absorbing and learning  and listening.  Then by the time I was a junior (I think this is a really good story for,  historically), there was another important guy in the accounting department  named Milton Usry. He wrote the cost accounting book that OSU used for  years, and Milton Usry, in a cost accounting class when I was a junior, made  an announcement to, I bet he told a thousand students that there was an  accounting internship at the City of Stillwater and that an internship would  really help a person get a job if they had an internship. I   d never heard of an  internship. It seemed quickly intuitive to me that if you could get this  accounting experience before you graduated that, indeed, it would probably  help you get a job.  I had a grandmother that I was really close to who did go to college, and she  had been a schoolteacher in Marlow  Oklahoma . She did understand this  kind of part of getting prepared and to get a job. She said,    What you   re  going to need is a really good suit for this interview.    I went, and she got me  decked out with really a, at the time, wasn   t a cheesy    70s-looking leisure  suit. It was a pinstripe, pinpoint cotton shirt, silk tie. It would probably still  look good today. It was a very timeless, really high-quality suit.  I set up an interview with City of Stillwater, and Milton Usry   s son is  Wayne Usry. I don   t think I knew it was his son, but you know,    Okay.  You   re the professor   s son.    Introduced myself, and he asked me what  fraternity I was in. I said,    Well, no. I   m just lucky to be here. I   m kind of a  Stout Hall, Willham guy. That   s my fraternity.    (Laughter) He laughed, and  he told me what fraternity he was in.    Honestly,    I thought,    Boy, I   m not a  fraternity guy. I   m probably not going to get this job. I bet, you know, some  frat brother   s probably going to get the job,    but I did the best I could at the  interview. Well, I got that internship.  They must have announced that to a thousand kids, and I got organized and  went and signed up. They chose me. I had an internship at the City of  Stillwater, accounting internship, my junior and senior year. Well, now  going back to your question about what did I plan to do with this accounting  degree, the auditors for the City (now I   m really getting into the professional  side of my life), the auditors for the city at that time, was what used to be  called a Big 8 accounting firm. There were eight big accounting firms in the  world, and they were the silk stocking, kind of the ivy league of accounting  firms. Deloitte Haskins   Sells was one of those eight accounting firms, and  that firm was auditing the City. Well, because I was an accounting intern, I  got to do a lot of the stuff to help the auditors. I got to know the auditors so  13  quickly my goal became, as an accounting major at OSU, to get to go to  work for Deloitte Haskins   Sells, which I did. That was my first job out of  college, so I did develop a plan. Getting the internship that I learned about  through my cost accounting class, that was all instrumental in developing  that plan. It all started to become pretty clear to me that I needed to get into  one of these public accounting firms.  Nykolaiszyn Graduation time. Do you remember much about the day?  Winders Yes. Back at married student housing, I remember being in my cap and  gown. My grandparents, who, if you remember, I went to live with them,  they had always been a real consistent part of my life, and my dad was there.  They took pictures. I have pictures of that day, standing in married student  housing with my cap and gown on with my grandparents around me and my  dad and making our way to the Seretean Center, at the time, was where  graduation was held for the business college.  Yes, I remember, you know, getting dressed up, pictures taken, making my  way, going across the stage, and then that   s all I remember. (Laughter) I  don   t know what we did afterwards or what, but I just, yes, I remember that  day. It was a great day. It was a huge day for my grandparents, because  they   d been there and supported me through all these years getting to that  point. My grandmother, I got to give her a plug. Now this was the    70s, but  she would send me a five-dollar check and a little note in the mail every  week.  Nykolaiszyn Wow   Winders Every week, five bucks, check, little note. You cannot believe what five  bucks   in the    70s that was probably like getting twenty bucks today. It was  probably twenty dollars, like getting a twenty-dollar bill in the dorm room. I  mean, you know, you can do a lot with twenty bucks a week. I don   t know.  Even if it was equal to ten bucks, it still was a   She would send me that five  bucks a week and got me the suit, so she deserved to be there for graduation.  It was real sweet. It was a great day, and I did it right on time. Four years in  and four years out and a little student loan payment to go with it, (laughs)  but not too bad.  Nykolaiszyn Did you already line up your job before graduation?  Winders Yeah. I did go through the interview process. OSU   s really good about, you  know, bringing companies on campus. I interviewed with City Service  Company, and I interviewed with Touche Ross, which was another firm, and  Phillips Petroleum. I did other interviews on campus, but I   d gotten to know  the Deloitte people. Specifically, Bob Moglenicki and another OSU  alumnus, John Smith, liked me and helped sponsor me and get me into  14  Deloitte Haskins   Sells. It was kind of a no-brainer that I had this two  years of audit experience as an intern and that I could join them and be part  of the audit team. I did. I came back for the next two years and actually was  on the City of Stillwater audit team. Yes, that just made all the sense in the  world to me, and I was really thankful to have that connection.  Nykolaiszyn Well, kind of take me through your career because you   re in a different  place today.  Winders Yeah, yeah. I guess kind of hold onto your seat. This isn   t going to make  sense to you, but it   s been a very   this isn   t the story of my life because my  life   s not over yet, I hope, today. (Laughs) I got that first job with Deloitte  Haskins   Sells, and I was an auditor for two years and studied for the CPA   certified public accountant  exam and passed the CPA exam while working  for Deloitte Haskins   Sells. You know, you   re under some pressure to do  that, you know, to get with it and    Let   s get the CPA exam studying done  and get that under your belt so that you can be a public accountant.     I passed the CPA exam. I did that for two years. Then Wayne Usry, the guy  that hired me, who was the director of finance for the City of Stillwater, who  hired me as an intern, left to take a job in Grapevine, Texas, either Grand  Prairie or Grapevine, as the director of finance down in Texas, which left the  director of finance spot open. Now I   m twenty-three years old, but I got  approached to become the finance director for the City of Stillwater at  twenty-three years old. I went and interviewed with the city council. The  mayor was a pretty famous mayor. Her name was Christine Salmon.  She was the mayor, and I set in the council chamber and had all the  councilors talking to me. The city manager then was a guy named Larry  Gish, and he ended up being a state, I think House, representative later.  Larry Gish brought me in and said,    We think Dan   s a good candidate. He   s  had two years as an intern, knows our accounting system. He   s two years as  an auditor, so he   s got four years of experience with the City.    They  interviewed me, and they hired me.  I became the director of finance for the City of Stillwater. I had about thirty  employees. I was also the city clerk, legally. I was over municipal court,  utility billing, all accounting. I think that   s enough. I think that was it. I had  all these people reporting to me, and I looked like I was twelve. You can   t  tell from the interview, but I   m only about five six. I weighed quite a bit less  back then, and I just looked like   they hired me, and I did a good job  I was  on city council meetings every Tuesday night. I did budgets. I helped with  revenue bond and general obligation bond issues to finance city  infrastructure improvements.  15  I was responsible, Wayne Usry started it, but I ended up getting the financial  statements so that we got the first Financial Statement of Conformance  Award for financial reporting in the state of Oklahoma, which was a big deal  issued by the Government Finance Officers    Association of America. You  had to have your financial statements audited and statistics about the city  and history as a big packet. We became the first city to get that financial  reporting award.  I had a really great and successful career at a really early age and got a lot of  management experience. The other thing that I did was the City really didn   t  have a lot of computer systems, so I did a software search. The term used to  be I    automated    the city. Our general ledger used to be a big book. We put  all that online. We had some automation for utility billing back then, but  everything else was manual. For the most part, during my tenure there, I  brought in automation to city accounting records. Well, because of that,  another big twelve accounting firm, which was Coopers   Lybrand, had  started auditing the city, and they wanted me to become a municipal  government consultant for them. They hired me away from the City, and I  mentioned that I did get a divorce early in life. That was going on.  I moved to Tulsa and took a job with Coopers   Lybrand as a consultant,  primarily, not completely but primarily working with other city governments  now in how to improve their operations and how to improve their use of  automation in their city government. Then I ended up working a lot on  police and fire records. That kind of jumped over into police and fire records  systems. Well, I ended up doing more work in police and fire records  systems than in municipal accounting, and I became somewhat of a  recognized national expert in automated fingerprint systems, police record  systems. I did some public speaking on how to implement that, and I got a  job with the City of Oklahoma City as a consultant because they did a bond  issue to upgrade all of the city police and fire. They were building a new jail  and 911 systems, and consulting fees were pretty expensive.  I became good friends with the assistant police chief, Dave McBride, and he  said,    I think we just need to hire you. You can go back to work for them  later, but we can   t afford   we need you. We can   t afford, as a city  government, to pay all these big consulting fees.    I went to work for the City  of Oklahoma City as the director of public safety information for the police  and fire department, and my office was right next to the chief of police  office with the assistant chief.  We implemented a multimillion-dollar upgrade of all of the case tracking  records, the investigation capability, kind of like you see on television. If we  just had one little clue, like a butterfly tattoo on a hand, we could put that in  the system, and it would give us anything that we ever knew about a  butterfly tattoo and who that might be and who they were associated with. It  16  was really a sophisticated system. We successfully implemented that. Then I  went back to Coopers   Lybrand.  Now I really was recognized as a public safety system specialist. Worked on  other, Columbus police department, Tallahassee, Florida, police department,  helping them do all those kinds of things. Then we got into, we got, kept  getting requests to do business planning. A good friend, who   s now my  business partner here at my company now, which is BlueView, his name   s  Bryant Bynum. He was at Coopers   Lybrand with me. We started doing  these business plans together.  We did the business planning for, as the example, where Hard Rock Casino  is. There was a Cherokee chief, Wilma Mankiller. She   s real famous. We  worked for Wilma Mankiller on multiple projects, doing business plans for,  before there was even a bingo hall in Oklahoma. My partner, Bryan Bynum,  and I did business planning for Wilma for what is now the Hard Rock  Casino when it was just dirt and some other places and some hotels and  some other Cherokee industry kinds of projects. We got into more business  planning and forecasting, and I kind of moved away from the municipal and  public information and got into that.  Well, during that time, a recession had hit, the oil bust of the    80s, and kind  of changed the economy of Oklahoma. Coopers   Lybrand Tulsa was doing  some downsizing and moving people around. They wanted me to move to  San Francisco. Well, you can tell by this accent I   m an Oklahoma guy, and I  just wasn   t a West Coast guy. I had been working for Liberty Bank as a,  doing some systems planning work for them, and they hired me as a head of  strategic systems planning for Liberty Bank. I jumped into banking, but  doing the same sort of things I   d been doing in government and business  planning.  I got hired into the bank to work between IT, information technology, and  the business units like mortgage and trust and international banking and  retail banking so I could kind of bring together what was going on with  technology with different banking departments. I did that for about a year  when I got a call, a life changing call, from my old boss at Coopers    Lybrand. His name was Jerry Parker from Tulsa, and he had joined a group  out of McLane, Virginia, called BDM Technologies that was opening a  Denver office in technology consulting. He said he thought it was a really  good opportunity. Now Denver appealed to me. Skiing appealed to me.  Mountains appealed to me.  I had met my current wife now, Claudine Winders, and we had actually just  gotten married. I   ve been married to her now for twenty-three years, twenty-two  years. We got married and moved to Denver, and I went to work in  Colorado to help develop a Denver BDM Technologies office. BDM  17  Technologies was about a half-a-billion-dollar company. It actually started  in New Mexico but headquartered in Virginia.  They started this Denver office because there was this new thing called the  Internet that was developing, and there was a browser called Mosaic. It was  a governmental browser. It was the only browser, and there was actually an  alphabetical listing of websites. I believe the site was called  commercenet.net, and    Oh, here   s all the websites for companies that start  with A and blue hyperlinks on a grey background.    They handed me a group  of people. I had an MIT graduate that worked for me in my group. I had a  Cornell University graduate in my group, two top Colorado University MIS  majors, Chris Muldone and Todd McGuire. The other two were Theron  Reddy and Michael. The five of us got involved in the web when it was  really early, and US West Communications approached us about the need  for internal corporate communications.  My group of smart guys and I thought about using a browser, and we really  developed one of the first largescale intranets. It made Inc. Magazine. We  had a demonstration project called    The Global Village    where we  demonstrated how this would all work. We took it even further than that  within US West Telecommunications and actually started developing  websites and intranet sites and pulling legacy system data into web  browsers.  Then from there, developed some of the   then Netscape hit the scene,  which was the first public browser. I actually went to Netscape and met the  Netscape people. My team and I, all those people I mentioned, we started  developing some of the first leading strategic-level websites. We got some     best of net    awards and had some creative people, great programmers and  worked with Disney on some of first, Disney   s edutainment concepts. I  mean, this was all really new stuff, and the two browsers were Mosaic and  Netscape. I haven   t talked about years much, but this would have been 1993,     94,    95, and the web really started in    92, publicly. I really became an  Internet guy through this transformation. I   ve long since quit doing   I   m  still really good at accounting. I still get it, but long since quit doing  accounting work.  Another thing I haven   t told you about the dimension of my personality is  going back to my sophomore year at OSU, I developed the love of the banjo  and bluegrass. I drove my roommate crazy. I became a banjo player, and I  actually got some awards for banjo competitions.  Nykolaiszyn Did you pick it up at OSU?  Winders I did, in my dorm room. That little newspaper, I found a hundred-dollar  banjo in a little newspaper at Stillwater, and I went and bought this hundred-  18  dollar banjo. I got a book, and I just started learning to play the banjo. I went  banjo crazy. (Laughs) I almost hurt my grades because I spent so much time  learning to play the banjo.  Nykolaiszyn Did you just teach yourself?  Winders Yeah. I took some lessons later, four or five years later, from a guy in Tulsa  named Robbie, who   s still in the banjo business here in Tulsa, and I played  in a traveling family bluegrass group on the weekends for a little while when  I was at Deloitte Haskins   Sells. I would leave on Friday and get in a van  and go travel around and play at different places around Arkansas and  Oklahoma. I played banjo. I   m getting somewhere with this. Then when I  heard Stevie Ray Vaughan in the    80s, I kind of put the banjo down and  picked up blues guitar and took lessons from a guy named Mike Bruce in  Tulsa, who used to play for Bob Seger. He really taught me how to play  blues guitar. I   m not great, but I   ve had a band ever since. I still have a band,  and I still play. I had this creative side.  All of a sudden, now we   re back to Denver. The Internet   s new. We   re  developing band sites, and I kind of discovered my creative side, which had  kind of always been there, in music. All of a sudden, going back to that  marketing thing, I all of a sudden found myself morphing into a branding  and marketing guy because I wasn   t a programmer. I never have been a  programmer. I was always more, you know,    What   s the objective? What   s  the strategy? What   s the benefit that we   re going to get from this spending  on technology? How do we implement it? How do we change processes?  How do we change the culture so the culture accepts the technology?    and  all that kind of stuff.  Now with the web and being creative and getting things pushed out so  people would click on sites, I started discovering,    Well, maybe I am a  marketing guy. Maybe that was the right major after all.    I started  developing my ability to help think about and talk about communications  and marketing and messaging and users and how you target users and the  whole marketing approach that is really an important part of the Internet and  was early on. While I was at BDM, they went public. Went from a half-a-billion-  dollar company to a billion-dollar company, and I   d been buying  employee stock all along. I was really homesick, even though Denver was  great. My wife and I had a great time skiing. My boys came up to Denver all  the time, and we went hiking. We had a great time in Denver, and it really  expanded my horizons.  I took the money that I made from the company going public and came back  to Tulsa and started from scratch with a guy named Colin Lee and Trey  Orta. Trey didn   t participate a long time, but those two guys. We started a  company in Tulsa called Halo Enterprises Inc., and it was a website  19  company, for all practical purposes. We went in business in Tulsa. We  pooled our money together. We lived cheap, and we bootstrapped. Early in  mid-   96, a Tulsa website company called Halo Technologies, was what we  called it. We ended up raising money, going back to my Boys    Home days. I  ended up raising a couple million dollars from investors, and we bought  another agency called Fire Ant. We liked their name better, but we   re  always legally Halo Enterprises. We bought Fire Ant Technology,  incorporated their operations, and now we had this merger of marketing and  web, an early version of how you merge marketing and web. It was known  by the marketplace as Fire Ant Technology and Communications. We sold  that company in a transaction in 1999 for twenty-two million dollars, ten  million dollars in cash and ten million dollars in stock in 1999. December 5,  I think, was our close day.  I did okay in that transaction. I had a lot of investors that made more money  than I did, but I had a great experience. My bank account was better. I   ll talk  about that in a minute. That was really a successful venture. We sold our  company to a company out of Boulder, Colorado, called XOR, X-O-R, and  they took over the company. I had a five-year non-compete. I tried to work  for them for a couple of years, and I wasn   t crazy about that because by this  time I   d really developed an entrepreneurial bent to my personality and  working for the other guys was kind of tough for me. I only stayed there a  couple of years.  Well, unfortunately, the dot-com bust of 2000 happened. The stock that I  had in that company, the value of that stock went away. Like everyone else,  everything was overvalued, and they paid too much. The company went on.  It was bought and sold several times. I went on. They were still in business,  so I had a non-compete. Well, I got into the retail world, into something I  didn   t know anything about. It was called Action Industries Inc., and I  bought a small store and developed a small chain of truck accessories,  around work trucks, tool boxes, and hitches. I wanted to be   it wasn   t so  much about the product. I wanted to try my hand at retail. I   d always been  an accountant and a professional services guy. Well, it didn   t go so well for  me. I lost a lot of money trying my hand in retail, and when my non-compete  was over, I got back into what I   m good at, which is marketing and  branding and website development and digital marketing, which brings us  up to today.  I have BlueView with my partner Bryant Bynum, who is the guy that I used  to do the projects with at, back for Wilma Mankiller. He   s my partner in this  company today. He   s got an MBA from OSU. We   ve been friends and  partners now for, you know, twenty-five-plus years, and we   re ten years in  business as BlueView. I love coming to work. I love what BlueView does.  I   m still in, I   m in branding, marketing, web, digital marketing, but I   m  pretty darn good at measuring analytics and numbers and return on  20  investment, as it relates to marketing, because deep inside me, there   s still  an accountant in there. (Laughs) That   s kind of my career.  I cannot tell you how exciting that   s been. Were it not for Oklahoma State  University and having that college degree and having the great, positive,  believing the world was my oyster as I graduated, I wouldn   t have had this  rich, exciting life. Prior to the interview, anything that I   ve had, money that  I   ve lost, things that haven   t gone right, have not been bad luck. I   ve just  been a risk-taker. Some things have worked and some things haven   t, but  most things have worked. From that standpoint, it   s been good.  Nykolaiszyn What a very interesting circle of events   Winders It is a very interesting circle of events, yes. (Laughter) I couldn   t make that  up if I tried. It   s like a jigsaw. It   s like buying a jigsaw puzzle that you say,     Wait a minute. There   s four different puzzles in here. How am I supposed  to make a jigsaw puzzle out of this?    You just do. (Laughs) That   s my  career story.  When I go back to the OSU campus and just walk around on campus, I just  absorb what that four years enabled, as far as my ability to strike out and,  you know, live and die by my own sword. Had it not been for those four  years invested at OSU, wouldn   t have happened for me. I know there are  stories of people with an eighth-grade education that ended up being  millionaires. I know that, but for my story, without Oklahoma State  University, I wouldn   t have been prepared for any, I wouldn   t have had any  of these opportunities.  Nykolaiszyn Has your time at OSU impacted your Tulsa community in any way?  Winders I would say yes, in this sense. I don   t have the statistics, but compared to  Oklahoma City, there are a lot of OSU graduates in Tulsa. I think what  really impacts it is that there   s so much comradery and familiarity in the  business world. You always end up sharing, you know,    Who   s your alma  mater? Who do you root for, TU, OU, OSU? Are you from out of state?    It  has impacted me that I have a long list, even though I didn   t go to college  with them, I have a long list of current friends, business associates that are  all OSU alumni. Dr. Rausch Masu, that   s at OSU-Tulsa, is one of my very  best friends and is always, you know, helping me meet people and inviting  me to things.  Mark Faro is another one of my, he   s a big OSU alumni donor, you know,  bleeds orange. It   s just the comradery of the people that I meet and know  from OSU and the transferability of understanding each other and the  experience that we had going to OSU. I don   t know if that   s a great answer,  but that   s really, you know, the satisfaction I feel. I have great OU friends,  21  and we hire a lot of TU people here. Those are great schools, too, but as I  meet people, I just enjoy the comradery of all of the OSU alumni that I meet  and work with to this day that live around Tulsa. It   s just a little extra special  feeling, I guess I would say.  Nykolaiszyn Do you feel that OSU alumni have, they kind of have a different feeling  towards the university in terms of loyalty?  Winders I believe that kind of like coffee shops, you know, coffee shops all have  different personalities. They all have good coffee. They all have, you know,  different, varying degrees of good experience, and I think universities are  like that. You know, as it relates to drawing a parallel between coffee shops  and universities, I mean, OSU is just a, continues to this day, and I think the  alumni feel that there   s just kind of a special friendly spark, an aura that  surrounds OSU and being an OSU graduate. It   s still a super friendly,  accepting, you know, it   s just not a snobby place.  It   s just a real, you know, anyone from any walk of life, rich, poor, we don   t  care. If you   re about the orange and the black, we   re about you. If I meet  you and we didn   t go to college together   I think that the alumni of OSU,  my experience is there   s just, gosh, there   s just a deep, deep held fondness  for that orange and that black and that association and any icons that you can  be a part of to tell other people that you   re part of it. I sense there for me and  for all the people I know just really deep loyalties surrounding OSU. I don   t  know. I   m sure it   s that way with other colleges, but I feel it   s really special  and unique at OSU. I do.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your children.  Winders Okay. I   m very proud of my children. I have a thirty- four -year-old son  who went to OU. He got an advertising degree. He   s a great family man. He  went to work at CarMax. Well, first he went to work for Enterprise and  quickly became a manager at Enterprise. He managed two stores at  Enterprise. He rose to management ranks quickly. Then he moved to  CarMax and became a manager, a car buyer. Nothing wrong. He   s never  sold cars. He   s always been in kind of the executive management side,  decision making side, and worked at CarMax.  Then he got hired by the Nelson Nissan Mazda Auto Group, and he   s an  executive at that company over large parts of their operation, making  decisions on inventory and conditioning and warranties. He makes very  high-level executive decisions and is a part of their top, top-level executive  team, and they own properties between Kansas and Oklahoma and  Tennessee. He   s part of the executive team there. He   s a really successful,  sharp guy. Has the same haircut as I do.  22  My other son is, his name is Jordan, and he   s thirty-two. Actually, I got to  get ages right. Oh my gosh, thirty-two and thirty-four. He   s thirty-two. They  have these birthdays that move around on me. I can   t believe they   re getting  that old. He just graduated from OSU in May with an aviation management  degree, and he went to OSU for a couple of years. Unlike me, he wasn   t  quite as serious about his academics. He went to OSU. Had a great  experience. Lived at Willham but opted to go the Navy for five years. He  was in the Navy for five years. Served in the Navy. He   s still in the National  Guard and he   s going to do his twenty years, but went to OSU. Navy paid  for that. Got his aviation management degree.  He had experience working on F-16   s in the Navy. Now he   s got the actual  hands-on mechanical experience in the Navy aircraft area. Now he works for  Omni Air International, and he   s a manager over safety for internationally  chartered flights. He   s a manager in their safety area. He got an internship.  He was an intern there first, and they   ve hired him full-time. His aviation  management career is off to a full swing.  Both of them are just, they   re off my payroll and doing great. Then I have a  seventeen-year-old daughter, Sarah, who is getting ready to be a senior at  my other alma mater, Edison High School, which I   m also very, very fond  of. Sometimes I don   t know whether to wear green or orange. She is also  planning to go to OSU in the fall, and her interest is in music business. She   s  kind of figuring what that looks like and going to be talking to some  advisers and figuring out how she helps develop that career through  Oklahoma State. Got three great kids. Just couldn   t be prouder.  Nykolaiszyn I will say that you do mention that you live your life, your business, social  media, and I   m pretty sure I came across your Twitter account.  Winders Oh yeah   Nykolaiszyn I want you to tell me the name of your dog.  Winders Our dog is Roxie. Oh, no, my son   s dog is T. Boone Pickens. Is that the one  that you saw?  Nykolaiszyn I don   t know. I saw some interesting dog names. I wasn   t sure. Did you have  an Iba?  Winders Then we have a dog named Iba, yeah. My son Jordan, that just graduated  from OSU, has a chocolate lab, T. Boone Pickens, with his own website. He  takes pictures of just the dog at the stadium, different locations, watching  football. The dog, T. Boone Pickens. I   m surprised he hasn   t been contacted  for any kind of copyright infringement. He has a dog, and we just call the  dog Boone. Then on the other scale, he   s married to Katie, who   s also an  23  OSU fan. He and Katie have Iba, and Iba is a little mixed dachshund. They  have T. Boone Pickens and Iba, and they   re quite active in and out of my  Twitter account. Yes, those are dogs, not people. (Laughs) Shows how deep  our roots run and how excited we are that we name our dogs such names.  Nykolaiszyn I was wondering if there was a little bit of a connection there. You know,  one could only assume. (Laughs)  Winders Historically, I have to give a plug to my other daughter-in-law, Sarah. Have  two grandkids now, Everet Allen and a granddaughter, Sarah. They   re a  little boy and a little girl. They   re super cute. I wouldn   t want them to be left  out of this. I am a grandfather now. I know I look twenty-three, but I   m a  grandfather now.  Nykolaiszyn As we wind down, I think before we turned on our recorders today you  mentioned a little something about your roommate. I know you   ve spoken  about your roommate. Could you just share a little bit about your roommate  for us?  Winders Yeah, my roommate was Jim Corbett. In college, he was Jimmy. When he  got older, he became Jim. He   s the one that I worked with Petty   s that just  said,    Hey, have you thought about going to college?    Actually, he helped  me get in college, and I want to tell very quickly. When Jim graduated from  college with his accounting degree (he had not had an internship), he had a  hard time finding a job. He was actually working at a convenience store,  with an accounting degree from OSU, called Get-n-Go, which was kind of  like a QuikTrip, and was having trouble finding a job.  Well, if you remember, I started at the City of Stillwater only, actually about  eighteen months after I got out of college. I did that stint with Deloitte.  Audited the City for a couple of years and then went to work for the City,  and there was an airport accountant job open. My friend, that I still talk to  and know, Pete Vanpelt, was the Stillwater airport director, and he had an  airport accountant job open. It didn   t pay much, but I called my old  roommate, friend, Jim, that was responsible for getting me to college. I  thought,    Well, this is my chance to do something and help him get his first  job.    I was glad to get that opportunity. He   d done so much for me.  Connected him with Pete, and he became the airport accountant for the  Stillwater Municipal Airport.  He then became the internal auditor for the City, and he stayed at the City  for four or five years, at City of Stillwater. Then he got hired as an  accountant for Glendale, Arizona, and he went there for a couple of years.  He was homesick, and the city of Moore, Oklahoma, hired him as the  finance director of City of Moore, Oklahoma. He stayed there for twenty-six-  and-a-half years as the finance director for City of Moore. He stayed in  24  city government. He kind of helped me get a college degree, and I feel like I  helped him get started in his career.  Unfortunately, on July 4, I got a call from his brother. It was very sad that at  fifty-six years old he dropped dead of a sudden heart attack. Woke up at five  in the morning with chest pains. Told his wife that he needed help, and they  rushed him to the hospital. Even did an emergency open heart surgery, and  about two-and-a-half hours later or so, he was gone. I   m a pallbearer in his  funeral tomorrow. Sometimes stories come around full circle, and that   s a  sad full circle for me. I   m going to control myself. I   ve shed tears over that.  He was really an important part of my life. He   s a good guy.  Nykolaiszyn We   ve kind of did a very quick fast-forward through your life so far. Is there  anything else you   d like to mention, anything we left out?  Winders I don   t think so. I don   t think so. I think I   ve hit all the major high points.  I   ve got my wife, Claudine, and great kids. I have gone to church most  Sundays. I   d like to throw that in there. I think that   s helped me. (Laughs) I  started out life probably a little perplexed as a kid in the Boy   s Home, but  it   s all worked out. OSU was a big part of that. I   m very honored to get to be  part of this record. I hope I   ve given enough information on the campus and  Stillwater and what it was like. As a child of the    70s, that was my  experience.  Nykolaiszyn Dan, thank you very much for joining us today. We really appreciate it.  Winders Thank you very much.  -------  -------
