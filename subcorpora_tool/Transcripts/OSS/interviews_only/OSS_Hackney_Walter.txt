 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Saturday, June 13, 2015, and we   re in Omaha, Nebraska,  interviewing Walter Hackney as part of the O-State Stories Oral History  Project. Walter, thank you so much for joining me today.  Hackney I   m happy that you   re here, and I welcome you to our home and to Omaha.  It   s a pleasure having OSU up here.  Nykolaiszyn Absolutely. Well, let   s begin by learning a little more about you. Could you  tell me the year you were born and where you were born?  Hackney Okay. I was born in 1937, August 8. I was born, actually, in a small border  town to Oklahoma called Coldwater, Kansas. Our little farm and little ranch  that I grew up at was in that small   when I say small, Juliana, it was a one-house  town, and we got fresh bread once a week at our hometown. That was  the way   that was our big name to fame. It was called Lookout, Oklahoma.  It was northwest of Alva, Oklahoma, about fifty, sixty mile out there. I was  born and raised there. I went through fifth grade in a one-room, country  schoolhouse that had all grades through the eighth grade in that one room.  At the fifth grade, I got transferred to the big city of Freedom, Oklahoma,  and from the fifth grade through the eighth grade, I went to school there in  town, they called it. Then my parents moved into Alva, Oklahoma, and I  went through high school at Alva, Oklahoma, as I also did my first two  years of college at Northwestern  Oklahoma  State  University  at Alva. At  that point in time, I was encouraged to go to Oklahoma A M, at that time  and see if I could qualify to be on a livestock judging team that had gotten  some good notoriety through the nation under guidance of Dr. Robert  Totusek. I applied down there and was fortunate to get accepted. I finished  my college, then, at what became Oklahoma State University.  5  Nykolaiszyn Well, before we get to your OSU years, I want you to back up a little bit for  me and tell me about your parents.  Hackney My mother was of Indian heritage, and she was born and raised in a small  town called Scobey, Montana, on a Indian reservation up there. Her family  migrated to Lookout, Oklahoma, and homesteaded out there. My father   s  family came over from London, England. He, in fact, was the only sibling in  a large family that was actually born in the United States. He and the family  also left a town in Kansas where they were sponsored. They moved to  western Oklahoma and homesteaded out there at Lookout, Oklahoma. My  background, then, is my father was a rancher and a farmer, and he had a  limited amount of college experience at Kansas State University. Through  the finances, of which he wasn   t capable to continue, he had to leave the  college, which, over the years, he was very verbal about his college  experience and how he wishes that he would have had the chance to finish.  That was always kind of a promotive force behind myself and my brother  and my sister that if nothing else we needed, probably, to finish our college  because of the pride it would give our father.  Nykolaiszyn Your early years, before your family moved to town, I   m assuming you grew  up on the ranch, the homestead.  Hackney That   s correct.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your chores growing up.  Hackney Well, as growing up, and up and including my time as a eighth grader in  grade school, I did the normal on-farm chores of that era that most of the  young people did. We had a few milk cows, and part of my responsibility  was to help milk the cows every day. We had a few hogs, and my father  made sure that we had plenty of pork stocked away in the winter for that.  My job there was partially my responsibility to take care and feed the hogs,  along with my brother and my sister. Then we had a cow-calf operation  there on the ranch. That was always my big, big desire, was to be able to  spend as much time as a real young youngster with the cattle out on the  pastures and during the winter, feeding them closer in on the winter, feeding  and that type thing. I thoroughly enjoyed that. I   ve always felt like, even as  we speak, that was promotive enough that that probably made my career  pretty easily come by, was my background in regard to the cattle. Then as I  progressed through my school, almost all of my activities revolved around  livestock. In the schools, I showed calves, I showed lambs, I showed hogs in  4H and, again, in FFA. I was extremely active. It was my luxury, that a kid  from a background such as we had, that was my luxury to be able to go and  become involved in those activities.  Nykolaiszyn Did you ever attend 4H Roundup as a youngster?  6  Hackney The only thing I can respond to that question is every summer I can recall, I  had two or three days that our local 4H chapter went to a place in Oklahoma,  out northwest Oklahoma. I believe it was Cleo Springs. They had a summer  camp there for 4H Club youngsters, and I can remember going. I can   t say I  enjoyed it because I was horribly homesick all the time. I wanted to get back  home, which was only two or three days. As far as any other activities, those  had to wait until I got into FFA. When I got into FFA in high school, then I  became deeply involved in the activities, even into some of the political  activities, of the Future Farmers of America. One of my failures that I   ve  always regretted is I tried and tried, and my dad and my mother worked like  Trojans to help me prepare a application to become an American Farmer  Award in FFA on a national basis. Needless to say, I didn   t qualify, but I put  together (they helped me) a mountain of material, photographs, and letters  of recommendation. It didn   t work. I didn   t get the honor.  Nykolaiszyn Well, you started your college education in Alva. What were you studying in  Alva?  Hackney Agriculture. Everything I seem to have done dovetailed itself into some  form of an ag-related career ultimately. There   s a reason for that, Juliana.  When I was fifteen, there was an enormous epidemic of infantile paralysis  called polio. I was one of, I think, two in the whole city of Alva that  contracted it. I vividly recall out on our ranch on Thanksgiving day in the  fall of, I think, 1951, I think it was, I was with a group of friends hunting  quail. The next thing I can recall was about six weeks later, I woke up in the  hospital in Alva, Oklahoma. I   ve never been able to tie anything together in  the middle. What it was, they thought initially, that I had a huge case of the  flu because it was an unknown, really, for any of us out there. Then they  finally diagnosed it as polio, and I went through the iron lung  briefly, for  two weeks .  I went through Hot Springs, Arkansas, therapy; Warm Springs, Georgia,  therapy. At Warm Springs was the one that helped the most. That was the  Sister Kenny Foundation, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had formally put that  together. I went in there with arm braces and leg braces. I came out of there  with only one brace, on crutches, and that was a moral victory for me.  That   s also why I was academically a very average student. Athletically, I  would have made a career of athletics, but this took care of that. I had the  choice of being into some form of industry because I could never have gone  back home, if you will, physically and done the work that was necessary to  run a ranch and to take care of things like that. I did, and I concentrated  expressly on that avenue. My instructors seemed to all know that because  without asking, they would make it applicable that I could pick up anything  I wanted in regard to an agricultural background, and they would help me  promote it and learn it and understand it.  7  As that all dovetailed, then, it became livestock. Fortunately, I was on a  winning livestock judging team as a youngster in high school, and we did  quite well. As a result, my instructor at Alva, Oklahoma, was Dr. Leo  Brandt. He was a Dr. Totusek of Northwestern, and he   s the one that  encouraged me. He said,    Walt, you really should go to Oklahoma A M  because you have a inbred talent here that could get more approach in your  liking at Oklahoma than you will here.    It was a nice thing, and it was a nice  recommendation. I was accepted, highly cordially, at Oklahoma State. One  of my very, very first knowledgeable things I can really recall was Dr.  Totusek. I can honestly give you very much background and history of my  other instructors at Oklahoma State, but everything I did seemed to pertain  to something that he sponsored. As a student, I was very impressed,  obviously.  Nykolaiszyn How did you get from Alva to Stillwater?  Hackney Well, I made an application to go to Oklahoma A M to school, and in those  days, it wasn   t as demanding for a student to get down there as it is today. In  my case, it was fairly simple. Dr. Brandt from Alva, Northwestern, took  myself and my parents, and we went down to Stillwater. He went to the old  animal husbandry arena where the offices were of the agricultural group,  except for ag education. That wasn   t in there, but it was the livestock part of  it. They all knew him, and he introduced me around. He made it very clear  that I wanted to come there, and then he made it very clear that I would  really appreciate getting to meet Dr. Robert Totusek. Dr. Totusek became  available to us there that day.  In his own way, we could not have been made more welcome. My dad and  my mother made the comment, they said,    You   ve got to come here. This is  what you have to do because there   s a good future for you here.    Then it  migrated from that into some intensive classroom work, but I was mediocre,  to say the least. I was only mediocre, but I made passable grades. I always  was waiting on, when we started, the livestock team workouts because that  became, that was a challenge for me was to make that team. That would  have been, then, as a junior, if you will. I was highly lucky and very  fortunate, and I made that team. As a team, then, we stayed totally together  and extremely successful as a junior and senior, one of the real national  champion livestock judging teams, actually, and all due to Dr. Totusek.  Nykolaiszyn We   ll get to your livestock judging in a second. When you came to  Stillwater, where did you live on campus?  Hackney I lived off campus. I couldn   t afford   I was there on a vocational  rehabilitation scholarship due to my polio, and they sponsored me there.  That was a political appointment by a politician in our area of Oklahoma,  8  Dr. Lewis Kamas. He sponsored me down there. I didn   t have enough  money to live on campus or in a fraternity or anything in that regard, so I  lived in a garage, above a garage, down on South Washington Street in  Stillwater. If I recall correctly, it was Third and Washington, and it was right  there in a lady   s garage up above. Was in a small apartment, small. Was one  room. That was where I lived.  Nykolaiszyn Did you have a job while you were going through OSU?  Hackney No. No, I didn   t for two reasons. It took all of my attention completely to  concentrate on having a reputation as in the livestock industry to start with  as a career when I left Oklahoma State. That was one reason. Second being I  was still on a full leg brace and a crutch. It   s simpler today for a  handicapped person to get into about any form of activity they want to.  They   re acceptable. In those days, it was harder to get a job, if you will,  Juliana. During the summers, I had a job, a good job. I had a family in my  hometown that had wheat combines. We would take those combines to  North Texas in May just before school was out in the spring, and we would  cut wheat from West Texas, up through West Texas, up through eastern  Colorado on into western Nebraska, on into Wyoming and Montana, and  then come home in September. That was a 24/7 job, and my job was either  running the combine or driving a truck. Now, being handicapped to a  degree, that wasn   t hard to do. That was pretty simply done. That was what I  did, and that was my job all the way from high school through college, every  year in the summertime.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk about the livestock judging team. Tell me a little bit about your  fellow teammates.  Hackney It was probably the most unforgettable (and it has been the most  unforgettable) experience a young man who was really committed to a  career as I was. It was unbelievably satisfying. On the workouts, there  would be, maybe, ten or twelve individuals who had similar wants and  desires as I did. Then you had to qualify through formal workouts. We  would take those infamous Oklahoma State vans, and we would travel all  around to purebred-sheep breeders, purebred-hog breeders, purebred-cattle,  purebred-horse breeders. We would have formal workouts, and Dr. Totusek  would set up classes of those respective species for us to judge there at that  place all weekend long. It was a grilling deal. We   d judge them visibly, we  would place them, and then we would stand in front of him individually and  give reasons why we had placed the cattle or hogs or sheep or horses as we  did. My classmates, there wasn   t one of them I ever considered that I was  better than. Every one of them I envied.  Now, when it come time for us to go to Fort Worth, Texas, Houston,  Chicago, Kansas City, Denver, when it come time for Dr. Totusek to pick a  9  team, he could take a team plus one alternate. You just sweat it out, if you  will. I was so fortunate to get picked as one of this team. Now, that wasn   t a  solid deal for you. You had to requalify after you came home from  wherever. Then until the next contest, you had to requalify, and so you just  were continually sweating it out if you were going to or were not going to  make this team. As it turned out, I was so fortunate. I always in my private  time wondered,    Am I qualified? Was I really qualified to be on this team,  or was it kind of a sympathy vote?    I would never ask the question. No one  ever brought it up, and my friends that were in the team never once  acknowledged any of that. We   d get somewhere, and if there were steps that  had to be conquered or if there was luggage that had to be carried, if I was  slow, which I   m always slow, they were always right there behind me  carrying the material that I should have been carrying. It was that kind of a  relationship. After we graduated, after intense two years of livestock  judging, our relationship is exactly as binding now as it was then.  We   ve lost some of our fellow teammates, but the ones that are still able, we  are highly active at the animal science reunion at Oklahoma State now,  every April. We have a huge time down there for three days, and it   s one of  my real highlights of my year is to be able to go there for that. The others  seem to feel the same way, the other guys. In those days, there were no  ladies, women on the team, and I always questioned that. I wondered why.  Well, it was pretty obvious. There wasn   t any ladies in the workouts, for  instance, trying to qualify. Well, that answered my question. I never  wondered,    Why wasn   t there some there?    They just weren   t there. Now  going back, I can see those young ladies up there, and in many cases they   re  the leader of the teams, the livestock judging teams. I thought,    That   s  wonderful.    That is so progressive for the college to be able to do that, and I  know that that   s noticed by a lot of people. None of my teammates have  ever mentioned it. It   s never come up, but we all sit there during the  banquets and so forth, and all of us admire the fact that those livestock  teams they introduce are made up of ladies and men, both. There   s no  differentials, and that   s what I like.  Nykolaiszyn Well, tell me about the national championship year.  Hackney It wasn   t by accident, Juliana. We were grooming ourselves for that. We had  talked and talked and talked in our private time, never in front of Dr.  Totusek. We felt a little bit intimidated to talk about it in front of him. As a  team, when we were in, maybe, Chicago, maybe wherever, as the year  started, we knew what was in front of us if we were the same team at every  contest. If we qualified that way, we knew our goal was to win every darn  one of them. We started out, and we did. We won the international; we won  the American Royal; we won Fort Worth; Houston. It was one of those was  unbelievable experiences that a young person like me will ever have. You  just never forget it. To say,    What was it like,    I can   t describe how if you  10  were on a baseball team and won the World Series, what was that like, or if  you were a national champion football player, what was that like.  I don   t know. I know that it was a pride thing, but it was a thing that we  never bragged about, if that   s a proper term. We felt that we   d earned it. We  knew that our abilities had been recognized by our superiors because part of  that judging, the classes that we were subjected to at each of those contests  put a final placing on each of the classes by a national, well-known expert in  that field. We respected and honored his or her opinion. We knew that when  it come time, that contest was going to get won or lost with our ability to  express oral reasons. That   s where you sweat blood, if you will, as a young  guy. We had our notes, and we   d sequester ourselves individually off in the  corners of some huge coliseum somewhere. At the same time, there would  be a person as nationally recognized as Dr. Totusek. He would be sitting  over there in a chair, and when your turn came, you walked in front of him  very privately. You introduced yourself, and you gave a set of reasons that  you placed these cattle or hogs or whatever.  Sometimes you   d stand there, and you knew that the term was, you knew  you had busted the class in that you had placed it so wrong it was pitiful  compared to what the expert had placed them. You had to justify why you  had placed them that way. A lot of humor came out of that in later years. Tot  was always very verbal in our private time. He   d name one of us, and he   d  say,    Walt, I was talking to Dr. so-and-so from Purdue that you gave the  oral reasons on that class of   and why would you ever have said what you  told me you said?    I said,    I don   t know, but it looked right at the time.     Anyway, we did well doing the best we could, and we got the honors of  doing it. Now, that has been replicated. It has been done extremely well and  probably in tougher competition and probably by sharper individuals than  we were because on those animal science reunions, when they introduce the  judging teams, they have all their trophies and so forth up there they   ve  won. All we can do is just sit there and envy it, (Laughter) but we won our  share.  Nykolaiszyn Was there a contest that really just sticks out in your mind during your time?  Hackney The American Royal was always the big challenge. It should have been,  actually, the international in Chicago, but really in my mind, my big  challenge was the American Royal. I practiced at home. I practiced. You   ll  appreciate, possibly, when we weren   t in a workout, we were still practicing.  We   d take a class that we remembered we   d judged in our workout at home.  We   d stand in front of a mirror privately, and we would give oral reasons to  ourself in that mirror. If you   ve never done anything like that, that   s harder  than giving it to a person sitting there. We practiced incessantly on how to  do our workouts, and we carried them through to the next workout. We  practiced all the time, and I know that people got tired of us. We didn   t get  11  to go to all the places we wanted to go socially. We didn   t get to do a lot of  those things, but then again, there were a lot of things we did do that we  shouldn   t have.  Nykolaiszyn Well, I   m glad you mentioned that   Hackney Oh, no.  Nykolaiszyn Why don   t you tell me about some of them? (Laughs)  Hackney Well, some of them are not need-to-know information. (Laughter) Some of  them are so off the wall that you wonder how you survived, and I can only  give you one. I   ll give you an example that I have used. I was also on the  rodeo team, rodeo club. I rode bulls, and I rode saddle broncs. I was never a  star of any kind, but at least I made the team. We were at Oklahoma State  Block and Bridle Rodeo. That was a social event during the time in those  days, back in the day, when they had what was called Western Week at  Oklahoma State. I don   t know that you even have that now. Those  fraternities and the sororities and the independents, they would all dress  western, and they   d have their neckerchiefs and a cowboy hat. If they could  find boots, they wore them, and so forth. The old animal husbandry arena  would be packed. On the last day of the rodeo, it was a kind of a ritual that  the fraternities and the sororities would go to the top floor of the Student  Union building on the big dance hall up there, is what we called it, a  wooden, huge room.  They would migrate up there after the last performance, and they   d have a  cowboy dance up there. Well, none of us at that time were invited to that  party, and we had put on the rodeo. We were beat up. We were crippled up,  as I was, but then again beat up from riding and getting injured and so forth.  We were sitting, after the rodeo, behind the chutes at the rodeo, sitting  around the horse trailers and pickup trucks and so forth, and we were  drinking beer. One thing led to another, and finally I said,    You know, it just  is not fair that we have gone to all this effort to entertain the students, and  then when time comes for a nice party and relaxing deal, we weren   t  invited.    That conversation evolved, and it developed. It got bigger, and it  got bigger. Finally, the clown, who was a student at Oklahoma State, said,     Well, let   s go to it. They surely won   t throw us out.    Sounds the right thing  to do, only he had a brahma bull. It probably weighed, I don   t know, two  thousand pounds, huge bull named Jimbo. Well, I was beat up, and I  couldn   t   we loaded the bull in the horse trailer, and there was five or six of  us.  We pulled the horse trailer around behind the Student Union to what was  then a parking lot there, and it was dark and night. We unloaded Jimbo, put  a saddle on him and so forth. He was broke to ride just like a horse, tame,  12  nice, quiet guy, and the idea being, in order for me to go with the guys, I had  to ride Jimbo, which I willingly did. Huge mistake, of course. We went  down below behind the Student Union through those doors in the Student  Union lower floor there. Went down to where there was a, well, there was  an elevator, but the weight restriction on it wasn   t proper for us to put us and  Jimbo in that elevator. In fact, we couldn   t have gotten in it, I don   t think,  but there was a freight elevator that was much bigger on down a little bit. It  was bigger, and it would take the weight. We took, and we went down there  and got on, went up. As I recall, Juliana, it was the fifth floor of the Student  Union was where that was, and we unloaded   the hallway.  That big room where the dance was had big wooden doors that opened, I can  recall, and one of the guys opened them doors. This place was just loaded up  with students, and they   re having a great time dancing and everything. We  went in,    we    being all of us and Jimbo. We got in there, and all those  students, the mass majority of them, all they could think about was that  brahma bull and what they   d seen those bulls doing during the rodeo, eating  the cowboys alive, you know. They started moving around, and quite a bit of  activity trying to get out of the dance hall. It excited Jimbo, and he started  moving around a little more than he should have. That floor was very slick,  and he went down and couldn   t get up. Every time he   d try to get up, his feet  would move on that slick floor. We took off our jackets, and we laid them  on the floor under his feet to give him some traction. We got him up, and we  got him out of there. We knew we were in trouble because those students  were just screaming, and it was a panic issue. We got out the door, got over  to that elevator, got down to that initial first floor, got up to the outside door  we   d come in at.  We   re just going through it, and the campus security were waiting on us out  there or showed up. That should   ve been the end of the story, but the fact  remains. We were escorted back over to the animal husbandry arena. We put  Jimbo away over there, and then we were escorted to the police station on  campus at that time. As a result of all of that, there was quite a little activity  going on among the academia of the college and us, and the question was,     Do we even want these people?    It boiled down to we all got excused for a  few days, but the guy that owned the bull, he got expelled forever. He was  eliminated from college. It was unfortunate, as it should have been. He was  a senior and would have been graduating. He never got to graduate, and he,  in fact, went to Fort Worth, Texas, and passed away down there. That was  the end of the story   . You probably should have forgotten about it, but  over the years, people wouldn   t let us forget about it. It   s one story. The  other being we all had our share of catching the ducks out of Theta Pond at  night and all of those things that continue to probably go on. I   m not sure.  That was the big glamour issue at that time. One very quick issue that  occurred was later on, which, if we get to it, I was vice president of a  13  national company. My president went to Stillwater to an agricultural  seminar during the course of that time, and when he came home, Mr.  Woodland said,    Walt, if you   ve got time, come down to my office. I   d like  to share with you my experience down at your old alma mater.    I said,     Great  Great     Pure ignorance, or I wouldn   t have gone. I went down to his  office, and he said,    Walt, I   ve got to bring it up to you. The darndest thing  occurred. I was sitting in a banquet at Stillwater, and one of the department  heads was sitting beside me and introduced himself.    I said,    Well, I   m not  sure I   d know who it was.    He said,    Well, it was Dr. Robert Totusek.    I  thought,    Oh, gosh.    He said,    He told me a story about you.    Then he  related    Jimbo the bull    story. What do you say? It   s been that since then  that people won   t leave you alone on the thing you prefer. (Laughter) It  never happened, of course.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk a little more about Dr. Totusek. Tell me a little bit about the man.  Hackney First of all, to have never known him, to have never met him before, which  was my case, I thought he was a student at Oklahoma A M when I went  there. I might ought to qualify that. In 1957 at a football game, they formally  changed the name from Oklahoma A M to Oklahoma State University, and  they had our rodeo team, who we were all horseback, carrying flags. We  rode in, and we went around the track that went around the football field  during the football game at halftime. That was nice, and that was an  honorarium that we   ll remember. What I really recall is one day here a few  years ago, I was at a animal science reunion, and we were off in a car  touring the campus, looking at the new buildings and so forth. Over outside  of the, I believe it   s the wrestling arena, there   s a bronze out there of some  cowboys riding. Well, that was a photograph that was taken of us when we  did the football field when they changed the name, and they took that  photograph and turned it into that bronze.  I always manage to take people that I know, like my wife. I said,    See that?  That   s   .    She said,    Oh, let   s go see something more interesting.    Now,  Dr. Totusek, we all didn   t have   we respected him so much that none of us  were about to ask him how old he was, but he did not look much older than  we were. Come to find out, he wasn   t a lot older than we were, but his  maturity was phenomenal. There was never a time when any of us  disregarded any of his stature or any of his comments or anything in that  regard. We took everything he said and done as gospel, and we actually  lived and breathed on what he instructed us to do. That was the type of  respect that we had for the man, and then over the years, that evolved into a  family atmosphere. Every April, we have the reunion, and Dr. Totusek  would personally call each one of us that had been on that team to be sure  that we were coming to that reunion. We did. We would not have not gone.  We did, and we went.  14  We   d check in at a hotel there. That evening, when we check in, Nell and  Dr. Totusek would invariably arrive about after it was time to   all the guys  were there, and their wives. He had made plans to go out to Freddie Paul   s,  have a dinner aligned for all of us out there, and we would try to buy his and  Nell   s dinners. It never happened. He would never take a gratuity from any  of us for any condition, ever. The respect that we earned over the nation as a  result of us having had him as our team coach was phenomenal, and never  would you run into an agricultural person in the nation that wasn   t very  aware of Dr. Totusek and very complimentary of his abilities. For a guy that  grew up on a little ol   wheat farm up by Enid, Garber, Oklahoma, we just  thought it was phenomenal. Then when we got out of school and graduated,  it never ended. Tot would call here, maybe, at least once a month and  sometimes once every couple weeks just to visit. Then he   d get off, but he   d  call one of the other guys immediately.  He did that all those years, and it   s hard for me to go much further with it  because it was all due to respect for the man. I got cancer in 2013, and they  had to do a lung operation and other   . It was in other areas of my body. I  don   t know how the word got out to him, but nearly every day that I was  recuperating here and at the hospitals, he would call. You   d had to  experience the thing and understand how much I appreciated that. He didn   t  have to do that. He had other   Kim Brock, he had Kim. He   d have him on  the phone now and then, and it wasn   t that Kim and I nor any of us and Kim  were good friends. It was just that Tot told him to call, and he did. He was  that kind of a man. We noticed as we matured, which we had a lot of  maturing to do, as we matured, we noticed   in my case, and if you care to,  we could go into that. I went into industry in a fairly significant manner, and  I couldn   t run into, in my field of packing companies, beef packing  companies, hog packing companies, I couldn   t run into figurative people in  those areas that may even come up and say,    Did you happen to know Bob  Totusek?       Oh, did I ever.    I can   t speak highly enough, Juliana.  Nykolaiszyn I can tell he   s been very special and instrumental in your life and career.  Hackney Career  He got me my job.  Nykolaiszyn Well, let   s talk about your career after you gradated.  Hackney Well, grades, GPA, none of this was so important when I graduated in 1959.  If you got a piece of paper, that was a moral victory, and you got out of  Dodge City in a hurry. I went to Tot at one point   I might back up a little  bit.  Nykolaiszyn Sure.  15  Hackney Before I graduated, the last semester, at the end of my next to last semester,  he called me into his office, still in the animal husbandry arena. It   s the old  animal husbandry arena. He said,    Walt, I have made an error in your  respect. We   ve got to do something about it, or you   ve got to spend another  year in school to graduate. Your hours are wrong, and we   ve not gotten you  the right credits.    I couldn   t have spent another minute at college. I wanted  to get out of there, and I said,    Well, what   s my alternative?    He said,     You   ve been carrying sixteen credits per semester, and that hasn   t worked  in your case. Partially, it   s due to some of the transferring that was done  initially from Alva at Northwestern down here. That got lost in the shuffle  some way.    I said,    What do I have to do? I can   t spend another year.    He  said,    This next semester, you have to carry twenty-three hours.    I said,     Okay.    I had no opinion what twenty-three hours meant. I didn   t know  what I was agreeing to do, but I did. He made me report to him every week,  and if I was ever in any issue with any subject, I would tell him.  He would either straighten me up, or he would bring an individual in that  would straighten me up. I graduated, so there. I did graduate. When I was  close, I had applied around, but it was still that syndrome of, I   d go for   my  credentials were excellent. The judging team, everything was just really  good, except when I   d go for a personal interview, it would become a little  bit of an issue because of my handicap. Tot said,    This isn   t the way it   s  going to work. We   re going to make it work,    and he got me my first job as  a trainee. That   s what I wanted to do was be a cattle buyer, a professional  cattle buyer. He got me my first job with a company called John Morrell and  Company, a meat packer, which in the day were of the top five packers in  the nation, and this plant was in Ottumwa, Iowa. I went up for my interview,  and the head buyer, (that   s who I interviewed with) he just talked like we  are. He said,    I   ll get back with you.    Never any mention about    Could  I   ,    or,    Are you capable? Are you able?     I went home, and I didn   t know where I was. I got back to Oklahoma, and I  told my friends. I said,    I doubt if they   ll accept me, but we   ll see.    That  phone call followed me to Dr. Totusek, and that head buyer called him  nearly before I got to Oklahoma and said,    We want to hire this guy.    Tot  called me, said,    Get over here. We need to talk.    He told me, and we called  from his office up there to Ottumwa. Never had any clue that I   d be  accepted, you know, and they accepted me. We secured a salary, which was  peanuts, but it was more than I   d had. The day I graduated from Oklahoma  State was in the stadium. My parents were there, and my sister was there. I  came out when it was completed. I came out behind the stadium, and I  handed my mother my cap and gown. I gave them all a hug.  I got in my car and drove that day to Ottumwa, Iowa, and the next morning  at five o   clock a.m., I was on the job as a trainee cattle buyer. I had visions  of milk and honey, of being a trainee cattle buyer, what I   d always wanted to  16  do. I got to the scale house in the plant, down where the live cattle came in  prior, of course, to slaughter. They said,    Walt, you put on those knee-high  rubber boots, and you put on this raincoat type of a waterproof top. We   ll  show you where we want you stationed, now until we change it.    It was  washing with a firehose the manure out of the pens after they   d emptied the  pen and took the cattle up to the kill floor. I had to clean those pens that  were appropriate for the health people and the USDA, and so they   d inspect  my work. That was my job for four months.  Nykolaiszyn Wow   Hackney As I   m out there washing the pen, I   m thinking,    I   ve got a diploma. I   m  capable of being a cattle buyer, but here I am.    I was ashamed to tell  anybody what I was doing, you know. Then it progressed from there, and  within about less than a year, I   d been qualified. I   d been given a company  car, which I   d dreamed of having, and I was given the chore of riding with  seasoned cattle buyers to learn their techniques as they personally applied  their work out buying the cattle. Then in about two or three months after  that, I was given a territory of my own and told to go get after it. I started  that way, and in a year, we were living in western Iowa. A new company  came into existence called Iowa Beef Packers.  It was destined to become the largest packing company in the world, but at  the moment, it had one packing plant in a small town in Iowa. It was an  independent plant, didn   t have the support of the big five like Morrell had  been and all that. They came to me and said,    We would like to hire you as a  trainee for us.    I said,    I   m through with the trainee business. I   ve been there  and done that. I   m going to continue doing what I   m doing because I   m able  to do my finished work now.    They said,    Well, okay, we   ll hire you to do  the finished work, then. We want you to come to work for us as one of our  original thirteen cattle buyers.    They offered me a salary that was a little  more than double what I   d been making at Morrell, and we needed the  income. I was with them then, and then from there my career kick-started  and really kick-started then through the years.  Nykolaiszyn You   ve done many, many things in agriculture.  Hackney I have.  Nykolaiszyn What   s been your favorite? You started your own company.  Hackney The challenge of starting my own company came about   . well, briefly, I  was with this Iowa Beef Packers. Then, a national cooperative, farm  cooperative in Kansas City called Farmland Industries contacted me. They  said,    We are building a new beef plant in Garden City, Kansas, and we  would like to talk to you about becoming head cattle buyer for that plant.     17  Well, that was a huge move, and I was still young as I could be, a kid on the  street, if you will. We went out; we looked it over. Again, it was a salary  thing, but it was promotive of my career. I could tell it was, and if I could  make it work, it would come back to me in dividends at another day. We  moved to Garden City. I was running their buy for the plant.  Their national president out of Kansas City had an annual meeting in Dodge  City, Kansas, one night, and we were obligated to be there. We were sitting  there, and he said,    Our plant manager has resigned, and we   d like to  introduce our new plant manager.    I thought,    Geez, I wonder   .    He said,     Walt, would you mind standing up?    I didn   t think I could get to my feet.  That kick-started, if you will, another facet of a career. I elevated from being  a country cattle buyer and head of other country cattle buyers to a plant  manager for two years. Another company that was a high competitor by then  of Iowa Beef Packers was called Missouri Beef Packers. They were in  Amarillo, Texas; Rockport, Missouri; Boise, Idaho; Friona, Texas; Dodge  City, Kansas, and they were enormous in size.  They flew into Garden City one day and said,    Our purpose in wanting to  visit is we   d like for you to become our corporate head cattle buyer,    which  meant they had about seventy national cattle buyers strung from Illinois to  Idaho and all points in between. I reviewed their whole deal as best I could,  and it was such a huge promotion. My wife and I agreed, and they moved us  then to  Plainview, Texas . That   s where their corporate offices were at that  time. I was corporate head cattle buyer, which goes without saying in my  field, that was quite a feather in my cap, and I knew it. In my quiet time I   d,     Yay     (Laughter) After a while, the political influence put on me in the  corporate world was not what I wanted. I didn   t like the corporate influence  and what it caused me to, I feared, become.  One day, I told my wife, I said,    I   m really tired of this corporate work, and  what I   d really like to do is, with all of my years of contacts that I   ve made  of cattle producers, I think I could start a feeder cattle company. I believe  we   d make a success out of it.    It meant moving from West Texas to  Omaha, and then it meant re-moving all of those old acquaintances and  getting the money that I required for a line of credit to operate a company of  the size I needed to make a good living. We accomplished all of that, and  that   s what I   ve done, then, ever since. Along the way, a national farm  organization came to me, and they said,    We would like to hire you to be  national livestock director of our farm organization.    They were in nearly all  the states and so forth, and I said,    No, I really don   t want to do that, except  if you want to hire me on just a management deal where I get the job done  and I set up the parameters of the work and then you are responsible for  seeing that it gets done.     18  They said,    We   ll do that,    so I did that for a long time. Farm Credit  Services, a government national lender, got ahold of me, and they said,     We   ve noticed you building these livestock programs nationally, all over  the nation, and we would like to ask if you would conduct risk management  seminars for us on our behalf in our branch banks on a national program.    I  said,    If I can do it on my schedule, I will. I   ve got my company that I  cannot let suffer because of obligations I have, but I will work hard to set up  a program schedule that will allow it, if that   s workable for you,    which is  what they wanted to do. I hired the head of the swine department at Iowa  State University, Lauren Christian. I hired the largest hog producer at that  time, independent hog producer, in the nation, independent, not a corporate.  He was in Minnesota, and I hired him. I hired a certified public accountant  that had huge ability for estate planning and that type thing.  Anyway, I hired four of that quality people, and I took on the physical part  of moving livestock, hogs, and cattle and how to handle them, how to  market them. I did that for about four years, and it got to the point where I   d  done about all I knew how I could do. I went to them. I said,    If you need  my help, I   ll be available, but right now I think I   ve gone as far as I can go.     I dropped them then, and as a result, I   ve been doing my company work. I  have a partner, and we have offices here and offices in Iowa. He handles the  eastern area, from east Iowa to Virginia and into Alabama, Mississippi, and  Kentucky in that country to Tennessee. I handle the western country, from  western Kansas, Colorado, Texas, on out into Montana and Wyoming,  Colorado, South Dakota. We have men that work formally for us, also, to  give us the assistance we   ve got to have. That   s kind of the long-winded  story of what I have done, but to make your point valid, I have had quite a  bit, different venue of things.  Nykolaiszyn A wide variety of things.  Hackney Yeah, yeah.  Nykolaiszyn You spoke a lot about being a cattle buyer. What goes into making a  successful cattle buyer?  Hackney Your ability to develop credibility. If you don   t have credibility with  whomever it is that you   re doing business, either buying from or buying for,  either/or, you can   t make it. There   s many, many, many in our competitors  that are in that category. They struggle, and they get into some of the worst  messes that are possible. It   s due to the fact that the people they   re doing  business for or with don   t trust them. If you can develop that one trait with  your clientele, you   ve got a large amount   if your talent is there to formally  produce what you claim you can do, you   ve got it made. I   ve worked hard at  doing that, and I haven   t changed anything in my lifestyle that would  threaten my credibility I   ve developed over the years. I do a lot of national  19  speaking. I go to state and national cattlemen association meetings as a  banquet speaker, if you will. I go to some college activities around the  country. I do that, but my goal in doing so is to further my credibility. I  don   t want to go in as some form of a braggart or anything in that regard. I  simply want them to see me as a person they would like to do business with,  and that   s my goal now is to sell myself.  Nykolaiszyn You   re also doing some work, and you have been for quite some time, with  Iowa Public Television?  Hackney I have. I was sitting someplace in 1978,    78, and an individual called and  wanted to visit with me and from Iowa Public Broadcasting. I didn   t even  know what that was. They came to my office, and they said,    What we  do   .    They explained that they have a feature every month on their show.  It   s syndicated into thirty-four states at Des Moines, Iowa, Iowa Public  Television, and it   s syndicated into thirty-four states.    We would like to  have you feature the livestock analyzation of that program every month,  once a month.    I said,    That can   t be any big deal, but I   ll do it.    Well, you  know, I did it, and back to selling myself, I starting getting all of these calls  from California and New York and Canada and wherever. They had seen the  show and respected my viewpoint on what it was that I was discussing on  this market to market. All of a sudden, I saw elevation in our business  activity of the company.  It   s been that way ever since, and even to the point to where I have told  them lately, I   ve said,    Yeah, you really need to find some young blood in  here.    They said,    Well, no one   s complained yet, so we want to continue  doing what we   re doing,    up to the point where last year, I was in Montana  exercising delivery of cattle off contracts that I had written earlier in the  year last year, and I get this call. It was from public television. They said,     We want to send a camera crew out to Montana, and we want to see you in  your physical activities. We want to know and see and document what  you   re doing.    I said,    Okay,    which they did. We started out in Billings,  Montana. I took delivery of quite a few ranches there, and they had their  camera crew there. They were cowboying it. They were filming the trucks  coming in with the cattle, weighing the cattle, loading the cattle back out to  whomever it was I had sold them to, and we did that for about, I guess, ten  days. I thought,    Well, that   s about it,    and they said,    Where you going  now?     I said,    Well, I   m on a schedule. I   m going to Wyoming, and my first stop is  Ten Sleep, Wyoming.    They thought,    Oh, man, the romance of Ten Sleep,  Wyoming     They said,    If you don   t mind....    I said,    Just be careful and  don   t get run over out in the stockyards. Just be careful. Be sensitive that  these animals don   t know you like I do.    We spent a little over a week in  Wyoming at three or four different   Jackson Hole, Ten Sleep, Rock  20  Springs, just to name a few. They were there with their cameras and  everything, and they said,    Well, are you going back to Omaha?    I said,     No, I got to go on down to Colorado in the high country by Grand Junction,  Colorado, and an area called Grand Mesa, Colorado, in the Rockies because  I   ve also got cattle to take delivery on there.    At these deliveries, I have the  people that work for the company. They   re there also assisting me to do a lot  of the physical work and that type thing, and I have them set up to be ready  for me to arrive.  We start, then, taking delivery. We went to Colorado, and here they were.  Anyway, last Tuesday I said,    What did you guys ever do with that filming?  You spent almost a month out there with me.    They said,    Oh, we   re  working on, we   re making a documentary for Iowa for public television.  We   re making a documentary for public television that we are orchestrating  on their behalf, and we   ll finish it toward fall this year.    Last Tuesday they  wanted to go down to our accounting offices in Albia, Iowa, and they  wanted to see the activity in-house that we do in respect to payables, credit  assurance, and all of those things that we have to do in that. They spent one  day in the office filming everybody in there, which was a big experience.  That was a nice thing, and that came out of the Iowa Public Television.  Another thing that   s been enormous, an enormous compliment to our  company and, really, our credibility is I do   have you heard of DTN?  Nykolaiszyn No.  Hackney Data Transmission Network? Well, it   s out of Omaha, Nebraska, and it   s  got, like, 130,000 subscribers. What it is is a marketing system that   s set up  through receivers that people subscribe for. They get the receiver, and that   s  programmed with a dish that feeds off a satellite at another area twenty  thousand mile away. You put the information into it every day. I put out a  market summary every day on that, five days a week. They fire that up to  that, and then it goes down to those subscribers. That has been phenomenal  for us as far as exposure goes because it   s our company   s name and  everything on there. People will call. They either agree or disagree with  what I have said about the markets and the conditions, but the fact is that  they are reading it. Our business, again, has appreciated from that. That is  kind of the sum and substance of me. It   s nothing elaborate. It   s nothing  exceptional. The one thing that I   m phenomenally proud of is our family and  my wife, obviously, a native Iowan I met when I first went to Morrell at  Ottumwa, Iowa.  We have a son that   s a director of beef sales for Tyson Foods, and he   s in  their corporate offices up by Sioux City, Iowa. Our daughter is in  Chatsworth, California, and she started being a special education instructor  out there. Then over the years, it became more than what she wanted to  devote to. Now her career is training horses and living in a beautiful place  21  there in Chatsworth, California. She has a family, her husband, and they  have four children. They   re loving it out there in the sun and the sand, you  know. I would prefer them being back here. Then our grandkids are just the  pride of our lives, and we incessantly brag about our grandkids. I hope they  appreciate it because we   re very complimentary of them. That   s kind of the  story as far as myself, and if anything I   ve ever done has influenced the  industry, that would probably be my biggest attempt would be to influence  the livestock industry. That   s what I actually did with this Farm Credit  Services of America in those monthly meetings that we would have around  the nation. My objective there was to influence agricultural producers of  livestock how to nutritionally and genetically improve their productivity to  where it would become more salable to the consumer public.  Nykolaiszyn Increasing gain, or   .  Hackney Increasing gain, increasing, if you will, cutability through a series of shear  tests on tenderness through the genetics and so forth, making them aware. A  lot of producers earlier on didn   t even know what EPDs were in the genetics  of cattle, which was the expected progeny deficiencies. In those regards,  they would look at you like a deer in the headlights when you started  talking, like,    Oh, God, we   ve got to sit through this.    That wasn   t the case.  After a little bit, they   d say,    Boy, I need to know more about that. That will  influence my productivity and my income, also.    I made that my personal  objective in all those meetings was to make that kind of an import to the  industry, and I hope that that   ll be part of my eulogy.  Nykolaiszyn Part of your legacy.  Hackney There you go   Nykolaiszyn Can you talk a little bit about how attending OSU and earning your degree  made an impact on your life?  Hackney On     Nykolaiszyn Earning your degree and attending OSU, how did it make an impact on your  life?  Hackney I would have been in some form of a financial assistance program on the  dole, if you will, had I not had my experience at Oklahoma State University,  had I not had the support that the people I was closely connected with there,  had they not supported me and recommended me and taught me. You would  easily understand I knew nothing when I came to Oklahoma State. I was the  epitome of a redneck. I didn   t understand many things. I knew how to chew  tobacco. I knew how to drink beer. I knew what I liked to do, but I didn   t  know how to get to that goal which was the livestock industry. I wanted to  22  become a player in the livestock industry, but I had no opinion of how to get  there. Oklahoma State taught me those rules of participation that I had to  have, and they let me know in no uncertain terms you have a choice.  You don   t have to commit yourself here, but if you do your odds are good in  your case of succeeding to do those things that you want to set up for your  goals. If you don   t want to apply yourself, it won   t happen, and that will be  of no fault for Oklahoma State. We   ll have your tuition money, and we   ll  have all of that. We   ll have out of you what we wanted. They didn   t say that,  but that   s what I thought they were looking at me to do. I thought,    You   re  not going to get a pound of flesh from me. I   m going to do what you tell me  to do,    and I did exactly, as near as I could, what they told me to do.     Taught me    is a better word, I   m sure. I worked hard at absorbing what I  was being told because no one in my background was ever qualified. I   m not  critical of that, but they just weren   t qualified to teach me those things. I  sure didn   t know it, and it was through application that I learned it. I learned  the applications at Oklahoma State.  Nykolaiszyn Well, you can definitely see how it impacted your life. You took the ball, and  you ran with it.  Hackney I had to. You see, I had to. There comes a time when conditions insist that  you take the ball and you run with it, or you fail miserably. That   s what I  recognized early on. I recognized early on that I had some phenomenal  challenges facing me, that I would have to really apply myself to in order to  overcome some of them. I worked, and I did. I did a lot of it in my private  time, my quiet time. I should have done this, I should have done that, the  would have, could have, should have syndrome, but it was Oklahoma State,  a bit Alva. I got the prerequisites, and they were really nice with me. This  Dr. Brandt was a great man, but he was, if you will, junior college material.  When I wanted to get to the pro ranks, I had to go to Dr. Totusek, and that   s  where I was able to go, through the help of people that helped me. A lot of  what I was able to do in that regard really didn   t have much to do with my  talents or reputation. It was the people that were helping me, and they really,  really helped me all the way through. They took me down there. My parents,  you know, bless their hearts, they weren   t qualified. They didn   t know. They  just knew that that was a good idea if I   d   but they weren   t sure. I was a  wild and crazy country kid. They hoped that somebody could put the reign  on me, and they did down at Stillwater.  Nykolaiszyn Well, Walt, is there anything else you   d like to add before we close out  today? I know we covered just a fraction.  Hackney Probably more than you wanted.  Nykolaiszyn Just a fraction  (Laughs)  23  Hackney I hope part of it is something that   s of any value to you. I really do.  Nykolaiszyn Oh, it   s been great. Thank you so much.  Hackney To answer your question, no. There   s so much, you know, and you can   t be  involved in this career life, and really addictive. I   m addicted to it, and I  hope that   s evident. I   m totally addicted to my career, and people know that,  I think, that are around me. People that don   t know it are bored to death, and  they don   t want to even be around me, you know. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn When are you going to retire?  Hackney Oh, I   ll pick the spot one day.  Nykolaiszyn One day.  Hackney I   m continually challenged. Sue, my wife, would love to have me retire  quite a while back. I couldn   t do that. I wouldn   t do that. The inactivity  would be unbelievable. I think it has kept me in the loop to stay involved as  I have. I think it   s mentally kept me in the loop, knowing what I need to do  next in my career. I have plans right on out of things to do, and I   ve got  approaches from other industry wanting me to set up genetic formulas for  them in regard to hogs and cattle. That has nothing to do with my age or  nothing else. It   s just,    Am I qualified to do it?    That   s all they care about.  Nykolaiszyn Still a lot left to do.  Hackney A lot left to do, a lot left to do  I love, totally love the industry, but I have  never failed, at any time, I have never failed to give full credit to anything I  am and have done in this industry but to Oklahoma State. It has been   I  can   t describe it, actually. It was a challenge to start with, and then it  became a work of love that I wanted   I didn   t want to disappoint anyone. I  really did not. I wanted to reward them for their efforts, and that   s what I   ve  tried to do.  Nykolaiszyn Well, we appreciate you...  Hackney Oh, thank you   Nykolaiszyn    and thank you for taking some time out to visit with me today.  Hackney Oh, my gosh  I   ve looked forward to this. You understand very well, but it   s  a sense of pride that you   re here.  -------  -------
