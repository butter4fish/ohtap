 Gill  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  Gill  My name is Jerry Gill. Today is December 10, 2008. I   m visiting with  Pat and Kathy Dorr on the OSU Campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This  interview is for the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. I appreciate you being with us today. I want  to start, Kathy, with a couple of questions for you, but Pat jump in here  if you have a comment too. Kathy, first off, a little bit of quick  background, where did you grow up?  I grew up all over the place because my father was part of the oil  business. But chiefly Oklahoma City and then the Midland-Odessa oil  area and Hobbs, New Mexico.  How did you get to Oklahoma State University from there?  Well, we came back my senior year to Oklahoma City and from there     my parents were OU grads and I broke ranks and came up here to OSU.  (Laughter) That   s good.  Yeah, saw the light.  So what high school did you graduate from?  Northwest Classen.  Northwest Classen. Was it the Comets from Northwest Classen?  Yes, we were the Comets.  I understand that you worked as an administrative assistant under Dr.  Wilton Anderson.  6  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  After Pat and I got married, I got a job     Which was our senior year of college.  Yeah, we got married in the middle of our senior year at OSU here.  After I graduated in spring of    69, I took a job working in the Student  Union as an administrative assistant. My degree was in office  management, which served me well to do that. But I was never really  happy in that position. Somehow or other Dr. Anderson probably heard  of my discomfort or my desire to do something else. I had been a student  of his and a fan of his and enjoyed him. So he called me up and said  he   d like to take me to coffee. I was scared to death. I really didn   t know  exactly the nature of this interview or this visit but I was happy to have  coffee with him one morning.  He said at that point in time they had four corner offices in the College  of Business for the four department heads. They had been teamed up two  and two in only two offices and shared a secretary. But they were  moving them to the individual offices so his secretary had decided to  stay with business education and so it left him with a void. He came to  me and said I   d like you to be my secretary. I was floored and honored  and I was very anxious to go do that.  And when he says it you do it.  (Laughter)Yeah. I mean he makes you   he shows so much faith in you  and belief in you and you just feel buoyed up by that.  Wow. So your connection   you said you   d had a couple of accounting  courses?  Yes, I had accounting one and two. He had tried to interest me in going  on. At that point in time, I just thought I could be the best secretary the  world had ever seen. That was my area, and that   s what I stayed with.  She was the first certified professional secretary in Oklahoma.  Dr. Anderson arranged for me to take the test, paid for me to take the  test, believed I could pass it and I did. And he was proud of me in doing  that.  That   s fantastic. Going back to the interview, what were some of the  anxieties you had? What do you remember about the interview?  Oh, gosh. Well, he   s just such a strong personality and knows this is  what   s going to happen and this is the order it   s going to happen. He just  7  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  floored me in his saying you are the one I want, I know you can do the  job, you graduated top in your class at OSU and I need a secretary and  you   re the one I want to have. So I was very thrilled to take that.  He still calls you the best secretary he ever had. He called you that  yesterday.  Yes, he did.  So he didn   t take no for an answer.  No he didn   t take no for an answer. And I never regretted that decision.  That was a wonderful opportunity.  So what years then did you     I worked for him from the fall of    69 through the summer of    71 when  Pat graduated with his master   s and we had to move on.  No, that would have been longer than that. We stayed around to work in  internal audit. We didn   t leave until the spring of    72.  Okay, so the spring of    72.  So    69 through    72. I   ve got to ask, what was he like to work with?  Oh, he was wonderful to work with. Now he could be kind of  intimidating because he would come in and you knew you were going to  do this, this and this. And you were going to do it quickly and you were  going to do it right. But he also empowered you in a way   because he  allowed me to take on more and more responsibility as he saw that I  could do it. And he turned lots of things over to me. He would dictate  letters and I would make slight corrections and things and he would  notice that. But he always approved of it. Or if I didn   t do it just right, he  would tell me but he would even say,    Write a letter and say so-and-so     and just give a brief description and then allow me to do that kind of  thing as he knew that I could and was able to. I had the files on the  master   s students in my office and I would pull them out and talk to  some of them at times saying,    Have you taken this or this? That   s what  he   s going to ask you about.    Or that sort of thing.  You were sort of the set up corner.  He was very good about empowering the people that he knew could take  over and do things for him.  8  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  Could you follow up on that a little bit? What are some of the  responsibilities that evolved in your role of work?  Like I said, actually talking to the master   s students or students that  came in wanting to talk about that kind of thing. When he had people  coming in to interview I would sometimes make those kinds of  arrangements, they are going to stay here or there or set up meals or that  kind of thing. And you know, he   d say   it seems like he said one time  that we needed better filing records. Pat and I moved stuff around one  weekend and re-filed and did some things and he just allowed me to do  that.  I can say it from the other side because I was a master   s student and  worked with the Ph.D. students. If you needed any information about the  School of Accounting you went to Kathy, and everybody knew it. She  was the information disseminator for the department too. I mean Andy   Dr. Anderson  was the boss, but if you need the information, like every  good secretary or administrative assistant, that   s who you go to for the  information. She was well known for that.  Well, you already alluded to this a little bit, but can you expand on his  management style, how you interacted with people? I mean I understand  he   s a pretty strong personality.  Yes, he   s a strong personality and he usually knew the way he wanted  things to go. You came in and you sat in the hot seat in front of his desk  and talked to him. But he rewarded good service and he believed in his  superstars, as he called the people that he knew were doing well or that  sort of a thing. He called me and his wife sometimes his    snappy little  numbers    because we were doing the things he wanted quickly and he  appreciated that. Back then, it was largely the men that were in  accounting. It was still breaking ground to have women in accounting.  There weren   t a whole lot of them in there. Politically correct  designations of people say today probably didn   t apply then because we  could call a woman    a snappy number    and that wasn   t a bad thing. But  he was very good to you as long as he knew you were trying and doing  what he wanted to see happen and making the goals of the department  move forward.  But you hit part of his personality. He had his superstars. Now that   s the  term he used. He called you superstars. So others would say he played  favorites and he did. I mean those he determined were his superstars he  took care of.  What do you remember most about Andy? What stands out in your mind  the three years that you worked for him?  9  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Oh gosh, lots of things. I remember he was always in charge, doing what  needed to be done, taking over and telling you what needed to be done  and you did it. I remember one time, I don   t remember if it was  Christmas or what, but we wanted to get him something. I determined  that the perfect gift was cufflinks that said,    debit and credit    so you  could wear them on the right arm. And that   s the only surprise that I was  ever able to do for him. He loved that gift. And he wore them   .  I would have liked to have some. (Laughter)  He even noted that in class when he was up writing on the board. That I  know my debits     Credits on the left cuff link, debits on the right.  Actually, it would be debits on the left. (Laughter)  Debit on the left, credit on the right, yes. That would be the correct way.  But yes, he was very generous and it was fun to be able to do something  fun for him and to reciprocate.  What personal qualities about Andy impressed you the most?  Well, his knowledge and he didn   t come from a lot of wealth or a huge  metropolitan   I mean he started in Cherokee, Oklahoma and came up.  And he knew the value of hard work.  Got his degree at Northwestern Oklahoma. We would not think that was  significant from today   s standards.  Did his graduate work at Oklahoma State?  No.  No, he did his graduate work at Colorado. He got his Ph.D. at Colorado.  Did he ever get a degree from OSU?  I don   t think he did any education at OSU. He came here in    60.  But he knew the value of hard work. He didn   t just think that your best  people came from the major schools. He knew they could come from the  other areas, the small areas. He wasn   t a man of a lot of words. He didn   t  sit and just chit chat. You didn   t just tell him how you were feeling  today or how the dog did or anything like that. He didn   t care about that.  10  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  He was all business.  He was all business. But he was not ever uncaring or unfeeling towards  you or that sort of thing. He took care of you if you were his. I was  definitely his and I appreciated that fact   the care and concern.  Kathy, your story leads to my next question. Could you tell us some  stories about Andy that would help us or say those who didn   t know him  personally know more about him? Can you think of some stories,  particularly in your office setting?  Oh, gosh.  Your interactions with him?  I was trying to think of specific things.  I   ve got something to tell him.  Yeah, okay. It was such a contrast. I had Milt on F.  Usry in one office  who was the head of the master   s program to students. And Dr.  Anderson was in the other office. Milt Usry never had anything on his  desk. It used to be a game I played to put something on his desk that I  had finished and see how quickly it would come off of there. But Dr.  Anderson had his piles and he knew exactly what was in his piles, but he  had them. So I had to very carefully place things in the right piles and  keep them and that sort of thing. He came by everyday and always had  nice words for me, talked to me. I remember going in and dropping my  Steno notebook in the middle of one of the dictations and he never  missed a beat. It was up to me to get it back and get going and that sort  of thing. I remember being very scared the first time I ever had to take  dictation from him. He was very patient with me and he got where he  really snapped them out. But he worked with me to make sure we could  become a team to work together. I appreciated that.  You know when you go to remember stories, it   s harder because he   as  we said, he did not BS. You did not talk about the football team. You  did not talk about things that were unrelated to the department and to  accounting. That was him. I mean he did not BS about any other stuff. I  bet you don   t have one memory of that, because I don   t.  No, I really don   t.  That   s how focused the man was. So you just   .  You suggested some of this, but did he have some   I don   t want to say  11  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  quirks, but some pet peeves and things? What are some things that you  remember about him? The stacks on the desk are one of them but   .  Superstars.  Or someone that wasn   t on time. That would not be something that he  would have appreciated at all. I don   t remember any particular quirks as  you would say. I mean he didn   t have to have a certain brand   oh he did  like one particularly kind of, those coffee nips, he loved those. And so  that was   there were just very few little things like that that I could say  that he really preferred. I think I learned that through Gwen  his wife ,  not so much through him.  I heard he was really, as the fellers described him and you described  him, a really good recruiter of students and faculty?  Oh, my gosh.  I   ll tell you more about that too.  Can you tell us some recruiting stories?  When I was a student of his and we were in this great big classroom over  in Engineering, it was one of those big auditorium rooms and there were  two aisles and three seats. And it was so funny, he picked out the top  students and he would stop them after class and he   d take them to coffee  and talk to them. But there was one couple in class and he sat us  alphabetically. So one of them ended up in one aisle and the other one  was across the aisle in the end seat. He asked one of them a question; I  think it was the guy. And he asked his wife for the book and reached  across the aisle and got the book. And he  Dr. Anderson  said,    Why  don   t you have your own book?    You know he was just      I can   t  believe you   d come to my class without the book     And he  the student   finally said,    We   re married.    Oh   That made a huge difference.  (Laughter) Then the whole thing was very different. I think he took both  of them to coffee at one point in time but boy when he pointed at you,  you better have your answer.  You talked about him being a recruiter, he was not a recruiter for  accounting, he was the recruiter for accounting. He taught principles.  When you look around, the principles courses were normally taught by  maybe a Ph.D.  student  or a rookie; lower people. He taught the  principles  course .  Not intermediate, but beginning.  12  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Yes, beginning principles, one and two.  Beginning the first two courses. Andy even did    like I had the first two  courses by correspondence. He even handled the correspondence. Why?  Because he could identify up front whom the best students were and he  went after them. He was the recruiter deluxe. The American Accounting  Association gave him the first Outstanding Accounting Educator Award  in 1973 and they called him an accounting evangelist. I mean     (Laughter) That   s a good term. That   s a very good term.  Accounting evangelist. That   s great.  That was his demeanor. He evangelized about accounting.  Lanny Chasteen said also that to make sure that he got all of them, that  his classes in the early years were large.  Oh, yes   Huge  Huge   A hundred, two hundred.  He wanted to see everyone. That   s what I   m saying.  So he was teaching every student?  Everybody, that   s right.  And he   d start at one side of the board. By the end of class   there were  three huge boards up there and they   d all be full. That   s just the way he  taught.  Pat, what about his teaching style that you remember?  Well, I started  as  an engineering major for a year and a half and then  moved into political science because I decided to change gears and go to  law school. So I was a political science major when I started dating this  lady who had Wilton T. Anderson at the time. That   s when, somehow  while I was dating her, she introduced me to Wilton. He said,    Well, if  you   re going to law school, you need to major in accounting.    So he  talked me into majoring in accounting.  Go ahead and tell him about your first class, first assignment.  13  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  So I was  at the  end of two years, and I wanted to graduate on time and  I was just now entering the College of Business. I had to take several  courses by correspondence over the summer. I took both accounting  courses by correspondence in one summer without sitting in the  classroom. Well, I got my first paper back. Wilton T. Anderson did all  the correspondence for principles as well as in-class work. My first  paper, a big old F.  You   ve never seen so much red on a paper.  I   ve saved that paper, Jerry. And he says if you   re going to be an  accountant, you can   t do   I tell you, I saved that. Make a long story  short, I made an A after that. But that   s how he was. He was direct. So  his style was   I mean, he did not beat around the bush. He came right  out and told you what he thought, which I   ll tell it. I saw that as a  student. Because you talked about the recruiting, I   m a classic example  of Andy the Recruiter. And of course we called Wilton T. Anderson  Andy. Not by the students but by professors and his friends. He got me  to change my major. Then I was going to go to law school, right? Well,  somehow he talked me into getting a master   s in accounting. I still  wanted to go to law school. Somehow then he determined that I needed  to get a Ph.D. in accounting. This was his style too. He recruited at all  levels. He would find his best master   s students and he would say,    You  are going to get a doctorate.    Then he would actually determine where  they were going to get a doctorate, set it up for them, and send them  there. So he set up an assistantship for me at Michigan State to get my  Ph.D.  We were married at the time.  And I finally said,    No, I want some experience.    I   m one of the first  people I know to ever say no to Wilton T. Anderson, because he had  sent Mike Crooch there   these are people you might talk to later-  George Krull there. Several went to   Bill Kinney is another person.  And I   ll tell this story later about Bill Kinney because that   s kind of  interesting too. So I did not go on and get the Ph.D. then, I went into  practice. But then he contacts me in practice and says there   s a position  open in Ada, Oklahoma, they want a teacher. So he talked me into going  down there to see if I would like education. Then he got me back to get a  doctorate. I went to North Texas, then  OSU  hired me back here. The  man determined every step of my career. (Laughs) Is that a recruiter or  what?  And I heard that was sort of a standard thing for him. Let   s see, one  student described that he would farm students out.  14  P. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  That   s right   Do your undergraduate or master   s, and then he would find a place to  for your Ph.D. and then the ones he wanted he   d bring them back on to  the faculty.  And he farmed out the places where he knew they would get the  education that he would want.  Michigan State was one of his favorite places because the guy received  the second outstanding educator   what was his name? Oh, anyway, but  he selected his best master   s students, selected where   d they go, sent  them away for a Ph.D. and then hired them back.  Hired them back.  Me, George Krull, Mike Crooch, Bill Kinney, the trouble is   I   ve got a  few more stories. Some of them stuck and some of them didn   t. So I   ll  tell you, Bill Kinney is a great story but I   ll let you go on and pop in     So part of the understanding was   someone explained to me that it was  sometimes hard to get people from the east and west coasts to come to  Stillwater, Oklahoma.  That   s right.  But Stillwater, Oklahoma people would come back.  Yeah, and he knew they   d be loyal.  Great strategy.  And he knew they   d be loyal to OSU. He knew they would stay so he  wouldn   t have to fight this turnover. And it worked. I mean he basically  came here in 1960. We had no reputation to my knowledge of an  accounting program. He is the father of our accounting program. It  existed before him, but he really built a good one.  Put it on the map.  And he started our Ph.D. program in about 1969, right?  Yes.  In my senior year. We didn   t have a Ph.D. program. We were not a  comprehensive university in accounting at that point in time, so he  15  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  began that too. He built the School of Accounting.  Pat, let me back up a bit and get some of your early career. I forgot to  ask you, where did you grow up?  I grew up in Oklahoma City. I went to high school in northeast  Oklahoma City, right by Lincoln Park and the Zoo and Spring Lake  Amusement park. I was six blocks from there. Great place to grow up.  Of course, like I said, my great uncle played baseball here in 1914 and     15. My parents went here, my two uncles went here, my two older  brothers went here, my wife went here, my two children went here.  (Laughs) And if I live long enough I hope to see my grandchildren  go  to OSU . So we were steeped in A M. I was brought to my first A M  football game when I was two years old. Unfortunately, we didn   t win.  You didn   t have a choice or a chance, either one. It was already  predetermined.  Well, my dad was like many parents of OSU. He said you can go  anywhere you want to, but I   ll pay for it if you go to OSU.  Great incentive.  So I literally grew up with orange blood, literally.  What did you do after you completed your master   s degree here?  I got my master   s, went to KP and G, which was Peat, Marwick,  Mitchell back then, the CPA firm in Tulsa. Worked for them a couple of  years. Then went and tried teaching in Ada, Oklahoma, East Central  University; liked it so I went back to get my doctorate at University of  North Texas. I had been an auditor in practice, but when I went back to  school, I kind of specialized in taxation which is significant because  when I came back here, I was the only auditing professor, that   s why  Andy had hired me back. George Krull had left, and he was the only  auditing professor. So he hired me and for a couple of years I was the  only professor in auditing. But I also taught estate gift taxation. Very  unusual in our field to do both. But Andy, see he went after me. When  that auditing position opened up he looked around at where his people  were and he found me and he said   and he just tells you. Jerry, I should  never have left. I did not even have a dissertation topic yet. I just  completed my course work, I wasn   t even completed. Hadn   t taken my  foreign language exams. And he said,    I need you and I need you now.     No sane person, and you know this, would leave their Ph.D. program not  only ABD but not having started their dissertation, and yet I did. So that  kind of   that   s a story of the power of his will to convince you that you  16  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  need to do this. Of course, I wanted to come to my alma mater. And I   ll  tell you, I was under great pressure those first two years because I was  teaching full time and working on my dissertation. That took strength.  Did you have kids at that time?  And becoming a father for the second time.  Had a little girl, and then had another one while there in my Ph.D. But I  survived.  Well, just give us a sense of   what was Andy   s spiel? What was it that  made you think you had to come to Oklahoma State? What was so  compelling?  Andy, he was so super positive. The man had energy. To use words to  describe him, he was evangelistic, he was high energy     That   s a good word.  He really didn   t give you much of a chance to respond. He dominated  the conversation. And he must have been good at  being a  salesmen. I  mean, there are good salesmen and bad salesmen because he virtually  always got the results he wanted. He was a salesman.  He had that yellow tablet. And he would sit down and write. This is  what I will give you, and he would write it down and hand it to you. You  will get this much, and I   ll do this for you and I   ll do this for you.  He made up his mind that he had you before he got you and therefore  there were no alternatives.  He was just explaining how it was going to happen.  That   s right.  Yeah, he was. (Laughter)  I mean and he convinced   I can   t even explain how I made some of my  decisions.  So I can see you leave the interview and you call Kathy and you say,     Kathy you can   t believe this, but      (Laughter)  I probably said that more than once in my career. Yeah, so I joined the  faculty here in 1977, coming back. That was interesting. Like I said, I  17  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  was under a lot of stress. Three people started the same year as I did. A  guy named Don Hansen who is our current department head, Larry  Hammer who has retired, and myself. They had completed their Ph.D.   s  so they were not under the pressure   the gun like I was. By that first  year and a half   two years I was in the computer center until three in the  morning.  Oh, yeah.  I barely had a life.  I was very pregnant. My worst nightmare was that I would go into labor  in the middle of the night and there was no way to get him at the  computer center.  He was in the computer center.  And if he was in the middle of a run, then we sure couldn   t get him.  That was the old days, Jerry, when you had to run cards through     Oh, yeah   .  You had to key punch every instruction into a card.  I remember that.  Also, he gave us a salary when we came here. He was taking a little bit  of a risk because Pat was ABD and he didn   t have his topic and all this.  And he told us,    Okay when you finish, you get this bump up.    And so  he held this over his head. He had ways to make you do what he wanted  you to do.  He gave me no summer support. To get a faculty member now, you have  to give them everything. You have to give them the world, including no  work in the summer, total research, extra money to research   I had  nothing. He held money back from me to give me the incentive to work  hard.  To make sure that he would work hard.  That   s another thing that just illustrated his will. I remember coming in  to interview with the faculty and trust me, we would not even begin to  consider today hiring a person at my stage that I was at. It would not  happen. But it did happen. And when I interviewed with the faculty  there I could tell some of them were saying     18  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr     What is going on?        Yeah, what   s going on? We shouldn   t be doing this.     Well, a lot of them     But it happened. And I   ll tell you why, and this leads to another story.  Because Andy said we are going to hire Pat Dorr. I come on faculty and  the second year that I was here, maybe even the end of the first year     this is one of my favorite stories and it tells you both sides of Andy. We  were having a discussion for our faculty meetings. Andy sat at the end of  the table and he basically told      He ran the meetings.      you what was going to happen. But we had three new professors. Don  Hansen is pretty outspoken too. I will always let people know how I feel,  even in my position. And we got into discussing an issue. At one point, I  said,    Well, let   s vote on it.    And I remember looking at Chasteen who I  had known from earlier in my master   s program because he came in    69,  and this look of horror was on Chasteen   s face. We voted on it and voted  down Andy   s recommendation. Afterwards, Milton Usry told me that  was the first time the faculty had ever voted over Andy. Do you believe  that? The first time. So I kind of have a special place in the Andy  history.  Pat, were there repercussions on that?  No  Here   s the good side too. Andy, as successful as he was at ramming  home things, he began to moderate. I think in his own view   this was  my personal opinion. See that was    77 and Andy left as head of the  department  in 1982 . I think he felt like he was less successful from that  point. But to show you that he didn   t try to dominate after that, he was  still Andy, you weren   t going to change that. But we did begin to vote  on things and had more of a democracy in the department. Now, I   ve  often thought that from Andy   s point of view he probably considered  that weakness. Now, we did not. Which ties into another story, to tell  you both sides of Andy, and I mean nobody can respect Andy more than  we do, but I can   t   I was a senior in 1969 in accounting, and I had to go  on a field trip with Bill Kinney. Do you know Bill Kinney?  Not well.  He   s a Stillwater boy, grew up here. He is the top auditing researcher in  accounting academia. Number one from here. He is a fantastic guy. He  was just back here presenting a paper last month. But Bill Kinney had  19  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  just been hired as a new young professor in    68-   69, right in there. And  I   m going on a field trip, me and about three other students in the car  and Bill Kinney all the way over is just ripping Andy right in front of us.  Just, he   s really ripping his style and I mean we   re sitting there like  what   s going on? I mean     How do we react to that?  No kidding, and Bill Kinney left after one year. He went to Michigan,  ended up at University of Texas. I mean he is respected like few people  are in our profession. He could not abide by Andy   s style. Andy  dictated. Like I say, they didn   t even vote. Where Bill Kinney was very  independent, a very intelligent person. Not everybody has been able to  accept Andy   s style. It would have been difficult for me, honestly, if he  had not moderated some after    77. But our department has continued to  grow and be successful and that   s because of what he laid down. He laid  down the foundation. But he had both those sides. He could irritate  people with his aggressiveness, yet overall it built us. I mean, we owe  everything to Wilton T. Anderson.  Well Pat, sort of turn the corner a little bit. External relations, did he  maintain close relationships with accounting firms, with OSU  practitioners?  Absolutely.  Can you speak to that a little bit?  Oh yeah, I mean we   I think that   s one of the strengths of OSU and he  built on that. Our main charge was to produce graduates going into  public accounting and industry. We started the Ph.D. program in    69 but  I don   t think Andy ever viewed that as our main charge on what we  should accomplish. And so since we   re producing students to go into the  industry he felt the need to have those industry contacts. He knew  everybody. He would go to a conference   and that   s another thing about  people that are successful in marketing, and that   s what he did, he  marketed us. He knew everybody, could remember everybody   s name.  And many of us don   t have that strength.  Well, I think also too, he expected those firms to support the department.  I think he kind of farmed out better people to the firms that were helping  us a little bit more. He rewarded them for their support to the department  too.  Kathy, you probably saw the outsourcing of the placement of our  students. So you say one of the things Andy would do with good students  20  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  was he would talk to them about where he wanted them to go, which  firms and where?  And he kind of directed people.  Or if they went to several interviews, he might call them in and say how  did that go? He   d tell you the advantages of one over the other.  I remember him absolutely saying   now that you bring that up, you  need to go to Arthur Andersen. I mean he would tell people that. You  know we try to avoid that now because the firms get a little touchy about  that. But I mean, he would determine that you belong to this firm and he  would tell you and you probably went there.  Were there two reasons for that? Because I   m thinking one from hearing  your conversation that he specifically wanted to strategically place OSU  graduates.  That   s right.  The other, I heard a story, I think Lanny was telling me that he was very  good at sitting down with a student or a faculty member and talking  about their professional strengths and     Absolutely.  And what career paths would probably work better and where they  should go.  Yeah, I don   t remember thinking he was doing it all for himself or for  the department.  He was just very good at analyzing.  He was doing it for you. I think all he did for me, he believed he was  helping me every step of the way. Oh yeah, so I don   t think it was  ever   .  Did you perceive that he did it to analyze people and to understand their  strengths or weaknesses and where they might best fit?  Absolutely, absolutely.  I think he had a real good grip on that.  An example again, I think he read me well. I   ve been successful here  21  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  and you know he had to ram me through. There were people I could tell  that did not want me. I have proved that Andy read me right. I was kind  of one living evidence that he over the will of the others read me  correctly.  And he knew Pat would finish and be successful.  That   s right.  Not everybody would have taken that chance.  He seemed to sense or knew the ability, the success factors that a person  would have, and chose those superstars     That   s true.  And support them.  And the other way around, too. If he didn   t think you had it, he didn   t  give you the time of day. I think every successful person, highly  successful is probably like that.  Like a head coach in football or basketball.  Yeah.  And he could take some people too that might not have seemed like  leaders or movers or shakers, and he could make you believe in yourself  too. I think he saw some things in some people that maybe they didn   t  even sense in themselves.  He didn   t talk you into majoring in accounting. (Laughter)  No, he didn   t.  His one failure.  A question for you both, what do you feel Andy   s major contributions to  developing OSU   s programs were? Would you summarize some of  those?  Well, basically selling us. Marketing us nationwide.  He put us on the map nationally, yeah.  Honestly, we still go around about this. Public Accounting Reports is a  22  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  magazine put out by the industry, the public accounting industry. They  do a survey of the firms and active admissions and they rate schools.  Well, a lot of that   we know some substance, some marketing. Well  Andy, we had some substance, but he was building our substance, but he  knew what we were going to be and how good we could be, but he went  out and sold us as better than we were before we were that good. Well  look, he was named the first Outstanding Accounting Educator. Andy  academically was not strong. He did not have a strong research  background. He did not have a strong publication record. If you rated  him as an academician, on that side he was not strong. But man, he was  unparallel in marketing us. In going across the nation and bragging on  his superstars and telling how good we were.  Now, I say he wasn   t strong research wise, he wrote a principles book  and we used his principles, and that was a successful book. So I mean,  from a teaching point of view, he was extremely strong. From a research  point of view, he was not. Yet, he would go out and sell our research  side, even though he wasn   t a big researcher himself. So he was the  marketer. We joke sometimes that he oversold us and that he really  convinced people we were even better than we were, which there was  probably a lot of truth to that. But that   s how powerful   so it wasn   t just  his charisma and personality here, it was nationwide. Because people  believed what he said. So we climbed into the top ten of accounting  programs in the nation under Wilton T. Anderson. Now we   re still  somewhere in the top 25, but we haven   t been top ten since Andy left. A  lot of that was Andy   s personality and the ability to market our name.  One thing that   s interesting and picked up from when I was recruiting  for OSU, pick up on the statistics that OSU graduates from the School of  Accounting had, I think, in the southwest and that includes Texas and  about 5 or 6 states in this area, had the highest or second highest rate or  percentage of passing the CPA exam first time around.  Yeah     That said something that they were learning the principles of accounting  as well.  Well, I mean  in  my class, I remember there were 15 people in my  master   s class and 13 of us passed it the first time. So we were one  major success.  That   s what I mean, like usually less than half of them pass the first time.  Oh, back then it was 15  passed the first time. Thirteen out of 15 in my  master   s class passed the first time.  23  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Wow. So why he was selling the school as pretty good, it had to be fairly  good too.  Oh, we were getting better. But Andy didn   t wait for us to get better. He  sold us ahead of time. And that   s descriptive of his personality.  So obviously Andy had some good relationships with our alumni and  practitioners. Do you remember some ways he stayed connected to our  graduate program?  You mean after he left?  No, when he was still teaching, but after graduates left. Did he bring  people back to the campus? Did he have organization? Did he stay in  contact with his graduates?  Well, he always   I   ll tell you and I   m kind of a part of this history. We  always had a good Beta Alpha Psi chapter. Beta Alpha Psi has always  been one of our key   and Beta Alpha Psi is the professional honorary  accounting fraternity. We have programs presented by the firms every  other week. Actually, two programs each time. So we had two firms in  every other week, and that was one of our main contacts. Andy was a  big believer in Beta Alpha Psi. And so he supported that and that was  one mechanism for   so it wasn   t just occasionally these firms came in,  it was every other week.  I came back in    77 and helped strengthen   Beta Alpha Psi   well I  won   t say the name, but was under one advisor had kind of really drifted  off the map. I looked up some old Redskins and they weren   t even in the  Redskin in    76 and    77 or in that era, and they were on probation  nationally. When I came back and had completed my dissertation or  when I was completing it, Andy and I got together and I remember  talking about we needed to strengthen Beta Alpha Psi. And he knew it.  He knew that was part of our pipeline to practitioners. So I got involved  with Beta Alpha Psi, totally reorganized how they go about doing things.  I helped Andy start our first School of Accounting honors banquet which  we   ve done ever since and which is another contact because we   ll have  200-300 practitioners back for that banquet. So we strengthened Beta  Alpha Psi and three out of the last four years it   s been named the top  organization on campus. That   s 420 organizations. Andy was a believer.  He built that Beta Alpha Psi which is a prominent part of our program.  I remember he always had that banner in his office.  Oh yeah, the Beta Alpha Psi banner.  24  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Well, the Accounting Hall of Fame, did that start under Andy   s tenure?  Well, yeah, it did. That   s what I   m saying. I was involved in that,  starting that banquet. That   s when we started honoring what we called  the Distinguished Accounting Alumnist. The first year was just one  person, and the second year one person. Then I remember talking to  Andy, and Lanny, Andy, and I were kind of all involved in that because  we came from   well I came from OSU. So I went back further than  Chasteen did because I was an undergraduate here and my brothers had  been here. We decided honoring one a year, we   re never going to get  everyone honored. So then we started honoring like one from industry,  one from public accounting, and one from education. Well, somewhere  along the line we ran out of educators. So then we switched over to one  from industry, one from public accounting   large national public  accounting, and one from local practice and public accounting. So that   s  continued on. But that started under Andy about 1977 the year I came, or  the year after I came.  Now, when you say the Wilton T. Anderson Accounting Hall of Fame,  we just renamed that three years ago. We decided to really   we used to  do the Distinguished Accounting Alumni when honoring our students  and the program just got too long. So three years ago we separated that;  we called it the Wilton T. Anderson Accounting Hall of Fame Banquet  and that   s where we recognize them. That also appropriately recognizes  Andy as the founder of this program and who else should the Hall of  Fame be named after.  In fact, the one thing   here I am retiring in May, and the one thing that  still bothers me, our department should be called   you know many  schools of accounting are named. Well, you know what naming requires,  it usually requires the bucks. Our school should be the Wilton T.  Anderson School of Accounting. We think about it like that, but  officially it   s not. And if I had five million it would be, but I don   t know  what it takes to name a school.  Well, Pat when you retire it might be a good fund raising opportunity for  you to do.  Well, I   m serious.  Get some people together.  You say that, I may seriously do something like that. Because it should  be. I can   t even conceive of somebody coming along and giving us  5  million or  10 million and naming the School of Accounting after  someone else. That would not be appropriate.  25  Gill  K. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  Also, as you alluded to early, Kathy, he really created a lot of  scholarship money, didn   t he?  Oh, my gosh, yes.  Cover all the scholarships.  There   s been a lot of jealousy, honestly, in the College of Business my  entire career here and before me, because he raised money. We had  more money than all of the other departments combined. We still do.  When I was in recruiting years ago with the university, I think I shared  this off camera earlier, but I got to know him because there   d be some  outstanding students in high schools that would be interested in  accounting so I   d have to call the department. We were visiting one time  and he said,    Well Jerry, if you   ve got someone, if they   re really  interested in accounting, if they   ve got a 28 or higher ACT score, you  offer them a scholarship right on the spot.     Oh, yeah.  He was pretty aggressive with the scholarship money.  I can see   that shows his management style too. Man, if he identified  you as superstar     And that was very atypical because you know you bundled and packaged  a scholarship, you wait until the spring. He said this in the fall of the  senior year and they   ve got a 28 or higher, you offer a scholarship right  there.  Give it to them, yeah.  You know, and that   s why back when we were professors, if we found a  good person who did not have a scholarship or wasn   t even in  accounting yet, all we had to do was walk into Wilton   s office and say,     Andy, I have found a great student, they don   t have a scholarship,  they   re thinking about majoring.    And bam, he had a scholarship when I  walked out of that office. Lanny Chasteen, who grew up under that  management style,  did the  same thing. When I found somebody and  walked into Lanny   s office   Lanny succeeded Andy as department  chair   and same thing. Because he grew up watching Andy do this. It   s  not that easy any more. (Laughs)  So what, getting close to a wrap, what are some favorite memories that  you guys have of Andy? I mean your stories, memories kind of  26  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  favorite   .  Well, my favorite memory was just that he loved us.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean he had such an impact on both of us. We   re almost like his  children, and he treats us almost like that. When he talks about us, I  mean if Andy gets sentimental, which he   s not really highly sentimental  but kind of gets sentimental when he talks about us and some of his  people. And so we still see him.  We   re closer to him than his own son, I believe at this point in time.  Oh yeah. Just fond memories of his influence on our lives. I mean it   s  incredible. Of course, our daughter majored in accounting and in 1996  was our Outstanding Accounting Graduate. So you can say his influence  has continued through my family and to my daughter. It   s sad he won   t  be around to influence my grandchildren.  One of my favorite stories, current stories, did you hear how he met his  current wife?  I don   t know how he did it   .  This is his second?  This is his second wife, yes. I mean this is kind of reflective of his  management style. His first wife, Gwen, died of Alzheimer   s. And he  took care of her, and made sure   he kept her at home as long as he  could and took care of her through a home in Oklahoma City. And very  much, he cared for her and they loved each other dearly. But after she  had been gone a while, one of his neighbors said,    Andy, you just can   t  sit at home, you need somebody in your life.    He looked around and  determined from different groups that there was this young lady   lady  close to his age.  Yeah, young lady. (Laughter)  That he thought he might enjoy spending some time with. So he said he  gave himself a week in order to contact her. And at the end of the  week     Jackie Adair.  Her name   s Jackie Adair, and she was also a widow. He waited until the  27  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  end of the week, and it was four o   clock that day and he said,    I need to  go.    He went over, knocked on her door, and said,    I   d like to take you  to dinner.        I am Wilton T. Anderson       (Laughter)  And he took her to dinner and they ended up married.     I   m Wilton T. Anderson and I   m here to help you.     Just like he managed everything else.  Yeah, just like he managed everything else.  And this would have been   how old would he have been by then?  Must have been 80 or so.  I think he was 80, cause he   s 92 now.  And they   ve only been married what?  We   re talking about a guy in his mid-eighties going out and doing that.  And courting, and it   s such a neat story. They   ve been so good for each  other.  He   s probably very organized.  Yes, he was and the way he determined who he wanted to spend time  with.  That   s what he said way back then when he presented you with  something, you did it. Obviously, she said all right.  Just sort of, we   ve already decided, we are just going to decide where  we   re going to do it.  That   s right.  Yeah, let   s just make it happen.  Well, Pat, I am going to give you an opportunity for a final question  here. Not so much about Wilton Anderson, this is about Dr. Patrick  Dorr. You   re going to be retiring here,  what are  some of your favorite  OSU memories throughout the years.  28  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Oh, gosh.  Kathy, obviously, but aside from Kathy.  Jerry, I don   t know if I can   there   s so many, I just   you know one of  my favorite memories is just remembering my students. I mean I have  students that are some of the top partners in the big accounting firms.  The managing partner KPMG in Houston. The managing partner of  Deloitte in Denver, Colorado, that   s one of my joys. And knowing that I  had some influence on them. A measure of that which stunned me, when  they heard about my retirement over the summer, they launched a  professorship in my name and raised  420,000 in 18 days from these  people. I mean     That   s exciting. That should make you proud, very proud.  Is that a memory?  We were in London at the time and he was just hearing about this  through emails. And his eyes were just   he couldn   t believe it  happened.  I was emailing back,    Get serious.    I mean the point of it is that that is a  measure of my favorite thing is just the great students that I   ve had. And  you know, Andy, loyalty. That   s what I love about OSU and staying  here. Of course, I was an undergraduate here. But Jerry, we had almost  no turnover, very little turnover compared to other schools and  professors. That   s because the atmosphere at OSU was so positive.  Everybody still feels that. It   s incredible. So just being at my alma mater  has been fun. My kids had no desire   that tells you another thing   no  desire to go anywhere else. It was just assumed that they would go here.  But other memories, I don   t know.  We have two son-in-laws from OSU, too.  I know about one of them.  Yeah.  You know just   Beta Alpha Psi, Andy got me into Beta Alpha Psi  which I   ve done the last 15 years. I did it at the beginning of my career,  then the middle of my career I   ve worked on my research and all. The  last 15 years I   ve come back into the student orientation. Well, Andy got  me into that and Beta Alpha Psi has all these incredible memories for  me. He helped get me into somewhere along the lines of the Summer in  London program where he influenced me to look at that. We love  29  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  teaching in London. There   s just so many memories here. I walk around  campus. It   s just, I   d have to think about detailed ones. But my students.  And I want to have a reunion party when I retire in May   a Beta Alpha  Psi reunion. Try to get as many of my former Beta Alpha Psi officers  and members back.  How many years, Pat, have you been advisor to their organization?  If you add up my first years it   s probably been about 17-18. I even lose  track. I mean by far longer than anybody else. And then I started another  club TCB, Taking Care of Business. We were doing nothing as the  College of Business. You may know this being in high school recruiting,  you don   t really get into business  right away at OSU . You get a little  bit your sophomore year, but you really don   t get into it until your junior  year. So you come as a freshman, you take no business courses. We  were watching people change their mind about their major because they  had no contact with business. I saw that and started a club to go after  freshman expressing an interest in business called Taking Care of  Business. So I did that for about six years. And it rolled on, I started that  in    92. But anyway between that and Beta Alpha Psi, I   ve probably been  an advisor for a club 24-25 years out of my 33 years. And most faculty  don   t get to do that. There have been pros and cons to that. It   s cost me  on the research side and led to pure enjoyment on the student side. And  Andy, Andy   s the one that got me involved in Beta Alpha Psi, so all this  goes back to him too. But that   s probably my fondest memory, probably  Beta Alpha Psi. But I could go on. If we stayed long enough, I   d take all  day.  Kathy, any favorite memory that you have you want to share? Or expand  on that?  Oh gosh, I remember walking across the campus   oh gosh, I can   t even  remember the exact day. Cold, cold day. And Pat hands me a piece of  bubblegum and says,    Do you want some gum?    Well, gum? I pull out  the bubble gum and it   s got an engagement ring in it.  It   s on the bubble gum. It was the dumbest thing. I bet no one   s ever  done anything that dumb.  Of course, I   m not sure   now that is creative, Pat.  And then I remember     There must have been something about gum. I don   t know, I can   t even  remember. She remembers these details better than I do.  30  K. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  Gill  P. Dorr  K. Dorr  I remember working on house decorations one night for his fraternity  and somebody handing me a bucket of black paint that poured all over  me. And Pat and I going to the then University Health Center to get it  out of my eyes and everything. And while they   re doing that Pat has my  engagement ring over the sink cleaning my engagement ring to make  sure that this investment that he has   .  Sounds like an accounting guy to me. He already knows the value of that  ring.  Yeah, I mean that was a good  350 ring. (Laughter)  Yeah. I   m trying to get the image. The doctors were working on Kathy.  Pat   s over here working on the ring over here, right.  OSU   s been wonderful to us.  It   s been a wonderful experience.  It has for you, I mean you   re another one who can understand what we  believe because we   re steeped in OSU.  And can see it in our kids too.  I remember the Jerry Gill football player. (Laughter)  You go back a long ways.  I remember that. I told you, an OSU fan since I was two years old.  (Laughter)  When I played with Walt Harrison, everybody remembers Walt.  Gosh, and we beat OU. Twice.  Back to back in my junior and senior year.  That   s right.  Anyway, about you guys. Is there anything, I know you Kathy got to  move on pretty quickly, but anything that we   ve not talked about, we   ve  forgotten about or you want to share?  We   ll probably remember something later.  Oh, I   m sure we will. A whole bunch of things, but no, you   ve given us  31  Gill  P. Dorr  lots of chances, thank you very much.  You bet.  Thank you Jerry.  -------  -------
