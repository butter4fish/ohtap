 Gill. I   m visiting with Robert Sandmeyer in his home  in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Today is December 10, 2008 and this recording  is a part of the O-STATE Stories Project, a part of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Bob I appreciate you taking the time to visit  with us today.  Pleased to be here.  I wanted to visit with you about your experience in the College of  Business Administration, now the Spears School of Business at  Oklahoma State University.  Yeah, I have a hard time with that. I still call it the College of Business.  Bob, first of all can you back up a little bit before you got to Oklahoma  State University. Where did you grow up? Can you tell us a little bit  about your family life?  Yeah, I grew up in eastern Kansas. I was born in Indiana. Mother moved  us to Topeka, Kansas, early in my childhood. I was five years old. Grew  up and went to grade school in Topeka and ended up in a Catholic  boarding school, a military academy actually in western Kansas, in  Hays, Kansas and got my high school degree at St. Joseph   s Military  Academy. Also that   s where I met my wife, at one of the mixer type  things. So Hays, Kansas became really my home. After high school, I  went into the Navy and was in the submarine force for four years   three  years-plus. I was married when I was in the Navy and when we got out  of the Navy I went to work doing minimum wage-type jobs. I didn   t  have anything but a high school education at the time. Also didn   t have  the G.I. Bill which was very necessary for me to go to school.  I served in the service during the Korean War, so I was able to  6  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  participate in the Korean G.I. Bill. When that came on, after I was out of  the Navy for a couple of years, I was able to enroll at Fort Hays Kansas  State College and got my undergraduate degree at Fort Hays. Left Fort  Hays and came to Oklahoma State University   it was Oklahoma A M  at the time   and got my master   s degree. By the time I got my master   s  degree, we were Oklahoma State University. So my diploma said     Oklahoma State University.    I wrote my master   s thesis under  Raymond D. Thomas who was a long term dean at the College of  Business at the time. So my lineage goes back to Raymond D. Thomas,  which is quite a stretch of time.  Wow. Not the father, but really one of the     He really was. I would say he was the father. We had a number of deans  and directors before him. I think the history points out   Bill Kincaid  wrote a great history of our college   but he was the one that really kind  of started what is the College of Business. I look at the development of  the college and I see three people who preceded me in really laying the  groundwork for the college. Raymond Thomas of course, was one.  Raymond Thomas was not only known within the academy, but also is  known within the state. He was a tax expert, called upon to help  establish the Tax Commission of the state of Oklahoma. So he was  known, not only at Oklahoma A M but in the state of Oklahoma. And  then Gene Swearingen came on after him. Gene was responsible for  getting the college accredited by AACSB, and then Dick Poole came in  after Gene and really developed the framework of what was the College  of Business that I took over. Then we had that three year interim with  Virgil Miller before I became dean. So that kind of takes you up to the  time that     You finished your master   s degree, did you then start on your doctorate?  No, thanks for asking that. I went back to Fort Hays after I got my  master   s and taught for a year as an instructor. I remember, about mid-year,  the president of the university called me in and I said,    Gosh, what  did I do wrong? Here I am an instructor and I   m going in to see the  president of the university.    He said,    When are you going to start your  doctorate?    I hadn   t even thought of starting a doctorate. I was married,  we had three children, I was in debt, and people are starting to talk about  a doctorate? I gave him all the reasons why I shouldn   t. He said,    Well I  don   t want you to stick around here for years and years without doing  that because then you   ll just hit a dead end.     I received a call from the people at Iowa State University at the time.  They had offered me an assistantship before I came to Oklahoma State.  Actually the reason I picked Oklahoma State over Iowa State was  7  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  because I was an Oklahoma A M basketball fan growing up in eastern  Kansas and Bob Kurland was my childhood hero. Later on, I got to meet  Bob and Bob became a member of our associates and a very good friend  of mine. So it was a dream come true, actually.  But I received a call from the people at Iowa State who offered me an  assistantship for my master   s and they wanted me to teach full time, get  a living wage at the time and be able to work on my doctorate. I said,     That sounds like a pretty good idea.    I went home and told my wife and  she didn   t think it was a great idea at first to pick our three kids up and  go to Iowa, but we made the decision to move up there and I got up there  and found out they really didn   t have the program that I wanted. But  OSU didn   t have a doctorate program at that time so I really couldn   t  come back here. Then the year I was up at Iowa they brought the Ph.D.  program to OSU.  In economics?  In economics, and Russ Bough was of course our department head. He  contacted me and said,    You know we have this Ph.D. program, would  you like to come back and enroll?    and I said,    Sure if I can get the  assistance that I need.    So we worked out a deal and I came back to  OSU. At the time Dick Poolee was in the program and Duck-Woo Nam  was in the program and they were one year ahead of me.  Pretty strong company.  Yeah, I became the third Ph.D. which was awarded in 1962. I actually  left the college and left Stillwater in 1961 and went to Arizona State as  my first job, so I was an assistant professor at Arizona State. Then  during that first year at Arizona State, I received another call from Russ  Bough and he said,    Dick Leftwich is going on leave, he   s going to  South America, to Chile with the Ford Foundation. We need somebody  to teach his courses. Would you be interested in coming back as a  visiting assistant professor?    Really things weren   t working out well for  us at Arizona State, weren   t working out well for me. I didn   t care for  the situation there. So I said,    Well yeah we   d love to come back.    So I  came back as a visiting assistant professor in 1962 and I guess I   ve been  visiting ever since. That was the beginning of my long term association  with Oklahoma State.  Can you trace a little bit coming back in as a visiting professor, you  moved into assistant professor, tenure track. Can you share your  professional development there in the college?  Yeah, two of us came in at the same time. Frank Steindl and me   Frank  8  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  came in from the University of Iowa and I came from Oklahoma State  University. And Dick Poole was on the faculty at the time. Of course  Duck-Woo Nam had gone back to Korea and started his lustrous career.  I just went through the ranks, teaching and doing my research and doing  a little bit of publication and getting involved. I think Dick Poole was  responsible for this more than anybody, really getting involved in issues  that dealt with economic development in the state of Oklahoma. My area  of expertise at the time was economics of public finance. So I was very  interested in state and local finance and what was going on in the state.  Got involved with Larkin Warner. Larkin was actually on the faculty  when I was a graduate student. Larkin and I, because of Dick Poole, got  involved in a number of things that dealt with economics     Bob if I could interject here, Dick, seemed like I   m hearing you say, put  a different emphasis in the college for reaching out to the public and  being engaged     Yeah, I would say that Dick   well actually you go back and look at the  history of our deans; as I mentioned, Raymond Thomas was very much  involved in the state of Oklahoma in the outreach sort of thing. Gene  Swearingen was probably as well known in the state as anybody at the  time as a dean. Of course he went on to become the president of what is  now the Bank of Oklahoma and also the president of Tulsa University,  so he was well known in the state. But Dick brought a few of us along in  terms of trying to do more in the way of sharing our expertise within the  state. I remember a very good example of course was his association  with Henry Bellmon. When Henry Bellmon was elected to the Senate,  he called Dick and said,    I need some help in terms of the economics. I  need some expertise in economics.     So Henry Bellmon would come back and meet with a group of us that  Dick would arrange once or twice a year. We   d sit down, he would ask  questions and we   d respond the best we could. He was a great listener  and asked great questions but that   s the kind of involvement, trying to  share expertise, what little we had, with policy makers in the state. We  got involved with the Kerr Foundation; the Kerr Foundation of course  was very interested in promoting economic understanding and also we  got involved with economic education, promoting economic education  in the grade schools and the high schools. All of that was because of  Dick Poole   s leadership as dean. Larkin and I were probably the two  greatest disciples of that great man. But I think we   ve had a history of  involvement with the state.  Was this about the time when the school formed the Office of Research  and Economic Development?  9  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  I   m trying to think in terms of exactly when that happened and I   ll look  at my notes here      Would that be in like    74?  I was director of Business and Economic Research in    75. I don   t think  we had a formal Office of Business and Economic Research during  Dick   s period of time. I may be wrong on that but I don   t think so. But  we were doing a number of things. Larkin and I had a grant from the  U.S. Department of Labor and I know Dick had an operation that he was  setting up in the old Morrill Hall where he was doing some commuting  patterns-type of work with Tinker Air Force Base. Larkin and I were  involved with our grant from the Department of Labor. We set up the  manpower and research and training center at Oklahoma State  University. So Larkin and I were responsible for the first major grants to  the College of Business. Then after that, I guess it was   I   m not sure  when Dick left the college as dean. I don   t remember exactly what year  he left.  Does around    68 sound right?  Probably that. Virgil was dean after Dick, but I think there was probably  a year again between Dick and Virgil. So that would be four years and  there was a year between, probably around the late    60s to early    70s.  You know you just lose track of time and dates. I would say, the formal  set-up of the Office of Business and Economic Research may have been  during Dick   s tenure, but I don   t believe it was, I think it was later.  Bob, you were the first director?  I was the first director.  Can you share some of the stories? You touched on some of the research  projects, the scope of the things you were doing.  What we saw here was   the University of Oklahoma had something  called the Bureau of Economic Research. They were responsible for  publishing data, various economic data for the state, and we didn   t want  to duplicate what they were doing. It didn   t make a lot of sense for us to  duplicate it. So our thrust was more of trying to get faculty involved in  various kinds of funded research because that was the primary interest of  the University was getting more federal funds coming in to the  University. And business schools are particularly not in that kind of  business. We didn   t do a lot of that sort of thing. Consulting with  businesses, consulting with the state, that sort of stuff we did quite a bit  of, but we were not really into doing a lot of federal funded research. As  10  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  I said, Larkin and I were the first to receive a major grant to the College  of Business from the federal government. So we were trying to get  faculty involved in research as much as we could, facilitating their  research, but my major thrust was trying to get an econometric model  started for the state. The reason I wanted this was to work with the tax  commission so that we could help the tax commission better understand  how to project what they were expecting to receive in the way of  funding.  Bob could you explain the econometric model a little bit? Not in detail.  I   m not capable of explaining it in detail. Actually an econometric model  is essentially a mathematical model of what happens in the economy and  the state. Of course what we needed to know was what was happening at  the national level and international level because that   s going to have  some impact of what we   re doing in the state. So we had to tie in with a  national model, which the model we tied in was the Wharton Model. So  we got our national projections from the Wharton people and then we in  turn developed the mathematical model, statistical model for the state of  Oklahoma. People who were responsible for that were guys like Ray  Grimes who I hired when I became dean; I hired him in as the director of  our business research. Jerry Lage was involved very much in helping us  develop our econometric models.  We worked with the tax commission and we did a lot of simulation work  with them. I had a graduate student, a Ph.D. graduate student who  became very much of an expert in simulating various kinds of scenarios  for tax commissions to forecast, and he became a consultant with the tax  commission. We had a very strong tie with the tax commission, they  were helping fund us. The Kerr Foundation was helping fund us. We  started popular-ising this thing, first by getting the old Fidelity Bank to  underwrite us, to put out our little pamphlet. A guy by the name of  Wilfred Clark who was the CEO of Fidelity before the oil fiasco stuff  came in Penn Square Bank and that kind of stuff. We had some real  good business and public support of our model.  Brought a lot of attention to the college?  Yeah, we started publishing it once a year and then we would have our  forecast sessions in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, we would invite people in  to listen to what we forecast for the state. I was working with one of the  banks in Oklahoma City where I was going around the state with them  and I would give little talks about the state of the economy. So we still  do that, it   s part of what we still do.  Bob did most of your projections come out pretty good?  11  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Yeah, well they did until we hit    82. (Laughter) I was traveling around  the state and as I was going from one speech to another I was seeing the  economy going down and down and down.  Did your mark keep changing for different locations? (Laughter)  I think the bank went under and I quit doing it. (Laughter) Yeah we had  some times where it wasn   t too good.  You became dean of the college in     1977.  At that transition moment, where was the college in your opinion,  looking back now, and where did it need to go?  I think you need to understand where business education was because  that impacted where we needed to go. Business education in the United  States has had a very interesting history. In the old days   that was prior  to 1960   business education was very trade school, very descriptive. I  remember joining the faculty at Arizona State, of course I got my Ph.D.  in economics, not in business. Economics was in the business school at  Arizona State and I checked into my office, which was on the fourth  floor, being the latest hire and the lowest on the totem pole. I was  walking down the hall and I saw this mock up of a department store  window with mannequins and the whole thing. I thought,    What in the  devil, are we sharing this building with home economics?    So I went  down for coffee with the rest of the faculty and I asked about the  window and they said,    Oh that   s marketing.    And I said,    What do you  mean marketing?    and they said,    They teach kids how to trim a  window.    So that describes, somewhat, what business education was  prior to 1960.  People were really upset at what we were turning out. We weren   t  turning out great products for what was happening to modern business.  There was a group that was sponsored   two guys sponsored by the Ford  Foundation. And I don   t know if Dick went into this or not. It was called  the Gordon-Howell Report, and there was also a Pierson Report in 1959.  And essentially this is what they said,    Business education is terrible. It  needs to be changed. And the way we   re going to change it is we   re  going to select Centers of Excellence.    This is the Ford Foundation.     And we   re going to put money in these Centers of Excellence.    At the  time they were talking about, not talking about, but they put about  35  million into these Centers of Excellence. These Centers of Excellence  just happened to be Carnegie, Stanford, Chicago, Harvard, and  Columbia.  12  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Surprise.  Now they are in the top ten schools today. These five schools are going  to be in the top ten every time. They set the standard for what we were  then to do for business education. That was the whole idea; this would  then spread out among the rest of us. What transpired after that was that  the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business had to buy  into this sort of thing because this was our accrediting body and our  accrediting body then needed to develop the curriculum for the rest of us  to follow that we   re going to be accredited. Of course at the time, Gene  Swearingen was dean and he was going through this period of transition  of trying to move us from what we had before to what was expected of  us now. That   s exactly the time that I came into the business school to  start learning something about what business education is all about. I  think this is a tremendous   this is the background which in we  developed our curriculum in the College of Business.  Now the College of Business, I would say   I guess I   d call them    mega  trends    during that period of time, what happened after that sort of thing  that caused us to be what we are today. I would pick out several. The  first thing I would pick out is women. What happened to female  enrollment? When I became dean about 31  of our undergraduate  enrollment was female, and almost all of them, or a large number of  them, were in the traditional secretarial business education type of  programs. When I left the dean   s position, over 50  of our  undergraduates were female and none of them were in the traditional  business education, secretarial administration because we no longer had  those programs.  There were two things that came along that I saw needed to change. One  was women were becoming more dominant in our enrollment and they  were moving into the areas like accounting   particularly became very  popular with women   but managing and marketing. Another thing that  was happening at that time was that we were going through a  technological transition. When I became dean, the largest capital outlay  that I had was typewriters.  Typewriters?  Typewriters. We had typing labs in the basement of the business school  because we had a two year secretarial program. We had a four year  secretarial program. We had an undergraduate degree in business  education, we had a master   s degree in business education, we had a  doctorate degree in business education. We had five programs in  business education. And we had a very large laboratory of typewriters;  then computers came along. We had a big discussion with Jay Boggs,  13  Gill  Sandmeyer  big computer vs. distributive computing. Of course Jay was the big  computer guy and we were distributive. But that was not any different  than what was going on in business. We went down to Halliburton and  they were having the same kind of arguments. Do we want those  computers out in the offices of everybody? We were going through that  transition as well. So we were bringing in computing, the women were  moving out of business education and I had typewriters. (Laughter)  That   s the wrong side of the trend.  What was happening at about the same time, this is the early    80s, was  that we were having difficulty with budgets. We had gone through a  very rapid growth in our budget and then we had a decrease in budget.  By the way, these women going into the college, not only was it an  internal shift in the enrollment, but it was also coming from different  parts of the campus, from education, from home economics, from every  other area, coming into the business school causing a tremendous  growth. We had a fabulous growth in the late    70s, early    80s and we  were faced with budget cuts. So what I had to do is I had to figure out  how are we going to accommodate this tremendous growth in our  enrollment, needing more faculty. How am I going to get computing into  the college? Because that was absolutely necessary. The only way I  could do that would be to reduce programs, so we took out the five  programs that I just talked about. That was kind of traumatic because we  had to deal with faculty and primary faculty. So we were able to do that  and that started to accommodate our need for that.  Then what we saw was a situation that was developing in Tulsa, the  University Center at Tulsa. Tulsa wanted their own university, of course,  and the state regents wanted the University Center at Tulsa. The College  of Business at OSU was located in Stillwater; not a major business  community in the city of Stillwater and that   s not a knock on our  businesses, it   s just not a major center of business. We needed a  movement into a major Center of Business. University Center at Tulsa  came along and I happened to be selected to serve on the committee that  would draw up the guidelines for participation in the University Center.  I said,    That   s an opportunity for us.     So Thurman White was the head of this committee. Thurman was the  Mr. Continuing Education person for the state of Oklahoma. I started  working with Thurman; I thought some way we needed to make it  possible for us to be there. What would be the best way to be there? I  wanted a master   s program there because that   s what faculty would be  willing to handle it, we couldn   t handle an undergraduate program. We  had a major growth on campus which we couldn   t handle and I wanted  to be in Tulsa with our program because it was necessary for us to be  14  there. So I was able to get written into the guidelines that we would  select programs based upon geographic location, the closest and the  highest level of accreditation. Well we just happened to be the closest     closer than OU, let   s put it that way   and we also had the AACSB  accreditation for our program which Northeastern didn   t have and  Langston certainly didn   t have. So we were able to put our MBA  program there.  We got our MBA program there and then said,    Now how do we get  some kind of recognition, how do we bring the business community  along?    So every year we went off the college went to a planning  session in Ponca City, every Spring. We   d have a two or three day  planning session. We kicked this around and I threw a challenge out to  Jim Hromas who was the Director of our Executive Education Center  and I said,    Jim, we need to have an outreach program that helps us  bring in the business community because we have an MBA there now  and we need some recognition.    Tulsa Business Forum, that was the  beginning. We started out very modest and became the most popular  thing going in Tulsa and we were then able to really get attention to  what we were doing in Tulsa in way of graduate education. So our  graduate education and our outreach program kind of meshed there.  Then after our Tulsa Business Forum we kicked off the Executive  Management Briefing Series in Oklahoma City which has been going  for over 20 years now and has been very, very popular and I think has  brought a lot of recognition at least within the state of Oklahoma to the  college. Also what was happening during the same period of time was  globalization issues. We couldn   t be sitting here in the state of  Oklahoma and not think about global business because we were sending  kids to Halliburton, we were sending them to Exxon, we were sending  them to places that were doing business globally. So we needed really to  think in that direction. I asked Dick Poole, who I knew I could get  something going if I had Dick Poole directing it because he was going to  make sure it happened. I asked Dick and Dick was retired at that time     not retired, he was still teaching, he taught an honors course in  economics. But anyhow, I asked him to chair a committee to look at how  we could internationalize our curriculum. Guys like Steve Miller and  others served on that particular committee, and Dick with I think  primarily Steve Miller   s help, brought together a program for  internationalizing our curriculum, which then allowed us to offer an  undergraduate degree in international business. We also tied that in with  another major, however, like marketing or finance, because we thought  our kids would go out with a degree in marketing, finance or accounting,  but if they went out with a degree in international business they  wouldn   t be able to get a job. So we wanted to be able to tie the two  together. We had globalization as an issue.  15  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Another issue was that we had people around the state who wanted an  MBA degree but they were in companies and they didn   t have time to  take classes full-time so we started doing distance learning   distance  education through our Distance Education Center which was terrific for  us. We had people enroll at Halliburton, Conoco, Ponca City, Phillips,  Bartlesville and our MBA program went statewide. So those were kind  of the issues that we were dealing with during this period of growth. I  think we laid a pretty solid foundation.  You mentioned some names. Who were some of the people you brought  on board during your administration to help drive some of the vision you  had?  First of all, we had some terrific department heads and real stability  within the department heads. When I first became dean we had people  like Wilton Anderson and Dick Leftwich   people who had been around  for a long period of time. Then as they left, we brought in other folks. I  inherited from Dick a structure that was very good for the college during  Dick   s administration. In fact, he had reorganized the college to get rid  of a lot of departments   we had more chiefs than we had other folks  running around there. So he really consolidated and pulled together what  was called Administrative Services and Administrative Sciences, so he  really pulled it down to four departments.  Administrative Sciences was marketing, finance and management.  Heading that Administrative Sciences was Wayne Meinhardt and Wayne  did a terrific job. But Wayne was in management and he was responsible  for the three functional areas of business in addition to accounting and of  course we had economics. Then Administrative Services was essentially  business education and business law. So I was able to eliminate business  education and secretarial administration and then I was able then to  break up Administrative Sciences. Wayne Meinhardt stayed on as Head  of Management and then we had some   didn   t have critical mass in  finance at one time, but we brought on Steve Miller as Head of  Marketing and Lanny Chasteen became Head of our School of  Accounting. Then we had several in economics, they had a rotation in  economics. So probably I would say, in terms of the academic side, our  strength and leadership was in management, marketing and accounting,  and eventually we were able to bring finance along. In outreach, I think,  was Jim Hromas and his staff, they did a terrific job. We did many,  many things in     Because of your outreach activities, I   m sure you have a lot of corporate  relationships to the college and perhaps some fundraising opportunities.  Can you discuss some of those?  16  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Thank you for reminding me of that. One of the things that I inherited  actually from Virgil Miller, Virgil was only in for three years   he was  one year getting acclimated, one year fighting with Anderson and  Leftwich and one year looking for a job. So Virgil didn   t make a great  impact on the college but he did leave us with one thing that we were  able to build on and that was called the College of Business  Administration Associates. Virgil   s idea was to bring in these guys and  they would provide us with advice on how to do things. He didn   t really  have a good concept. He brought in people that were not very high in the  organization and couldn   t do you much good other than provide advice  that wasn   t very good. (Laughter) I looked at that and I said,    Gee, I   m  not even sure I want to keep that thing around.    I started talking with a  few people and again, calling in guys like Hromas and a guy that really  helped me a lot that didn   t get a great deal of credit was a fellow by the  name of Rudy Greer.  Rudy was a student of mine at the undergraduate and at the graduate  level and he went to work for Exxon. When I became director of  research, I needed somebody to help me and I talked Rudy into coming  back and working on his doctorate and helping me in the Office of  Business and Economic Research. Well he ended up doing all of his  course work but he never finished his dissertation. When I moved to the  dean   s office, I brought him to the dean   s office and Rudy is just my  alter-ego.  And John Bale, I must mention John Bale because, bless his heart, he  was one of the best associate deans around. He was an associate dean for  Dick Poole. He served as an interim dean twice. He handled all the  undergraduate stuff that I didn   t have to mess with. He was just terrific  as an associate dean. We had a very lean administrative structure, but  very good.  Getting back to the associates, Rudy and Jim Hromas and I ended up  drawing up the guidelines for the associates and one of the things we put  in there was    To become a member of the associates, you had to make a  certain amount of financial contributions to the college.    We set it at   1,000 a year or so much in terms of an endowment, scholarships and  such and such. Jerry, when I became dean, our endowment was  85,000.  Your endowment?  Our endowment.  I don   t want to ask what you were raising a year in regular     That was the scholarships. We had nothing in terms of external funding,  17  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  but you have to remember that we didn   t start a foundation until the  early    60s.  The University was behind the curve then.  Way behind the curve. Way behind the curve, and didn   t get into that  business until Dick started and really got that going in the early    60s,  and he had some problems early on with that. So we had a problem of  getting money, of bringing money in so we could do some of these  things that we talked about. And lo and behold we developed a very nice  group of associates. I don't remember exactly how many we had at the  time, but we would have two meetings a year. We   d bring them in and  we developed certain kinds of committees that they could work on  during the year. We were aiming at people who were at the top of the  organization as opposed to middle management, human resources type  people, and were able to get quite a few of those folks.  Bob can you name some names?  Yeah, Larry Bump was one. He was one of my first ones. Bob Chitwood  was one. Ed Keller was one, Bill Ulrich, Arthur Anderson was another.  Bob Kurland. Bob Kurland was a graduate of the College of Education,  actually, but he was with Phillips. He was a Senior Vice President of  Phillips Petroleum Company. He was able to get us around Phillips.  People in the banking industry too as I recall.  We had Don Doty from Bartlesville. Don Doty was a graduate of the  College of Arts and Sciences, became one of our College of Business  Administration honoraries   hall of fame people. First non-business  school person to become     Gordon Greer.  Gordon Greer was one of our associates. So we had some very good  people.  And I   ll brag on you a little bit, Bob. As I recall the College of Business  Administration was the first college to have these and became a model  program for other colleges to copy.  It did. Actually, the dean who really picked up on this was Dean of  Human Environmental Sciences. She came in and did a terrific job. She  had a job to do, but she did a terrific job with that college. The associates  program over at her college, she took a number of things that we did  over at her college, but she did a tremendous job over there and yeah,  18  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  became a model. College of Education also did. John Lenahan is another  person and John   s still doing a tremendous job for the University.  I think even Bob McCormick.  Yeah Bob, locally Bob was great.  You had success with this in the College of Business Administration, but  also corporate giving seemed like has really increased significantly.  Our associates, as I said, we had an  85,000 endowment. We made  money off of the Tulsa Business Forum, which we were able to put back  into other programs   developing other programs was the whole concept  of that. But we were also able to build on the associates program tied in  with the regents program for endowed chairs. The first endowed  professorship we had in the College of Business was the College of  Business Administration Associates Professorship. We challenged it. We  came and said,    Look let   s try to do this and make it the first one.    By  the time I left the dean   s office we had thirteen endowed positions.  One part of your strategy or model, it wasn   t the money so much you  were getting from the associates themselves, eventually you were able to  tap into their companies and their corporations and businesses.  Absolutely. It   s all tied together. If a business school is not tied in with  the business community then you   re not a business school. That   s part of  what we do. I think that through my predecessors who were very active  in the state and I was able to carry some of this stuff on, our business  school became a lot better than the one down south.  I think your concept of the associates was also, in terms of curriculum,  looking from the outside in, internships, model relationships, and  placement for students. A lot of centers here now.  When it   s all said and done, you   re going back to what   s best for the  student and if you can place your students; we had to have businesses to  place our students.  Well the Conoco Spirit Scholars Program started from the early days  with Phillips, even before the ConocoPhillips merger, but those things  tie onto each other and spurred some momentum.  We developed a scholarship program that I   ve very proud of. Again, it  came in conversation that Rudy Greer and I would sit down after five  o   clock, after everybody had gone home and that   s when we would have  our conversation. We talked about a scholarship program and he said his  19  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  daughter was going to some school in Arkansas, I forget which school it  was, but it had something called a Scholar Leader Program. He said,     It   s not a real large endowment, it   s just to get them involved in  leadership.    And I said,    That sounds like a great idea. Why don   t we  start something like that here? We   ll call it a Scholar Leader.    We now  have several million dollars in our Scholar Leader Program.  Do you know how it started, who we first got a big chunk of money  from? A big chunk for us was, gosh I wish I could remember his name  now. First thing that goes is that you can   t remember names. It was a  man. He wrote us a letter and you could tell he was quite old, it was in  long hand. He said,    I   m a 1920-something graduate of the College of  Business and I want to leave some money to the college, but I want you  to take care of my housekeeper.    (Laughter) We went over to the  Foundation and said, look take care of this for us. But he ended up  giving us  300,000. That was the biggest chunk of getting our Scholar  Leader Program. Don Doty gave  100,000. Others started coming along  after that. So it   s become quite a program. Who we selected was based  on scholarship at their high school and also leadership types of activities  in their high school, and when they came in, we wanted them to do  things in addition to just taking coursework. Then we got that tied into  our summer abroad program, which has now become our Summer in  France and Summer in London programs.  Part of the international component.  Right. So the scholarships became very important to us. I noticed that  we   ve gotten   the Spears School just recently had a scholarship banquet  and I was amazed at the number of kids that were there for the  scholarships.  Thousands and thousands of dollars in scholarships.  Fabulous program.  We talked about a lot of successes, but looking back on your tenure as  dean, what were some of your successes, failures, maybe some of your  frustrations, things that didn   t work as well for you, milestones; can you  share some of that information with us?  Yeah, I   m trying to think about, I guess I don   t think of it in terms of  what worked and what didn   t work. I think the things that worked the  best were the things that we developed. Let me say that outside forces  caused us to do certain things. I mean, you   d have to be a dummy not to  do these things. But one of the things I think that really helped us along  in sort of the middle period of my being dean was the Centennial  20  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Program. It was the OSU Centennial Program. Every year   you  remember this   every year we   d go off as a university as a planning  group. Every college was challenged to come up with a Centennial Plan.  You know what ours was? Tulsa Business Forum. We went from the  university planning thing to a college planning thing and I said,    Okay  guys, we   re challenged to do this, what are we going to do?     So the extension of our MBA program to Tulsa, the extension of our  MBA program statewide, the Tulsa Business Forum, the connection with  our associates, all of that was part of a challenge that we had to do  something greater than we were doing before. So I think a lot of what we  achieved came because we had external stimuli, whether it was within  the University, whether it was within the state, whether it was nationally,  with our accrediting body. What was it? I found and I think Dick Poole  would say the same thing, our association, my association with the  AACSB was very helpful because I could see what was going on  nationally. I served on the Executive Committee of AACSB.  Can you spell that Bob?  American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business. I think it   s  called something else now, but it is still the same thing, still the same  acronym. But I was on the executive committee. I chaired the continuing  education committee. I chaired the international committee.  Any of the accreditation teams?  I served on I don   t know how many accreditation teams.  You looked closely at a lot of schools, then.  A lot of schools. As my tenure as dean I probably chaired accreditation  teams   visitation teams to around 20 or 30 universities around the  country. Small, large, some more prestigious than others, some less  prestigious than others. We found that every time I made one of those  trips I learned something. I learned something that we could possibly use  within our program. So again, it   s external stimuli. Finding out what   s  going on in business education around the country.  From your perspective of other schools that you were visiting on  visitation teams and looking at at the time, how did you view Oklahoma  State, how did it fit in the general college? An honest evaluation.  An honest evaluation, I think we   re very good   we   re very good at, as a  state land-grant university, I think we do very well. The worst thing that  happened, in my opinion, to higher education generally, but business  21  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  education in particular were the damn ratings by U.S. News   World  Report and all that sort of stuff. I think it does absolutely no good. If you  take the top ten universities that are rated every year by U.S. News,  everybody knows who these are. You don   t need a rating service to  know who those are. And you know what, they   re all graduate programs,  they   re not undergraduate programs. Now we have at Oklahoma State  University, we have a major undergraduate commitment. That   s our  bread and butter.  State mission mandate.  If I could wave a magic wand and say,    Let   s do something much  better.    I would say let   s do something better on the undergraduate level,  absolutely, because we have built our graduate programs on the back of  undergraduate education. What we   ve done is we   ve taken our faculty,  some of our best faculty, and put them in graduate education and put  some of our least experienced faculty into undergraduate education. And  that   s not where we are. We   re not the most prestigious Ph.D. granting  institution in the country. That   s not us. It just isn   t. I don   t care what  they say. And it never will be, in my opinion. Do we do a decent job in  graduate education? Yes. Do we send our Ph.D.   s out to the most  prestigious universities? Will we ever? No, because the most prestigious  universities exchange their faculty with one another. We don   t play in  that ballpark. So I would say if I had anything to do with it again I   d say,     Let   s put our best faculty doing undergraduate and master   s work.     Did Wilton Anderson have that right? In accounting, he taught those  introductory classes, he had a system where he would pick his  superstars, undergraduate and maybe at the master   s level, and he  would send them off to get their Ph.D. and then bring them back to  Oklahoma State.  And I tell you what, there   s one department within the college that had it  right in terms of undergraduate education, and that was accounting. The  reason, it was very practical because you get your undergraduate degree  in accounting and you go work for an accounting firm and you get your  CPA. When Wilton was hiring faculty, he required that they all get their  CPA and that would be unheard of now. I mean you couldn   t do that to a  faculty person. All this stuff has been put on us by accreditation.  We had a dean of the business school at VPI. This guy was named Billy  Mitchell. Billy Mitchell came from Alabama. And Billy said one time,  he was a very humorous guy and he built the program at VPI. He went  into VPI and it was very much like what we had in our Department of  Business. He really built a decent College of Business out there. He  retired from VPI and went back to Alabama and became dean at  22  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Alabama for four or five years. We were sitting around one time, and I  said,    Billy, when are you going to give up being dean?    He said,     When I find a faculty that reads as much as it writes.    (Laughter)  Maybe never   We went through this going back in time again, going back to the  Gordon-Howell report, we were two trade school and then we became  maybe too much research oriented and not enough practice oriented.  And that   s kind of where accounting had a one up on us, because they  had that real tie to the profession through their CPA and their  undergraduate education, so it   s always been kind of a stream with  accounting, but it hasn   t been a stream with the other departments as so  much as it has with accounting. Now the career path was very well  defined, either public accounting or corporate accounting.  Looking back on your tenure, some major milestones, and some you  touched on in our conversation, but what are some moments you  remember when you arrived at some key events in the college?  Well I think in terms of our outreach, certainly our econometric model,  our Tulsa Business Forum, our executive management briefings.  Distance learning programs.  Distance learning programs. Another program that we did in our  outreach that I   m quite proud of is every year the dean of the business  school at OU and I got together and played golf. We talked about what  we could do together which was very difficult because faculty frequently  don   t want to do things like that together. But one thing we said we  might be able to do is a corporate program, a continuing education  program   management development program. So he and I went around  to various companies and said,    Would you sponsor this?    Well if you  go in there by yourself, they say,    We can   t do this for you if we don   t  do it for OU.    So we went in together and they couldn   t say that to us   Great strategy   We went to the firms around the state and lo and behold we got support  for this. I thought it was quite an innovative thing, and it   s still going  today. So we have that executive development program still going. I  think our Scholar Leader Program, our Summer in London program  really took off. You know the person who drove that   there is always a  person or somebody that comes in and has an idea. Jim  James  Jackman  came into my office and he said,    I   d like to do a Summer in London  program.    He   d been to London on a sabbatical and did some post-  23  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  graduate work over there in international law. He said,    Why don   t we  try this Summer in London program?    I said,    How are we going to do  that?    and he said,    Well I   ll try to get enrollment and charge students so  much and we   ll get a contact with a university over there and we   ll start  working on it.    I said,    Well let   s do it if you can do it.     Jim went around and posted things on a bulletin board around the  university and went to various colleges around the state and posted stuff  on the bulletin board. Called in extension and of course they helped  direct the thing to start out with, again because we were able to get some  money from the Tulsa Business Forum, we were able to write a program  for a Summer in London. Jim was a real pain in the rear on this, I mean  he was just a driving force on this thing. He ran that program for several  years, working through extension.  Jim then became my assistant dean at Zayed University when I was in  the United Arab Emirates, and of course that   s where his wife murdered  him, so we had that tragic ending to that story. But Jim was a driving  force in that Summer in London program, which is now probably the  most popular student program that we have going. And like I said,  extension now has moved it on into Paris and other places around  Europe. I   m sure the dean will be able to tell you what programs they   re  looking at now, but they   re looking to extend it beyond where they are  now. The Scholar Leader, that all tied together. I think some of the real  accomplishments we made were things again that were forced on us  because of budget constraints. We had to consolidate certain programs  and we had to say we can   t do these things anymore because we had to  do other things. But I   m extremely proud of the leadership that we had  within the college.  Looking back, what gives you the most sense of pride in your tenure?  One thing?  Anything. Just some things that you look back with special pride for  you?  Yeah, I think our associates program. I think that was a program that I   m  most proud of.  Enabled a lot of things, didn   t it?  It enabled a lot of things. It enabled me to become more acquainted with  the business community in the state of Oklahoma. I was an economist  for crying out loud. I was not in the business community. I really didn   t  know these folks and I really needed some contacts myself. So that was  24  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  very helpful.  You spent how many years at Oklahoma State University?  I first enrolled in my master   s program in 1956.  Wow. All your years of professor, the office that you created, the  deanship. How do you hope people remember you, Bob?  I don   t know. How would they remember me? I hope they put me in the  group of Raymond Thomas and Gene Swearingen and Dick Poole. I  hope I fit into that group. I   m the second longest tenure in the college. I  come only after Raymond Thomas, so I lasted long. Somebody asked me  one time,    What do you owe your longetivity to?    and I said,    Faculty.  Rapid faculty turnover.    (Laughter)  What adjectives do you think some of your colleagues and people that  knew you, alumni of the college, what adjectives would they use to  describe you?  I don   t know.  Focused, caring?  I think aggressive may be one.  Risk taker?  I think they   d say risk taker. Some would say that I threw a lot of things  up against the wall. A lot of them didn   t stick. (Laughter) But I came in  with an idea. I really am kind of an idea person. I generate thought, I  think.  A lot of focus, and tough?  I don   t know, tough I guess. I had to be tough I guess. You had to be  tough to survive certain things. Focused, I don   t know if I could say I  was focused. I mean I am kind of a shotgun type of person. I   m not that  focused.  Where do you see the Spears Schools of Business going? We talked  about undergraduate education which was very insightful.  Well I think what they   re doing, as I look at it from the outside, I think  their emphasis on international has gone down the tubes which  disappoints me. They closed the Office of International Business that  25  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Steve Miller was running. I don   t see that they have that great of a focus  anymore. They   ve moved over to this entrepreneurship which was an  area that a number of people tried to push me and I just couldn   t  generate interest. This dean has been able to generate more interest in  this area than I could.  Good gifts have helped, too.  Even before that she was able to generate interest that I was not able to  generate. Maybe it was because I wasn   t interested in it. I just didn   t see  a lot of expertise out there that impressed me and maybe that was the  reason that I didn   t. There was a wise dean one time, this guy was at  Southern Miss. These guys that come from the south have all these  sayings  Entrepreneurship has been a discussion within business  education for a long time. Can you teach entrepreneurship? That   s the  question. And I still think it   s a question. This dean from Southern  Mississippi said,    I kind of liken    it to if you take a Stradivarius violin  and you give it to a person with talent, a gift, and that person plays that  violin in such a way, it   s beautiful. You give it to another person who  doesn   t have a gift, but you give him a lot of lessons and he plays it like  a fiddle.     I think you have to have a gift to be an entrepreneur and I still believe  that. I   ll always believe that. There are certain things you can teach that  person with a gift that he will be able to use or she will be able to use.  Be it accounting, marketing, finance, how to do a business plan, these  are things that you can teach them. But an entrepreneur is different than  me. They have a certain drive. They have a certain focus that I never  had, or never will have. I think that   s true, you know it   s different. They  will not be a good dean or be a good faculty member either. So we all  have that kind of gift that you have to play on. The question comes back,  can you teach entrepreneurship? And I don   t know.  Create an environment in which they can thrive perhaps?  That   s right. So I think that   s the thrust the college is going for now  which is something that I didn   t do and probably if I were still dean, I  still wouldn   t do it. A lot of colleges are doing it and some are more  successful than others. But I see the college   they   ve been able to build  on the endowed professorship program. I   m very pleased to see that. Of  course gifts that are coming in now are much larger than the gifts we  were able to generate. But this is a process that we started early on. It   s a  process that started back when we started the Foundation. We had to  have the Foundation. We had to have the university support. We have to  have all the things right for us to get these things done. We couldn   t  have had the endowed positions had it not been for the state   s support.  26  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  Sandmeyer  Gill  That was very necessary. But I think they   re building on that and I   m  pleased to see that happen. Our faculty are getting better   absolutely  they are getting better. They are better than the faculty that we started  with and they   ll get better as time goes on. And we have some darn good  faculty. Doing some darn good things.  Outstanding students too.  Yeah.  Again, there are the scholarships and the internships and the leadership  opportunities created for them.  I think our student body is much better. One thing I overlooked and  didn   t emphasize during this time, the one thing that I missed, when I  moved out of being a faculty member to being an administrator is I quit  teaching. And that   s probably a mistake. Not probably. It was a mistake.  But I saw Gene Swearingen. He always taught a basic course in  statistics, and it was a hundred people in that course and I took that  course. But I found that as time went on Gene Swearingen   s assistant  taught the course more than he taught the course. I said,    Well that   s not  going to happen to me.    But I probably should   ve stayed more in contact  with students.  The way I tried to stay in contact with students was I had a monthly  breakfast meeting with kids from the Business Student Council. We   d sit  around at 7:30 in the morning and we   d talk about things that went on in  the college. I found out some things that were concerning to me that I  was able to take back to the department heads and faculty. But contact  with students, you lose that contact. I see that the faculty who are  honored   the people who are remembered are faculty. When you go out  and talk to alumni, they don   t talk about the dean. They talk about  professor    X   ; that   s who they should be talking about. Those are people  who really impacted their life. That   s kind of the overall good thing  about the profession we   re in.  Bob anything we left out?  No, I can   t think of anything. I could probably go on for two or three  more hours, pontificating but no, this has been fun. I   ve enjoyed this.  I appreciate it. Thank you.  -------  -------
