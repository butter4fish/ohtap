 Gill and today is December 8, 2008. I   m visiting with  Dean Sara Freedman on the OSU campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This  interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Dr. Freedman, you are currently serving as  Dean of the William S. Spears School of Business at Oklahoma State  University. I know you hold two endowed chairs. Can we back up from  that and perhaps get to know you a little more personally? For example,  where did you grow up? Can you tell us a little bit about your family and  early experiences?  Okay, sure. I grew up in North Carolina. My family was from an area  outside of Charlotte and most of my grandparents, aunts and uncles were  all in that same area. When I went off to school, I wanted to leave North  Carolina so I went to undergraduate school at Boston University. I  wanted to experience something a little different than a small southern  town. I had a great time there. Ended up going back to North Carolina  for graduate school and completed my PhD at the University of North  Carolina. Had a wonderful experience with that. And then started my  career as a faculty member at the University of Houston where I moved  into administration. I served as dean and then changed locations and  went to Mississippi State University as dean, and then came here two  and a half years ago as dean. It   s been a real exciting experience being  here. A lot of great things are going on and there are terrific people to  work with in the Spears School of Business and the University.  Are there some values and principles that you learned at an early age in  your family, some values that you   ve taken with you wherever you   ve  gone?  Well, my dad had a small-town hardware store, and I think from him I  learned the value of hard work and being willing to go the extra mile if  you need to, the importance of service and making sure you provide a  5  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  good service and product to your customers, and concern for people. It  was a small town, and sometimes you carry people during tough times  instead of holding hard and fast to things. You work with people to  accomplish things. It was a small town. As my grandmother always said,     If you didn   t want to see it on the front page of the paper, you didn   t do  it.    I think those are the kinds of things that have helped me a lot of  times to look at things and decide a course of action in a difficult  decision.  Can you share about some of your experiences in university, academic,  but also outside of the classroom? Leadership opportunities that helped  develop you as a person.  Well, let me think. One of the things I really enjoyed when I was at the  University of North Carolina, I got a fellowship to the Center for  Creative Leadership in the summer. It was a new program. They had  started working with doctoral students from across the country. It was  just a terrific experience in so many different ways because you were  pretty much free to study whatever you wanted. But you had an  opportunity to interact with probably twenty-five PhD students from  across the country, all in business, and mostly in my field, management  and organizational behavior. A lot of interesting conversations. They  were coming from different programs with different emphases, so it was  a sort of a broadening experience. It opened my eyes to all the different  things that were going on in my field.  Other kinds of experiences as a faculty member getting involved in some  of the outreach activities and interacting with business leaders really was  helpful in bringing those experiences back to my students. Trying to get  students involved in interacting with business leaders while they were in  the program, those kinds of things, I think, really made a difference. The  textbook kinds of things are relatively straightforward, but it   s those  extra things, I think, that make a real difference to our students. And one  of the real strengths at OSU is we have an alumni base who are willing  to come back and share their experiences.  I assume that as a student you had been involved in several leadership  activities that, sort of, set your career path in that direction. Could you  share some of your leadership experiences as a student?  Well, as a student, I was involved in the doctoral student organization  and played an administrative role over the course of the years, and just a  variety of different kinds of things. My undergraduate program   I was a  psychology major as an undergraduate, so I was involved in psychology  student group.  6  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  There   s got to be a story there. You changed from psychology over to  business in graduate work?  Yes, I really enjoyed psychology and was most interested in normal  people behavior. I really wasn   t interested in counseling. As I started  looking at career opportunities, I found that I was most interested in  management and organizational behavior, the topics that had to do with  how you can improve the workplace by understanding motivation,  leadership, other kinds of things, so you could design systems to support  the kind of productivity, commitment, values that you would like to have  in the work force.  You talked earlier about growing up, your dad managing a hardware  store. Did you work there? Did this influence some of your thinking?  Actually, he never really wanted my brother or me to work there. Now,  he was more than happy to have us work for his colleagues in the  business community, so I had a variety of summer jobs, working one  retail job at sort of a small-town K-Mart, if you will, and manufacturing,  and other kinds of jobs. A lot of different kinds of things over the course  of high school and college.  The town again that you grew up in was   ?  It was a little town called Albemarle. It   s about an hour   s drive outside  of Charlotte, North Carolina.  Population?  Around 10,000 if you counted the visitors that were passing through.  (Laughter) And that was on Saturday also?  Yes. (Laughter)  So, you were dean at a couple of schools before you came to OSU?  Right.  Was that helpful in having had those experiences before you come in as  a first time dean at Oklahoma State?  Sure. I think having a dean   s experience before   there are things that  deans do that aren   t typical faculty activities. In particular, fundraising  and spending a lot of time with alums. So, having a little bit of  experience doing that before makes it easier to step into those things  7  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  quickly in a new occasion.  How   d you learn about the position at Oklahoma State University? Is  there a story about how you got to OSU?  Actually, I had been on the Accreditation Review Committee in 1998, so  I knew a bit about this school. But, more importantly, I had known Gary  Trennepohl from History. When he was in Texas and I was in Texas, our  paths crossed, and Gary gave me a call. He asked and said,    You know,  our dean   s position is open. You were on the Accreditation Committee  when I was dean over there. Would you have any interest?       Well, I   m  happy where I am.       Well, maybe you should look into it; always keep  your options open.    So, I came and interviewed, and once I saw how  great the place was and what good things were going, it was hard to  resist   Tell us about the interview process. What did you learn about Oklahoma  State University   s department during the interview process?  During the interview process, I think the thing that stood out most were  that there were a lot of things that were going well in the business  school. A strong faculty and academic programs, a lot of opportunities  for continuing to grow and develop, a supportive environment, alumni  actively involved. There were a lot of positives about this school. Not to  say that everything was perfect. We need a new building and other kinds  of things as well, but certainly it was a positive sort of place.  Building on your comments for my next question, what was your  assessment early on in terms of traditional strengths of Oklahoma State  University, maybe some of its areas where it needed improvement?  I think clearly one of the things that schools the size of Oklahoma State  University typically don   t have are the outreach programs that we do     primarily through our Center for Executive and Professional  Development. But the kinds of speaker series like Tulsa Forums and the  Oklahoma City Management Executive Briefings, you don   t usually see  that in the size of school that we are. Those are just wonderful programs.  The speakers that we bring in, the service it provides to the Oklahoma  Business community, it   s just incredible. So, that was a real strength on  the faculty who also participate in those programs and provide executive  development opportunities for folks who are looking for specific schools  or just advancing careers. So, the whole outreach component of the  mission of the business school, I thought, was a very big strength.  We have solid programs, academic programs, and good placement. We  have certain areas, accounting and management information systems,  8  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  where we don   t have enough students to accommodate the demand for  those students. I think a lot of companies come back and recruit our  students. They   ve got solid schools. They typically have a very good  work ethic. There is a lot of integrity amongst the students. They   re hard  working. There   s not a sense of entitlement. So, the relationships with  employers who come to recruit our students are also very strong. We  have a faculty that is committed. They are doing research and teaching.  We have faculty who have strengths in one area and we try to  accommodate and make sure that we use those strengths to help us reach  our goals and objectives. One concern, we have a lot of faculty  approaching retirement. We want to make sure we recruit outstanding  people to replace them because they   ve done a wonderful job. They   ve  left large shoes to be filled. We   re in the process of recruiting quite a  few replacements in the next five years or so.  Also, from your early assessment, some areas that you felt like needed  improvement.  Well, I mentioned the building. Our building was built in the 1960s. It  was very efficient, but it doesn   t have a lot of characteristics that many  business schools have now that actually enhance what   s going on in the  academic program, whether it   s team rooms for students who are  working on projects or open areas for interaction between classes,  studying areas for people to stay in the building. Right now we   re just a  collection of offices and classrooms, and there   s not really much for  students. It   s hard to create a student success center with the layout of  the building, and those are things that we would like to do. Other areas  that we need to work on, we always talk about budget issues. (Laughter)  You can   t leave those out, of course  Business school is faced with fairly  high salaries competitively. If you want to be in the job market for the  best faculty, salaries are tough, so trying to keep up and deal with that  issue is something that all     Maybe it will be more available out there in the pool now.  Yes, we hope so. Other kinds of things, I mean, there are things you are  always working on. And in business, in particular, we   re always  updating our curriculum, so it   s a constant challenge to make sure that in  every area we are doing the kinds of things that we need to do to make  sure our students are well prepared. Accounting is looking at  international accounting standards and how they would change what we  do in our curriculum. Management information systems, it seems like  there are always new technologies that are affecting things, and so  there   s some challenges with just keeping up.  But the broad picture, looking at the 30,000-feet level, what   s your  9  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  vision that you have for the college? Where would you like to see it go  five years from now, ten years from now?  We spent quite a bit of time talking about that when I first got here. You  know, you get a new dean, and so there   s a discussion of where the  college is and where it should be. We revised our mission and worked  on our strategic plan and talked about a lot of those issues. There were  really four things that we talked about always having front and center.  One was entrepreneurship, and I can tell you some more about our  initiatives in entrepreneurship later. Two was excellence. We wanted to  make sure that we didn   t undertake anything that we didn   t feel like we  could do an excellent job, whether it was our academic programs or our  research, that we wanted to do things to support high quality in  everything that we do.  Find some areas of excellence?  And focus on that, make sure we didn   t leave something important out  that   for instance, moving into entrepreneurship, that we don   t  undermine the quality of our other academic programs by doing so. We  were also interested in participating in economic development activities.  We saw a relationship between that and the entrepreneurship program.  But we also felt like if we used student groups and other kinds of things  we could perhaps help companies, and we   re currently doing that with  our MBA program. We have teams that work on projects for companies  that, hopefully, those companies will be able to use to make them more  competitive. I should tell you about the paddle fish project if we have  time. And the last one is engagement, that we should continue to be  engaged in the business community, whether it   s through CEPD,  through having business leaders come speak to students in classes or  CEO Day, a variety of activities to support those kinds of things.  You were talking about goal areas. Are there some targets that you are  looking at?  For each one of those and for the whole, throughout the strategic plan,  we set targets and when we wanted certain things in place and what  kinds of things we included under those areas. In some areas, such as  entrepreneurship, we   re well ahead of where we thought we would be  thanks to the gift we received from Amy and Malone Mitchell. In other  areas, the building, we   re a little behind on where we had hoped to be at  this point.  You talked about entrepreneurship. Do you want to expand on that a  little bit?  10  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Sure. Again, when I first got here, we spent the fall semester reviewing,  and we decided that entrepreneurship was an area that   we knew there  was student interest. We thought there were opportunities that would  help the state, and we felt like if we expanded our activities in that area,  it would be beneficial for everybody. So, we laid out those kinds of  things. We want to offer more courses. We want to consider a major; we  want to consider a minor across the campus. We want to create a student  organization. We have a whole list of things we wanted to do, and we  started doing those kinds of things.  Then, last year in the fall, we started talking to Malone Mitchell. He  expressed some interest in providing some support for entrepreneurship  and, as you know, we received a significant gift back in June. With that,  we   ve been able to go out and hire more people and really have been  moving very quickly on some of the goals and objectives. We   ve created  a separate department for entrepreneurship in the college, a center, a  Riata Center for Entrepreneurship. The department is faculty traditional  research, developing a curriculum for a major, developing a minor all  across campus. The Riata Center is the opportunity for students to have  hands-on experiences, work with entrepreneurs, whether it be  entrepreneurs from the business community or faculty who have ideas  for new products or services that could be turned into a viable company,  with a little bit of help from a student group writing business plans,  looking into issues of getting started. So, doing both of those, we feel  like we can make some significant strides in doing things. We feel like  we   ll be the only school that will have a truly comprehensive  entrepreneurship program. We   re putting an option into the MBA  program for students. So, there   s a lot of exciting things going on.  I noticed the OSU Board of Regents approved just recently a couple of  your new hires, department head and a new faculty member.  Right, those are our first with the gift. We   ve hired Mike Morris who  will be the department head. Mike is   let   s see. Fortune Small Business  had him in their top twenty entrepreneurship faculty, as identified by  students, entrepreneurs, and faculty, which is kind of a unique group to  get everybody to say,    This is a good person.    He developed their  program which is a top rate program. And again, the Mitchells    gift has  allowed us to hire somebody like him. Before we had the funding, we  were kind of doing it ourselves and building it up gradually as we got  more faculty involved. By bringing him, he   s going to get faculty  involved from the college, but across the campus to assist in creating, if  you will, a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation, trying to develop  new opportunities and new ways of doing things on campus, for the  business community, across the board.  11  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Heart and soul and the core of any new program is faculty, and I guess  the chairs program is very helpful in tracking faculty and, as you were  saying earlier, to provide leadership in the program.  Right. In addition to the two that were recently approved, we have  advertisements out and are looking at possibly hiring as many as three  more for the fall, which will give us a nice core of the people to get  things started. Before we leave that, I do want to talk a little bit more  about Mike. One of things that Mike did at Syracuse and that we had  talked about is how important it was for non-business students who  might have an interest in doing something in entrepreneurship to have an  opportunity to get exposed to it. So, if you   re an engineer with an idea  for a new product, whether you   re a music major who wants to start a  concert company and bring in concerts and those sort of things, there are  certain basic kinds of start-your-own-business skills that those students  could benefit from, and we were trying to figure out a way to get them  those skills without having to have them come take the whole MBA. So,  that   s what the whole idea of a minor is.  We also want the other colleges to offer courses that we could use as  part of that minor within. So, it may be that the Department of Physics  has a course in new technologies or something like that that we could  count towards this entrepreneurship minor, and that would support  entrepreneurship as something that that department and that college  values, not just the business school. Try to get those connections, break  down barriers between colleges so it   s easier for students to go back and  forth. And maybe the student doesn   t want to take all the minor, just  getting the introductory entrepreneurship course. But to encourage  people across campus to think about that, faculty and students.  You were talking about faculty and your plan looking forward and your  goals. Are there goals for recruiting certain types of students or certain  skills? What goals do you have in the student recruitment and  development area?  Well, certainly, and we have spent some time working on this in the last  year or so, on recruiting outstanding students. We want students who  will do well in our programs, who are going to do well when they go to  work in their career paths. So, we   ve spent a lot of time talking about  those kinds of skills. We want to bring students in who can really benefit  from the opportunities they are given. We want to get the word out to  high schools and community college transfer students about the  opportunities here and what those opportunities can do to help them as  they go into the workforce and move forward with all the exciting things  that are available for kids nowadays.  12  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Time flies, what has it been, four or five years you   ve been dean now?  Two and a half.  Gosh, it seems like longer than that. Well, looking back on the last two  and a half years, what initiatives, what accomplishments give you the  most pride?  Well, clearly the entrepreneurship thing. That is a huge transformation  for the business school as well as the University, so that   s a great area.  We   re doing things   we   re expanding our student services. We   ve  added a career counselor to our career services offices for the  undergraduates. We   ve done some things at the graduate level and the  master   s level by creating a person who helps with professional  development activities and things like that. So, I think we   re doing a  nice job with student support systems, trying to have people and tools to  help students in those areas if they need them. We   re pleased with that.  Other kinds of things we   re proud of, just generally, the fundraising. The  whole initiative this past year for chairs and professorships, the college  did very well on that, even without the entrepreneurship gift.  In about a five month window, how many million dollars did you raise?  If you include the Mitchell gift, it   s over 30 million.  Very impressive.  Yes, it is, and that   s exciting. I   m pleased we added a number of  conferences and programs with the Center for Executive and  Professional Development, for instance. We had a very successful  energy conference that we offered. That   s been well received. I guess  now we   ll be looking at our third conference hopefully this spring.  We   re trying to get the details worked out on it. But we offer that. The  spring of the first year I got here, you know, it   s like any other new  thing. We weren   t sure what kind of response we   d get, but the industry  has been very supportive. The attendance has been great. We brought in  some speakers that are very appealing to a lot of folks. We had the CEO  of Shell Law at the first one and Boone Pickens spoke at the second one,  so a lot of good things.  Speaking of Boone and fundraising, I know Boone   s gift certainly helped  attract a lot of attention to the matching gifts for chairs. We talked about  fundraising, about your dreams and aspirations for a new facility. What  are some of the things you   re looking for and what kind of facility are  you thinking about?  13  Freedman  Well, right now we   re on the Master Plan for a new facility. In fact, my  understanding is that it is something that has been talked about in the  business school for ten years or more. The thought right now is Hanner  Hall which is, as you know, an older building that   s not in very good  shape, that we would build a standalone building where Hanner Hall is  and put into that area a lot of the things that we would like as part of our  facility. We   d keep our current facility and, perhaps as phase two, we   d  do some things to upgrade it as well. What we see going into that new  facility is, first of all, a large auditorium. We bring in a number of  speakers, and it would be great to have an auditorium where they could  speak and students could come directly from their existing classes, and  we could use it for a lot of other things. We see an open area when you  come in, sort of an atrium area, where students could sit and visit and  talk to faculty between classes. We see, as I mentioned earlier, the team  rooms, some studying areas, quiet studying areas.  And then, clearly, we would like a very large, what we call a student  success center. It would be a place where students looking for any type  of assistance would go. If they need help picking out a major and the  courses they need to take for a given semester, that   s where they   d go  for that kind of advisement. If they   re coming in and saying,    Well, I  don   t know what I want to major in. I   m thinking about marketing. What  kind of job opportunities are there?    the career services people are right  there.    Gee, I   d like to get more involved. What kind of student  organizations?    It would be that sort of thing. It would be one place for  students having trouble in a course, looking for how they get tutors,  anything like that. Anything that would support students in being  successful in their academic programs and enriching their academic  programs would be available in that one place.  We would want it to be a friendly place where you walk in and there are  plenty of seats. There   s some computers where you can check your  email while you wait, so that it   s a friendly, comfortable place to walk  in. Students feel comfortable wandering in and saying,    Oh, I   m  thinking about taking    X    course at a community college while I   m  home for the summer. Will that count toward my degree program?    So,  they get answers early on, and they are comfortable and confident of  what they   re doing is going to work. So, that front and center. I envision,  we don   t have real drawings yet, but as you walk into this atrium area  and at one side of this atrium area is this student success center.  We also want the Riata Center to be close by. We want students to feel  comfortable wandering into that area and talking with the director of the  center and executives in residence about their ideas for new companies  or new products, and just having a place to bounce their thoughts off and  get some feedback and reaction. Those are critical. What other kinds of  14  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  things? We certainly want state of the art classrooms and a mix of  classroom sizes. The campus seems to have a lot of smaller classrooms  and not so many larger classrooms. There   s discussion about creating an  area for the graduate students that is somewhat separate and has some of  the same kinds of functions for graduate students that you see in the  student success center for undergraduates.  Are they putting any dollar figures into that? I know it   s kind of blue  skying it, but     Probably around  60 million for this.  It seems like I have seen one version of the twenty-five year plan, and at  one time there was still in there about, maybe, a wing on the east side,  kind of balancing off of Hanner Hall, also another standalone building.  Is that part of the plan now?  It is sort of in this next phase two, phase three kind of thing. I think  phase one is where Hanner is. Phase two is doing something to upgrade  the current building, and that might be phase three.  We   re going to talk about Dean Sara Freedman. Is that okay?  Sure.  Just want to ask a little bit, if we can get to know you better. Do you  have any hobbies or special interests?  Well, I think all of us enjoy reading, the non-academic reading, whether  it   s fiction or some of the books     Do you have a particular genre that you like better than others?  Well, I must admit, I like an occasional mystery or something like that.  And then, of course, there   s so many popular press books out. We bring  in Thomas Friedman. You want to make sure you   ve read his books. So  there   s a lot of that. That   s probably what I spend the most amount of  time trying, outside of work and family kinds of issues. I may have  mentioned I have two grown sons. They are very important. I try to  spend time with them as much as I can.  Grandkids yet?  No grandkids yet. My oldest son just got married this past summer. That  was a big deal  (Laughter)  15  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  I bet it was.  Yes, it was fun.  Any strong likes or dislikes?  Well, I guess one of the things that concerns me   and I haven   t seen this  as much over here as you get elsewhere   are students, or anyone for that  matter, who have a sense of entitlement. I think those of us who have  taught, other business deans at conferences and places talk a lot about  students who are somehow   they   ll come into their academic setting  and then into the workforce with an attitude of    I   m here. What can you  do for me?    as opposed to    I   m here. I want to work. I want to be  successful. I want to learn.    There   s a general sense that in some places  that   s definitely increasing, and I think all of us are concerned. I do  spend a lot of time with our accrediting body, AACSB. I   m on their  board, and I   ve served on a number of accrediting teams over the years.  So, you interact with other deans and you look at their student bodies  and the kinds of issues that are going on, and I do think that   s a bit of a  concern.  You probably can   t help make some comparisons of OSU to other  schools. How do we come out in comparisons?  I think we do very well. Our kids tend to come from smaller towns,  more rural backgrounds. They   re used to the idea of hard work. They  play hard and they work hard. They don   t expect things to be handed to  them on a silver platter. We   ve come off very well. I think that   s a  characteristic of land-grants, just generally, and that is something I   m  proud of. It   s fun to work with our students. You don   t get a lot of  whiners and    how could you do that?    You have some of that  everywhere, but it   s certainly not as great here as it might be at some  other places.  Of course, you are a very public person. What would surprise us to know  about Dean Sara Freedman that we don   t know, from your public  persona?  Gee, I think I   m pretty much an open book. (Laughter) I don   t know that  I have this secret life that anyone would be interested in. I think I   m  probably more family oriented than some people might suspect. I mean,  my kids can get me way up or way down or cry in just a minute or two.  It   s been great watching them grow up, and I   m pleased to say, at least  currently, there are very few of the crying things.  Were you a soccer mom?  16  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  I was a soccer mom. Although, I must tell you, my oldest son, we signed  him up for soccer when he was, I don   t know, five or so and all of his  little friends were signing up for soccer so we signed him up for soccer.  The first few Saturdays we were out there, he was fine. They were  teaching him how to kick and the different plays and everything. So,  finally, they were going to have this practice game, one team against  another. Matthew was out on the field and they   re kicking the ball  around. And suddenly somebody kicks the ball towards him and all of  these other boys are running towards him, and he decided he didn   t like  soccer. (Laughter) He never had any interest in football. He was into  track and tennis, but none of these sports where you could really get  hurt.  That   s good. Those are career kinds of sports.  So, soccer mom translated into tennis and track and things like that.  You were talking just a few minutes ago about land-grant university  extension and outreach. What are some of the things that, as you  indicated earlier, you felt like were strengths of Oklahoma State  University? What are some initiatives you   re pursuing to continue that  strength and expand on?  Well, I mentioned we   re doing more conferences. In fact, we   re going to  have a marketing and branding conference this year for the first time.  We started the energy conference. We started the governor   s partnership  program; it   s a week-long executive program. We   d been offering a  week-long executive development program for the business community  for several years. We were approached and there was some conversation  begun about offering that for government employees as well,  government managers. So, we started that, and that   s been going very  well. We do that in the summer.  And we always are developing new programs offered by our faculty,  when there   s some new business concepts or ideas that we think the  business community could benefit from. It may be something like this  branding thing. It may be taking a book on good to great and having  some programs on how you would actually do that in a company, what  kinds of things you can learn and how you would change your practice  as a result of that.  So, we see again, as a land-grant extension oriented trying to connect  with the business community and to assist. I   m always saying that we  want to be seen as a resource for the business community, a resource for  students to hire for interns and full-time jobs, a resource for the latest in  business education, a resource for connecting with other business people  17  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  and meetings for our associates or opportunities to network for the  business community. We want them to think of us when something  comes up.    Oh, gee, we need to upgrade this. We need some help. Well,  maybe we can get some faculty from OSU to help us with that,    either in  a consulting role, or training program or whatever.  Are there some corporate relationships that you want to speak to that  you   ve developed closely over the years and here more recently?  Yes, OSU   s been strong with building relationships with companies. The  accounting program has been particularly effective in working with  accounting firms. It   s a two-way street. The accounting firms help the  accounting school in terms of scholarships, in terms of coming back and  speaking to students and interacting with students, and the business  school, the accounting department, provides qualified students to work  in their companies. So, it   s a marvelous relationship in every sense of  the word. It   s one that they   ve maintained and developed and expanded.  At one time it was just with big accounting firms, and now we do lots of  working with regional accounting firms and with companies who hire  accountants directly and to them. So, it   s a good example of that kind of  relationship in which everybody benefits. We certainly have great  relationships with a lot of the energy companies. They help us in a  variety of different ways with students, much as the accounting firms  have helped the school of accounting. We have scholarship programs.  There are folks who stay involved with the students and the faculty and  interact in the programs. It   s been a real good relationship.  ConocoPhillips Spirit Scholars would be an example of that?  ConocoPhillips Spirit Scholars are probably our best example of that,  because they not only provide scholarships, but they are active with the  students, they   re involved, they come on campus, they are there if we  need assistance. For instance, management information systems   we  need more students, and ConocoPhillips have been willing to send  people, to send mostly our graduates who have graduated in the last few  years, to go with our faculty and our students to talk to high schools. So,  you can talk to high school students about the opportunities, and then  you have somebody from ConocoPhillips who graduated, who is young,  talking about what they   re doing and how excited they are to be there.  Very strong internship program I think, too.  Very strong internship. Most of the students with the Spirit Scholars  program get internships with ConocoPhillips, and that   s a great  experience. If I could wave a wand in the business school and have  every student do an internship, I would. Students get exposed to what  18  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  they   re going to be doing so when they come back to school they can  understand how what they   re studying fits with what they   re going to be  doing. Occasionally you get a student who comes back and says,    I  don   t really want to do it.    It   s one thing to read it; it   s another to have to  work that way. So, that   s good. We want them to find that before they  graduate  And then the companies get an opportunity to look at the  students. A lot of times these students get job offers practically before  they finish the internship or right after they finish the internship. So, the  company gets the chance to look at the student. The company gets a  chance to shape the student a little bit, in terms of expectations of what  they   re going to be doing when they graduate, understanding how to  work in a professional environment. All of those kinds of things are  great for both parties. So, internships are something we   re encouraging  more of, as are we encouraging more international activities.  I was just going to ask you, as we move to a more global society and,  certainly, business system, how important are international internships  and opportunities to our students?  Right. They are very important. We are subsidizing more study-abroad  opportunities for students and offering more scholarships. The  University is very committed to that. Vice President Strathe has done a  great job of encouraging us to move in that direction. I think we all  recognize that students need to get exposed to those kinds of things and,  certainly in business, it is an international marketplace. It is not a local  one. So, we are doing more in terms of more study abroad, trying to  expand the number and the types of programs we offer and also trying to  make it more financially possible for students to participate in those.  You alluded to alumni earlier, and I   d like to pick up on that one more  time. From your perspective, what is the role of alumni in advancing the  school?  There are several different things that alumni can do. First of all, just  being involved and active. We have a very strong Associates program  where our alumni support activities, give us advice and guidance. Again,  with business, there   s a community out there that   s doing what we   re  trying to teach our students. So, we need to know what issues and  concerns they   re dealing with or that they anticipate dealing with so that  we can adjust our curriculum and make sure that we   re covering the  issues that need to be covered. So, that kind of feedback. Students who  graduate and have been out there two years come back to say,    We need  more of this. These things work well, and these things we need to work  on.    Those kinds of feedback loops are very important.  Involvement, helping us recruit.    One of my co-workers    kids is  19  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  thinking about where to go to college and asked me about OSU. Can you  make sure some materials get sent? They are possibly interested in the  business school. Can you help us try to recruit this student?    We love  that sort of thing, because those are great students usually, and working  with them is what we want to do, to recruit good students to the Spears  School. Obviously, we appreciate financial support. A lot of our students  get scholarships and we try to tell them,    When you get out there, you  need to remember that somebody helped you.     Payback.     And so now, if you   ve got the wherewithal and the interest, we   d hope  you would help other students.    Scholarships are an important way of  doing that. There   s a whole variety of different things. And you know,  coming back for Homecoming and being a part of what   s going on,  those are all important things that alumni can do to stay involved with  the University and with the Spears School.  To be ambassadors and advocates for the school.  Yes. Wear your orange with pride   There you go. Well, what excites you about the future of the Spears  School of Business?  Well, I hate to harp on the entrepreneurship, but we   re really excited  about that. And I think just generally trying to   the sense of movement,  that we are moving forward. If you look at the trajectory, things are  getting better, and that we   ve got the right people, the right programs in  place to continue that trajectory. The good things going on, and that  people are concerned about doing the right thing and helping young  people get off to a great start.  Are there continuing challenges that you see ahead of the school?  I don   t think there   s any business school in the country that   s not always  going to be worried about budgets and stuff like that. There   s certainly  always things that come up that you   re going to be working to improve,  but I always say that if it wasn   t for that, I   d be out of a job. So, I better  be excited about those challenges  (Laughter)  Well said. You talked about the momentum for the School of Business,  but also for the University. What are your thoughts on the administrative  leadership at OSU at this time?  Well, President Hargis is an accounting graduate of the Spears School of  20  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Gill  Freedman  Business, so we take great pride in that. We   re excited about having him  on campus. We feel like he   s going to help raise the visibility. He   s  going to help as we start a capital campaign. His role will be critical  about getting people involved and excited about what   s going on at  OSU. Provost Marlene Strathe, she   s been here for a number of years,  and I have been very impressed about her commitment to the academic  programs and her support for accomplishing what needs to be done on  the academic side. And then, of course, we   re going to a bowl game, and  so we   re excited about that.  I think you   ve probably answered the next question I was thinking about,  but I   m going to ask you anyway to get a sense of it. Are you still as  excited about being an OSU Cowboy as you were two and a half years  ago when you came on board?  Yes. In fact, if anything, more. It   s been one of those things, as I   ve  learned more about the school and where we   re headed and what the  University is doing, it   s a great place to be. It   s a fun place to be. I look  forward to getting up in the morning and going to work. I used to tell  students,    No job is perfect and no job you   re going to love everything  that you do, but if most mornings when you get up in the morning,  you   re excited about going to work, it   s good.     Speaking of that, how have your expectations changed, or have they  changed, since you started at Oklahoma State?  I don   t know if they   ve changed a lot. I think it has been busier, just in  general, in terms of the total number of activities and different things  going on, but that   s a positive change. You certainly appreciate the  opportunity to get to do a lot of things in the course of a year.  What else would you like to share about the college that we haven   t  talked about?  I think we   ve talked about most things. The school is up and coming. It   s  not to say that it wasn   t strong in the past, but it   s just getting better. And  as time passes, I   m convinced that we   re going to continue to recruit  upon the already solid foundation that we have. It   s a good place to be.  Final question, fast forward. What would you want for people to  remember about you most at the college?  That   s a good question. I would hope that people   let   s say I   m gone  two years, I   ve been retired and I came back and I was talking to people  and so forth. What would I want them to be saying to me? I would want  them to be saying that we were involved in moving forward together.  21  Gill  Freedman  Whether it   s student leadership, faculty, staff of the college, that they  were involved and committed to helping move us forward, and that  under my deanship that happened, and that these were some of the things  that we accomplished. But I think probably more than the specific  accomplishments, was this sense of getting everybody moving together,  focused on trying to do the very best that we can for our students, for the  business community, for the University.  That would be a great legacy to leave.  I think that would be good.  -------  -------
