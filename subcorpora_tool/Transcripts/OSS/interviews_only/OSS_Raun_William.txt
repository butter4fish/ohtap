 Sherman and today is November 6, 2009. I   m visiting  with Dr. William Raun in his office here on the campus of Oklahoma  State University. This interview is being conducted by the Oklahoma  Oral History Research Program as part of its O-STATE Stories project.  First off, I want to congratulate you having recently won a big award.  I   m just wondering what your thoughts are about that award and can  you tell us what that award was?  It was the Eminent Faculty Award. It   s an honor that   s given mostly to  researchers, but basically they pick one faculty member per year that  receives it. From what I   ve been told, it   s the highest honor that you can  receive as a faculty member at OSU and it   s also accompanied by   10,000.  Is that  10,000 being used for research then?  Oh no, that actually goes to the individual. In my case the majority of  that   s going to go to OU because I   m still paying off cancer bills to the  OU Medical Center.  Can you describe for me your background and where you grew up and  how you got interested in agriculture work?  Sure. I was born in Nebraska on a farm and became interested in  agriculture really at an early age. I grew up in Mexico and South  America during the school year but each summer we flew back to the  United States where I worked on the farm in Nebraska.  Now what kind of farm was it?  Corn and cattle.  5  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Why did you spend your winters in Latin America?  That happened to be where my family was employed. So as a kid you go  where they go.  Did you do your undergraduate work here at OSU?  Yes, bachelor   s and master   s were here at OSU. Master   s degree was  under Dr. Robert Westerman who gave me a position as an hourly in his  lab in 1981, and then he later gave me an assistantship. He took a big  chance on me and yeah, it   s like that award I received. It   s everything  about the people that helped you and very little about you as an  individual because I   ve been helped a lot along the way. If Dr.  Westerman had not employed me, I   d probably be waiting tables today.  What did he see in you?  Don   t know. Don   t know, but I am forever indebted to him.  Now as a Nebraskan why did you choose Oklahoma State?  For a lot of different reasons. You know you kind of want to get away  from Nebraska. But I think they have a good school.  What were your impressions of campus when you first got here?  Well OSU is a smaller school than the University of Nebraska. It   s  always been a pretty campus. They   ve always had that Georgian  architecture that   s quite pristine.  What was your major when you first came here?  I was an agronomy major.  I thought I read that you did end up with turf studies.  That   s a major. So you get a bachelor   s degree in agronomy. But you  know there are all sorts of different majors, whether it   s Business Ag,  Weed Science, in my case Turf Management. It   s just a major. But you  take all the agronomy courses.  Did you know right off hand that you wanted to pursue graduate  studies?  No, that   s hard to say. When you   re a freshman or sophomore there   s  very little that you know about what you   re going to do. But very  6  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  quickly you find out.  What years did you attend OSU?  From    75-   79 and then Master   s    81 and    82.  Were you involved with any campus organizations at that time?  Graduate school, no. There was just so much that you could squeeze in  and you   re pretty busy so there   s no time for really anything other than  your graduate studies. I was in a fraternity, but other than that, no.  What was the fraternity life like for you?  It was fine. It   s not something I would recommend to my kids. My  daughters probably want to be in a sorority but my son, it   s probably a  waste of time.  Do you have any other memories of your undergraduate experience that  stand out for you?  Well, I had an advisor who was superb. His name was Wayne Huffine.  He was an absolutely gem of a man. Very well respected throughout the  country and very committed to his students. He was a wonderful man.  Were you involved with any organizations with the College of  Agriculture? Did you work at the time here on campus?  Yeah, I had a little part time job always here and there. There were  several.  Did you have any favorite campus hangouts or anything like that?  Sunday through Thursday was always work and business. Then Friday  night and Saturday night I had my share of fun, I guess, in the local  watering holes.  Did you graduate in four years?  Yes.  And right away you went into graduate school here?  No, not right away. I spent almost a year back at the farm and then went  to graduate school.  7  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Was there any particular reason why you made the choice to go to  graduate school?  Yes. I mean, I wanted to work in nutrient management, which is what I  do. It was just what I really liked the most.  What did you focus on when you came to graduate school? Was it  nutrient management?  Yes, I worked with wheat. We were working on a nitrogen deficiency  project in wheat using selective ion electrodes for nitrate analysis.  Did you have a tough transition into graduate school? What was that  like?  No, it was fine. Graduate school was an eye opener where you really got  to see what you were made of. You had to study and work a lot harder  than you had to before. It was all in all just an awesome experience.  Granted it was more demanding, but a really great experience because it  pushed you.  So you were tossed in the fire basically.  Oh yes, you worked. You worked with your fellow students. You got to  know those guys. It was fun.  Did you have an assistantship at that time?  I was hired as an hourly in the lab for Dr. Westerman and then later got  an assistantship. So yes, all the graduate students at the time actually had  assistantships. I was the only one that was an hourly.  Is that how you got acquainted with Dr. Westerman?  Yes, he hired me in his lab.  Did you have him as a professor as an undergrad?  No.  You were in the soils lab then?  Yes, just right down the hall in 055. It   s the lab I   m in charge of today.  You moved up in the world.  8  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Yes, I went from an hourly to   well, thanks to Dr. Westerman because  he took a huge chance on me, I think. I wouldn   t have.  Is he still a similar type of guy to what he was back then?  Same. He   s Assistant Vice President of Ag. Nicest person you   ll ever  meet.  You did your PhD work at UNL  University of Nebraska-Lincoln ?  Yes.  And what was that in?  It was also a PhD in Agronomy.  Agronomy?  Yes. I mean Soil Science but they give PhDs in Agronomy in Nebraska.  That was the title.   Was it  similar research?  Nutrient Management. Nitrogen and phosphorus work.  How did you come back to Oklahoma State after you got your PhD?  From Nebraska, I went to Mexico with CIMMYT. It   s the International  Maize and Wheat Improvement Center which Dr.  Norman  Borlaug,  who you   ve probably heard of, was the founder of. I worked in Mexico  for two years and then with CIMMYT again, I was transferred to  Guatemala and was in Guatemala for another four years. But the  position in Guatemala was as a regional agronomist so I serviced nine  countries in Central America and I was on the road virtually all the time.  I covered Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador,  Guatemala, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  What time period was this?  That was from 1985 to 1991.  Central America at this time was in the throes of upheaval in Nicaragua,  El Salvador, and Guatemala. Did you see any of that?  Oh, yes.  9  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Do you have any stories that you could possibly share with us?  San Miguel de Allende one day, that   s in the eastern parts of El Salvador  the way that sets. Yeah, there were battles, gun battles between the  FMLN and El Salvador national army. Because there was such a  political upheaval of people that were fighting against the government  and they actually were being supported at that time by Cuba because  they wanted communism in Central America. So they succeeded for ten  years in Nicaragua but then at the end of those ten years Daniel Ortega  gave in and the Contras, who the US supported, basically were  successful in getting rid of communism in Nicaragua. So El Salvador  and Nicaragua were basically the reverse of each other. In El Salvador, it  was the Cubans that were supporting the mercenaries, and in Nicaragua  it was the US that was supporting the Contras.  As an American, did you ever feel threatened?  No. I mean you had to be careful. You just had to be careful. But I didn   t  feel threatened. There was always the danger. People were being  kidnapped, if you were wealthy. Yes, the environment there was dicey.  Were you there at times when the nuns were murdered?  In El Salvador, that was earlier and those were Jesuit priests. There were  eight Jesuit priests that were basically assassinated. And that was  eighty   that was earlier, before I was there. But I know where it was at.  Drove by there many times.  That   s kind of scary, wasn   t it?  Yes, again, you just had to be careful. My work was developing  improved practices for the smallest of the farmer in El Salvador or  Guatemala, wherever it was.  So you helped subsistent farmers?  Oh yes, absolutely. Yes, farmers that had maybe two acres of land and  that were farming hillsides that were that steep.  Did you ever go to Cuba then?  Many times. Yes, Cuba   s awful. I mean, working there was awful. It   s  changed a little bit now, but there was nothing painted. All the walls  were grey, very few ads. There were lots of pictures of Che Guevara and  Fidel that had some color in them but working in Cuba was pathetic  because what  Fidel  Castro did was, the first thing he did is he went  10  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  after the Catholic Church. He had to wipe out the Catholic Church, so  the letters that Castro had with Che Guevara was that for communism to  succeed they said they had to wipe out God from man. And in doing so  they go to the churches and they would destroy them, they left them, but  they made sure they were unkept, vines growing over the doors and  everything. They made them look as sorry as possible. They made them  look as though God was not present in their universe. And so they did  get rid of God in Cuba. I mean not everyone, but a lot.  Did Cuba ever collectivize their agriculture?  Everything is government run, so yes.  What do you do in Cuba? You helped villagers?  No, Cuba was a little more   you worked with the national programs.  You worked with their USDA-type guys on practices that could possibly  be adopted there. You did not have direct contact with the producers.  But the producers were all   you know, it   s all state owned so they are  not really producers. Everybody   s a worker because nobody owns the  land, the government owns the land.  Did you ever feel conflicted by working for the Cubans?  Conflicted? Why would I feel conflicted?  Just because the way you saw things happening and the way their  government controlled everything.  That was my job. I was there working in Cuba because it was part of my  region. You know, their politics were their politics. I was not a  politician.  So you stayed clear out of that.  Yes.  When did you come back to Oklahoma State then?  I came back in the latter parts of    91 as an assistant professor here. I was  hired by OSU.  Were you invited back?  Yes, I was asked to apply for a position here and then they offered it to  me.  11  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Now is it sort of prideful for you that as an alum you came back and now  are teaching here? How do you feel about being an alum and being also  a faculty member at the same time?  It   s just the natural progression of things that if you come back here,  you   re going to have to teach in some capacity. I used to have to only  teach one class every two years. Now I   m teaching   last year, anyway,  before I got cancer, I was teaching four classes a year. A lot of teaching  because we lost faculty because of economic woes and whatnot. But, no,  teaching is a good thing.  Do you like to teach or actually do research? How do you feel overall?  Well, I was hired as a researcher. I would prefer focusing on research.  I   ve had a lot of graduate students, fifty-seven now and counting, that  have received degrees with me.  Yes, I see your stacks here.  I   m more trained for research than teaching, but you   ve got to teach,  especially the older experienced people. You need to put those guys in  the classroom, provided they   re going to give the energy in the class that  gets students motivated and excited. If he   s just going to go to class and  blow smoke, then no.  Are you full-time through the College of Agriculture or are you  Extension Services?  Yes. Full-time through   research, Dr. Watson, and the teaching gets  some support. But yes, I   m paid through the research branch.  When you were hired in 1991, was that when you took care of the  Magruder Plots?  Yes, if you   ve read that document then whoever gets here, Dr.  Westerman took care of those plots before me from probably 1977 to  1991. And then  from  1991 on I   ve been in charge.  As a graduate student did you ever do research over there?  Oh yes. A lot of the stuff that I collected from my work as a graduate  student was off of the Magruder Plots.  Now we   re going to go into questions about the Magruder Plots. First  off, I want you to define agronomy for me.  12  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Okay. Agronomy is a compilation of the sciences that combine to enable  improved production practices of virtually all crops in as sustainable a  process as possible.  The Magruder Plots are part of the Oklahoma Agriculture Experiment  Station, right?  Yes. In 1979 they were put into the National Registry of Historic Places  by Billy Tucker and Dr. Westerman.  How does the experiment station work within the university structure?  Well, the experiment station is a part of the Hatch Act that was  established in 1887. I   m not real good on the history. So whether these  other colleges like it or not, this is a land-grant university and we still  receive land-grant funds that they (other colleges) don   t receive. Ag  does. So this is still an ag school.  How does the experiment station fulfill the land-grant mission?  Land-grant universities were established because our country   s  forefathers recognized that agriculture needed to be the bedrock on  which all of these states, each and every one, would be able to support  the people in their state and then looking out into the future, possibly to  export these things elsewhere. So that land-grant mission of having an  ag school in every state, as a result of the Hatch Act has produced the  most powerful agriculture nation in the world. So is that land-grant  mission doing something? Absolutely. Food security is one of them.  Do you think the university is still fulfilling its land-grant mission today?  Absolutely. We wouldn   t have the improved wheat varieties that we  have out there today. We wouldn   t have the GreenSeeker production  systems that we developed here at OSU that are now being used  worldwide. We wouldn   t have any of these products that have been  incredibly important for improving crop production all over the world.  Can you tell me your knowledge of the Magruder Plots, like its  background and its history?  They were started in 1892 where A.C. Magruder  points to picture   implemented these plots. There were originally ten treatments that were  included. We have six of those left. The six that are left are manure  every four years and a check plot, one that receives phosphorus every  year, a plot that receives nitrogen and phosphorus, a plot that receives  nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and nitrogen, phosphorus,  13  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  potassium and lime. So those are the ones that are left. It was basically at  the time, they wanted to know whether or not the use of inorganic  fertilizers would compete and compare to some of the manure plots.  So they evaluated those ten treatments, but oddly enough A.C. Magruder  was only here for three years because he was fired. He was accused of  selling   I don   t know, there was an animal or something that he took     somehow, somewhere he sold an animal he wasn   t supposed to sell. He  didn   t have Regents approval to do it and they fired him (he later went  on to become a medical doctor) but those plots continued. And so those  plots continue to be the oldest continuous wheat trials west of the  Mississippi and really the oldest continuous wheat trials in the United  States. The oldest continuous wheat trials in the world are in Rothamsted  in England.  What about the Sanborn Plots in Missouri?  There   s corn in that trial, but they don   t have continuous wheat plots. So  the Sandborn Plots in Missouri are important, as are the Morrow Plots at  the University of Illinois. The Magruder Plots over time, it   s not like it   s  elegant research, but over time it has been valuable where we monitor  carbon as a function of time. We   ve been able to see how many years it  has taken to exhaust the potassium supplies, how many years it   s taken  to exhaust nitrogen supplies. We are still in the check plot that hasn   t  received any nutrients of any kind for 115 years  and is  still producing  20 bushels of wheat  per acre .  Now, you said it decreased from ten plots to six.  Yes.  What were the four   .  I don   t remember what the four were that they got rid of. But the plots  used to be right over here under Stout. So in 1947 they had to excavate  them and take them out to where they   re at today. And they took the  surface 18 inches of that soil and moved and excavated it to the current  location, which is at the experiment station just west of town.  How are the nutrients applied? Are they applied through  mechanization?  We apply them with mechanized equipment. Put out broadcast and  incorporate it with a disk.  When is that usually applied?  14  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  The fertilizer is applied in the fall, just right before planting.  And these are winter wheat that are grown there?  Yes, this is winter wheat. We   ve changed the varieties as a function of  time because it   s required, disease resistance, et cetera. But other than  changing the varieties nothing has been changed.  Can you define the variety for me? For the layman, can you explain  what the varieties of wheat do?  Over time, plant breeders have been able to cross one wheat to another  using various different methods to produce better lines, lines that had  disease resistance, lines that could possibly yield more, lines that had the  dwarf gene built into them. Wheat used to be chest high. The wheats that  we grow today are waist high. The reason that we want the waist high  wheats is that they won   t fall over. That has all been variety, work that   s  been done by plant breeders.  Are these wheats that are currently being grown, were the formers the  winter red wheat?  Hard red winter wheat is what we grow in Oklahoma. There are soft  white wheats that are grown in Washington. There are spring wheats that  are grown in Washington and the Yaqui Valley in Mexico. There are  hard white wheats that are grown in Virginia.  What do you use this wheat for?  All of our wheat in Oklahoma is either used for feed or for making  bread.  What   s the output on the plots themselves? How many bushels?  The check plot will still produce twenty bushels per acre with no inputs,  granted it changes by year, and then the NPK plot, depending on the  year, we produce up to forty-five bushels per acre.  The twenty bushels per acre, was that standard back when the plots  were     Oh yes. In 1892, twenty bushels  per acre  wheat would have been good  wheat.  Now, without fertilizer, is that still good wheat?  15  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Well, again, that   s part of the experiment. We don   t fertilize it. But is the  wheat still good, the twenty bushels that we produce there? Sure.  Is that a good enough number?  No, no. Some farmers today are producing forty, fifty, seventy, eighty  bushels  per acre  wheat in Oklahoma, in a good year. In an average  year, forty bushels per acre.  Has it been good years lately?  Yes, in fact, 2007 and 2009 were great years and those years were  characterized by timely rains at planting to get the wheat up. They could  be followed by dry periods in the winter and timely rains in the spring.  Have there been bad years lately?  Yes. We had 2006 and basically we got fried. It was an incredibly hot  summer and we got fried. Not in the summer, but early spring was  incredibly hot, so yes, it goes up and down.  Does frost or cold affect the wheat?  Yes, it does. If we have an early frost in Oklahoma, you know, or excuse  me, late frost are the ones that are the killers, early frost are not because  it   s winter wheat   yes. And we   ve had some.  What about ice storms?  We recently haven   t had any ice storms.  What kind of knowledge has the Magruder Plots yielded that you   ve  taken to farmers across the state?  The biggest one is that the prairie soils, when they were first tilled in  1890, were about four percent organic matter. Today, they   re one  percent organic matter. So we take this virgin prairie soil and we till it,  oxidize it with the equipment, you turn it over and you   re basically  oxidizing it. We   ve taken organic matter down to one percent in those  115 years.  Now is there a certain percentage that will kill the sustainability of it?  Not necessarily. I mean, we   re at one percent and we can still produce  wheat out there, but we would certainly like to get it up higher, around  two percent, but that   s not what we   re evaluating in this trial.  16  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  So when you take the percentages down, you add the nutrients into the  soil to basically regain that composition of organic matter?  Yes, pretty much. We apply fixed amounts to the exact same treatment  year after year.  And so that brings it back up to what it would normally be?  No. Once you lose that soil organic matter, you   ve lost it. Does that  replenish some? Yes. But not all.  What kind of nutrients are you adding to     We apply nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and then the last plot line.  And then there   s one plot where it gets manure every four years.  Every year would over neutralize it?  No, it is just what was set up by people that established the Magruder  Plots and then later continued. They get the same rate as these other  treatments, in terms of NPK, about every four years because the nitrogen  and the manure have to mineralize. That has to break down.  You   ve worked since 1991 out there, how many students have you  worked with using the Magruder Plots for their field work?  All of our students, to a certain extent, have to work out there at some  point in time. It   s not necessarily a part of their thesis, but they   re  involved and so yes, I   ve had fifty-seven and all fifty-seven have been  exposed to what   s going on in the Magruder Plots. They all had to work  out there in one way, shape or form or another.  Do you remember any particular students that you worked with?  All of them.  All of them?  Do you want me to rattle them off? (Laughs)  No, not all of them, but have some gone on to do PhD work?  Oh yea, of the seventeen PhD students, there   s thirteen   there   s one  that   s an assistant professor at Ohio State and another assistant professor  at Virginia Tech, another assistant professor at Louisiana State, another  one at Montana State, another assistant professor at Kansas State. We   ve  17  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  got a bunch of our students scattered all over the US and the world.  Have any come back to Oklahoma State?  Yes. Dr. Arnall got his degree here with me and he is now an assistant  professor.  How do you feel about that, does that give you a sense of pride?  I just want them gainfully employed with good jobs, no matter where  that is.  How does Magruder Plots compare with other wheat research out  there? I know Montana State and Minnesota have plots.  They   re very simplistic, I mean there   s no rocket science in those  Magruder Plots, but they   re still useful in terms of benchmark values,  soil test values, all that kind of stuff that we still can use, but it   s not  sophisticated.  Have you had any mishaps along the way with the research?  Have we made a mistake?  Yeah.  Not that I know of. Dr. Westerman always used to say that there   s  eleven commandments and the eleventh one is    You better not screw up  the Magruder Plots.    So we haven   t.  That   s good and under your watch, you haven   t?  To my knowledge. There could be students that did some strange things  out there, but  not  to my knowledge. Our students applied urea to a  check plot out at 222 which is caddy corner to the Magruder Plots and I  had to go out there and vacuum it all up. Because those are long term  plots, you know. They were like,    Well can we just          No, you can go  vacuum.     Are there any institutional safeguards out there?  Like what?  Before I came to Oklahoma State, I was at the University of Illinois and  if you messed around in the Morrow Plots, they could expel you from  school.  18  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  No, none to my knowledge, but these are more secluded than the  Morrow Plots at Illinois. Those are right next to the library.  Did you help get the barn out there under the National Historic  Registry?  I had nothing to do with that.  Where do you see the Magruder Plots heading in the future?  I   ll put it this way, I   ve been asked many times, should we go no-tillage  and into a rotation that would be more relevant to producers today? And,  you know, there   s a 115 years there and I don   t want to be the guy that  screwed up the cycle. You know? (Laughter) So it   s like, why am I  going to mess with the Magruder Plots when if that   s what I want to do,  I want to do a rotation study, I   ll find some other land. Those have been  continuous wheat and whether or not that   s a good or a bad thing, I   m  not going to say. But I   m not going to mess them up.    Oh well, this is  stupid, we   re producing continuous wheat.    Maybe.  What are the big issues that you see that agriculture and wheat farming  faces in the future?  I work with Dr. Stone and we just have to do a better job of producing  more with less and producing more on the same acre of land and that   s  why he and I are working on some really fun technologies right now,  just on seed orientation where we think we can squeeze in more plants  per acre by manipulating their orientation as they emerge. And we   re  going to line them up like little Chinese toy soldiers, just right in a row  with their leaves perfectly spread out, you know, left and right in row  and we   ve uncovered a method that we   re going to do that, so Randy  Taylor, John Solie, we   re working on that. We   ll have a new planter.  Are there any issues pertaining to sustainability?  The Magruder Plots are not a good example of sustainability because it   s  conventionally tilled. We don   t use no-tillage. We   re just adhering to  what our forefathers set up before us. Are the Magruder Plots  sustainable? Well a lot of people say yeah, look at the check plot, it still  produces twenty bushels per acre. So to a certain extent, maybe they are.  Maybe conventional till wheat is sustainable because    But other people  would say no, conventional till is not a good thing.  Is there anything you   d like to add?  The Magruder Plots have been, although simplistic, a valuable  19  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  Sherman  Raun  benchmark for us to rely on. They   ve provided us with benchmark data  that we don   t get in other plots and even though they   re non-replicated,  they can   t be statistically analyzed, they still provide a benchmark. Why  is that? In 115 years, you know, who needs reps?  Yes.  You don   t need to replicate it. Hell, it   s been replicated 115 years, so.  I want to thank you for your time here today and for granting me this  interview.  You   re welcome. It   s 117 years, actually.  117. Well it   s getting up there.  Yes, it   s getting up there.  Thank you for your time.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
