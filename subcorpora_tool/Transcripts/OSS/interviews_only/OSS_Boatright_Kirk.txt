 Neurohr, with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Tuesday, October 23rd 2007, and I   m at the OSU  Library. Today I   m interviewing Dr. Kirk Boatright, and it   s being  conducted as a part of O-STATE Stories, an oral history project of the  OSU library. Thank you for joining us today, Dr. Boatright. If you  would, tell us a little bit about yourself, starting about when you were  here as a student, where you came here from, just a little information  like that.  I grew up in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma. At that time Fort Gibson had a  population of about 1,500. My father had a general store and we had a  farm, so I grew up working in the store and on the farm. Small town, we  made delivery runs, and when I could drive, I drove the delivery truck  when I was out of school. If you lived in Fort Gibson, we would bring  your food to your house, two runs in the morning two in the afternoon. I  put the meat in the refrigerator, turned on your heat, whatever you  wanted me to do. So I worked in a small town, worked in the store and  on the farm.  I went to school at Fort Gibson and studied hard, played baseball   in  fact natural ability at baseball. We played from the time the sun came  up, from the time we could walk. I came to OSU planning on playing  baseball and being an engineer as well. In fact, in high school I hit .457  my senior year. In those days, in small towns in eastern Oklahoma if you  won the Northeastern State   at that time Northeastern State College  baseball or basketball tournaments, you were state champs as far as we  were concerned, and we won that year.  I brought three of my friends up when I came to enroll at Oklahoma  State. Initial intent when I was about a sophomore in high school was to  come to OSU   at that time Oklahoma A M. I graduated from high  school in 1955 and since we had a farm I was going to major in  5  agriculture, but decided not to because I liked mathematics so well. And  I   m not sure if I knew what an engineer was. But with three of my  friends we came up one day for me to enroll, and at that time you took  examinations to determine your freshman courses. I passed the  examinations to take honors math and honors chemistry, and so I was  supposed to take a combination of analytics and calculus   analytical  geometry and calculus my first semester. I enrolled and Raymond Girod  was the registrar at the time and I was assigned to M.R. Lohmann, Pete  Lohmann later, who was vice dean of engineering who became dean of  engineering while I was here.  I enrolled in those honors courses, got back to the small town of Fort  Gibson, and I decided,    No way can I take those honors courses and play  baseball and be an engineer, because I   ll be competing with students  from Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Here I am from this small town, and I  just can   t do that.    So I came back to Stillwater the next day, talked to  Dean Lohmann and said,    Dean Lohmann, I just can   t do this. I want to  enroll in algebra and trigonometry and general chemistry. I just don   t  want to take those honors courses.    So he called, this was in the old  Engineering Building, he called Raymond Girod, the registrar, and Mr.  Girod said,    Well, he   ll have to wait until the first week of school.    And  I   ll never forget, Vice-Dean Lohmann at the time, who became Dean  Lohmann, a very fantastic person and friend of mine, in my opinion. I   ll  never forget he said,    Ah hell, Raymond, let   s let the boy do what he  wants to.    And so that day I changed all my enrollment and I   m not sure  any other people got the chance to do that.  It turned out to be a big mistake. I should have started in the honors  chemistry and math because I was not aware as to how much the small  town of Fort Gibson had prepared me in the schools. By the way, my  father was president of the school board there from before I started the  first grade until he died, and my sister and I were both out of school. He  had a big impact on the school system. I was talented in math and I  should have taken those courses, but I did not. And I should have played  baseball but I did not. I found that the students from the big high  schools were not my academic competition here. My academic  competition was the small town kids of primarily western Oklahoma  wheat country. We became friends.  So over the years I started out working as hard as I could work at  Oklahoma State, at Oklahoma A M at the time. My first class was  engineering drawing, and it met on the fourth floor of the old  Engineering Building from ten to twelve on Monday, Wednesday, and  Friday. So this is my first university class, and I got there early, and  here was this man standing at the board, European in appearance,  smoking a pipe with the typical professorial appearance and I was scared  6  to death. It turned out to be Ladislas Lewis Jay Fila, who was a  specialist in vibrations and later I had Professor Fila in vibrations course,  but he was not the instructor for that course. So when he left I went in     first time I   d ever seen a drafting table and it was the first time I   d ever  seen a slide rule before. I bought one at the Student Union, at the  bookstore.  I went in and took the second seat back and finally students start coming  in, most of them Air Force captains. I thought,    This is going to be really  tough with these Air Force captains in here, all carrying slide rules,    and  I had never seen a slide rule until I bought one. Finally the instructor  came in, Gerald Parker who was a graduate student. Gerald later  became a friend of mine after I graduated.  I   d had mechanical drawing in Fort Gibson, and we had no drafting  tables. We sat at a chair with our drawing board leaning against the  table, and that   s the way we did our drafting. We had done most of ours  in ink however. So when we started up here, I was very conscientious.  This person in front of me, at the front table dressed in a suit and tie, and  asked very intelligent questions. I worked hard, in fact I thought I was  really close to   was hoping I could get a good grade. And the last day of  the class Mr. Parker came in and said,    Kirk has the highest grade in the  class       and I was stunned. And he said,       but he lacks three points  having an A.    It turned out that was not true after he gave me the grades.  He said,    I want you to vote to see if we should give him an A,    and so I  was just stunned. As it turned out, the person who asked the nice  questions in front of me, just barely passed the course. So that kind of  taught me a lesson but that   s the way I started.  I became active the first night I was in Cordell Hall, room 344. A friend  of mine from Fort Gibson, we   d gone through school together, Max  Lindsay, who later was president of the state FFA  Future Farmers of  America , Max and I roomed together at Cordell. And so the first night  we arrived, we went to the Wesley Foundation and became active in the  Wesley Foundation. My grandfather had been a circuit riding  Presbyterian preacher in Arkansas, but small town Presbyterian churches  had pretty well gone down and so my mother had been a Methodist. We  got in the Methodist my senior year of high school. I became very active  from the beginning in the Wesley Foundation and active in  organizations. Phi Eta Sigma was the first one, which was an honor  society, as well as Wesley Foundation. Anyway, just worked hard in  engineering, studied very hard and wanted to go home. The good thing  about Oklahoma A M, it was so busy. If you went home, you missed  something. So I ended up staying up here most weekends, but again very  anxious to get home.  7  Neurohr  Boatright  I became active in American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and then  very active in the Wesley Foundation, and met many students on  campus. At that time all men had to be in either Army or Air Force  ROTC  Reserve Officers    Training Corps . We had to wear the uniforms  everyday we were in those classes and salute the cadet officers all over  the campus, and polish our shoes and shine our brass. Very commonly  on Monday/Wednesday I   d have classes all day long, so I had to wear  my uniform all day long, and we   d have our military drills. I just did my  best in all that I did and was surprised, at the end of my sophomore year  that I was named outstanding sophomore Army military cadet.  I didn   t consider my self gung ho, I just   it was teaching me a lesson I  think that I taught a lot of other people. Since I   ve been out as a  professional   not so much now, but I did a lot of presentations to junior  high schools, high schools and also church groups. I would say to these  young people,    You know, two things I   ve found: number one if you   re  honest in all you do, just honest in all you do, don   t try to mislead  anyone, just be yourself, and be honest. And secondly       and this is  after I formed my two companies. I formed them in 1980 as well as had  been in the administration at the university in Tahlequah, I said,    When  you do something, when you walk away from it, realize I   ve done the  best I can possibly do. Don   t get stressed out about it, just do the best  you can do.    In my experience you   ve outclassed ninety percent of your  competition if you follow those two rules. And I still find that to be true.  Then, Tom Tate was president of the Student Senate, and we had  become friends through the Wesley Foundation. In fact, Tom was  president of the Wesley Foundation when the new building was built.  He convinced me to run for junior class senator. I did not want to be a  politician at all, but I was very active in several university organizations.  Why did that not interest you, at first?  I   d never thought of myself as a politician just like I never expected to  get an A in drawing. I never expected to be named the number one  sophomore Army ROTC cadet. I just did the best I could do. I worked  hard and studied hard. But I had a good time, was active in  organizations selectively, and by the way, I did pledge a fraternity. My  first semester I made a four point so I was recruited. Finally I was  convinced to join a fraternity in the spring semester. I moved in on  Thursday, moved out on Sunday, moved back into Cordell Hall.  Fortunately Mr. Rogers and Mrs. Rogers had not rented my room out, so  I decided to stay an independent.  I ran for Student Senate, junior senator, and I won, very narrowly. I  think by nine votes. At that time you had the independent party and you  8  had the inter-collegiates who were the fraternity and sororities. I was  close to both sides, because of the Wesley Foundation. So I became the  junior senator, and Bill Oden was president of the senate, and Bill later  became a bishop in the Methodist Church, and so Bill and I were very  close through the Wesley Foundation. Dean Stringer, who later and may  still be an attorney in Oklahoma City, was president of the Student  Association. During that year, I   m not sure exactly what happened, but it  was changed so that the president of the Student Association was also  president of the senate. I don   t know what happened exactly. But Dean  took over the presidency of the senate and as a result of that, when I was  elected president of the Student Association, the next year, then I also  became president of the Student Senate.  I don   t recall exactly the combination that occurred, but the senate was  very active. At that time there was no special mascot for Oklahoma  A M so I was on the Student Senate the last year it was OAMC. And it  was obvious that Frank Eaton was the mascot, that Pistol Pete was the  mascot. Oklahoma State, Oklahoma A M at that time, had the  recognized best Homecoming parade in the U.S. and I think that   s  probably still true. But Frank Eaton, Pistol Pete from Perkins, he rode in  the Homecoming parades and he rode on the stage coach, and it was  obvious he was going to be Pistol Pete. I had that decal all over my  suitcase. Anyway, the Student Senate was asked to select a mascot for  the university, at that time the college, and I was appointed chairman of  that committee. So we discussed all sorts of possibilities, and as I said  somewhere I had those original minutes, and I   ll find them, but we  looked at a cowboy on a horse, and we looked at a stage coach, and we  looked at a covered wagon, but obviously it was going to be Pistol Pete.  We   re the ones who decided on the person with the big head and the big  hat, the chaps and the  cowboy  Pistol Pete as we know him today,  although the face today is much more modern than the one we started  with.  I remember going to Bully Good Saddle Shop in Muskogee, looking for  leather chaps and whatever you call the coat, not a coat, whatever it   s  called. Jill Roberts was vice-president of the senate and John Smith was  I believe a cheerleader, and he was also in the senate. Jill and John went  to Houston and looked for the hat and so on, but anyway we finally put  it together. So today we have Pistol Pete as our official mascot. By that  time, I think, Frank Eaton had died, but I was not aware, and I   m not  sure any of us were aware that Pistol Pete won the shooting competition  at Fort Gibson, where I grew up. I think it   s quite amazing that I was  chosen to chair that committee. What's even more amazing, the first  Pistol Pete in the costume was Charlie Lester from Fort Gibson. I   m not  sure that was intentional either, so I think it must have been predestined  or something.  9  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  So before this time, you said that there were like decals     Everywhere  And things like that of his likeness already     Everywhere. I had them all over my car and my suitcases and  everywhere.  Do you still have any of those suitcases? No?  No, not that I know of.  So the likeness was out there, but there was not someone who dressed up  for the games or things like that?  No   No. Nothing official. Nothing official.  Okay, so and then the team name, at that time we were the Cowboys?  Was it the Cowboys or the Aggies? Well I think it was the Aggies  because we   I never said cowboys.  I wonder when that changed. When did that change?  I don   t know. I don   t recall, but I was an Oklahoma State Aggie.  You were.  All the way.  Okay, okay, so even when it changed over at first to OSU, we were still  the Aggies for a while.  I   m still an Aggie. I   m an Aggie today.  You   re still an Aggie, okay.  I   m a Cowboy but I   m still an Aggie today, yeah.  Still an Aggie.  So then I was doing very well   the grades in engineering and so was  asked to run for president of the Student Senate, but by now it was  president of the Student Association, because they   d changed the  approach.  10  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  What was the difference there then? How were the two groups different?  There was a Student Association that met that had representatives,  primarily dealing with campus issues, social and so on. The Student  Senate dealt with student insurance and many other issues. In fact we  initiated, when I was president, contacting for the first time the  legislature and asking for initial legislative support for universities   that  was an interesting experience also. But the Student Association was  mainly more like a social determination  group . When I was elected   I  guess the real change did not occur until I was already in, because  Harold McElroy was elected president of the association. I   m not sure  what happened but I know when I was a junior senator, Bill Oden was  our initial president, and Dean Stringer was president of the Student  Association. I think I have that correct. But midway through, or so,  Dean became president of the Student Senate, but because of the set up,  I ran for president. I   m not sure what I ran for president of, it   s in the  paper, we can look at that, but Harold McElroy was president of the  Student Association. Harold McElroy was over the group that made  other decisions, more social type decisions, than the senate and I was  president of the senate. Through the relationship I also became president  of the Student Association. And I don   t know exactly what happened  there, but...  So you basically had two different groups and meetings with each group,  that you were chairing?  At that time, yes, and the senate was not so much interested in social  activities, on campus as such. I would say we were interested in the  more complex situations. And so I was elected president of the Student  Senate and president of the Student Association. We can look at the  O   Colly and see how that was.  Did you campaign?  Yes.  How were the elections run?  Well you had the independent party, and you had the inter-collegiates.  The independents selected their nominee and the inter-collegiates  selected their nominee. John Jacob was the inter-collegiate nominee.  John was a fantastic person. He was a football player, an excellent  player, had fantastic ethics and character. He was also president of the  BSU, and was a friend of mine, became a friend of mine. I didn   t really  know John until we were face to face in politics. I won by a considerable  amount. I was supported by both independents and inter-collegiates.  11  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  How did you campaign?  With signs around campus, and I had a big banner out here in front of  the Library. I still have that banner, and you   re welcome to that if you   d  like.  I   m going to get one of the signs out, that you brought and maybe have  you hold that up.  We had these all over the campus   on the light poles and telephone  poles, and by Main. I really didn   t talk very much and we   d go around.  They   d organize it so we could go to the various fraternities and  sororities, John and I and the other candidates for other offices. But the  main thing, I had a banner, goodness, it was twenty feet long, and four  feet high out here in front of the Library. Then we had the election and  the morning after the election the fellows at Cordell Hall got it and put it  across the front of Cordell Hall, and locked me out of their rooms so I  couldn   t get to it. It was on the third floor, and I have pictures of that  also. But it was no big deal. We didn   t feel adverse against one another.  And if you won, hey you won. We   re all together. This is by now, by the  time of the election, the election was in I think April of 1958 and that   s  about the time   well let   s see, what did you say it was July, that summer  that the official change went from OAMC to Oklahoma State. I was on  the senate of OAMC College, and was president of the student body, and  president of the Student Senate the first year it was Oklahoma State. But  the campaigning was no big deal. The fraternities and sororities  participated with independents and vice versa. And so anyway I was  elected president of the senate.  How long did the campaigning go on, was it a week, two weeks?  Oh I don   t recall. Probably three or four weeks we knew about it, no  more than that.  And how about voting, where did that take place at?  I don   t even remember.  Must have had a ballot box, and people     Yes, there were ballot boxes. It was very well run. It was very well run,  and it was a fun time. Lee Gilstrap was the advisor to the senate, and  had been for several years. Mr. Gilstrap taught speech and he had  retired. He was a retired military man and had been at the Oklahoma  Military Academy at Claremore before he came to Oklahoma State.  And he was fantastic, he was hilarious, and especially with some of the  12  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  controversies we went through that year when I was president of the  senate. We made arrangements to go to Oklahoma City and visit with  the state legislature. And according to the O   Colly, I was not aware of  this until I pulled out those old editions  last night  before I came   this  had never been done before. This was a precedent setting event, when  we went to the state legislature.  Was it just OSU students who went?  Yes.  It was?  Yes, and the names of those who participated are in the O   Colly. I was  not aware of this until I   it said    Senate House hear Boatright speak for  OSU. Oklahoma State University made a first in the annals of student  senate government, when President Kirk Boatright spoke before both the  Oklahoma Senate and the House of Representatives, Tuesday.    And this  was Thursday, April 30, 1959 that this came out.  Was that the first time you had ever been to the Capitol?  Oh I   d been to the Capitol before, but certainly   in fact I was not aware  I was going to be speaking to the House and the Senate.  Oh you didn   t.  We were just going to visit and so the Speaker of the House invited me  to speak. So I stood up in front and I spoke to them for five minutes, and  then Senator Everett Collins from Sapulpa was the President Pro  Tempore of the Senate and he invited me to do the same. And so I  spoke for about five minutes before each group and this is when J.  Howard Edmondson was Governor. Even with the democrats there was  considerable controversy and Governor Edmondson was refusing to live  in the Governor   s Mansion. They had an apartment downtown, he and  his family. By the way, this was in this O   Colly, I was not aware of that.  Everett Collins   Senator Collins, after I   d given my speech, he asked if  we would like to visit the Governor   s Mansion. And I said,    Well  Senator, I appreciate the invitation but we   re here to talk to our senators  and representatives and therefore thank you, but we need to visit.    That  was the last that was said of it. The next day The Daily Oklahoman  read,    OSU Students Turned Away at Gun Point from Governor   s  Mansion,    and so they were trying to get at Governor Edmondson, and  that upset me very much. I called The Daily Oklahoman and several  days later, about page 19, down in one corner was a   they retracted that,  13  but that was a real introduction for me into politics.  My senior year I lived out in town. Garland Phillips and I had grown up  in Fort Gibson together. He is about three years older than I, and  Garland had received a degree in mathematics from Northeastern at  Tahlequah and worked for Douglas Aircraft in Tulsa. He   d come back to  Oklahoma State then to get a degree in aeronautical engineering. So  Garland and I lived out together in an apartment in town. We were  seniors the same year. He was in aeronautical. I was in petroleum  engineering, both under mechanical engineering. So our degrees were  mechanical engineering. I had a job interview in Tulsa and got back  about eight o   clock that night. It was after dark, and Garland says,     Kirk, Dean Patchin, the Dean of Women, is frantic. She's been calling  for you. She wants you to come to Murray Hall immediately, as quickly  as you can.    And so Garland and I got in my car. We lived just to the  east of the campus and headed to Murray Hall.  Oklahoma State had just made the Big VIII Conference. We just won  our first Big VIII Championship, the wrestling championship, and  students were demanding a walk-out to celebrate that. Well this was a  real issue with the administration because every year when I was on the  senate, even prior to that and then now I   m president of the senate there  was one extra day put in the academic schedule for a holiday to celebrate  an event. Well obviously we could not set that holiday until after we  played OU in football, because if won the OU football game, you   d  better believe there was going to be no one in class the next day. In fact,  I think it was that year we were playing OU here in Stillwater, and  Garland and I were sitting in the stands. I think the score was zero-zero,  right, near the end of the game, and OSU had just held OU four downs  on like the two yard line, and Garland says    Kirk, you need to go talk to  Dr. Willham. You know we could win this game and tomorrows going  to be a walk-out.     Well, as it turned out they punted out to the 35 yard line, I think it was  Tommy McDonald, either the punt or the next play ran it in for a  touchdown, and I think we lost seven-nothing, something like that. But  we would try to change that, because we had to set the day a month in  advance. The day we   re going to celebrate this special day had to be set  a month in advance. And I told Dr. Willham, who was the president and  a fantastic person, and you   re going to see I came to appreciate him even  more. I remember he came to the senate and said,    We cannot do this  without letting people know we   re going to take this holiday. Can you  imagine all the researchers that have eggs that are going to hatch on that  day, and if we take a holiday, and those eggs hatch we messed up all  their research.    I probably heard Dr. Willham tell that story five times.  But anyway, they wouldn   t let us set it in advance and so this was the  14  Neurohr  Boatright  issue.  When we got over to Murray Hall there was a car turned upside down in  the streets. This article in the O   Colly says there were a few hundred  students. There were at least a thousand students there. The fountain  between Murray and Stout was on fire. They were throwing gasoline in  the fountain. Girls were throwing items out of the second, third and top  floor windows of both Stout Hall and Murray Hall.  What kind of items, undergarments?  Undergarments, the screens off the windows. Dean Patchin was there by  herself, the Dean of Women in her night gown, a pink night gown, and  she was frantic. And so I came in and she said,    Kirk, I   ve hardly been  able to wait till you got here. What are we going to do?    The police  were there but they couldn   t handle it. I said    Let me call the  Dean of  Student Affairs ,    and I called him and told him what was happening.  And he said    We   ll take care of it tomorrow.    I said    Sir, this is critical  and Dean Patchin needs help.       We   ll take care of it tomorrow.    And  so, I decided, I talked to Dean Patchin and I said,    I will call a meeting  of the Student Senate.    I went out front, and the police gave me a mic,  and I went back in front Murray and back and I announced what I was  going to do. They just sat down on the ground, and all just shut down,  just like that, they sat down on the ground. So we called each of the  senators and we all went in Murray Hall.  I noticed  Mim Oesch and  Jim Maxwell   s comments in the paper. I   d  forgotten about some of those. So we met and I said,    I   m opposed to a  walk-out but what are we going to do?    So we talked about it and they  were opposed also. By now it   s midnight, by the time we got everyone  together. And so I said,    Let me call the Dean of Student Affairs again.     I called him. I said,    Sir, something has to be done        We   ll take care of  it tomorrow.    So the senate voted for a walk-out. And you can read  about it in the O   Colly. When I announced to the students, they went  home. Well, the next day was like a party on campus. Members of the  band were walking through the classroom building, playing their  trombones and their trumpets. Kids in class were coming out to follow  them down the halls, and most of the faculty just fell right in with it.  And I remember standing on the   and I noticed there were others who  did the same thing   but I stood on the, at that time there was a patio  balcony behind the University Center and there was a dance area back  there, in the opening before they extended the Student Union to the East.  I felt like a dictator standing, talking to the crowd up there, and got  applause and all this. It was very well-ordered and no problems  whatsoever that day. But what I forgot to tell you, after the senate vote,  15  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  and I announced it to the students and they went home, I called Dr.  Willham, the president, at his home. I said    Dr. Willham, this is Kirk, I  think I need to talk to you.     What time was this?  I think it must have been three in the morning, two or three in the  morning. He said come right on over, so I went over and     Where did he live?  Over in that direction, the president   s home is somewhere over there, I  don   t recall. He came down   big man, came down in his robe, and I  told him what had happened and what we had to do. He said,    Well you  have your job to do, and I have my job to do.    So I had no idea what the  consequences of this were going to be, but he was a very nice person.  And so I left, and by the way I noticed the paper says,    The President,  the Vice-President and the Dean of Student Affairs were out of town the  next day and could not be reached for comment.    But anyway that  Wednesday night was the Engineering Honors Banquet     This walk-out was on a Monday?  I don   t recall.  Probably?  I think it was. The date   s in the paper. But the Engineering Honors  Banquet was Thursday, March 19, 1959, and I was the emcee for the  banquet. And my parents were coming up from Fort Gibson for the  banquet. Tuesday night was the editorial in the Tulsa Tribune by Jenkin  Lloyd Jones, that said the entire Student Senate at now Oklahoma State  University should be expelled. And so my parents had no idea what to  expect when they got up here. Dean Lohmann started the awards  banquet, by now people know him as the dean, in fact he was most of  the time I was there   and I was the emcee.  Dean Lohmann got up to present the awards after the speaker made his  presentation, and he was fantastic. He was just he looked right at me  and he made some comments that were hilarious, and I don   t recall what  they were. But he was very appreciative that it had gone so easily,  because this had been a big controversy. You   ll notice on here the  awards were given out and the only award not announced is the  Hamilton Award for the Outstanding Student in the College of  Engineering. So when he stood up to present that award to me, and  again in no way did I expect that, no way. As it turned out, I had almost  16  Neurohr  Boatright  twice the points for that award as the number two person. I was told I  ranked third in grade point out of 726 engineering students.  Was this award selected by the faculty?  I don   t know. I   d say yes the dean   s office and the faculty. I received a  Hamilton watch for the award and, by the way, they misspelled my  name on it. Not my last name, my middle name. My father   s name was  Ewell Boatright and they spelled it E-L-W-E-LL, put an    L    in the  middle of it. Dean Lohmann had to comment when the award was  made.  So the Regents called a special meeting that weekend to determine our  fate and Dean Patchin was so appreciative. The vice president of the  university was Dr. Robert MacVicar who was a very straight person. In  fact personality wise, he reminded me somewhat of Richard Nixon     very formal, very straight. He was also graduate dean. And so the  senate assembled in the conference room at the University Center. I  think that   s  the conference room  where the Regents met. So we  assembled in that conference room, and Dr. MacVicar came in and he  was so nice to us, it was unbelievable.  And the thing that was happening was, Dean Patchin was telling the  Regents that had we not acted, had I not come over, and we not acted,  there was likelihood that Murray Hall would have been destroyed,  because it was wild when I got over there. They were throwing gasoline  in the fountain, and it was burning like crazy, and the cars was turned  over in the streets. So the Regents, basically, said thank you to us. And  later the Dean of Student Affairs was moved to another position of  academics in Oklahoma, and was no longer at Oklahoma State. That was  an interesting time.  There was tremendous demand for engineers at the time. We were  getting a dozen job offers, each graduate. I   d selected to go to work for  Phillips Petroleum in West Texas as a field engineer. About six weeks  before I graduated one of the professors came and said,    Kirk, Pan  American has offered you a fellowship for your master   s in mechanical  engineering,    and I said,    Hey,    cause that   s just a check, that   s not a  student assistantship. I called Phillips and told them the situation, and I  said,    Okay, I think I can finish in about 15 months, is it okay if I call  you next year?    and they said yes. I   d already taken two graduate  courses my last semester, because I had extra open hours. And so I got  my master   s in mechanical engineering, and that summer of the next  year, as I finished in the summer at the end of the summer in 1960. And  James Boggs was head of mechanical engineering before he became  Academic Vice President, and his secretary was Mildred Avery, and Ms.  17  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Avery took care of us students. And so she was typing my thesis and     How so you mean she took care of you?  She stood between us and the administration, as you   re going to see. I  came in one day and she said,    Well, Dr. Boggs has complained at me  for typing your thesis, and I told him to be quiet and get back in his  office and leave the students alone.    She was a fantastic person, so I got  my master   s and I called Phillips back. I said,    I   m ready to come to  work for you,    and they said,    We have a job for you in the research lab  in Bartlesville.    I said,    I don   t want to be a research engineer. I want to  be a field engineer.       But you have a master   s degree     And I said,     That doesn   t matter. I want to go to the field.       But you have a master   s  degree.    I said,    Send me to the field for three years. Let me be a field  engineer. Pay me a B.S. salary and then I   ll go to the research lab.    And  you know they would not do it. I was overeducated. So I went with  Exxon because they sent me to the field and that   s the story. And I   ve  tried to stay up with OSU.  When you were a student here, an undergraduate student, did you go  home in the summertime? Did you take classes in the summertime?  I worked on the farm, usually. But that first semester, it was to my  benefit to take some courses. That first summer I went to Northeastern  in Tahlequah and took three courses. Then I worked at my Dad   s store  and at the farm, on the side. Second summer, I went to summer school.  Between my junior and senior year, I was a roustabout in West Texas oil  fields for City Service Company out of Vernon, Texas because I was  awarded a City Service scholarship both my junior and senior years.  Then I went to work for Pan American in the summer, which later  became Amoco. I did not go to summer school that first summer after  my B.S. I worked in Tulsa in a Pan American Research Laboratory on  41st and Yale. I   d forgotten about that. And then I came back and got  my master   s, and then I went to work for Exxon.  Were your summer experiences required?  No, but what I do now as a consulting engineer worldwide in the oil  business, one of my best experiences was the roustabout in West Texas  oil fields. So when I was at the university in Tahlequah, and I could tell  you the story that led to that, but I set up a degree in Engineering  Physics. Well, after finishing my master   s, I ended up at Exxon in Tulsa  in a research lab as a drilling research engineer for Exxon, at Jersey  Research in Tulsa, which was Exxon   s International Research and  Development Corporation. In Houston, they had Humble Research on  Buffalo Speedway which was their U.S. research and development  18  corporation.  I was a drilling research engineer in Tulsa when my father died at Fort  Gibson, forty-eight miles away. And we still had our farm and we had  the store, and my mother and sister still lived there. She was commuting  to the university in Tahlequah to get her degree. So I started running the  farm by telephone and on weekends. Then Exxon told us they were  moving all of us to Houston, to form Esso Research on Buffalo  Speedway. I wasn   t about to leave the farm, so I had to find another job.  I applied to the physics faculty at the university in Tahlequah and was  accepted. In order to be accepted I had to set up a plan for a doctor   s  degree. And so I, just like the master   s, I was somewhat forced into  getting my Ph.D. So I went to the university in Tahlequah, to their  Physics Department. We only had two Physics faculty members and  that   s a low-income area. Many of our students were from Stilwell and  the areas around were low-income areas but that doesn   t mean low  quality of life. The quality of life was fantastic and many of our  students, if not most, were the first in their families ever to go to  university. And these were engineer level students, many of them.  At that time, if you got a degree in physics or chemistry, bachelor   s  degree and went to work in industry, you  were hired basically  to work  as a technician type person   even if you had a master   s in physics or  chemistry. In industry, you were hired at a technician level, with a  bachelor   s engineer as your supervisor who might not know half as  much as you know, but that was the way it was. And so I said,    We  need to do something because these students will never have a chance to  go to a major university.    So this argument that only Oklahoma State  and OU should have a degree named engineering is grossly not fair.  These students could never have come to Oklahoma State or OU.  E.T. Dunlap was the chancellor, so I put together a program called  Engineering Physics. We could never have a degree in mechanical or  electrical. We were too small, so I decided if we can give these students  a strong basis in mathematics and engineering, they can compete  anywhere. So we applied for a degree in Engineering Physics with the  state regents, and they said    No. No public university except Oklahoma  State or OU will have a degree with the name engineering in it. You can  call it applied physics.    And I said,    No, we will not do that, that  implies technician.    So I used politics and got the degree in Engineering  Physics. And E.T. Dunlap never forgave me for that, and there would be  major conflict between us later, and I would win   if it caused me to  have to decide to leave the university in Tahlequah, but I would win that  conflict.  19  So we got the degree and our graduates would have had six full  semesters of mathematics beyond differential equations, and have a full  semester abstract algebra, math statistics, vector analysis, numerical  analysis, partial differential equations, and one other,  matrix algebra .  There were six of them, full semesters in mathematics. And we gave  them a strong basis in engineering. The only courses I taught every year  were Engineering Physics I and Engineering Physics II. Over a two-year  period I would rotate through all the basic engineering courses.  The other faculty member was a Ph.D. geophysicist,  Dr. Lanny Reed ,  so he did the electronics and field theory. In about six years we had a  national reputation at Tahlequah. I could call MIT or Stanford or Rice,  and with one telephone call, get them an assistantship. I could give you  example after example, where our students came back with a master   s  degree, and they said,    We did the homework for the BS graduates in  master   s programs from the major universities.    One student has the  fourth largest heat exchanger company in the U.S. Another I got in at  Argonne Laboratories at the University of Chicago and he   s now an  attorney in Washington.  For those who remember the failure of Penn Square Bank in Oklahoma  City that almost took the U.S. financial system under, he   s the attorney  in that book called Belly Up, that   s quoted over and over again. And so  we had a national reputation. But the point is, that led me into this, is  there would have to be a very special consideration for me to say,     Okay, go to summer school.    I   d say,    Get a job in an industry, even if  it   s a custodian, or a welder   s helper.    My job as a roustabout was one of  my best experiences for professional development. I could call several  companies in Tulsa and say,    I have a student I want to recommend for  this summer,    and like that they had a job. And then many of them hired  them permanently, at least offered to hire them when they graduated.  Since that time, since I left the university that program has gone down,  down, down, and what a shame  it was . It   s disgusting to me how  politics controls higher education in Oklahoma. Totally disgusting, and  politics led me to leave the university in Tahlequah, because the  president and I were like this, and it was time for me to leave because  anything I proposed was not going to be approved. For my personal  benefit, it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me  because I formed my companies, November 10th, 1980, Engineering  Consultants International, and under that Training Consultants  International.  Left the University July 1st, 1981 to run my companies. I haven   t pushed  it so much recently, but I   m still doing mostly training for all the major  companies worldwide. I wrote the manuals and developed the training  20  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  for new engineers for Saudi Arabia; Arco Alaska; and Maersk in  Denmark. In fact, I   ll be in Denmark a week from next Sunday, well  London a week next Sunday and then Denmark the next week. But I  still love Northeastern, just like I feel the same way about Oklahoma  State, but it's such a shame what politics can do.  Is Oklahoma different from other states in that respect?  I don   t know, but I think David Boren has done a fantastic job at OU,  but anyway.  As a student leader, you had experiences and encounters with different  campus administrators, and you   ve talked a little bit about that, but I  wanted to know if you have any other stories to share about that. You  mentioned you had a lot of respect for President Willham?  Yes.  And did you meet with him on any kind of a regular basis or anything?  No, not very often. My primary contact was with the Dean of Student  Affairs and Dean Patchin, the Dean of Women.  Do you have any other stories about her?  No. She was just very conscientious of what she did and she was just in  panic that night when I got over there. Very high regards for the heads  of various engineering departments. They   re the ones I worked with  primarily. Bob Kamm and I became real friends, met him first through  the Wesley Foundation. He was president when I got my master   s at that  time, but I had no problems. Dr. MacVicar was very distant and he  didn   t   I think he went from here to Oregon State as the president of the  University there. I   m not sure but I don   t have any disrespect for him.  That was just his personality and he was always professional with me.  What would you say was your leadership style?  It   s like we   re talking right here, I think. I was on the Physics faculty at  the university in Tahlequah, set up the degree in Engineering Physics.  And one summer, the chairman of the division and this is later a dean   s  position, but the chairman of the division of Natural Science and  Mathematics took leave to finish his doctorate. And I was an instructor.  To be classified as an assistant professor you had to have thirty hours  beyond a master   s. Well I didn   t have hardly anything beyond a  master   s. I was an instructor, but the division decided to vote to elect  their interim chairman that summer. I was just this young fellow and it  21  came down between me and a math faculty, who was later dean of the  graduate school and had his Ph.D., and I won that hands down.  So here   s this instructor, chairman of Science and Math, and then I was  forced to start on my Ph.D. at Arkansas. It was convenient, 59 miles  from my house. And if I had to name the number one engineer with  whom I   ve ever worked as a professional, no one could be above my  major professor at the University of Arkansas, Dr. Ing-Chang Jong. Dr.  Jong is Taiwanese, about three years younger than I   fantastic  experience. So often the Ph.D. is a survival event, but I was just so  fortunate to have him. As soon as I   well to be named permanent  chairman of Science and Math, the chairman who   d taken leave came  back. I had everything approved for my Ph.D. in May of 1975, and  immediately, when the University received the letter they named me  chairman of Science and Math, permanent.  They   d set up a College of Arts and Sciences that year also, and  appointed a dean, who was a history professor, who had only one year to  retirement, so when he retired, I was named Dean of Arts and Sciences.  And the drama people, the sociologists, the music people might have  been quite concerned that this engineer was named their dean, but we  had a ball. We had a fantastic drama department and music department  and also Northeastern had the highest percent acceptance of pre-meds to  the professional schools of medicine of any college or university in  Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas, including the major  universities.  When I went in as Chairman of Science and Math, I was over that area.  I inherited it. I   m not the one who took it to that level. As dean of Arts  and Sciences, I still was over that area. I was over Arts and Letters and  Sociology and Natural Science and Math. So I was called over to the  acting president, the previous president had been removed, and he told  me to start a College of Optometry at the university in Tahlequah. I was  na  ve enough to think that I   d been picked for that position because I  was over the pre-med area and I knew nothing about optometry. So also  meeting with me was the medical student advisor, who was now  chairman of Science and Math after I left.  I started making contacts and I found number one in the U.S. in  Optometry, Dean Chester Pheiffer from the University of Houston.  There were only thirteen or fourteen schools at the time. By the way,  the profession accepted me as one of them. That was amazing to me.  They invited me to the quarterly meetings of the board of directors of the  Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry, the presidents and  the deans, and that   s when I met Dr. Pheiffer. Dr. Pheiffer had polio  back in the days when they put you in a body cast. He was very much  22  Neurohr  physically disabled. When he walked he threw his legs   one of the  most powerful men I   ve ever known, so we hired him away from the  College of Optometry, at Houston. And now the Oklahoma College of  Optometry is number one in the U.S. and is called by many number one  in the world.  And by setting it up, I outsmarted E.T. Dunlap, because the intention  was that it be placed at Tahlequah but then fail. The reason I know that  is Dr. Pheiffer   and I could write a book on this one. I could not attend  one of the quarterly meetings. They were having one of the quarterly  meetings of the board in Washington, D.C. and I could not attend. So  Dr. Pheiffer, I had hired him as a consultant. He was still dean at  Houston. I got a call one afternoon, my secretary said,    Dr. Pheiffer   s  on the phone from Washington.    I picked up, I said,    Hey Chet, what's  going on?    He said,    What's going on there?    I said,    What do you  mean?    Spurgeon Eure, who was the president of the College of  Optometry at the University of Memphis, Southern College of Memphis.  Visualize Carroll O   Connor in The Heat of the Night, and you   ve got the  personality of Spurgeon Eure. Spurgeon was a bit more sophisticated.     And Spurgeon just told me that the president of the university had  visited him last week in Memphis, and asked him to help kill the college  at Northeastern, because he couldn   t do it by himself.    And I said,     What?     I began to put together what was going on, and behind the scenes I got  nine million dollars of clinics with the College of Optometry in the new  Indian Hospital, and no one was aware of that. And so when I released  it to the press the Chancellor of Higher Education went into absolute  orbit. And I got called into the office of the president, who came from  Heavener, by the way and is now in Edmond. He was mad as he could  be. And I was aware that he had been a page to David Boren at the state  Capitol and I just smiled at him and I said,    You know if       Someone  had sent him this newspaper article anonymously with a Muskogee  postmark to the Chancellor. And the Chancellor had called him, really  upset, and I said, just smiled at him and I said,    You know things like  that happen occasionally.     A couple of nights later, the chancellor was interviewed in The Tulsa  Tribune, and it was as if he had thought up the idea, and how are you  going to turn down nine million dollars in clinics free to the state of  Oklahoma. And I could write a book on what went on behind the scenes  here, but anyway that   s my style. I   ve tried the best I can to always be  honest and be straight but I found out how na  ve I was in the early days,  in so many events.  You have an excellent memory with details and about your experiences  23  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  here. And there are some more things that I   d sure like to ask you about  your time here at OSU.  Yes.  One of the things I wanted to get back to is the Pistol Pete and a little  more detail about that. And you all had gone through the process of  selecting him as the official mascot, and back to the stories about  looking for the outfit, and what that was like. So could you talk about  that a little more?  We decided what we wanted and laid out the basic plan, but I think I  really mentioned just about all the details that I remember. I remember  going to Bulley Good Saddle Shop in Muskogee, which was the area  leather place for cowboys, and looking at chaps and other paraphernalia  for Pistol Pete. And Jill Roberts and John Smith, as I recall, went to  Houston looking for similar apparel. Well, I think it   s from Houston  that they checked and found the big head and the big hat for the initial  Pistol Pete. Of course, the facial appearance has changed considerable  from that original. That   s about all I remember about it.  What about the holster and the guns, anything about that?  No, I don   t remember anything about that at all. But it made a major  impact on campus when it hit.  Was there any discussion about whether to have the braids or the hair  the way it was?  Not that I remember at all. But I really remember Eaton riding the  stagecoach in the Homecoming parades. At least the first two years I  was here, as I recall.  Did you ever see him on campus at all?  Not that I remember.  Were you at the first sporting event where the mascot came out?  I   m sure I was, but I don   t remember. The thing I remember most about  the sporting events was Hank Iba. Of course the arena was small, so we  had odd and even tickets to go to basketball games. My seats were right  up behind Coach Iba and by the end of every game he had no more voice  left, and it always was that way. Eddie Sutton was a year ahead of me,  so Eddie was here when I was here.  24  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  I think one of things I remember most was at the beginning of football  games the    Oklahoma Aggie Band, the most colorful band in all the  land.    And when I arrived John Rusco was the drum major. John was  from Stillwater, and had on the big hat, and it gave the whole crowd cold  chills. When he came down the field he could touch the ground with the  back of his head and he was graceful as he did it. And, in fact, I   d like  to find a film of John coming out. They tried to repeat that after he  graduated but they were never able to get back to the John Ruscoe. It   s  difficult to be graceful coming down the field leaning so far backwards  as he did. But, they came out and they did the Star Spangled Banner. I  remember that    The Oklahoma Aggie Band, the most colorful band in  all the land,    and here they came out on the field.  I was looking right down the field from my room at 344 Cordell Hall.  By the way, this morning I had breakfast at Fort Gibson at my wife   s  restaurant. We   re trying to bring back old downtown with Arlie Perry.  And Arlie and Budo came to OSU. Arlie was in the same room that I  was in, 344 Cordell Hall. By the way Budo has a Ford Mustang that   s  OSU orange, so we   re big time Oklahoma State.  How did you participate in Homecoming? What was Homecoming like  when you were? You talked about the parade, and how the parade was  very big.  We always made the rounds of all the houses and dormitories the night  before because of the decorations. All the fraternities and all the  sororities and all the dormitories had fantastic displays out front, and the  lighting and so on. So the night before, that was a three or four hour  event, just walking around the campus.  Did it have the name walk-around like it does now?  No, not that I remember but it was big time. And it was an exciting  time.  Were there mostly students walking around and looking at things, or did  alumni come back for that event?  I   m sure there were a lot of alumni here for it also. It was big.  What about any other campus traditions that were occurring while you  were here, any Theta Pond stories?  Oh, big time, Theta Pond stories, and primarily with honorary  fraternities. I pledged Pi Tau Sigma, which was the mechanical  engineering honorary fraternity. We had to build these gears that we  25  held on our arm like shields, similar to the big one you see behind the  old engineering building, that you spin. And we were given names and  we were in this role all week long. Every time we went into the  engineering building we had to hold up our shield, and spin it and spin  the big wheel. My name was    Floatma Boatright.    I   m    Sorry Pledge  Floatma Boatright says have a good day.    And that was a real  experience also, because all week long, we   d meet at Theta Pond and the  members would come up and we had to spin these wheels for I think two  minutes or something.  We had to build our own wheels on ball bearings and we   d spent the  whole weekend building these wheels. And the first day this fellow  comes up and breaks mine off the bearings and so I   m ready to go after  him. I   m not aware of why they   re trying to make us mad. But then  Friday night, I believe it was Friday night maybe Saturday night, we had  to feed them a dinner, all the members and their wives dinner, at a  restaurant. We had to be the ushers and serve them dinner. Then we  had to go to the Engineering Building to the drafting rooms on the fourth  floor of the old Engineering Building and take an examination. So we  had to pass this engineering examination before we   d be accepted as  members. And we were already exhausted from what we   d been  through all week long, and tearing our wheels off our bearings and  having to spin the wheels and go through all that we had gone through,  and meet everyday at Theta Pond.  This exam was very difficult, about a two-hour examination. So about  midnight we finished the exams, and they blindfolded us and took us to  these rooms throughout the Engineering Building, and set us on a big  stool, blindfolded with your wheel on your arm for about an hour. Then  finally someone came in and said,    Kirk you failed the examination.  You   re the only one who failed. This has never happened before. We  don   t know what we   re going to do. We   re trying to figure out some  way, because we hate to, after all you   ve been through this week, hate to  not let you in the organization. I have to go back. We   re having a  meeting,    and they left. About an hour later someone would come back  and say,    We   re doing our best.    Then finally an hour later, by now it   s  three in the morning, or three thirty in the morning, and they said,     We   ve called some faculty members and the dean to come up and give  you a verbal exam, so we   ll come back and get you shortly.     Finally they came up, still blindfolded, walked you down the hall,  walked you in this door, and you hear the door open. And they stood  you, had a broom stick lying down there, and they put this broomstick in  the middle of your shoes. You   re standing with this broomstick on your  shoes, and you had this blindfold on all the time. And you   re aware  there   s a light here, so they pull your blindfold off and there   s a spot  26  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  light right in your eyes. Well the first one to start questioning me was  obviously Dean Lohmann, the dean of Engineering. They told me,     These people have gone to really put themselves out because you   re the  only one they   re having to do this with, and they had gotten up in the  middle of the night to come down here and see if they can be considerate  of you.    So they asked you these questions, and then they blindfolded  you again and took you back up and sat you on the stool.  About an hour later I began to figure out what was going on because I  heard Bill Livesay, another pledge, tell this member what he thought  about him,    You know, you can take this and shove it. I   m not putting  up with anymore of this,    and I realized, finally, they were doing this to  all of us. I begin to figure it out finally. I heard all this noise  downstairs, this yelling and screaming and I didn   t know what was  going on. It went on and on and on for like thirty or forty minutes.  Finally, they came and got me and took me in this room, told me to duck  walk across this room. They took the blindfolds off of me, and here were  these members all lined up yelling and screaming at me,    Duck walk,  sorry pledge  Duck walk, sorry pledge      When you got to the end, they congratulated you for making it through  the week, but then they gave you three shots with a paddle. You could  hit three members one time each, or one member three times each. And  any member who did not make someone mad enough to hit them, he got  hit by the whole bunch. So that   s why they were trying to make us so  mad all week long. And I picked one person to do all three of mine.  Then when I pledged Sigma Tau, the general engineering honor  fraternity. Our pyramid is in front of the old, where are we? Our  pyramid is front of the old engineering building, and that was also  Agriculture Week. Every night the Ag students would cover our  pyramid with manure. So the next morning pledges had to go out and  clean the pyramid of manure. We painted one of their bulls green, and  shaved Sigma Tau on its side. So anyway, yes we had some fun times.  But I was very much involved in the Wesley Foundation, and the  Wesley Foundation was very active and so was the BSU, and good times  on campus. We had good times.  Some of the other student organizations you were in, Blue Key was an  honors society you were in.  I was president of Blue Key.  And was that your senior year only or   ?  That came after I   d been elected to the, I was president of the senate so  27  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  that was my senior   it was limited. They limited the ones they gave  offers to. And I think it was my senior year. They did not make offers  till later in your time here. I was president of Blue Key, president of  ASME, Wesley Foundation.  I saw in one of your yearbooks you were on the president   s honor roll,  five times and you had mentioned how hard you had to study when you  were a freshman.  I studied hard, but I did that in high school also.  So you were accustomed to that already?  My second semester Joy Childers was my English teacher, and it was a  five hour course in English. I would have had a four point my second  semester also except I made a B in English because our final was a  theme. If you misspelled a word, you had an automatic letter grade loss.  And I wrote my theme and went back through it and checked it, and  added a sentence with the word churches in it. And I misspelled the  word churches, so I got a B on my final and I made a B in the course.  Another semester, I would have made a four point, I think it was, except  I had a three-hour course in fluid mechanics. I had eighty-seven and two  fifths, instead of eighty-seven and three fifths. Had it rounded up to  eighty-eight, I would have had an A in that course. I think that was fluid  mechanics, I   m not sure. But anyway, most of my studying was done at  four o   clock in the morning and later. Had it not been for KRMG, and  oh what was his name, their DJ   country western music, I probably  would not have made it through university.  So you listened to music while you studied?  Country and western all the time.  Did any bands come through and play while you were here?  Here? Oh yes.  Country bands?  I don   t remember country so much. I remember Bob Hope being here.  Oh so many I remember, the old bands, I don   t remember the names of  them now. But they had programs every year in the gymnasium, and  yes. Ella Fitzgerald was here one time I remember. But most of the  really popular bands at the time did come through. We tried to  participate in all of those. I remember going to a national student  28  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  meeting, Methodist student meeting in Athens, Ohio at the University of  Ohio, and the speaker was Martin Luther King. We never knew at the  time, the level of these people later.  Were you a student leader in high school?  Oh, I was I guess. I was valedictorian. My sister was valedictorian. I  played baseball. President of the class was almost like a brother to me.  He and his brother and I, we woke one another up from the time we  could walk. In the mornings, one of us would be at the other   s house.  He was elected in the seventh grade, as our president, so we elected him  president all the way through. And later at the university when I was  dean of Arts and Sciences, Fort Gibson had a fantastic school when I  went through. I came up here and I was really not challenged. I worked  hard but I made good grades and it was because of Fort Gibson Schools.  Doyle Stone was my math teacher and Emmit Wheat was the physics  teacher, algebra teacher, algebra in eighth grade, he was also our choir  director. And when I was at the university, I was their dean. Both  Doyle and Emmit were two of the best math teachers we had at the  university. And I was their dean when I was dean of Arts and Sciences.  So you can imagine how that went. We had a good time.  Tell me about the Library. When you walked in the Library, you shared  something with us today.  The smell, the smell of the Library hasn   t changed a bit. We would  come to the Library, and in the summer time it was so cold you could  hang beef in here, and in the winter time it was hot. So I remember the  temperature never did work out quite right, but we   d come to the Library  and study, and mainly the two big rooms out here. On weekends I   d go  downstairs and hide in a corner somewhere, because it was all isolated  downstairs.  In the basement?  In the basement, I   d find a table over in the corner and study. We   d meet  at the Library and then go to the Union fourth floor and drink coffee and  then come on back. The first pizza I ever had in my life was at    Campus  Hideaway.     Oh tell me about that.  I did not care for it. Today they taste nothing like the original did. But I  would give anything to have a pizza from Dewey   s Pizza Palace,  because I   ve never found that good of a pizza since. It was down, what  29  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  is this, Washington that goes down by the Wesley Foundation? It was  on the next corner past AGR, it sat on that corner right there. Dewey   s  Pizza Palace, and my graduate year there were three of us, Charlie  Nuckolls, Jim Beattie, and I we were going for our master   s in  mechanical engineering. We had an apartment out in town, and we got  up here the Sunday afternoon before school started, and they   d leased  our apartment out from under us.  We found a single room on the back of an old two-story house about a  block and a half from the fire station to the Southeast, and this house  was an elderly couple   s. We paid fifteen dollars a month apiece for this  room, and it was size from here to there. Three of us lived in this room,  about ten feet by twelve feet. We had three single beds, two chest-of-drawers.  To get to the bottom drawer you had to pull it out to the middle  of the floor. Water ran down the north wall. In the winter we had ice  inside the room in the wintertime. We had to go through the closet and  the kitchen of these people   s house to get to the bathroom, and it had  cobwebs the top foot. And in the morning when it was cold, we would  lay our clothes out, and we   d run to the Student Union as fast as we  could every morning. I have a picture of one of my roommates Jim  Beattie, who later was head of mechanical engineering at the University  of Tulsa. Jim   s in bed, he   s got on a fatigue jacket, all of his clothes on  the bed, he   s got a hat pulled down over his ears, sitting in bed smoking  a cigar, ready to go to bed with ice on the wall behind him, so we had a  good time.  We went to the Okeene snake hunt, brought seven rattlesnakes back  from the snake hunt, and kept them in our room over the weekend. We  kept them in the room that week, and I told the guys,    I   m not about to  sleep in this room.    So we put each of them in a gunnysack and tied  them up. We had seven snakes in our room in that gunnysack. One of  them was about six feet long. You   d come into the room and kick the  cage, and they   d make a noise so that you couldn   t carry on a  conversation. We did all sorts of things like that.  Well what did you end up doing with those snakes?  We cleaned them and we gave them to the elderly couple where we lived  in their house. So anyway     Was Dewey   s Pizza here before Hideaway, or were they here about the  same time?  They were, I think right after, Dewey   s Pizza Palace. If I ever taste pizza  like that again I   ll know it.  30  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  We had another story this weekend, someone remembered Hideaway,  and they had never had pizza before, and they shared a memory about  that experience and how they didn   t really care for it too.  It was okay, but it wasn   t at all what we think of today as pizza. It was  more bland than today.  What about other restaurants in Stillwater?  I remember the restaurants. I don   t remember their name. Cliff   s   was  there a Cliff   s? I think down south in Stillwater, on the right, a  steakhouse. And right down town was, I think, a yellow brick restaurant  we went to a lot by the old Aggie Theater. Was it the Aggie Theater on  the corner? Leachman was on the corner and Aggie was in the middle  of the street. And it was right across from the Aggie, I think.  Did you go to movies much while you were in school?  Yes, the only one I remember was Picnic with Kim Novak. I remember  that. We went to that on the final day of finals week. I lived on the third  floor of Cordell Hall. Two doors down from the hall from us were Billy  Tom Stewart and Dexter Bellis from Shawnee. They were majoring in  agriculture and every Sunday night they   d come back from Shawnee and  all those guys would go to the movie and then leave on Friday night.  Billy Tom had a spittoon by his bed, and then they had a radio in his  room that had a sign on it that said,    If you don   t like country music,  keep your damn hands off of this radio.     We had a good time and I   ve got a picture. I found a picture of the  several of them, I don   t think Dexter   s in that, standing out in front of  Cordell when they put the banner after I   d won the presidency, up on   the front of  Cordell Hall. We had a really good time. Mr. and Mrs.  Rogers were our house parents in Cordell and they were just fantastic.  He told me, he said,    I saved this room for you when you pledged that  fraternity, because I figured you were gonna be back,    so when I went  back Sunday morning and said,    Mr. Rogers, I need to come back to this  place.     Where did they live?  They lived there in the dorm.  On the first floor?  Yes, right off where the mail boxes were, as I remember.  31  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  So they had a good relationship with all the students there?  Oh big time, they were like parents. Then later, the next summer and I  think the next year, my roommate was Jerry Moore from Claremore. He  worked down in the cafeteria and I think he made fifty-five cents an  hour, working down in the cafeteria.  Was the food good at Cordell?  Yes, it was good. I assure they bought a surplus of brussels sprouts and  mixed vegetables from somewhere. Four of us went to MIT  representing Pi Tau Sigma, the mechanical engineering fraternity,  Gilbert Whitlow, Scott, and I don   t remember the other   s name, but we  drove from here to Boston. And I remember taking a taxi in Boston to  the meeting at MIT and the cab driver asked us if we came out of  Oklahoma by stagecoach. He was dead serious about it, so anyway, we  probably told him yes. Also, when we got back on campus, I was eating  down in Cordell cafeteria and someone asked us about our trip. I said,     We saw more pretty girls driving back on campus than we saw the  whole week in Boston,    and there were two guys at the table from  Boston, and I didn   t know. And that went over big time with them I can  assure you, but anyway.  I guess most of the students were probably from Oklahoma?  Yes, most were.  International students here?  Several international. One from Turkey,    the Turk    who ran for Student  Senate and he started out with just a blank piece of paper on all the light  poles on campus. Then    What is this?    and then there was a picture of a  turkey on the next one he put up, and I don   t remember whether he won  the election or not. But there were a lot of Asian graduate students here  at the time. I remember while I was doing my work for my master   s  thesis out at the old mechanical engineering Quonset, out there where  the baseball field is. Jack Holman was doing his work for his Ph.D., and  Jack later wrote a textbook I used later in heat transfer.  Jack had this massive system set up where he needed city water to stay  within a certain pressure. On Saturday nights every once in a while all  the water pressure in the whole city of Stillwater went to zap, and that  messed him up big time. A lot of Saturday nights I was out there  working also, and he   d really get upset. We tried to figure out what in  the world was happening, what caused it to happen. We finally figured  it out, the big TV show was Gunsmoke, at that time, and every time there  32  was a commercial in Gunsmoke, the water pressure in Stillwater just  plummeted. So he found out he should not do his work during  Gunsmoke, and oh just a lot of memories like that.  Back in the nostalgia time, I graduated in Fort Gibson and our high  school was a WPA building built in 1939, 1940. It was sold at auction in  1970 when Fort Gibson built this fantastic new complex, and after 1970  it was just cannibalized. When it was sold it had a new maple  gymnasium floor in it, it was in good shape. One of the first things they  did was knock a hole in the wall of the gymnasium, through this  beautiful sandstone. They drove trucks in on that floor and built storage  buildings. By 1997,    96-   97, it had had four different owners that just  cannibalized it. The windows were falling out. There were old cars out  front. The roof was collapsing and the city was going to condemn it.  I just couldn   t stand for that to happen and a girl I   d gone all the way  through high school with was on the town council. I started trying to  negotiate to buy it and she was trying to delay the city condemnation of  it because they   d just bulldoze this down. This is a 20,000 square foot  building. The walls are 17 inch hand-cut sandstone, not a crack in it. The  owner would not let me go in so I ended up buying it sight unseen  inside. I could see the holes in the roof that the rafters appeared to be in  good shape, and these are two-by-six furniture-grade pine from the  1930   s, not a knot in them. But the next week, the whole east roof  dropped six inches because all the support structure had rotted out so.  The Tulsa World heard I had bought it and they contacted me and asked  if they could do an article on me buying my old high school. I said,     Fine, I   m down there often.    I made arrangements to meet a reporter  and a photographer down there one morning, this lady and her  photographer, took her through the old school. No big deal. Two days  later, front page, the second section of the Tulsa World, local section,  two-thirds of the old Fort Gibson High School,    with a colored picture  across the top showing the roof collapsing, holes in the roof, and  windows falling out, and the old cars. Womble Company, which has  Pella windows in Oklahoma, read about that and contacted me and asked  if we could work a deal for them to duplicate the original windows. So I  gave them pictures of all the original windows.  It has all new support structure in it and all new roof on it. The  gymnasium roof had collapsed and all that was left was   and I   ve got  pictures of all this, these steel girders. So the gym roof is all redone, as it  was originally with natural finish yellow pine. It   s beautiful. And it has  all new Pella windows custom built to the originals, wooden thermal  pane. Just like a hundred windows, two and a half feet wide, and seven  or eight feet high, some curved at the top. I got a company out of  33  Neurohr  Boatright  Broken Arrow to redo all the plaster inside, and a new concrete floor  with plumbing stubbed out   put hard wood back on top of the concrete.  My plan is to donate it back to the city, for younger youth, and  community and adult programs but I will not let politics control it. I  bought three and three-quarters acres next to it also, as a part of it. And  the school said they   d let me duplicate the pictures of all the graduating  classes, and put them back in the halls. But, Alan Greenspan changed  my plan when he killed the stock market in 1999 and 2000. I blame him  for most of what happened to our economy. I was doing that all out of  my retirement so it has been kind of delayed. At least it   s in the dry, and  it   s in the process.  Also I bought the old drugstore back, the corner drugstore which was  right across from my dad   s general store. When Dad first came to Fort  Gibson from Arkansas his brother had the general store and he had the  drugstore, my dad did. My mother was teaching English in Sand  Springs and her closest friend was the president   s secretary at  Northeastern. Dad   s best friend was Lawrence Owens, and Buella Mae,  Mom   s best friend, was dating Lawrence. They stopped in the drugstore  one day for them to get something to drink and that   s where my dad met  my mother. And so I bought the old drugstore back, and we   re gonna  take it back to the original.  These are Indian Territory buildings. The drugstore was built in 1906.  My wife has put a small restaurant in next to the old drugstore building,  in a building that was also there at that time. We live 24 miles from  there. She gets up at 4:30 every morning and drives down and opens by  six. When I   m not travelling with my company, I   m traveling about 25  weeks a year now and doing training and consulting in the oil business,  I   m down there by 6:15 to have coffee with the guys, and solve world  problems, as we did this morning at 6:15.  What's the name of the restaurant?     Classic Kitchen    and we   re getting ready to expand into part of the old  drugstore that was not part of the old drugstore, with a major restaurant,  and then we   re going to open up the old drugstore. My brother-in-law  and I, my brother-in-law was president, my sister   s husband, was  president of Bank of America, Tahlequah/Fort Gibson/Muskogee.  When big banks started taking over the small banks, I went over to his  house one afternoon in Tahlequah, and he was sitting in his driveway on  his Harley. It was a winter day in January, spitting snow, and I didn   t  know whether he was coming or going. He was there by himself and I  said,    Tony, you   ve been president of more banks than anyone I   ve ever  known, without ever moving your chair.    There is First National Bank  34  Neurohr  Boatright  of Tahlequah, which was a fantastic small town bank, which was bought  by Commercial Bank Holding Company out of Muskogee, which was  bought by BancFour out of Wichita, which was bought by Boatman   s  out of St. Louis, which was bought by NationsBank out of North  Carolina. Now Nations Bank has taken over Bank of America, and they  had taken him from 76 employees in Tahlequah to 11. I   d already  cancelled accounts. I couldn   t work with them there.  I told him,    Let   s buy a bank.    So we bought Fort Gibson State Bank,  and about four years ago, we   re not there now but, it was named by the  American Bankers Association as the number one small bank in  Oklahoma. So, I   m really involved in Fort Gibson again, as well as  Tahlequah. My wife and I are doing a housing addition in Tahlequah  less than a mile from the university. So I   ll probably go bankrupt before  long, so, anyway, we   re having a good time.  Well, how do you feel about Oklahoma history, the area that you   re in?  I mean obviously you have a deep love for it you want to see it  preserved.  That includes all of Oklahoma history. You know, it   s really disgusting  how we ignore it. And I was listening to KRMG radio, Tulsa, about  three years ago, and heard on the news that Tulsa was requesting  19  million dollars from centennial funds for an arboretum northwest of  Tulsa, to celebrate the centennial. And I thought big deal. How much is  Fort Gibson getting, because there   s nowhere in Oklahoma that can  touch Fort Gibson for national history, and almost no one knows that in  the state. It   s a state treasure not just a Muskogee County treasure. And  so I checked and the answer is zero dollars. So I contacted the mayor,  Bob Peebles, Bob has died since then and I said,    I   m going to make  some people mad in Oklahoma City, probably.     I contacted the president of Friends of Fort Gibson, and they   d try to  help the old fort, which is an Oklahoma Historical Society facility,  that   s, is likely to be   the Historical Society is permitting to rot down. I  told her what I was going to do. I started to make some calls and Phil  Tomlinson married a girl from Fort Gibson, Carol Huggins. Carol and I,  we dated in high school and, in fact, we dated till the end of our first  semester here at OSU. Phil and I had become very good friends. He   s  really sharp and he   s Secretary of Transportation. I talked to Phil at our  50th class reunion and he told me about the Department of  Transportation program which they   ve used at Perkins and several other  towns. And so I initiated through him to get the people to come to  appear before the town council.  Then I had the town clerk make an appointment with Blake Wade,  35  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Chairman of the Centennial Commission and we met with him in  Oklahoma City   had no more money and so we haven   t backed off.  And Blake Wade, I respect him highly. He   s called me at home three  times. We have almost  600,000 dollars now  total from the  Department of Transportation and the Centennial Commission plus  matching funds , and redoing the four blocks coming in to the old stop  light at old downtown and brick sidewalks and beautiful streetlights.  That   s from the Department of Transportation.  Then from the Centennial Commission, we   ll build a centennial park on  the corner. When we get this finished five years from now, there   ll be  people driving from a hundred miles to see downtown Fort Gibson at  Christmas time. And I   m trying to figure out some way to get someone  to get the old high school but I   ll put controls over whatever happens.  By the way, I do have  28,000 dollars worth of vandalism in the old  school, done by a 13 year-old and a 14 year-old boy. We   re in the  process of trying work that out now.  You know, Sallisaw had a problem with that.  It   s really sad.  Yes, it is sad.  And these are single parent families and I   m not gonna put this on the  mothers. I want to get everyone involved. And it   s really sad what  happens, but if people like us don   t   you talk about Oklahoma history,  Mike Brown is the representative for the Cherokee County area and he  grew up at Fort Gibson. His mother is one of my   she was like family,  she was a year older than I. She died several years ago. And Mike said  in the legislature, he heard there was a meeting in Tahlequah to discuss  how to maintain the old forts of Oklahoma. He talked to the chairman of  the committee and he said,    Why don   t you do this meeting at Fort  Gibson?    And his response was,    Is there a fort at Fort Gibson?    This  state is illiterate as to what we have, the treasures we have. Instead of  rebuilding this beautiful Historical Society building in Oklahoma City to  celebrate our history, we   re letting the old fort at Fort Gibson rot down.  I called Earl Garrison, our senator and George Faught, our  representative. They   ve been fantastic. And Jim Wilson helped from  Cherokee County and they got  250,000 dollars. Earl got right on it. I  called him and called Jim, and they got  250,000 dollars to replace some  of the logs and restrooms and roofs. But Oklahoma   s letting their  treasures just rot down, basically.  I   m glad that there are people like you who are working to try to prevent  36  Boatright  that.  Well, it   s nostalgia. I have to watch what I say to the press, because  they come out with the wrong things. A reporter from The Muskogee  Phoenix wanted to interview me about buying the high school, and the  article started,    Kirk Boatright says that most of his success in life  comes from Fort Gibson.    I just blew. That   s not what I said. So  obviously, I called this reporter immediately, and I said,    If there   s  anything good about me, it can be traced to family and friends, and  neighbors and church and school at Fort Gibson.    That   s what I said.  And I told this reporter,    If I   m successful, I   m not the one to determine  that, but I   ve been very fortunate in life.     As my son said, I   ve been blessed. We   ve all been blessed in life, really.  Americans should go to Europe, and see Europe. On the 9/11, I was 150  miles out in the desert at the Buhasa Oil Camp. On the 9/11, I was the  only American out there. And the thing I remember most about that day,  we started our training courses early in the morning and I   d come back  to the camp and sleep about two hours of the afternoon. That day the  phone rang in my room at the camp, and it was my daughter calling from  Oklahoma. She knew we had satellite television, and she asked if I was  watching television. I said,    No. I   m asleep,    and she said,    Turn on  your TV.     It was about five minutes after the plane hit the second tower, but the  thing I remember most was calling my son, and his daughter, my  granddaughter Ashley. She was about ten years old at the time, she's 16  now, will be seventeen next month. I told her Sunday I   d like to take her  back to five, but anyway, five years old. But she was ten at the time,  and when I called my son, Ashley answered the phone, and here   s what I  remember most about that experience. I said,    Ashley?    she said,     Grandpa, you come home right now  There's gonna be a war.     Americans are not aware of what we   re up against and we don   t have  leadership now. Congress is, overall congress is scary, and Americans  had better know what's going on, because we have no concept of what  we   re up against. And I know about it, because I   ve been working over  there for 20 years now. But not only is it Oklahoma I   m worried about,  I   m concerned about our country, big time. One of the least of our  problems is energy. We   ve caused our energy problems and I figured  out how to solve our energy problems. Every time you stop a typical  automobile from 55 miles an hour, you waste enough energy to run a  100-watt light bulb for four hours. My solution is don   t stop at  stoplights and stop signs, and we   ll solve our problem very quickly,  especially in Houston.  37  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  No, we   re blessed to be Americans and we   d better be aware of that.  Last Christmas I got the DVDs, three DVDs called Liberty done by  History Channel, on the Revolutionary War. Every American ought to  watch that. And I gave a set to each of our children   s families, because  Americans are not aware of how much we owe to people who have  sacrificed tremendously to get us where we are.  I   m going to bring you back to OSU just a little bit more, I think.  Okay, I think I   ve told you everything I remember about OSU almost.  What about the name change? That was occurring.  I don   t remember any controversy.  No controversy over it?  Not that I remember. I think we did not want to lose the word    Aggie.     I still consider myself an Oklahoma Aggie. I   m a Cowboy, but I   m an  Aggie.  Well they actually have some merchandise in the student store now that  says Aggies again. But, you won several awards when you were a  student here. One was the St. Pat   s award.  Yes.  And they do still give that award. I believe that might be the highest  honor that they give in the College of Engineering.  No, the Hamilton Award. I don   t know that they still give that. That   s  why in the program I gave you, it says to be announced, it lists, I   m not  sure if it lists the St. Pat   s, but it lists the Hamilton award to be  announced. At that time it was the top student in the College of  Engineering, and     Does that award mean the most to you, out of the ones that you  received?  I   d say of the engineering awards, yes. One that means a tremendous  amount to me was when I was at Northeastern, on the Physics faculty.  Each year the outstanding faculty member was named by vote of the  members of the Oklahoma Education Association. And the first year,  the outstanding faculty member was chosen by student election, and  faculty election, I won. And to me, that   s a very major award, for me.  The fact that I was selected as the outstanding faculty member at the  38  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  university, when the students voted and the faculty voted. I   m not sure  how they weighted that, but that was major.  Do you feel like that your time at OAMC/OSU and your opportunities  with the student organizations and leadership positions that you had,  how do you feel that that has impacted your life?  I think the main thing, was what I told you I told all those young people.  That I   ve found out in my life that if you   re always honest in everything  you do, you do the best you can to be honest in everything you do, and  also do the best you can do in everything you do, that you   ve got 90  percent of your competition out-classed from the beginning. I never  expected any of this stuff. I got the Hamilton award. I never expected  that, I never thought of that. When I was in high school, John Eichling  and I were close friends and they called John    little Einstein    and he was.  He built telescopes and he was a genius. He was as smart as he could be.  And I never thought, I don   t think John ever did either,    Which one of  us is going to be valedictorian?     And Doyle Stone, my former math teacher I told you about, where I was  later his dean, Doyle was very conscientious. One of the best math  teachers anyone could ever expect to find. He set me up for OSU  Engineering, and Doyle was a perfectionist. He did not believe in giving  A   s, because no one was perfect. He would give you an A minus, but he  wouldn   t give you an A. When I was his dean at the university, he told  me the most difficult job he ever had was when the superintendent of  Fort Gibson told him to determine who was the valedictorian. And I got  it, and he said that he knew it could be controversial. The point is, I  never thought,    Am I going to be valedictorian?    I never thought about  it and I   m sure John didn   t either. Here at OSU I never thought,    I   m  going to try to be president of the student body,    until they talked me  into it. If Tom Tate hadn   t talked me into running for senate, I never  would have run for senate. But I   d say that   s the major lesson I learned.  Some students have those roles as goals in their lives, and to me it  sounds like, through your hard work and your efforts, sometimes people  saw qualities and recognized things in you, qualities that you didn   t see  in yourself, so much and some doors opened and the opportunities were  there, and you took advantage of them, which was wonderful and really  a great tremendous service from you back to your fellow students and  the university.  But much of that goes back to family and church. The scientist who  said,    I   m a scientist,    and the scientist who says they put science and  religion in competition with one another, at the same level, they don   t  know what science is. Carl Sagan is a good example. He died a very  39  frustrated scientist. Remember he wrote the books on astronomy and all  that? The billions and billions of stars, he was a very frustrated person  because he didn   t understand science. And so a lot of that goes to  church and my background in the church.  One of the most influential experiences I ever had was when I went to  Tahlequah on the faculty, and moved there in August of 1962. Went to  church the first Sunday in this professional   the people in our Sunday  school class were professionals. I was 25 years old and others were up  to early 30s, so many faculties from the university, some dentists and  doctors and had a very small group, only about ten per Sunday. This  elderly lady was our teacher and after a year or so, she resigned so we  had to find a new teacher and decide what to do.  We decided to elect our own teacher each year. And the first year this  faculty member in education and his wife served in that position, and the  next year this doctor from the Indian Hospital and his wife who was a  nurse, served. The third year I was elected and we decided to read the  New Testament out loud in class, every Sunday. We   d start with, what  we determined to be the oldest book, so we started with Galatians.  Some Sundays we would read one verse, or no verses or a chapter, and it  took us three years. And I found out that what the bible says is far  beyond what I   d been preached and a lot of what I   d been preached is  not what it says. It   s far more powerful than that. It had a major  influence on my life. Basically one of the messages is just keep cool.  Don   t get frustrated. Just appreciate the situation we   re in and take  advantage of that, and go from there.  When Jesus said to Peter,    You will deny me three times before the cock  crows,    he wasn   t predestining him. He knew Peter. I know what I  could go by the farm today and say to my son and I know how he would  respond. I tell you and you could do that with your kids too, probably.  One of the most powerful verses in the New Testament is when they  lead Jesus out and Peter sees him, and their eyes meet, and Peter realizes  what he   s done. A powerful story, as to how to live. The Wesley  Foundation had a big time influence on me. I   d say the Wesley  Foundation and BSU were two of the most influential organizations on  campus when I was here.  Harry Denman, we had what was it, Religious Emphasis Week. Harry  Denman was out of the Methodist Headquarters in Nashville. The  students picked who they wanted to do the final convocation, and each  time he came he did the final convocation. And that was in the days  when we could have that on the campus. Americans need to realize  what's happening. In the days of those convocations, in the auditorium,  it was packed with students. But we   ve gotten away from a lot of that  40  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  now. You have to be politically correct today.  Well, you   ve shared your philosophy and is that the advice you would  encourage people to follow? Are there any strategic directions at the  University you would like to see in particular?  Change in direction? OSU is doing it right as far as I can tell. I try to  keep up with it. We try to come to basketball games. I keep up with the  news. But not really, I   m impressed. I   ve been particularly impressed  with the presidents recently and Dr. Kamm when he was here.  How do you want to be remembered someday?  Well I just haven   t really thought about it. Remembered through the  lives of my family and children. My mother was a big time influence on  them also  I was very fortunate . And my father of course, he died. One  of my greatest regrets is he did not live long enough to see his  grandchildren, and he died within a five minute period, so.  You brought a letter that your father wrote to you. Would you like to  read that?  Yes. I don   t mind it. I found it last night as I was looking for materials  to bring to you.  What is the date of the letter?  May 1st, 1956. Before last night, I didn   t realize I had this and my wife  says I collect everything. My son says,    Dad, you don   t need a house,  you need a little cabin and a big warehouse.    But at least I saved my  baseball cards and my friends didn   t.  This is written on Tuesday, it has my dad   s store   s letterhead,  Boatright   s General Store, Ewell Boatright owner, Fort Gibson  Oklahoma.    Tuesday: Dear Kirk, Boy are we enjoying this rain. It  rained one and a half inches Saturday night and we have had about one  inch today. Our alfalfa, oats, and wheat sure are looking good. Hope  this will get rid of the bugs. Mother   s house cleaning today. Boy is the  house a mess. She is having the kitchen redecorated. It sure is going to  be nice. Kirk, we are planning to come up there Sunday so you can  come home Friday and go back with us Sunday. Call us when you get in  Muskogee. Love, Daddy.     We always called him Daddy, so anyway, I was very fortunate. By the  time I was 12 years old, he expected me to be at the store by 7:00  Saturday mornings. He would go down at 4:30, seven days a week. We  41  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  Boatright  lived in the new house behind the store. We moved there December  1941. And so I didn   t understand why I had to be there at seven o   clock,  because no one was there, but I was there at seven o   clock. When I was  old enough to start driving and doing things, he would ask me,    Kirk do  you want the car Saturday night?    And you think that did not have an  influence on me. I never had to ask him for anything, and I didn   t ask  for much money. I earned six dollars a day when I worked at the store  on Saturdays. After school I fed 20 calves during the winter time out at  the 40 acres we had. We had the farm, but he never had to ask me to  mow the yard or whatever. I just did it because he had so much  confidence in me, I wasn   t about to disappoint him.  I was so impressed when the store stayed open when I was a little boy  till eleven o   clock on Saturday nights, and by the time I was in junior  high, nine o   clock on Saturday nights. But when I was old enough to  start driving and dating, instead of working until nine o   clock on  Saturday nights, he said,    If you will help me at the check out stands  from six to seven, while the boys go back and sit on the sacks of feed  and eat a bologna sandwich, then you can leave at seven.    I didn   t have  to ask him, he said,    You can take the car.    So that had a big influence  on me. It had a big influence when my son was in high school in  Tahlequah. Many parents were buying his friends new sports cars, and I  told him,    If you will cut wood, out at the place, I   ll cut down the trees  you can cut them up, and buy you a vehicle.    So his first vehicle was an  old Chevrolet pickup, had fenders of three different colors on it. And he  is 36 years old now, and about five years ago, he thanked me for that.  And that came from my parents, I   d say. Our area   s not a high-income  area but it   s a high quality of life area.  Is there anything else you want to add?  No. I think we   ve done it. My wife, we   ve been married two years.  We   ve been close friends now since 1996, and she grew up in Qualls,  Oklahoma, one of 11 children. She is a workaholic and we   re having a  great time. She is adored by my children and grandchildren. When she  was 13 she was feeding cattle with her two brothers down on Tenkiller,  so anyway I feel very fortunate.  Well thank you so much for coming and sharing your experiences and  stories today. We really appreciate your participation in the project.  And you left very early this morning, and had a long drive, and are you  headed back home today?  We create the problems at my wife   s restaurant at 6:15 every morning,  and I was going to be down there anyway this morning. But then we  solve them at Dano   s Convenience store this afternoon in Tahlequah at  42  Neurohr  Boatright  Neurohr  2:30. So I   m going back to, my wife says I take too many coffee breaks.  Every time I come through at OSU, Gallagher-Iba, and the Library, and  it kind of gives me chills or something. It   s a tremendous   Oklahoma  State I   m sure, I think Oklahoma State probably more than other  universities, we are aware of what we have. The new Gallagher-Iba is  awesome.  Yes, I love being here, it   s a wonderful place.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
