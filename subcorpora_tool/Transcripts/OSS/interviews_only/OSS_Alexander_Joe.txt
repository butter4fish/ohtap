 Gill. Today is December 4th, 2008. I   m visiting with  Dr. Joe Alexander in the OSU Library on the Oklahoma State University  campus. This interview is for the O-State Stories Project which is part of  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Joe, it is good to have  you with us.  Thank you, Jerry. It   s always good to be with you.  Those at OSU know a lot about Dr. Joe Alexander, but can you share a  little bit about your early life? Where you grew up and where you went  to school?  Sure. I grew up in rural northern Virginia back when the Redskins were  still playing in Griffith Stadium and the Washington Senators were still a  baseball team, so that was a long time ago. Went to a local grade school  and high school, then when I was almost through my senior year in high  school, my father was transferred to Arizona. He worked for the  telephone company. So I went out there and went to the University of  Arizona to go to undergraduate school. For as long as I can remember,  all I wanted to be was a veterinarian. That   s all I wanted to do, and  Arizona didn   t have a veterinary school, so I went to Colorado State to  veterinary school then went to Cornell University for my graduate work  in veterinary surgery. Went to private practice for a year, then the  University of Tennessee started a new veterinary school. I went there in  1976 and had a great early academic career. It was an exciting place to  be with the new school. Then Virginia built a veterinary school, and I  wanted to go there in the worst way and was very fortunate to be hired  there.  Something had happened at the University of Tennessee. The dean had  called me to his office, and at Tennessee the dean   s office is on a hill. So  you have to walk up the hill to get there, and I swear he always called  5  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  you up on the hottest day of the year, so when you got there you were  always perspiring. He really gave me some great advice. He said,    You  know, you ought to think about going into administration.    And he was  willing to support me to go back to graduate school at night, and I got  my master   s in educational administration and supervision there at  Tennessee. Then  I  went to Virginia Tech as a faculty member, and was  fortunate enough to become director of the teaching hospital and later to  become department head. I was planning to stay there my whole life. I  think Blacksburg is a wonderful place. It reminds you a lot of Stillwater  and Oklahoma State University. Then I got a call from Larry Boger and  was very fortunate to be hired as the dean here in 1985.  Going back a little bit, where do you think your love for being a  veterinarian came from?  Well, first of all, I think you have to love animals, and I always loved  animals. Our local   we had a small farm. When I say that  I mean   seven acres, 4-H projects, farm, and dogs. And our veterinarian was a  guy that I just really, really looked up to. He was not only, I think, a  wonderful person, but he was active in the community and just the kind  of person you want to emulate.  Can you give us the little story about when Dr. Boger came to you?  What did you think of Oklahoma State University and that opportunity?  Sure. Well I   d never been to Oklahoma, so I   d never been to Oklahoma  State. I used to say Willard Scott gave the weather and he stood in front  of Oklahoma so I didn   t know where it was. When I got a call from Dr.  Boger, you have to remember I was thirty-seven years old and I had  been a department head for two years. I thought,    This guy   s got the  wrong number.    But it was a great honor. It was just a great honor to  even be considered. Came out and fell in love with Stillwater, and I felt  like the opportunities here for the veterinary college were really great  because as you go through your dean   s interview, you interview with  people outside the university, and I think it   s because of the state   s  dependence on animal agriculture, people outside of the university took  great pride in the veterinary school. And I just thought,    Boy there   s  something you can   t buy.    I   ve certainly been to schools that are much,  much better funded. They have bigger and better facilities and bigger  faculty, but the pride the people in Oklahoma take in the veterinary  school is unique.  What were some early challenges for you in the college when you  assumed the dean   s position?  Well when I interviewed for the job, Dr. Boger indicated to me that the  6  Gill  Alexander  state had just given the biggest percentage increase to the university in  its recent history. There had been significant salary raises that year. I  arrived on May 15th, and on June 15th I got a letter from the governor  saying that we should withhold 10 percent of our budget because oil had  fallen to 12 dollars a barrel. So certainly I didn   t know where the men   s  room was, much less where I was going to find 10 percent of our budget.  Now, we never had to give that back. And as you may know the  veterinary school is somewhat unique in that we don   t get our funding  from the university. Funding comes directly from the state regents, as it  does to OSU   s medical school and OU   s medical school and the law  school, so any cuts that are made, you   re on your own for those. So  certainly that was a big thing to have to deal with right away.  I thought that the real strength, as I got to Oklahoma State, was that this  university produced students that could immediately go out and  contribute to a practice. They were well trained in the everyday things of  a veterinary practice. I felt that what was lacking was the whole school  was geared towards that. I thought that we needed to be more geared to  research. We needed to be more geared to bringing in clinical specialists  that were going to enhance the national reputation and institution, and  certainly we had to work on finding more sources, so those were the big  challenges.  Can you talk about some of the areas that you felt needed to be  strengthened, like research and some of the things you did to enhance  funding for research?  Well as I looked at the clinic first   and of course the clinical science is a  hallmark of any veterinary college. The clinic didn   t open until eleven  o   clock in the morning, and it closed at four o   clock in the afternoon.  The reason it did that is because they had so few faculty, and faculty  were expected to teach courses, they were expected to give extension  programs and expected to run the clinic. Just couldn   t do it all. So I felt  like one of the first things we needed to do was double the size of the  clinical faculty, and we set upon doing that.  Now there had been some controversies that had taken place before I got  here, and the aftermath of that was there were lots of open positions. We  really concentrated on taking the current faculty and encouraging them  to enhance their academic credentials and bringing in people that I felt  like somebody from outside of Oklahoma would say,    They hired a  good person. They   ve hired a person that has written these articles or  written this book.    And then we proceeded to assign faculty rotations on  and off the clinic floor so they weren   t expected to be on the clinic floor  and teaching formal classes at the same time. However, I expected the  clinic to open at 7:30 in the morning and not to close until we were done  7  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  at night. And that was a change, that was a cultural change, but we all  worked through that.  And then in research, I felt like if we were not good in cattle and horses,  I wasn   t going to be dean for very long, because that   s what was  important to Oklahoma. So we tried to strengthen and work on, again,  bringing in faculty that were going to actively participate in the research  programs looking at those economically devastating diseases that  affected Oklahoma   s livestock. And again, we were very fortunate to  attract some outstanding people. I guess if someone looks back and says,     What was your biggest accomplishment?    I think the quality of the  faculty that were brought in and the faculty that were already here really  has to be something that people of the veterinary school should take  pride in.  Are there some professors you want to point out that you brought in that  are significant here in research?  We brought in a gentleman named Bill Barrow. Bill is a fabulous  researcher and has just gotten in recent years a very, very large NIH   National Institutes of Health  grant, the largest one in the history of  Oklahoma State University. Carey Pope is a world-renowned  toxicologist and has just done a remarkable job with the attraction of  outside funding. Tony Confer and Bob Fulton are two individuals that  have dedicated their lives to bovine respiratory disease, and that   s a  devastating problem for Oklahoma cattleman. I don   t know that anybody  could ever really put a figure on it, but I believe those two gentleman  have saved Oklahoma and the nation   s cattle an awful lot of money  through their research efforts. Michael Davis is one of the country   s  foremost respiratory physiologists. One of the things that Michael does  is go to the Iditarod every year to look at the challenges that are faced by  the respiratory system of those dogs under obviously very difficult  circumstances. Of course remember, the person is under those same  difficult circumstances, so he   s able to relate what he   s seeing in those  dogs to some of the same challenges that are dealt with in human  medicine. There are others certainly, but those are some really  outstanding individuals.  You indicated that teaching has always been a strength historically in  the college. What are some names that you think of in your tenure and  earlier, and since?  One of the first names that comes to mind is Duane Peterson. Duane  Peterson gave the very first lecture in the College of Veterinary  Medicine in March of 1948, and he was still on the faculty when I came  to Oklahoma State University, and he truly was one of the icons of the  8  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  university. Certainly there were others. Jonathan Friend, who joined the  faculty shortly after the school opened, him and Duane Peterson were  anatomy and basic science. Ralph Buckner   Dr. Buckner was a person  that had a great love for students and teaching, was beloved by the  faculty and by the practitioners of the state. They were truly outstanding,  and there were many, many others. You just look through the teaching  awards that have been given over the years at the veterinary school, and  there are some folks that are very, very dedicated to student learning.  Would Lester Johnson be one of them?  Lester Johnson is   I guess my way to describe Lester is such a  gentleman. Unfortunately for me, Lester retired not too long after I  came, so I got to know him more in retirement than I did as a faculty  member, but everyone respected and admired him.  You   ve mentioned some of them, but can we talk again about some of the  challenges you faced in your tenure when you came on board?  Well first of all the facilities at OSU were pretty marginal. McElroy  Hall, which in those days was called the Veterinary Medicine Building,  had been built in 1948, and it looked like it had been built in 1948. The  other thing   and I guess if you look back and say,    Well what was your  legacy in the veterinary medicine school?    mine was women   s  restrooms, because in 1948 there were no women in the College of  Veterinary Medicine. The women   s locker room was a closet. The men   s  locker room was huge. When I got to Oklahoma State, the class was  almost 50  female, and that trend has continued, and so while I say that  jokingly, that was a big challenge. We were very fortunate to be part of  the state   s bond issues, and some significant improvements were done in  McElroy Hall, but that took time.  I would like to think that one of the ways that we were able to build the  faculty was through the Endowed Chairs Program. One of the things I  am proud of, when I left the veterinary school, the College of Veterinary  Medicine had more endowed chairs money than any other college at  Oklahoma State. We didn   t have as many positions because we tended  to use our money   more money and fewer positions   because I wanted  to go out and really attract nationally recognized researchers in those  endowed chairs, and you have to have a big chair to do that. You  couldn   t do that with a million-dollar chair.  The clinic, I felt like, was being run like a private practice. They did not  have a lot of specialized equipment. The equipment they did have was  antiquated, and in improving the physical plan and improving the  offering ... What I wanted, Jerry, was I wanted a practitioner in  9  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Oklahoma to refer a case to the veterinary school because we had the  best people and the best equipment to meet the needs of that owner,  whether that be Mrs. Smith   s poodle or Mr. Jones    dairy cow. And quite  honestly, there was a long way to go to get there. All that had to be done  mostly through private fundraising efforts, but not much of that had been  done, and so you sort of had an open field.  The other thing that you realize when you   re at the veterinary school is  you don   t get caught up in OU/OSU because we are the state   s College  of Veterinary Medicine. Some of our biggest donors would not have  given to Oklahoma State, not because they don   t like Oklahoma State,  but their loyalties were elsewhere. But their loyalties are to animals, so  you really had an advantage of being the state   s College of Veterinary  Medicine.  In fundraising. I think that   s one of the areas   as I   ve read the history of  that college and your tenure, we had a huge increase in funding. Can  you talk about your strategy for fundraising and maybe some specific  fundraising successes?  Well first of all, I   ve had the philosophy that if we just treat everybody  the same, we won   t have to worry about who to be nice to. And so,  while we were trying to enhance the reputation and the image of the  veterinary school, I spent a lot of time in the state. I was very, very  fortunate to have Sandy Cotton and John Cathey as our fundraisers.  They were wonderful at opening doors. They were wonderful at paving  the way. I realized I had to be the one to ask for the money, but   and  John Cathey especially had so many contacts at foundations, and I felt if  we could get in the door, we could sell our story. We also started to pay  much more attention to who was coming through our clinic doors.  Where were their connections? When Sam Walton   s brother Bud  showed up, you paid attention.  You knew what the connection was there.  You knew what the connection was, exactly. When I got a call from  Coach Holder in the middle of the night that Boone Pickens    dog was  hemorrhaging, this was before Mr. Pickens had done anything for  Oklahoma State. You know who Boone Pickens is, and you don   t treat  those people differently, but you perk up a little bit. You pay more  personal attention perhaps. When Ed Gaylord   s horse, number one  stallion, colicked, you know there are two opportunities here   to save  this horse, and you make a friend that could be very helpful down the  road.  One of my best fundraising stories is I had gotten a phone call about a  10  Gill  Alexander  gentleman at the veterinary school that before my time had had some  positive dealings with the school, and he wanted to know if he could  have lunch with me. I didn   t know this but the foundation had already  been working with him, and so I went down, and we met at a barbecue  place in Oklahoma City. He didn   t have a belt on when he got out of his  truck; he had a piece of wire holding his pants up. We had a delightful  lunch. Nothing much was said, and not too much longer, unfortunately,  he passed away and left the veterinary school  7 million. That was  Walter Sitlington, and he left Oklahoma State  14 million. Here   s a man  who had been a dairy farmer his whole life, but his dairy farm was  sitting on property near Quail Springs Mall. So you never know.  I became very good friends with Bud Walton, and I operated on several  of Mr. Walton   s dogs. Once the nature of the dog   s injuries were such  that I had to put on external device to stabilize a ruptured Achilles  tendon. Well it came time to take that off, and I called Mr. Walton, and  he always answered the phone. I didn   t call a secretary, didn   t go  through an office. He always answered the phone. I told him,  It   s time  to take the device off.  Sam had died, by this time. Bud was now  Chairman of the Board, and he said,    Well, Doctor, I can   t get over  there, we   ve got a board meeting coming up. Why don   t you come over  here?    I said,    Mr. Walton, that   s a long trip for me.    To make a long  story short, they fly the Wal-Mart plane over here, we fly to Bentonville,  he comes out to the airport to pick me up in a truck that he couldn   t get  the driver   s door side open. We went, we did surgery on the dog at his  local veterinarian, and on my way back to the airplane, he gave me an  envelope, and he said,    Now don   t look at this till you get home.    Well  as soon as I got on the airplane I looked at it. It was full of Wal-Mart  stock. We were able to give that to the foundation, and it was sold. But  those are two gentlemen that were just   you would never know. You  would never know.  I think we   re so fortunate that we have people that are so tied to their  animals in Oklahoma. John Cathey, he and I were going through  Oklahoma City one time, and he asked me if I wanted to meet Bob Kerr,  and I said,    Well sure John, who wouldn   t?    He said,    Well we   ll go  meet him.    We pulled into the Kerr Foundation parking lot, and I   m  thinking,    We   re not going to get in to see Bob. What   s John thinking?     We walk down the hallway, and the receptionist jumped up and ran  around and gave John a big hug, and I knew we were going to get in to  see Bob Kerr.  That was your first clue?  We went in to see him. I   m thinking,    What am I going to talk to him  about?    and behind his desk was a large picture of a horse named Round  11  Gill  Alexander  Table in the winner   s circle. I knew who Round Table was. He was a  very, very famous racehorse. It turned out the Kerr family owned a  significant portion of Round Table. And Lou Kerr and I, his widow,  became fast friends. We went to horse races together. They have  continued to be very generous to the College of Veterinary Medicine. So  you just never know where those things are going to come from. I can  tell you story after story of people that   especially older veterinarians  who are very conservative, who save their resources, but in the end they  wanted to put those to use to help a future generation.  And much of what you   re able to work on as a fundraiser in the College  of Veterinary Medicine is not veterinarians. It   s the veterinarian   s  clients. And their clients will say to that veterinarian,    You know, I   d  like to do something. Do you have any suggestions?    and you want that  veterinarian to suggest the College of Veterinary Medicine at Oklahoma  State.  That raises a point. To have successful fundraising and those  relationships, you work with those practitioners. You said earlier that  you traveled extensively around the state meeting people. Can you tell a  little bit about that process and some of your experiences?  Well the first thing I did   and you have to understand I love and own  thoroughbred racehorses. So the first thing I did was I got the racehorse  journal from Oklahoma and everybody that had an ad in there, I went  and visited. I visited people such as Randy Gamble who is a  multimillionaire, loves Oklahoma State, his racing colors are black and  orange, has pictures of Pistol Pete or Frank Eaton all over his office. He  lives in a huge, huge home on a beautiful farm in Edmond.  From that   all the way to somebody that you think,    What am I doing here?    but  they had an ad in the journal because they had a horse.  Whenever I went to a town, I always went and saw the local  veterinarian, just to let them know we were in town, just to chat about  what the school was doing,    What could we do to help you?    And the  same thing with the cattle industry. If they had an ad in the Oklahoma  Cattlemen   s Journal, I went and visited them. We went to their  conventions, and the leadership of Tom Thedford really tried to enhance  the extension program the college was doing. Going out and trying to  find out,    What is it that you want us to be doing?    Oklahoma is a small  enough state that you can visit every local association meeting and  you   re not driving that far. It   s not like Texas or California. So an  opportunity just to get in front of them and say,    I want to hear from  you. I   m new. I   ve never been here. Tell me what you want.    And this  will come out wrong, but I was very fortunate that I was reasonably  well-known nationally as a veterinarian, so people at least knew who I  12  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  was when I walked in the door. There were some practitioners that really  took me under their wing. Sam Strahm, Joe Howell, Lauren Parker,  Tony Thomas and I can just go down the list  of people  that really  introduced me to the practitioners of this state and to the people in this  state.  What was the tie between the college and the horse racing industry in  Oklahoma? Isn   t that when we were legalizing racing and betting?  I wasn   t here when that was going on. The college chose to stay out of  that fray. And I think where we missed an opportunity, and I   m certainly  not being critical of anything, is that many states, when you   re getting  into racing, they will give a portion of the income to go to research, and  Oklahoma State did not fight for that. Again, it   s easier to say,    I wasn   t  here,    so I don   t know what the circumstances were.  And not everything you do is successful. I   ll tell you an unsuccessful  story I had. I felt like one of the things that we could really do at  Remington Park was to build a veterinary hospital, have it on the  grounds. We would have in there equipment that the average practitioner  at the race track wouldn   t have: ultrasound, radiology equipment, certain  surgical opportunities. So I thought,    I   m going to do that.    I went and  had a very humbling meeting with Edward DeBartolo. And Mr.  DeBartolo, I went in and made a presentation to him, and I asked him  for a million and a half dollars to build a veterinary clinic, and he did not  speak the whole time I was making the presentation. I walked out the  door, and the general manager, David Vance, came out and said,    You  got your money.    Well some of the practitioners in Oklahoma didn   t like  that. They thought it was going to be unfair competition for them,  especially those that had hospitals, that had invested in clinics, and I  understand that. It was enough of a controversy that the president at that  time decided we were going to back away and not do it. So not  everything you do is successful.  I guess you had one of the longest tenures in the deanship; you had  tenure here for sixteen years. Can you share some of your stories and  relationships with the university administration?  Yes, of course. One of my favorites was the very first phone call I ever  got. It was May 15th. I was in my office, it was 8:10 in the morning, and  I got a call from Larry Boger, and he gave me the usual,    Welcome to  the university.    He said,    We   ve had our ups and downs over there as  we   ve had throughout the university, but there   s two things that I want  you to always remember. If it weren   t for money and personnel  problems, we wouldn   t need a dean.    And when times got tough I  always remembered that. We wouldn   t need a dean if it weren   t for those  13  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  problems. But Dr. Boger, as every president that I had the opportunity  and the privilege to serve under, they   ve been very good to me. They   ve  given me opportunities, they   ve been supportive of the school. John  Campbell   s daughter had been my intern when I was at Tennessee, so  we knew the Campbells and have stayed very close to them over the  years, and certainly David Schmidly and Jim Halligan. Jim Halligan, I  just think, is what I would think of when you look up    university  president    in the dictionary. He certainly gave me some wonderful  opportunities at Oklahoma State that I never would have had.  It is unique being the dean of the veterinary school because unlike the  other deans, you don   t really report to the president on paper. You do on  paper, but in reality your expenditures have to be approved by the board  of regents, so you have to attend all of the board meetings and you have  to make all the budget presentations, and that   s changed since I left the  school. But it was a unique opportunity to do that, to have your college  featured. And the presidents, every single one of them, I felt like, never  had OSU compete against the veterinary school for funding. They were  two different entities. Now we follow all of the policies and procedures  of the university, and really anyone coming would never know that  there   s that uniqueness. Only three veterinary schools in the country  have that arrangement, and that was one of the things that appealed to  me when I came here.  Would you step out and say you had a favorite president you worked  for?  No, I really don   t think so, Jerry. I   ll be honest about that. As I think  back, every single one of them did some very special things for me.  Maybe Larry because he hired you?  Well Larry, certainly. Dr. Boger and I have stayed very close after his  retirement. And I   ve been such good friends with his son-in-law Jim  Schlimpert, that always kept us in line.  Looking back on your tenure as dean, are there any achievements or  innovations in the college that give you special pride?  Certainly the quality of the faculty is the number one thing that I would  look at, and the things that go with that. I believe if you   re going to have  quality programs, you have got to have outstanding facilities, you   ve got  to have sophisticated equipment, and you have to do everything first  class. I believe you   ve got to have an administration that supports what  you   re trying to do, but most of all you   ve got to have quality faculty. I  really believe that through the Endowed Chairs Program, and because  14  Gill  Alexander  we were able to focus our research efforts. There were things we didn   t  do in research.  But we really focused our efforts, and I think to change the culture that  not every faculty member had to do the same thing   that there were  going to be faculty members who 100  of what they did was research  and there would be ones that 100  of what they did was teach. And  there were going to be some that did a little bit of everything, but by  concentrating those, we were able to recruit faculty into specialty areas.  Toxicology, to me, was one of our biggest successes because we got  Carey Pope initially, but we were able to hire two additional first-rate  toxicologists who all they did was research, but we also had Sandra  Morgan, and Dr. Morgan handled the teaching program. So you   re not  pulling away from your research effort in the classroom. And quite  honestly, she was a wonderful teacher, did a great job, students loved  her. It allowed our researchers to do research and it allowed our best  teachers to teach, and we weren   t able to do that in all areas, but that was  the goal, to say that assignments were going to be different. Everybody  didn   t have to fit into the same cubbyholes, and then they were evaluated  for promotion and tenure and salary based upon their assignments and  how they did.  Any favorite memories, unforgettable events, stories you can share with  us?  Oh, Jerry, there   s so many I wouldn   t know where to begin. I started  with the Boone Pickens story. I got a phone call in the middle of the  night from Michael Holder saying that Boone Pickens    dog was bleeding  to death. Every time it opened its mouth, blood ran out of its nose. I said,     Well, Coach Holder, what can we do?    He said,    They want to come to  Stillwater.    They brought that dog from Amarillo that night, flew up on  a plane to Stillwater, and I guess it got here, it was four or five in the  morning by the time they got here. And they were right, every time he  opened his mouth, blood poured out of his nose. To make a long story  short, we operated on him, and he had bitten a porcupine quill, and it  went through his mouth and stuck his carotid artery, and we were able to  repair that.  But it came time for the dog to go home, and I called Mr. Pickens. And  again, when I called him, I talked to Mr. Pickens. I called him and said,     Mr. Pickens, we need to send the dog home.    And he said,    Well we  just can   t get up there right now.    He said,    You call Holder up and tell  him to bring it.    I said,    Mr. Pickens, I don   t feel like calling Coach  Holder and ...    And he said,    You   re right. We   ll make some  arrangements.    It wasn   t much longer when Coach Holder called me and  said,    I   ll be over to get that dog.    (Laughter)  15  I got a phone call from Tony Thomas. Dr. Thomas is a wonderful  veterinarian in Midwest City, a person that not just in Oklahoma but  throughout the nation is known for his leadership. He said,    Listen, I   ve  got a client here I want you to come down and see. She   s kind of ...     You know, I   ve learned if you   re poor, you   re crazy, if you   re rich,  you   re eccentric. Well she was eccentric. Before I could get down there,  she had been taken out of her home by the authorities and placed in an  assisted living situation and unfortunately passed away a few days after  that. But the reason they did that was because she was living with 150  dogs. And the UPS man, when he delivered a package, the odor was so  overwhelming, because 75 of the dogs lived in her home. She also had a  large number of cats, and when the authorities came to remove her from  her home for health purposes, they went next door, and the home next  door was full of cats that she had purchased. She would go to the  Humane Society and get dogs that were scheduled to be euthanized. She  would find animals that didn   t have homes.  In her estate she left the veterinary school the funds to build what   s now  called the Cohn Shelter at Oklahoma State University. It was a shelter  that was originally built to house her dogs, and we kept her dogs  throughout their life. A very nice endowment was set up, and that   s a  very unique facility for the university, for the veterinary school. It   s a  beautiful facility. It   s a very modern housing area.  Our provost  Marlene Strathe  told me a cute story about it. Our provost  and her husband have two bichon frises that he   s very attracted to. As  you might know, they   re a little white dog. One of the things the Cohn  Shelter does is it will provide boarding services for faculty and staff  animals. John, her husband, had taken those dogs to the Cohn Shelter to  be housed while he and the provost were going to be out of town. He  came back to get the dogs, went in and got them, paid his bill, and was  walking the dogs to his car, and as he opened the car door, the two dogs  turned around and ran back into the shelter. (Laughs) And I said,    Well  John, that   s a mixed blessing. They were well-treated, and they loved it  there,    and he said,    Yeah, but I   m their dad      I was back at Saratoga Racetrack. I happened to be involved with a  syndicate that owned a bunch of racehorses, and we were going to run at  Saratoga Racetrack. That   s in New York, and I was back there for a  partnership meeting. Rick Pitino was in that syndicate. Now he owned a  bigger share than I did, and I was the only non-Italian in the syndicate.  Our trainer was John Parisella, the syndicate manager was Frank  DiTondo. I   m there with just wonderful people, and John Parisella, our  trainer, asked me if I   d like to meet Nick Zito. Well he might as well  have asked me if I wanted to meet Mickey Mantle. I mean, Nick Zito is  one of the most famous horse trainers in all the world. So here   s my  16  Gill  Alexander  right arm, I   d love to meet Nick Zito. So we go back to meet Nick Zito,  and again, to me it   s like I   m meeting a huge celebrity. He   s showing us  these horses, and I knew every one of them. The trainer turned to me and  said,    Hey, I've got to talk to Nick a second, would you mind waiting for  me?     Well it   s starting to sprinkle, so I get up under the eaves of the stone, and  there   s a guy standing next to me who   s apparently an Arab. We get to  talking, talking about what I do, and he said,    Well would you take a  look at a horse of mine?    (Laughs) Oh boy.  Here we go again.  Here we go. And they get this horse out, and the horse has got on his  halter his name, and I thought,    This horse won the Illinois Derby.  Alexander, stand up a little straighter.    Natural Selection was the horse   s  name, and the man   s name was Mohamed Moubarak. Buckram Oak is  one of the wealthiest horse farms in North America, and Mr. Moubarak  trained for the Sheik of Dubai, and this was their horse, this was one of  their big horses. Well, I won   t bore you with all the details, but this  horse had liver disease, and it was pretty apparent from looking at him. I  told Mr. Moubarak, I said,    Why don   t you let me refer you to Cornell  University, they   re a few hours up the road.    Well, it was the last day of  the meet.    We   re leaving. We   re getting ready to go to Gulfstream to  race in Miami.    I said,    Well, you know, you   re going to go right by the  University of Florida. Let me call them and get you an appointment.  This horse needs to go in, and they can do a liver biopsy and find out  what   s wrong with him.    He said,    Are you near Lexington?    (Laughs)  Well to make a long story short, they shipped that horse to Oklahoma  State University, and our faculty did a wonderful job with him. The  entourage that showed up with him was pretty impressive, the plane that  flew him in here was pretty impressive, and it was great.  And you know, there have been other things that didn   t generate you a  lot of notoriety in terms of finances, but they bought you a lot of  goodwill. We had an instance where a tractor trailer was stopped in  southeastern Oklahoma, and the tractor trailer was full of box turtles.  These box turtles were being smuggled into Florida to be sold as pets,  and that   s against the law. You cannot take a natural resource. Well  unfortunately the turtles had been kept in that boxcar long enough that  they were suffering from Vitamin A deficiency because there was no  sunlight. So the turtles were confiscated. There were seventy-five of  them, I believe, and they were all sent to the veterinary school. Well that  year, Jerry, Oklahoma State had three presidents or former presidents on  the campus   Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, and George Bush   and they  had a very difficult time getting TV coverage for them because it was a  17  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  long way and what have you. We had every TV station in Oklahoma  City and Tulsa for seven days filming those turtles, interviewing the  students, talking about what happened. I mean those things just get a life  of their own. It was great publicity, it was great for the students, and so  you never know  (Laughter)  Well I know one special memory for you has got to be your  Distinguished Service Award that you won in 1995 from the Oklahoma  Veterinary Medical Association.  Yes, right.  That had to be pretty special for you.  It was very special for me. That   s an award that   s given to someone that  gives of their time and efforts outside the practice of veterinary  medicine, and I have been privileged to be associated with Special  Olympics International since 1977. That interest continues today, and  I   ve been involved with Special Olympics in four different states now,  and Oklahoma has the best program in the world. I   m very proud to be  on their board and to serve with that. It   s one of those charities and one  of those activities that you get far more out of it than you put into it. It  has been very special to me.  Some of the relationships that you talked about   that award of  recognition from the Oklahoma Veterinary Medical Association is, I  guess, recognition of all the many years of activities with practitioners,  with people out in the field. I think is quite an accomplishment.  Well I would like to think so. I love veterinarians, and I love people, and  I love people that have animals. And I think for me, something that  really helped me is first of all I actually own horses. I mean, I   m not  telling somebody something that they don   t know that I   m experiencing  myself, and when they talk to me, I know, because I   ve been there. I  know what it   s like to go out and find your best horse laying, or to have  your trainer call and say,    We   ve got a problem.    And then we also raise  and show golden retriever dogs, so I have an opportunity to be at dog  shows and meet the dog-owning public. And again, you   re one of them.  People think that   s pretty special, and I think it   s pretty special.  I enjoy people   s company, and I always felt that the Associate Dean for  Academic Affairs   and I had two wonderful ones in  J.  Mack Oyler  and Michael Lorenz   they really were the inside deans of the veterinary  school. They took care of the students and the curriculum and  admissions and academic standards and the things that are so important.  My job was to get resources, whether that was friends, cases, finances,  18  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  that was my job. And you can   t do that   and I missed Billy Hooper.  Billy Hooper was in between Mike Lorenz and Mack Oyler, and they  were just so talented. They really ran the school day to day, because I  didn   t spend a lot of time in the office.  How do you feel about the college now, Joe, and where it   s going under  Dean Mike Lorenz   s leadership?  Well, I   ve tried to stay away for a lot of reasons. First of all, you need to  know that Mike and I have known each other a long time. He was  leaving Cornell University when I got there in 1976, and so we   ve  known each other as friends and colleagues for a long time, and I just  think the world of him. I think Mike   s doing a great job as the dean. His  challenges are different than mine. He faces some issues that I didn   t  have to face, and I guess I faced some that he didn   t have to face. And I  think the school right now is going through some strategic planning and  some soul searching and trying to see just where they   re going to land. I  think that there were some programs that I wanted to focus on, and did,  that today are not being focused on, but there are others that are. And so  I think each administration has to have a very unique   their own style,  and that   s one of the reasons that unless Mike has asked, I don   t  interfere, because I don   t need to be going over there. And the same is  true in the private sector. If I get phone calls from people that want to  know something about the veterinary school, good or bad, they don   t  need to talk to me. And I think that Mike has put together a great  administrative team over there and it   s just moving the college forward.  Thinking back over your years there and your experience, how much you  enjoyed it, how do you hope people remember Dean Joe Alexander?  How do you want to be remembered?  I hope they remember me as a person who really cared about having a  school that was viewed as being the best it could be, whether that was  the teaching or research or the service program, and one that first of all  served the needs of the people of Oklahoma and second of all was an  institution that contributed to what was going on around the world.  Well I guess the question I   ve got then is why did you leave the  deanship?  Okay, well I   ve asked myself that before.  I say that somewhat facetiously, but I guess in 2001 your university  needed you in another administrative position. Can you share with us ...  Well you talk about stories that have a way they go. I got a call from Dr.  19  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Halligan, and he asked me if I would come over to Whitehurst, and he  asked me to come over after five o   clock. And so I went over, and I saw  Dr. Keener coming down the hallway, and I thought,    They   re going to  fire me. What   s gone wrong?    Well the news was worse. (Laughs) No.  Dr. Halligan and Dr. Keener at that time felt there needed to be some  changes in the administration of the research program.  Marvin Keener was vice president.  Marvin Keener was provost and executive vice president. They asked  me if I   d be willing to take a six-month leave of absence from the  veterinary school  to become vice president for research , because my  intentions were always to return to the veterinary school. Well, some  things moved along. There were some financial challenges, and the  university decided they could not fill that position for a year, so I agreed  to stay another six months and then another six months, and then, you  may remember, two things happened. One was that Harry Birdwell was  appointed athletic director. Dr. Birdwell had been the vice president for  business and external relations and that included government affairs.  And when Dr. Birdwell went over to athletic administration, Dr.  Halligan asked us to take over government affairs. I got the title director  of external affairs in addition to the vice president   s position, and then of  course Dr. Halligan announced his retirement and everything was put on  hold until we got a new president, so that six months stretched out for  quite awhile. And as I looked at it, I felt like Mike Lorenz had been the  dean for almost three years now and for me to go back was maybe not  the best thing for the college and maybe this was time   it   d been sixteen  years   to try something different. When I was vice president for  research, Jerry, I got to meet people and be involved in things that I  would never have ever done, and then when we took over legislative  affairs, that just expanded.  Can you share a little about what your major responsibilities in that  position were?  Our major responsibilities under Dr. Halligan and under Dr. Schmidly  were to promote what we would call OSU   s directed federal  appropriations agenda. Now, if Nevada gets it or Kansas, it   s  pork  barrel,  but for us it was  directed federal appropriations.  It was  basically to get federal dollars, non-competitive federal dollars, coming  to Oklahoma State University, and that involves forging a working  relationship with our congressional delegation and with their staff. I did  not know hardly anyone on our congressional delegation, except I had  served as the Payne County campaign chair for Bill Brewster when he  ran for congress, and Bill was able to open some doors for me. Our job  is to promote that agenda for Oklahoma State. We don   t do the projects;  20  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  projects come to us from the colleges. Our job is to go get the funding  for them.  Your funding for primarily research dollars.  Well, for everything. For instance, I think one of the best  accomplishments in recent years was the Multimodal Facility. The  Multimodal Facility is all federal dollars; we got it over a four or five-year  period of time. At the time, we were very fortunate because Senator  Inhoffe was chairman of the highway bill, and I learned that they can  trade lots of things if you control people   s highways. And the senator  was very supportive of the Multimodal Facility, so it   s not just program.  And now one of our big focuses is on Ponca City and the UML, the  University Multispectral Laboratory and Sensor program. Those are  directed appropriations. I think one of OSU   s most significant  contributions is protective armor for our troops that comes out of Donna  Branson   s laboratory. That   s all federal money, that   s all directed  appropriations. To me it   s the poster child for us, because it started with  an idea, it started with a talented faculty, federal dollars were put in, they  were successful, a manufacturer in Paul   s Valley makes the armor, and  now it   s protecting the limbs of our troops overseas, and that   s being  expanded now to help first responders. So that was our principle role in  that regard. Then at the state level it was to try to support funding for  higher education.  Something else happened in the interim to me that again was a great  experience, and that is when Governor Brad Henry appointed me to his  cabinet as Oklahoma secretary for science and technology. And much of  what we   re trying to do there dovetails directly with what the university  is trying to do. The difference is, you   ve got to be careful. You   re  representing all of the institutions, but what   s good for one is good for  another. It was again one of those opportunities to meet people and to do  things that I would just never have gotten to do as dean of the veterinary  school.  So your first position is vice president for research and then you tagged  on director of external relations. And now your current title is ...  Yeah, well what happened, Jerry, was that back in the    70s the  Oklahoma legislature had passed legislation that allowed universities to  form not-for-profit foundations that could do things outside the normal  channels of the university, but no state money could be used. Out of that  grew what was called the Education Research Foundation, and it really  grew out for two reasons. One was OSU had enjoyed, and did enjoy for  a long time, a very large grant from NASA, and it had to do with  teachers teaching the space program in classrooms, but it involved  21  Gill  Alexander  having to pay salaries in all fifty states, to buy automobiles in all fifty  states, to buy teaching supplies in all fifty states, and a teacher in  Massachusetts got paid on a different scale than one did in New Mexico.  And so the NASA program ran through what was then called ERF. Also  at that time, the university had the opportunity to buy Cowboy Mall but  did not want to spend state resources, so ERF borrowed the money and  went into the landlord business and continued to do that. Of course that  has now become Northern Oklahoma College, but in those days it was  restaurants and computer stores and pizza places and a Greek restaurant,  an old movie theater. And so as vice president for research, you were  automatically president of ERF.  Well, when Brad Henry came in as governor, he charged the universities  with being the engines of economic development, and each institution  was to form a separate economic development organization. The  University of Oklahoma did what they call the Center for Wealth  Creation, and Dr. Schmidly  at OSU  formed what was then called the  Education Research and Economic Development Foundation, EREDF. I  was very fortunate, because I was thinking of leaving Oklahoma State. I  didn   t feel like I could go back to the veterinary school. I really didn   t  want to be vice president for research any longer; that was really not my  forte, although I enjoyed the people and everything. And then Dr.  Schmidly offered me the presidency of that and asked if we would  continue to do federal government relations. EREDF over a few months  became a very cumbersome acronym, and so it was changed to now its  current  Center for Innovation and Economic Development.  So I   m the  president of that and the director of external relations.  What are some of the significant challenges that you   ve had in that  area? Then I know we   re speaking of two different areas here, but could  you touch on your vice presidency and then move into your current role  as president of the foundation?  Well I think that our biggest challenge when I went into the vice  president of research   s office was to try to restore confidence and fiscal  accountability in the office. Some funds had been used in a manner that  some folks thought was not appropriate, budgets were in the red. Just to  try to get everybody on the same page, get the budget balanced, those  were really our big challenges. I think the infrastructure was already in  place for the research program, but there had been a lack of confidence,  perhaps, is the best way to put it, and I felt like we needed to get that  back. And people were very supportive and helped me a great deal. We  had some lean times because there was several million dollars that we  had to make up over a two-year period of time in order to balance the  budget.  22  Gill  Alexander  The other big challenge for me was my whole life had been in veterinary  medicine. I had never been involved in the other aspects of the  university   s research program, and so I   d be sitting in there and there   d  be a physicist telling me about his research and it took about thirty  seconds and I didn   t know what they were talking about. So you have to  sort of broaden your thought process about what was important and what  people were doing. We had a little bit of that, but it was a very  interesting opportunity for me to learn about the university and to meet  some of the wonderful scientists of this university who I never would  have known.  We had some areas at this university that I thought were really top  drawer. One of the things as vice president of research that I would look  back on with a lot of pride is that we were very instrumental   we being  Oklahoma State University and I think our office   at getting the state to  initiate a  34 million bond program,  17 million of which came to  Oklahoma State to enhance research facilities. As I look around the  campus, some of the research facilities today that we point to as some of  our best and most modern came out of that  17 million. And some of the  deans were able to take those funds and enhance them and what have  you, but we were able to use that money to build research laboratories  that were very unique to Oklahoma State University.  Joe, is it true there were some morale problems, frustrations, with  research and being appropriately rewarded on our campus?  Well I think there was, Jerry. I think people   you know you always  have those folks that feel that they   re looking at their neighbor and  thinking they   ve got a better shake than they have. And researchers,  when you go into research, you have to accept that you   re not  necessarily going to get a Christmas vacation off because your research  has got to continue. You   re not necessarily going to be successful; it   s a  rollercoaster. One year you   re on top, you   ve got funding, your lab   s  moving along, it   s going, and then that project finishes, you miss a  couple grants as everyone does, and you   re back down again. So it   s  pretty unique in research, and I feel like partly because of personalities  but partly because of the culture of the university that researchers didn   t  feel like their efforts were appreciated here. That we were an extension  and service institution   you know, you   ve heard people say , Well,  you   re the biggest junior college in the state,  things like that, and I  think that   s all gone. I think this is looked at now as a very committed  research institution.  Now, we have a long way to go to get to be a Tier One research  institution, and that   s solved by money. But I think that a person coming  in from the outside that looked at one of our colleges and what they were  23  Gill  Alexander  accomplishing at research would maybe perhaps be critical of what we  were accomplishing until they got to see the resources we have to work  with. I think once they saw what was being accomplished with what we  were able to provide, it   s pretty impressive. I think that   s true lots of  places in this university. I think the challenges of a research program are  always in what   s next. You know, Wayne Gretzsky said,    Success is not  knowing where the puck is, it   s knowing where the puck   s going to be  next.    Well I think OSU is starting to look at those things in their sensor  program, their biofuels program. There are things that we are finding out  where the puck is going to be next, and by putting in the faculty talent  and equipment and the facilities, we   re going to be the ones who are  going to get the research programs in those areas.  It appears the university has made a commitment to some of those  things, to move toward a Tier One research institution. They   ve set some  marks out there to achieve, like the Reward, Restore, Grow Program.  Would you care to speak to any of those?  I think what this university has done is moving toward a little bit   and  maybe I   d like it to move faster   but that is we   re finding areas that we  feel we can be the best in. Jim Halligan and I   when I was vice  president for research, there were these interim legislative studies that  were done over the holidays, over the summer vacation and they were  unrelated. I mean one would be on rural economic development, the  other would be on something to do with teacher certifications, but we  had to be at them and always were asked to make a presentation. And  OSU   s presentation would always focus on the subject at hand. The  University of Oklahoma   s presentation was always the Weather Center.  Didn   t care what the subject was, they had made a huge commitment to  the Weather Center, and look how that   s paid off today. The Noble  Foundation has made a huge commitment, not to plant biology, but to  plant genomics and to biofuel crops, and the best scientists in the world  in that area can be found at the Noble Foundation. Now don   t go down  there to try to find a scientist that does research in something else;  they   re not there.  And I feel like we   re starting to build some of that critical mass here in  nanotechnology, in advanced materials, in sensors, in biofuels, in  infectious diseases. I think we   re building those kinds of research niches.  It takes the recruitment, not just of that major person, but it takes the  recruitment of a lot of people to contribute.  When I came to Oklahoma State in 1985, the laser center was all I heard  about, and there was a faculty member, Dick Powell, who was making  great strides in the laser center. And it was, I mean, there were  wonderful facilities. Dick Powell left, and you can   t find the laser center.  24  Gill  Alexander  Those facilities are being used for other things because we didn   t have  enough depth in laser research. The director of the OU Weather Center,  he   s a wonderful guy, he could leave tomorrow, and they   re not going to  miss a beat because there   s enough depth there. They   ve got a reputation  that there   s an awful lot of people that would like to be director of the  OU Weather Center. And I think OSU is starting to build on those kinds  of things.  Joe, in your position as president for the Center for Innovation and  Economic Development, can you share a little about your  responsibilities and about your primary focus in that role?  Sure. Our primary focus falls into several categories, but one big  challenge is economic development. Our role is to try to enhance the  economy of the state of Oklahoma through working with entrepreneurs  and businesses to enhance the recruitment of them to Oklahoma, their  retention in Oklahoma, and their growth in Oklahoma. And I   m very  fortunate to have two very talented vice presidents in Tom Grey and  Glenn Freedman. We   ve been able, through their leadership, to put in  place several programs that directly impact the economy of our state. I   ll  just mention a few of them.  We had an opportunity and have successfully competed to be part of  what   s called the USDA Revolving Loan Program. We can borrow   750,000 at 1  interest for 30 years from the federal government. We  can then loan that money out at any interest rate we think it   ll bear.  We   re limited to towns of 20,000 people or less, and we   re limited to   150,000 in any one loan. We work with the local banks as a partner  with them. We have a wonderful loan committee made of the presidents  of three of the banks here in Stillwater, but we   re able to go out and give  a small business a 4  or 5  loan that they can then use to get additional  loans and expand their business. We take an equity interest in that  business, and we expect that loan to be repaid. Now the interest  difference between the 1  and say the 5  or 6  that we   re charging  loses identity and we can use that for anything that we see fit. And what  we   re hoping to do is build a big enough fund that we can invest in early  faculty inventions. Ones that haven   t gotten there, they   re high risk, we  wouldn   t want to risk state money in them, but this is money that if we  lose it, we   ve lost it. But maybe we promote a successful effort.  We have a program that is OSU   s largest federal program right now in  terms of money received, and that   s called ASSET. I forget what that  stands for, but ASSET basically says that Tinker Air Force Base has a  lot of airplanes, and I don   t know anything about airplanes, but say they  were meant to fly for 30 years, now they have to fly for 50. Well, their  parts are wearing out. The Boeings and the Lockheed Martins that made  25  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  that part, they don   t make it anymore because it   s so small. Maybe it   s  20,000 bolts and washers, maybe it   s 1,500 fans. Well there are a lot of  Oklahoma manufacturers that can make that, and it would be a big deal  to a small town to get a contract to make 25,000 bolts and washers, but  they don   t know how to compete for that contract. So what the ASSET  program does, it funds our going in, doing the paperwork for them, and  it looks like War and Peace, believe me, doing the paperwork for them,  and allowing them to successfully submit a bid for those parts. Now they  don   t always win, but once they   ve got their foot in the door, then they  can move forward from there. The other thing that the project funds is  having their product certified. The army wants to know, if you   re going  to make these nuts and bolts and washers, that they fit and they meet our  quality, and so that fund goes in to certify those.  We have a program that works directly with entrepreneurs that think  they have an idea for a product. Many times I think the best service we  do is we show them it   s just not economically feasible for them to do  that, but we do business plans for these people. Tom Grey especially is  very familiar with the loan programs that are available and investment  programs through the state. He   s formed a network within the private  sector of venture funds, because that   s really what you need. You need  angel venture money, that they   re going to invest in your invention. And  we   re able to certify   or to put the Good Housekeeping Seal of  Approval on someone   s invention through our engineers at OSU   that  we think this thing will work, and hopefully that helps them then to get  venture money.  What about faculty that patent things through the university?  Same principle.  The university works with them and tries to take that to a commercial  level?  Absolutely, absolutely.  How would that process work?  Well, how that process works, it depends upon what the faculty member  has and what they want to do. We have an example where a faculty  member in the College of Agriculture in their Ag and Food Products  Center developed a system to test the microbiology in foods. One of the  first contracts they got was somebody decided that when you go into  your grocery store and there   s an apple pie sitting out, is that sitting out  drawing bacteria? So they had a contract with Bama Pie to test that and  show that it was safe. Well, they decided to spin off their company,  26  Gill  Alexander  came to us, we were able to make them a low interest loan program  because they located outside the city limits of Stillwater in Payne  County. We were able to make a direct investment because we have a  venture fund; we invest in some companies. And they now have a very  successful company, Food Protech, which is located just outside of  Stillwater. They employ about twenty people and they have a going  program.  There are other faculty that what we try to do is help them find venture  money, because that   s really what they need. They enter what people  call  the valley of death,  the time when you   ve invented something and  you   ve invented it on the workbench, but you   ve got to take it from this  scale to a big scale. And how do I do that? That may be what we try to  get federal money for. It may be money we invest directly.  We try to work with student entrepreneurs to help them grow their  companies, and then we try, Jerry, to make some direct investments.  There   s a company that was in the incubator out at Meridian  Technology, called Engius. I don   t know where that name comes from,  but I assume it   s a Greek god of some sort. But Engius had a very  unique product; it   s a sensor that will tell you when cement   s cured. So  you would insert the sensor in a bridge, and instead of having to drill a  core, send it off to some lab, and ten days later find out the cement  wasn   t cured  and  you   ve got to wait longer, well the ten days is gone     it can tell you immediately. It can also tell you if the mixture you paid  for is what it is. Well they had grown out of the incubator and were  getting ready to move to Tulsa. We felt they had a very bright future.  About that same time, the Gatesway East building, which is located out  east of town behind the John Deere plant, came on market, and we  bought that building. We moved Engius there, and they rent that  building from us. That company   s continuing to grow; they   ve stayed  here in Stillwater. And so we try to make a direct investment in that  regard.  How important is that in attracting bright, potential researchers?  Knowing these stories, does it help to attract faculty to the state?  Oh, I hope so. And of course the people of Oklahoma, not that many  years ago, passed a state question that actually allowed faculty to benefit  from their research, and prior to that they couldn   t. That was a huge  obstacle to get over because faculty who have good ideas should be  rewarded for those. Under Steve McKeever   s leadership, the Intellectual  Property Office here has expanded and is doing a great job working with  people. And I think also because we   re a separate not-for-profit, we can  have some failures and it not reflect poorly on the university. When  you   re dealing with start-up companies, you   re going to have failures;  27  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  they   re not all going to succeed. We   ve had some successes and we   ve  had some failures. You learn from those. And so that   s really what we  do a lot of in economic development.  We also provide a grants writer that the university can take advantage of.  Just recently this person wrote a grant, for instance, that we don   t do the  grant because we   re not going to be hiring scientists. We write the grant  and get the scientists then to be the PI  Principal Investigator . There   s a  talented person over in the College of Education, Steve Marks. Steve has  been involved with the space program for his whole life, I guess, in the  educational side of it. And we just got an  800,000 grant,  800,000 a  year for five years, for a Teacher in Space Program. We don   t run the  grant. We run the grant administratively, but Steve is the PI. We   re  trying to be a partner with the university. We don   t want to duplicate  what the university is doing.  Joe, do you have any specific goals for the center?  Well I would hope, Jerry, that the center will first of all continue its  philosophy that we have one client and that   s Oklahoma State  University. I hope that our programs will mature to where we   re  contributing more and more to the university in the areas we   re  responsible for, and I don   t know what those are going to be. President  Hargis of course comes out of the private sector. I think he   s going to  have some different goals and missions for us. You know one of the  things that we hope to be very involved in is the university   s Creativity  Project, and that   s going to take innovative thought. It   s also going to  take resources. So my goal would be for us to be able to be a financially  independent organization (we don   t take any state money now), that our  programs will grow, that they   re generating resources, that we   re  actually giving cash, if you will, back to the university, and most of all  that we   re promoting this university as a caring institution that   s trying  to improve the quality of life of everybody in the state of Oklahoma.  How important are these goals to the mission of Oklahoma State  University?  Well I would hope that, as a land grant institution, we have long had that  as our mission and that the big revolution, I think, that   s taking place is  when people thought about land grant and its outreach, they thought  about agriculture. And that model now is not being diminished in  agriculture, but it   s a greater model for the whole university. And  whether that   s in engineering or education or human environmental  sciences or veterinary medicine, people are more cognizant that we have  to be seen as being critical to the future of this state if we expect to  continue to get the support of the taxpayers.  28  Gill  Alexander  President Hargis is still fairly new on the job, but how are you viewing  his presidency and his perception of your role in the foundation  program?  Well just to let you know where we interact, we are separate from the  university. We are governed by a board separate from the OSU Board of  Regents. The board is chaired by President Hargis, the vice chair is the  provost, Marlene Strathe, the treasurer is the vice president for business,  David Bosserman, so we are governed by the university, as we should  be. And so President Hargis is very important to us because he   s our  chairman.  My observation has been that when he was named president, people in  the state instantly recognized who we   d gotten here. You know, whether  it   s through his TV show, his private sector activities, I know that people  recognized the quality of person that was coming into this university.  And I think that he   s a person who twenty years ago would perhaps not  have been the best choice for president because presidents were more  inside people. Presidents really did back then what provosts do now.  Now presidents, their job is outside the university. Their job is working  with external constituencies whether they be donors, alumni, boards of  regents, legislators. We couldn   t have a better person doing that.  I was at a dinner at the president   s home, and you know you have these  ice breakers and people ask you about what you were doing, and he got  to talking about how he   d gone to law school. He   d gone to law school  because he   d had a grandfather I believe that was a judge, and he said  his grandfather loved the law. He just loved the law. He said,    I liked the  law, but I didn   t love the law.    He said,    I went into banking, and I liked  banking, but I didn   t really love banking. It was a good job but you  know what it did, it gave me the opportunity to be involved in civic  activities.    And I think when people think of him, that   s what they think  of. They think of the MAPS  Metropolitan Area Projects  Program, they  think of the Creativity Program, they think of United Way, Oklahoma  City Chamber. So I believe that he came in here with an instant  reputation for public service, and he   s carried that on. He will learn  about the university. He   s got a very good provost; I know he   ll let her  do her job. So I don   t know that the University could have made a better  selection at this time in its history.  And presidents fit different times. I think that John Campbell was a  visionary president. John was a little bit ahead of himself at times. The  university after John finished his tenure needed someone to come in and  put the family back together, restore the confidence, and we could not  have had a better person than Jim Halligan. So I think presidents fit  times. And I think at this time Burns Hargis fits Oklahoma State  29  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  University.  What do you think about all the new construction and renovation on  campus, current and proposed over the next ten or fifteen years?  We   re going to change the face of this university. And I know facilities  don   t make programs, people do, but facilities show your commitment. I  know that much of what we   ve seen in the public   s view has been in  athletics, and certainly what has been done and what will be done over  there is tremendous. But we   re building the biggest science building in  Oklahoma. We   re renovating historic buildings   Murray Hall, Old  Central   that are not going to lose their character but are going to be  facilities that are going to be modern and house faculty, and I think  it   s   the growth is tremendous.  We talked about Boone Pickens earlier, and we think about athletics, but  his recent gift, his matching gift on endowed chairs, is that a boost in the  arm of research and attracting research faculty?  I don   t know that he could   ve made a more significant gift. I   m a little  disappointed that the state chose not to continue the Endowed Chairs  Program after July 1st. But Mr. Pickens    gift allowed Oklahoma State to  at the very least triple its money and then after that to double its money.  Of course he will continue to match out of his fund for private sector  gifts. And one of the things we have to remember about endowed chairs  is you only spend 5 percent of the interest, so you need to have a big  chair to really go out and get the kinds of people that you want to attract  here.  That   s not a million dollar chair.  That   s not a million dollars. You know, that   s a  5 million chair. And  with that you   ll bring in   those people will attract people. And if you  attract the right kinds of people, they will more than pay for themselves  with the grants, research grants, and contracts that they   ll attract to your  university.  That was a great jump start.  It was a great jump start. And you know people forget the Boone  Pickens School of Geology. I   d love to be dean of the Veterinary School  these days given his wife Madeline and her great love for animals. I just  think that there   s going to be lots of opportunities to work with Mrs.  Pickens. Because she does, she has a great love affair with animals and  is a person that is willing to get out on the front lines to make things  better. So I think there   s a great resource.  30  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Switching back just a minute to a question I meant to ask you earlier. In  your external relations role, particularly governmental relations, can  you share with us the importance of engaging with the alumni  association, with Cowboys for Higher Education, and a little about how  that works?  Yes. You know, I guess to me the love of alumni for its university is  what really makes the university great, and I think that OSU has some  really devoted alumni. It reminds me  of  when I was at Cornell  University. I mean Cornell alumni, you think, they know it   s   the only  institution on earth is Cornell University. Every time that I visited  Auburn I felt the same way, and I think we have that Oklahoma State. I  think people have a great love for this university, and I also think they  want to see this university get better. I feel like our alumni association is  trying to utilize their connections. The group does a great job of looking  at who are the OSU alums that have been elected to political office. Not  to say that they   re going to do something special for OSU, but that  they   re going to recognize the importance of this institution and its role  in this great state in terms of education.  I tease my friend Doug Cox who   s in the legislature; he   s the only  physician in the legislature. There are three veterinarians in the  legislature, and we had never had a veterinarian in the legislature up  until six years ago and now we have three. So I tell him the veterinarians  are taking over the legislature. But what a great opportunity for when  issues related to animals come before the legislature to have three  experts sitting right there, and who does the legislature go to when they  have a question? Jim Halligan as a senator is going to be the education  senator. And I think the Cowboys for Higher Education, we   ve certainly  had a great opportunity to work with them in hosting receptions for  supporters of the university before some of our football games this fall.  And we   re able I think to get people here for those that if it weren   t for  the cowboys   I could call and ask them, but if one of their constituents  calls and asks them, it means a whole lot more. I feel that we need to  look for more and more ways for the cowboys to be directly involved in  the agenda for Oklahoma State. And you do have to be a little careful  because the cowboys are a diverse group and they   re not only going to  agree with your agenda.  Represent both parties?  They both represent both parties. You know, OSU may feel like there   s  a tuition issue, and there may be some people who think,    No, you   re  not going to raise tuition,    others who say,    Yes, you have to address  that.    So there   s always going to be some controversy. But I think the  important thing is open discussion and an access to them when you go to  31  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  the legislature, or when you can take a Larry Briggs or the other  cowboys with you, it just means a whole lot more. This is not somebody  who   s down here because they happen to work at that institution; they   re  here because they   re my constituent and because they think this is  important.  They   re not employees of the university, they   re voting constituents.  They   re not employees of the university. Exactly. And they   re  supporters of this institution and supporters of that legislator.  Well Joe, we   ve talked about a lot of things today, and I appreciate it.  You   ve covered a lot of things.  My pleasure.  I   d leave you with this one last question. What excites you the most  about the future of Oklahoma State University?  Well, what excites me the most about   I believe that this university, if it  continues on the path it   s going, is going to become recognized  nationally for the things that we already know that they do within the  state. And I really believe that   s going to happen. I believe that in what  Larry Boger used to say,    The more people know about us, the better  they like us.    And to do that, we   re going to have to establish certain  areas that when people think about those areas, they think about  Oklahoma State University. They think about where are the people that  are making the greatest difference in these areas, and guess what?  They   re in Stillwater, Oklahoma. And I think this university is heading  in that direction.  Joe, is there anything that I have not asked that I should have? I am sure  you have a lot of stories.  I do have a lot of stories, Jerry. But there are ones that you look back on  and you think how fortunate you were to be a part of them. I got a call  from a guy named Jerry Hagey. I didn   t know who Jerry Hagey was, but  I found out that Jerry Hagey owned what was called the Arbuckle  Wilderness. The Arbuckle Wilderness had just been awarded  Oklahoma   s Number One Tourism Attraction, but Jerry Hagey wanted  to sell it. And so he called me up and he told me that he wanted to make  a donation of  1 million to the veterinary school. So I went down to visit  with him. Well it turned out he wanted to sell me the Arbuckle  Wilderness for  1 million even though it was valued at  2 million, and I  just told him that I didn   t really think that was what I wanted to be  doing. But it wasn   t too much longer that he did put it on the market, and  32  Gill  Alexander  Gill  Alexander  because of its location and its importance to the city of Davis, a group  called the Murray County Economic Development Authority bought  Arbuckle Wilderness. My good friend Danny Hilliard, who   s now the  legislative person for the University of Oklahoma, was at that time  majority leader in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Jerry  motioned that since they were now owned by a not-for-profit  organization that the veterinary school better get down there and help  those people figure out how to run this place.  So we went down and we went on a tour with the manager and they had  a stockade fence that had a bunch of elk in it. And I asked the man what  those elk were doing. Well, he said, those elk weren   t feeling very well.  So we went over to look at them, and there was a dead elk in there, and  it had a sore right behind its jaw, which is tuberculosis, and that was the  worst diagnosis they could have. We diagnosed tuberculosis and the  whole park was quarantined for two years while we cleaned up the  tuberculosis. Well to clean it up, you have to test the animals, and you  haven   t lived until you   ve trying to test a giraffe or you   re trying to test  an African wildebeest for tuberculosis. It was one of those devastating  disease epidemics that was just a great case study. I mean students got  exposed to things they would never ever have been exposed to.  Unfortunately an awful lot of autopsies were done, but they got to do  those autopsies. And we were credited with saving the Arbuckle  Wilderness. It   s now in private hands and doing very well. But it was  such a unique opportunity to be there, to be part of trying to keep that for  Oklahoma, and at the same time recognizing that these people didn   t get  state money. I mean they had to keep the doors open and keep tourists  going through, all those things have to be happening when you   re trying  to clean it up. So just another one of those great experiences that you  get.  That   s great. Got any more stories?  Nope. That   s good for me.  I appreciate it. Thanks.  Well Jerry, thank you.  -------  -------
