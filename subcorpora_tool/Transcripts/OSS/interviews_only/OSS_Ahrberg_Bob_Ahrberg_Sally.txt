 Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  Today is Friday, October 20, 2006, and we   re here in the  ConocoPhillips Alumni Center on the OSU  Oklahoma State University   campus. I   m Jennifer Paustenbaugh and I   m here today with Bob and  Sally Ahrberg from Stillwater. The title of this project is O-STATE  Stories, an oral history project of the OSU Library. We   re really grateful  that you both agreed to participate. Since it is Homecoming weekend,  let   s go ahead and start there. What were Homecoming events like when  you attended OAMC?  Well, similar to what they are now. They had the parade, the floats and  they had the house decorations.  Were the house decorations like they are today?  Not as elaborate, but every house had them.  I   ve also heard something        and the Residence Halls, too.  Well, someone was telling me that the fire marshal had sort of changed  the way house decorations were done a little bit   that they were  originally attached to the house and then there were some safety issues  and that   s why all of them today are like way out in front of the house.     away from the house. It could be. I   m not familiar with that  requirement.  I don   t remember them being attached to the house, but I do remember I  was out of college. I was an advisor for my sorority and we had  homecoming with the AGRs  Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity      Okay.  5  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg     the year the house decorations hit the electrical wires and two boys  were killed.  Oh, what year was that?  Do you remember  turning to Bob      No, I don   t remember that. I remember the incident, but I don   t  remember the year.  Okay.  I don   t really recall     All right.     but it was a very sad occasion.  That might be why they changed the regulations. It could be.  That could have been why. It was probably in the    70s.  Okay. Now when did you all attend school here?     48. I started the year before Sally. I was here    48 to    52.  Okay.  And I went from    50 to    52. I went to a girls    school my first two years.  Okay, and then you transferred here?  Then I transferred here.  All right, and you were a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority?  Correct.  And were you in a fraternity?  No, I wasn   t in a fraternity.  Did you come here as a result of the GI Bill or     No. My father was transferred here. He was the county agent in Osage  County, and had the opportunity to put my brother and I through college  6  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  if he moved back. We had a farm north of town, still got it, I was born  there. And we moved back to the farm and I went to school from there.  Were you from Oklahoma originally?  I was born in Stillwater.  Okay.  Both of us were born here.  In fact, I was born just a block south of Gallagher-Iba.  Wow. (Laughter)  In fact, my Mother always said,    You almost were born on the wrestling  mat.    (Laughter)  Well, that sounds like a very interesting story all by itself. So you came  to OAMC and you met each other here or did you know each other     High school.     before then? In high school?  I actually met her when she was in Pawhuska. I grew up in Pawhuska  and went to high school there. Dad was the county agent there, and she  was helping her uncle write gas tickets, and we were buying gasoline.  And I went home and told Mom, I said,    There   s a better looking girl in  town today.    And I remembered that, so when I moved to Stillwater, I  hunted her up. (Laughter)  He can tell some pretty big stories.  Well, it   s true. (Laughter)  I   ll bet you can. What other traditions besides Homecoming can you  remember from your time here on campus?  Well, Feeder   s Day was a big day with the Animal Science Department.  Clay Potts had a big barbeque and it was free to all the Ag students and  anybody in Agriculture over at the Animal Science building, which is  gone now. But boy it was a good steak dinner and, of course, all the Ag  students were back at Feeder   s Day.  And what time of year was that?  7  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  Oh, let me see. It was always in the summer, late fall, and old Clay he     he must have cooked 3,000 steaks in those days.  He was sort of legendary     Oh, yes.  Absolutely.  And then Jimmy Fleming took over after Clay died.  Yes.  We have stories that we were responsible for getting into the O-State  Magazine, or what it was before it had that title, and it was about Clay  Potts, and his granddaughter read it and brought us a couple of bottles  of Clay Potts    recipe     Barbeque? Yeah. Well, he was an excellent cook         that was some fine eating, I   ll tell you.  Well, he used to cook for the games     Oh, he did?     the football games.  So that was in the concessions area?  Yes.  Okay. Besides Feeder   s Day, are there other traditions?  Well, I was in Agriculture and actually lived out on a farm north of  town, and that was my main remembrance of college other than I was in  ROTC  Reserve Officer Training Corps  of course, and when I  graduated I had two years to serve in the Army. The Korean War was  on, and everybody went to the war then.  I, of course, was a Swim  Sally   s maiden name  before I married Bob  and grew up literally on the campus you might say. I used to roller skate  all over, and Swim   s was a college hangout     Right.  8  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh     and a lot of the students, men, went through college working for us.  I remember all of the sporting events because my parents were very  active and supported the university. Actually we were more university  than we were town you might say and   I   m trying to think   I don   t  really recall other than the sporting events     Well, that   s about all there was in those days. There wasn   t a lot of  social activity for anybody, except fraternities and sororities, you know.  Were those sporting events all pretty well attended?  Yes, college students had free tickets to the games     Oh, okay.     see and so everybody attended.  That helped a lot.  Oh, yeah.  There were probably lots of things competing for their attention in  town     Well, in the    40s, you know, we had a good football team. We went to  the Sugar Bowl. Bob Fenimore, an old alumni here, he and Neill  Armstrong were outstanding athletes, and we won the Sugar Bowl that  year. I think that   s the only time we ever did.  Yes, that was a huge     It was a big lift for the athletic department   of course, Mr. Iba, too. He  had winning teams every year.  That   s right      45 and    46 because of those back-to-back NCAA  championships. Now that was before you were students on the campus,  but I   m sure you remember, pretty well.  Well, Bob Kurland showed up and he was seven foot tall. As a result of  his activity in sports, they put in the goaltending law because he could  stand at the basket and knock the ball away. Nobody could put it over  his head.  I heard that he really was probably the player that was the most  responsible for the move from the old basketball to a modern basketball.  9  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  Tall people. Tall people got into basketball and they still are.  Well, you   ve told me a little bit about Swim   s being a gathering place on  campus. Can you tell us a little bit more about that and what some of the  other gathering places were for students?  The Bread Basket down here that Buddy Andrews had on south  Washington        which was the Strip later on     Yeah.     after we were out.  What type of place was that?  Well, it was a coffee hall and a restaurant     Okay.     one of the early better ones out here by the campus. This campus then  was a long ways from town, and if you were out here, well you ate either  on the Strip or this little Y Hut or over at Swim   s     Well, and Brock   s     A few boarding houses around town then.  What was the name of that place across from the Chi Omega  sorority   house that Brock had?  Oh, yeah. Oh, golly   a little coffee shop and that   s where the fraternities  and sororities hung out.  Oh, it was pretty popular.  I can   t remember the name of it now.  Maybe somebody will come along that remembers     Yeah, somebody that drank coffee more than we did there.  Well, now tell me about Swim   s. Was it a place that you went in and sat  down and ate, or did it have a snack bar or     10  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Well, yes, it had a fountain in it   and they served meals and later on in  the    40s, they put in a dance floor.  Was that done by expanding it or by removing some of the        removing some of the booths that were around it.  It was a drugstore, too, wasn   t it?  Oh, yeah.  It was the first one out in this area.  And they had OSU paraphernalia that you could buy   blankets and  sweatshirts and stuff like that.  All right, so it was really like a student store     Yeah, well.  It was the student store in those days.  And when did it close?  Well, my dad left and sold to his brothers. There were three Swim  men   Leslie, Paul who was my father, and Rustie. I think it was about     46 that my father sold to his oldest brother and finally used his degree  (Laughs) from OAMC in Chemical Engineering and went to work for  Tidewater Oil Company in Drumright.  Okay.  So all three of the Swim boys graduated from Oklahoma A M, and Bob  and I have also had our children and one granddaughter and another one  coming up and a grandson coming up.  Were you the first woman in your family to graduate from college?  Oh, no. No, no, no. Well, let   s see Leva Swim Drummond didn   t  because she got married. I don   t know whether Emma Dell did or not  because she got married, and this was all during war time. They were  older than me, and I don   t remember whether she got hers.  I don   t know   we always considered her part of the Class of    42.  Well, your sister graduated here.  11  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  My sister graduated here, Joyce Swim, and Johnny Swim, Emma Dell  and Leva   s brother, and Bill Swim, and I don   t know whether Martha  and Ann did or not     I   m trying to figure this out in my head. Your grandchildren that are  attending, and will be attending, are the fourth or fifth generation of  your family to        of my family        me and Fred and     Fourth.  They   re the fourth.  That   s really exciting.  It is.     at a single institution     Janet and Fred   s youngest left us. (Laughs) I guess you know that.  Yes. (Laughter)  I won   t say where she went, but (Laughter) she   s happy. She   s excited.  We   ve heard rumors that she   s someplace in Florida     Yes.  About the time you were students here some new buildings were being  constructed on campus, namely the Student Union and the library. Do  you remember very much about     Yeah.     the building of those buildings and what it was like when they opened  and     I about flunked chemistry. It was right next to the   I was watching the  Student Union being built out the window and didn   t pay attention to  chemistry   (Laughter) and the library wasn   t there yet.  No.  12  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  So Washington was still open.  Okay.  Yeah, at that time.  I think the library opened like in the spring of    53     Yeah, we were gone.  In the military then.  Okay.  But what broke my heart was when they tore Williams Hall down     Wasn   t that a beautiful building?  Yeah.  Oh, yes, and I never understood where that came from.  The Quonset huts all started leaving about the time we graduated.  Everybody had class in the Quonset hut back in those days. They didn   t  have any classrooms, very few, and Animal Science   about half of their  classes were in Quonsets, and they   re all gone.  So what was that like meeting in a Quonset hut?  I thought it was pretty good; it beat outside. (Laughter)  But it still seems like they would be a lot draftier     Oh, my. Yeah, it was freezing in there you know. No, it was small,  small, but classes were probably forty in each end of the Quonset.  Okay.  And after we came back from the military, I taught at OSU in the  Physical Education Department under Mr. Kevin and Valerie Colvin. I  taught swimming in what we called,    the bathtub,    in the old gym,  which is now the Architectural Building.  I had heard that there was a pool in the bottom of that      Yeah, there was. It wasn   t much bigger than this room, but     13  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  So, you did that for a couple of years      For six.  For six years? Was physical education a     Required.  Okay, I was thinking that it probably was at that time. So you saw lots  and lots of students and     Yes, and the first Black student was in my swimming class.  Do you remember who     I don   t remember her name.  Okay. Nancy Randolph Davis was the first female Black student but she  was a graduate student so maybe it was her     No. No, it was undergraduate because it was required. If you could not  swim the length of the pool and back, you had to take swimming.  Oh, okay.  And the pool wasn   t much bigger than this room. (Laughs)  So girls always tried to struggle down that pool so they wouldn   t have to  take swimming.  What happened if they still couldn   t swim after     Oh, they had to.  They had to? Okay. They worked till they could, huh?  We had good teachers. (Laughter)  That   s pretty interesting. What was the reaction of students to her being  there?  I don   t recall that we had any     They were just pretty accepting     Yeah, but they weren   t on the football field and there was    and you   ve  14  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  heard that story I   m sure.  I have heard that story.  That happened when we were here at school.  Okay, that was    51 right?  Johnny Bright? Yeah, it made Life Magazine.  And Time Magazine and I   ve read various accounts in different places.  I   ve always been curious, you know, what the reaction of the students  was to that incident.  Well, I don   t think it   s near like it is today. Of course, communication  was very poor then. We didn   t have television and no cell phones, even  phone systems were very poor. We didn   t have one out at our farm for  years. And communication, now everybody knows what happened five  minutes ago, but I believe they were more accepting in those days than  they are today.  Well, they were segregated.  Yeah, they were segregated, sure     You know. So you didn   t     Schools were   I never did go to a school until college, well not even  college   with any Colored people. They were all segregated, and      So was there indignation among the student body     No   I don   t remember any     I don   t either.     of course there weren   t any Blacks in school when I was in college     but I don   t remember prejudice being as bad in those days as it is today,  even        and of course our children   they were     Yeah, they went to school with them.     went to school     15  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg     grew up with         but our PE  physical education  classes, of course   we didn   t have  the Colvin Center, and they were in many buildings on campus. I taught  archery in the basement of the Gallagher Iba, and I taught dance out in  the basement of North Murray. I don   t know what the name of that is  now, but     Is that what your degree was in, physical education?  Yes. I had a double major. I had a English major and a major in Health  Physical Education and Recreation.  You look very fit. Is that still something that you continue     Well, I   ve tried. (Laughter)  We   re both wearing out. (Laughter)  Genetics has something to do with some of it. That   s probably the only  regret I have in my life is not going back after I had our daughter. Ann  Mahoney is her name now, and she   s working at the HES  College of  Human Environmental Sciences .  Well   that was most common for women to do that     I worked while our son was young, but after she was born I did not go  back, and I kind of look back now and wish I had. I don   t know why, but  I guess to be able to use the new facilities. (Laughter)  That would be terrific. I used to have a wonderful job over at the Colvin  Center     And of course it   s  physical education  not even called that now, and it   s  not required.  Which is too bad      I think so, too. Too many obese children, but     I had asked you a little bit about the Student Union when that opened.  Was that something that was a source of pride on campus?  Oh, you bet. Well, after it was opened   it   s really a fine building, you  know     16  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  It didn   t open until after we were gone though, did it?  No, it wasn   t finished until we were gone.  Did that open in the end of    51 or the beginning of    52?  It had to be in    52 because that   s the year I graduated.  All right.  But a good friend of ours, Abe Hesser, became director of it soon after it  opened and did a good job of getting the hotel and restaurant business  started.  It was neat. The union was, I think.  They had really fine food service then.  That   s what I   ve heard. (Laughter)  I think the town was proud     Oh, sure, it was a big addition.  A really fine facility     Of course they shut Washington Street     I heard that was really controversial at the time     Yeah, at the same   just like it is      Today?  Yeah.  Although there was no hope that Washington was going to reopen  after     No. No. No. Once they put the library in there, that was it.  I don   t think Hall of Fame will be     I don   t know. I sure hope not. (Laughter)  Well, it would be a tragedy the way the streets are right now. You   d  17  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  have to go miles to get around.  It is definitely hard to get around now. I know that both of you grew up  in this area. Was that one of the main reasons that you decided to go to  school here? Were there other compelling reasons that brought you  here?  Actually, I grew up in Pawhuska. Dad was the county agent there, and  he had an opportunity to become the state livestock specialist to the  extension division, and my brother and I both were ready to go to  college and the only way he thought he could afford to send us was  move back down here     Okay.     and we did. We   ve got a farm north of town, Granddad   s, who got it  in the run   and the homestead   and he gave it to Dad as a college  graduation gift and then I   ve still got it. Janet and Fred  daughter-in-law  and son  live on another farm joining it out there   .both of our kids have  built homes out there.  I knew they had moved out of town, but I didn   t know where. So that  meant when he moved back here you said tuition was     It was free. Yeah.  It was free so   and that your living expenses   you      I lived at home. My brother had the GI Bill. He   d been in the service and  back. And he lived in the Beta house, but I didn   t     No, he lived in an apartment.  Well, they had an apartment. They lived at the Beta house one semester  and then four other friends moved to the new homes out at the high  school, College Homes, maybe? It was private apartments out there, and  they were nice. But he had GI Bill to go through school. Most people  did, you know, older people.  Right. Yes in that time period     And I was still in high school when the war broke out. In 1954 we got  out of the service and came back and I started the Ahrberg Milling  Company here in Stillwater, and bought the elevator in Perkins, then my  brother and I started one in Cushing and I had the one in Morrison later.  So we   ve been in the grain elevator business     18  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  A long time?     the feed and fertilizer business until I retired   been in there thirty  years. I   ve always been associated with agriculture in every way, and  cattle raising, and we managed a cattle operation for the Oppenheimers  out of Kansas City, and they had a lot of cattle.  And when you were a student here, you said you were in the College of  Agriculture?  Yes, Animal Husbandry.  In Animal Husbandry? Okay. Now Sally     And I was a city girl. (Laughter)  That   s right, and you said that you had gone to another school the first  two years. So what made you decide to transfer?  Well, I wanted to go away to school. I had     And where did you go?  To Christian College, which is now Columbia. It was a girls    school, but  now it   s co-ed, and it had about 325 enrollment when I was there. I don   t  know what the enrollment is now, but it was in Columbia, Missouri. And  my parents kind of wanted me to go away, too   have that opportunity.  Sure.  And there was no idea that I wouldn   t come back here to finish. That  was just in the works.  So, that was the plan?  Yeah, that was        you had that experience of being away from home for that year     Yes, I do remember one thing from college when we were here. I don   t  know whether they do it now or not, but when we won a game in  football or basketball that we weren   t supposed to   we always got to  have a walkout     Next day. Everybody   s all out of school     19  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg     and we didn   t have to go to school.  So who determined the games that you were and weren   t supposed to  win?  Well     I don   t remember that, but we walked out most of the games that we  won. (Laughter)  Whether they let us or not    No, I think that they were ranked higher  than we were     It was always OU  University of Oklahoma .  They would   always OU, yeah, which was very seldom, but I don   t  think they do that anymore.  No, I don   t think so, although maybe people take their own walkout kind  of     Well, they may do that, too. Didn   t they do that?  That   s probably a tradition students wish still existed. I know that you  said that sporting events were one of the main activities that students  attended for entertainment      Everybody had the opportunity, you know. It was free for the college  students.  What else did they do?  Students didn   t go home like they do now.  No, they stayed here.  They didn   t have cars.  It was much more of a challenge to get somewhere     When they were here, they were here until their parents came and got  them and took them home.  Gasoline. I remember coming in a Model A to school and it cost  seventeen cents a gallon. That was tax and all.  20  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Wow. (Laughter)  But I   m sure they, you know, attended church and went to the movies.  Movies were big.  Were there lots of dances?  They had        used to have quite a few dances.  The fraternities and     Yeah.     sororities did and the military ball.  TV had just started, and nobody owned them so they   d go down on  Main Street to the appliance stores that did have them in the windows,  and people would stand there for hours watching the TV shows.  Really?  So that took a lot of time. (Laughs)  That   s very interesting. It was a lovely small black and white     Oh yeah. It was   I think seventeen inch was the biggest. (Laughter)  When someone mentions OAMC or OSU, what   s the first thing that  comes across your mind? Is there a first thing?  Not really at our age. (Laughs)  Well, it   I     Usually I ask them what degree they got in, you know, if they say they  went to school here.  To me, it   s the fact that it   s in Stillwater, and Stillwater   s my home town  and I love it. I think it   s been a wonderful place to live and raise my  children and have them go to school. I think the university   s grown     Oh, yes. I think        in accordance with other universities and more or less kept up, and I  21  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  don   t know. I just love it.  Yeah, we   ve lived in the same house since 1960. You know, that   s a  long time. Most people move about every five years.  Well, that is really something that   s different than probably the  generation today has experienced.  Right. Our kids have already moved several times, you know, way more  than we ever did. We came home from the Army and, why, we settled  here.  We were here.  That was it.  If your grandchildren asked you   tell us a story about when you were in  college at OSU. What kind of story could you share with them?  Well, he   s shared a lot    (Laughter) that you don   t want to hear.  (Laughter) And I don   t know that I   ve shared many.  I can remember one   Dr. Willham was my advisor in Agriculture     Okay.  And as a senior, while my brother was in Korea in the Army, Dad  passed away and we had very limited income as a family. Mother and  my sister and I lived out on the farm north of town. So I came in and  told Dr. Willham I was dropping out of college. And he knew Dad real  well and he said,    Bob, Fred would want you to graduate.    And I said,    I  just can   t afford to.    I said,    I really need to drop out of school.    He  says,    I see you haven   t ever taken         I was a senior   He says,    I see  you haven   t ever taken freshman English.    I said,    Doc, I can   t spell.    I  said,    Every class I go into, it looks like a chicken has walked across the  test page with red feet. They just mark every damn word because I can   t  spell.    And he says,    Well.    He says,    We   ll get you substitutes and  what else could we do?    And I said,    I don   t know. What have you got  for a selection?    He said,    How about speech?    I said,    Yes sir, I can  out-talk most people. Just put me in there.    So he assigned me to   was  her name Hillis?  Hillis. Olive Hillis.  And the classroom was in the third story of Old Central, upstairs. Well, I  get up there, you know, and a bunch of students about like me   there  22  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  were some seniors, but most of them were freshman in speech. And she  says it was a demonstration speech class and you had to talk while you  were demonstrating your speech     And he was the first one because his name begins with an    A.           and see we   re going in alphabetical order so Mr. Ahrberg you   ll be  first, and be ready by Wednesday.    Well, I had sheared all the sheep for  the college here for years. I was a sheep shearer, and I thought, well I   ll  just shear a darn sheep up there. I went out to the college. I knew the  herdsman real well, and I just got one of these sheep and carried it up  three flights of stairs over there (Laughter)   and electric shears. It took  about three minutes to shear the sheep, you know, and I was talking as I  went through it. It   s quite a process, and I had the sheep all sheared and  she says,    Mr. Ahrberg,    she says,    You   ve got an    A    in this class. You  don   t have to come back.    It took three minutes to qualify for English.  Wow. (Laughter)  That was it. (Laughter)  That wouldn   t happen now.  I won the state contest in 1946 shearing sheep, and I was second in the  nation that year, so I could shear sheep, and I knew I could do that and it  worked.  So, have you ever been to   I know that in Australia that     No, I haven   t been. I   d like to have gone over there when I was younger.  The way I got to shearing sheep was Dad was the state livestock  specialist. Part of his job was to teach 4-H Club boys how to shear sheep  in each county. On the weekends   he always went on a Saturday   and  to a different county and all the club kids came in and they had their  sheep in there and we demonstrated how to shear sheep. Dad  demonstrated on a chart which had about seventy steps, and I did the  shearing. Well, after about two years of that, I could jerk the wool off a  sheep as fast as anybody. Sunbeam Corporation sponsored it. They gave  me a set of shears, and I   ve had them all these years, but now they   ve  got better shears, more modern, more powerful. They were electric  shears, and a lot of farms then didn   t have electricity. They had to bring  them to the fairgrounds to have their sheep sheared     Oh, okay.     and they   d bring in ten or twelve head, you know, and get them  23  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  sheared. That   s how I got interested in shearing sheep and made very  good money, too. I sheared all the sheep at OSU   or it was A M     from 1948 to 1952, and they always paid you a year late.  A whole year later?  So when I was a senior, I talked to Dr. Willham and I said,    You know  I   m going to the war.    I had an ROTC commission, and the Korean War  was on, and I said,    Could you see that they pay me before I go to war? I  might not get back.    (Laughter) And he did. When I was a senior, why  he got me paid on time. (Laughs)  Now, you  turning to Sally  were a Theta. What was life like in the  sorority house at that time?  Well, the numbers were much smaller. My pledge class was like twenty-four  or five.  Oh, wow. Quite a bit smaller.  Yes, which was the norm, and of course I couldn   t live in the house  because I was a Stillwater girl and that wasn   t allowed. There wasn   t  room and     So how many girls would the house accommodate?  Oh, fifty.  And is the house still in the location that it was?  Yes, yes. Of course, originally it was the parking lot of the Sigma Nu  house and that   s how Theta Pond got its name.  Oh, I didn   t realize that.  Because Kappa Alpha Theta was across the street     Okay.     and I don   t know all the story of it   well, I have it at home, but I  couldn   t tell you all about it.  The story I heard was it was like the college pond or something     Cow pond. Yes. Yes.  24  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg     something real generic.     and then we moved where we are now and we   ve put on several  additions, and they had dance hours and semester pledging, and you  weren   t initiated until you made your grades, and that   s a lot different  than it is now.  Yes, it is.  And I think we were probably closer to our sorority sisters than they are  now because it wasn   t so big.     a lot easier to get to know people.  Right. You   re closer to them.  Now, have you been active   were you on the house board?  Very active. Yes. I was on the advisory board, corporation board, for     well, I started in probably 1960 and I just retired recently. (Laughs)  Okay. So other than the superficial differences of students then and now,  when you look at a new pledge class in the Theta house, what would  strike you as being really different about those young women than the  young women who were pledges when you were a student?  Oh, I probably would think they were spoiled now. (Laughter) That they  had come from homes where they had their own rooms, their own  bathrooms and when they get here, they have to share.  Although that seems to be true of college students in general.  Well, that   s true. And, except now that the new dorm-type buildings on  our campus, they don   t have to share as much. The bedrooms   they  have their own bedroom     Right.     and bath. It   s different and I don   t really think I want to get into why  it   s that different. (Laughter) I have grandchildren that are in college.  Okay. Well, I mean times do change     They do, and that   s great. You know, it   s just like we were talking  earlier about when Coach Hanson was here and we were allowed to be  host families and could have the athletes into our homes and also  25  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  football     Yeah, we had the whole football team in our backyard for hamburgers  one night. (Laughs)  And we had one young man from Washington, DC that came that got in  trouble and went to court, and I took him to Oklahoma City to a  psychiatrist and back, and we went to the wire with him and he got off,  but he did leave Stillwater and go back to Washington, DC where he  was from.  Stillwater has changed as much as the college, too     Oh, yeah.     the town has, you know. When they used to have the Japanese people  live on Washington Street where the hospital is that was   and they  talked Japanese to the Navy Zoomers here during the War     Okay.     and there were a lot of Japanese that lived there on Sixth Street.  Well, I had them living behind me in my house.  Well, but the main place was over here. They were pretty well confined.  So where did they come from?  Around the United States. They had to teach the language when we were  fighting the Japanese.  You know that was what brought Bob Kamm back to OSU. He was  stationed here with the Navy.  That   s right, he was.  And they liked it so well that when he had an opportunity to come back  here, he did.  So tell me a little more   I   ve never heard about this before. I knew that  there had been a language training program     Yeah.     on the campus and that there were, like a Waves trained here?  26  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Navy Zoomers were here.  Okay. So were these like Japanese   instead of people being sent to  interment camps?  These were American Japanese.  American? Okay.  Yeah, they came here to teach the Japanese language to the Navy people  and personnel. At the same time we had a little old town called Ortuba  south of the hospital and west just a little. It was close   it probably  housed 2,000 students, and the rooms were not any bigger than this one.  Four college students lived in it, and they had a     Wow. That   s hard to imagine        coal stove   coal stove in the center of the floor and one drop light.  You know, that   s it. So the living conditions are much different today  than they were then.  Well, you know     Dirt streets out there. There weren   t any paved streets.  So what about bathing facilities?  Well, they had a shower. It was pretty open (Laughs) out there. It was all  male students, and all my buddies lived there   Don Conrad and Bill  Austin and Tom Porter and     Ted.  I used to go out and study there     Well, there were married students that lived there. Ted and Kay lived in  Ortuba.  Did they live in   did they     And it was called Ortuba?  Ortuba.  Ortuba.  27  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  I don   t know where they got the name, but it was just a wood shack   tar  paper shack and, of course, they   re all gone.  And that was different than Vet Village?  Oh yeah.  Well, Vet Village was the same time, and it was wooden buildings out  here where the nice brick ones are now, but it was for married students  primarily.  You know, veterans when they   d get back, they didn   t have anything  else to do. They went to school   .  Right.  And they had a little money. The GI Bill        and the GI Bill        put a lot of them through school.     provided that.  Well, I heard that Vet Village was so large and at its peak that it had its  own mayor, city council and its own post office.  It had its own post office, I remember that. I didn   t know all the other  things that went on out there, but it was pretty large, and they were  better than Quonsets. They were wooden shacks. (Laughter)  I know that this happened after you graduated, but did you have any  strong feelings when OAMC became OSU?  Well, I didn   t think we were big enough for it, you know. It was a cow  college here. Agriculture school was very large when I was in school,  and it   s minor today, very minor. Of course, the military department is  the same way. You were required to take ROTC. Everybody that came  to school took ROTC or you didn   t go to school, and now it   s elective,  of course. It   s pretty small. But it was the right thing to do. It  modernized the college and, looking back on it, why we needed to do it,  but I didn   t think so at the time.  What about the change of the mascot to Pistol Pete? Did you think that  that was a very good idea or     28  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Well, I hadn   t noticed it changed that much to tell you the truth.  (Laughs)  The change is great. I don   t really have a problem with it. I don   t have a  problem with the Athletic Village.  No, it   s really nice if you can afford it, I guess.  I think it   s progress. I think it   s progress and, you know, you   ve got to  stay up with the times. If the current student population wants something  new, if it doesn   t hurt anybody, I don   t know why they can   t do it.  Well, this town has changed a tremendous amount and it   s done well.  Our people have done very   Perkins Road used to be a muddy, dirt  road.  That   s what I heard.  You couldn   t drive down it at all     Knoblock.     and that farm where Atwood   s is, across the road from all those new  buildings, that was Sally   s farm. Her father owned that quarter section     Okay.     and west of the railroad track, he subdivided it into homes, and the  east side is just now being developed.  That   s amazing.  But those were all   I   ve run cattle on, you know. It was all cow pasture.  Where the Holiday Inn is, I used to cut wheat there, Lee Stevens owned  that property. A little old combine back in the 1940s   but it   s changed  tremendously. Highway 51 was dirt from the motel right there at  Western going west. There wasn   t any black top. There sure wasn   t  any     So when did they get paved?  Oh     I don   t remember.  I don   t remember, but it had to be in the 1960s, no in the late 1950s  29  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  evidently.  I can remember Knoblock     And then they finally four-laned it. The road on the north side is new.  It   s a lot higher than the old one on the south side. Of course, we had the  floods in 1957 and all that. From the bridge out there out to the Ford  garage was underwater for three days. You couldn   t leave town.  Stillwater Mill had three foot of water in the office down there   stood  there for several days. We had eleven inches of rain here at one time,  and things do get wild when the rains come. (Laughter) We haven   t had  it in years, but in 1957 and 1959 we had some big floods, and Bill  Thomas was the mayor here in   oh, it must have been about 1970,  wasn   t it? And I like his brother, Owen, real well   we were in the Army  together but     They   re Ford garage people.  Right.     Bill was the one that really got the water line from Kaw down to  Stillwater, and if we hadn   t had that, the town wouldn   t have grown.  We were getting        wouldn   t have the water     No, we were drawing water out of Lake Carl Blackwell, and it drained  down to a fish pond every year. And now they   ve got that four-foot pipe  in from Kaw down here and it   ll take care of the next hundred years.  And that happened in the 1970s?  Yeah, it   I think Bill was mayor in the 1970s.  1980s? I don   t remember.  But it was one thing that was really major for the town.  He   s not into the 2000s yet. (Laughter)  I can   t remember the exact date, but I can remember some things that  happened. (Laughter)  Well, do you have any advice for current or future students coming to  OSU?  30  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  Oh, it   s changed so much. We   re not up to date on what they   re doing  anymore. You know, agriculture was our field   my field, and you have  to specialize now in agriculture. It   s not general like it used to be. I had  to take horse production and they taught us how to hook up to horse  equipment, and tractors came out pretty quick. (Laughter)  Didn   t do him any good, did it?  Now the horses are quarter horses and pleasure riding     Well, they were beasts of burden.  Yeah, they sure were.  I would tell the students to continue to come back to their alma mater  and to support the university, give back what they took away, and send  their children and grandchildren. Encourage that.  I think that   s good. I think probably that   s the reason that that kind of  thing is happening, because of alums like you that have that attitude.  There seems to be sort of a shared value that students, I guess, have  developed in the modern era about the importance of giving back to the  institution.  Yeah, we were lucky to have Boone Pickens. He was here at the same  time. I never heard of him, but I   m sure glad I hear of him now.  (Laughter) He   s done an awful lot for OSU.  Bob   s sister, Ruth Austin, is a graduate of OSU, too, and she  participated with a granddaughter in the grandparents camp that they  have in the summer a year ago, and she said it   s just wonderful.  That   s what I   ve heard.  My sister   s real active here in school. After Dad died, my mother  became house mother to Murray and then Stout Hall, and she   d come  dragging my little sister in there and she was     Thirteen.     thirteen and lived in those dorms with her. So she grew up kind of in  the shadow of the college, you know, and thinks a lot of it.  Yeah, you ought to have her here. She could tell you a lot     Yeah, she knows more about the history of the college than we would, of  31  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  B.

She grew up right here going to high school and then college,  too.  So where does she live now?  Colorado Springs.  Okay.  She   s retired. She   s a school teacher retired and married an Air Force  colonel and     Well, I have a cousin that teaches at the Air Force Academy   I should  go and interview     Yeah.  Her son was married there.  Okay   a beautiful chapel     We went out to the wedding.  No, he wasn   t married at the Air Force Academy.  Jimmy?  No. He wasn   t.  That was the reception     No, it was Debbie. She married     It was Debbie? Okay.     she married a graduate of the Academy.  Yeah, that   s right. That   s right.  Yeah.  It was Debbie. I get those kids mixed up. (Laughter)  Well, is there anything else that you can think of that you wish that I had  asked you about your experience here?  32  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  B. Ahrberg  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  S. Ahrberg  Paustenbaugh  Oh, my.  Not me. (Laughter)  A lot of it you wouldn   t want to know. (Laughter)  Well, you know that   s one thing I   ve noticed that a lot of retirees coming  back     Yeah, they come back, a lot of them do.     to Stillwater because the times that they were here were good times  for them.  This is supposedly is a great place to retire, from what I   ve read in  magazine articles.  We   re glad we   re here. We   re glad we   re here.  You know, the university offers lots of things to do for the townspeople,  and they   ve even started a new learning class. I don   t know what the  name of it is, and then they   re going to have a new   hopefully  someday   retirement center, just not too far from where we live.  I   ve heard about the plans for that. That will be really great.  Yes. It will be.  Well, thank you so much for coming in today and sharing your story.  -------  -------
