 Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  My name is David Peters, and I   m with the Oklahoma State University  library. Today is October 25, 2008. We are at the Stillwater Plaza Hotel,  located at 600 East McElroy in Stillwater, Oklahoma interviewing  Dr.   Yack Moseley, with assistance by his spouse, Genevela. This interview is  being conducted as part of the OAMC / OSU in Ethiopia Oral History  Project of the OSU Library. Thank you for joining us today.  I   m glad to be with you.  Please share with me the story of your life before you went to Ethiopia,  beginning about where you   re from.  Alright. I was born in central Texas and my birth certificate carries the  town of Izoro, Texas which is in Lampasas County. People ask me  where I   m from and I generally say,    Well I   m from the Fort Hood area     because Fort Hood came in and took in a large part of Coryell County  and a large part of Bell County, an adjoining county. So it wasn   t  unusual for me to be out on the porch and hear the roar of tanks going up  and down a public road in front of our house   they were from Fort  Hood area. I went to a little school, Peabody School, before I went to  Pearl High School. But Peabody was a little community in which there  was a school and I had an education there and then I went on to Pearl,  Texas for high school. A bus was furnished to carry me up to that school  and the education was good. In 1944, I graduated with 17 in my class.  Today, I took a check on them and there   s not too many of us left. Of the  17, I think eight are dead and the rest of them are scattered here and  there.  After I finished my bachelor   s at Texas A M, I was trying to decide,  should I take a job or should I go on for a master   s. I decided to try for a  master   s so I came on up to Oklahoma State University and then started  school here and finished my master   s degree. I  then  took a job at New  5  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Mexico State University. One day we got a phone call from the  department head, Dr.  Ervin W.  Schroeder, and asked me would I be  interested in going to Ethiopia. I called my wife and I said,    Would you  like to go to Ethiopia?    and she said,    Well, if we   re ever going to  travel,    she said,    Now is the time because the children are just at the  right age.    They were small and easy to manage, so we made an  appointment with the interviewer to come down to New Mexico and to  interview me and to find out about the family and so forth and see if  would we be okay to go over to Ethiopia.  So he came down   Bill  William S.  Abbott is the man who came down  and interviewed me, and he said,    You know, when I was first married, I  was in the military.    He said,    My wife and I had our first apartment  here in El Paso. I   d like to go look at that apartment if we can find it, and  then I   d like to go over across the border   across the river   into Mexico  because I remember going over there earlier and I   d like to see it once  again.    So he came down for a visit and we met him at the airport there  and loaded him up with a suitcase and so forth and we found his old  apartment building.  Then we went over to Old Mexico and we weren   t over there very long;  when we started to come out the people at the customs says,    Say, would  you go over there to that second place there?       They   ve got some more  questions to ask you.    So we went over there and they said,    Ahh,    said,     What have you got in your trunk?    and it really wasn   t a trunk on that  car, it was a station wagon and it had a place for a spare tire back there.  They said,    What you got in your spare tire?    I said,    Oh, just a spare  tire.       Let   s look.    So they took that car and looked and,    Oh, let   s  see   let   s see down in your window wells.    So they had us to roll down  the windows and he took a flashlight and shined down in there and made  sure there wasn   t anything in there. They thought since we were going  down there just for a short visit and come back out, well maybe we were  going down there for a load of some kind   What was your field of study? Why was Bill Abbott interviewing you, for  what area did he     Agricultural engineering. Agricultural engineering is what I did my  bachelor   s in at A M and I came on up here and did my master   s here at  Oklahoma State.  When did you complete your masters at OSU? In 1957?  Sounds about right   about 1957, yes. And then Bill told me later, he  said,    I   ve been across a lot of boundaries in this world   crossed a lot of  boundaries of countries,    he said,    This is the most rugged investigation  6  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  I   ve ever had,    for thinking that maybe he was carrying something  because he had a shiny new suitcase and just freshly packed and we   d  been down there in Mexico just a short time and was going back out  after being down there. It looked like (Laughs) we might have gone  down there for a load of something. But anyway, we went on and so we  agreed to assignment to Ethiopia. So we sold the car and sold the house  and got things all ready and we left from the El Paso Airport. The day  was about   don   t know exactly   do you remember the month?   Wife Genevela Moseley joins in   We got there in June of 1962.  About June of 1962. We flew then to Dallas, and from Dallas we flew  on to New York City, and from New York City to Frankfurt, Germany,  and then from Frankfurt we got on Ethiopian Airlines and flew down to  Eritrea, and then from Eritrea on into Ethiopia. Eritrea is a little country  that used to be part of Ethiopia but now has been changed   and so we  went on into Ethiopia. I had read what I could and couldn   t carry in, and  I   d been told that guns were okay according to the written information  that I had. My grandfather had an old 30-40 Krag and he let me carry it  into Ethiopia, and I came into Ethiopia with that on my shoulder. I come  out of the plane and some of the people who were meeting me said,    Oh,  no. They can   t be       So they took the gun   the Ethiopians took the gun  and kept it for several months and finally I got it after my friend there  paid some money, he got it moved on.  What years were you in Ethiopia then?  1962 to 1968.  1962 to 1968   and who made the arrangements for all those flights?  OSU made the arrangements for the flights.  How did Bill Abbott let you know that you were approved? I mean, it  looks like they called you   they made the contact with you   did they  offer you the job and then you accepted?  Yes. I guess Bill Abbott had been in contact with the Department Head  here     OSU.     of agricultural engineering. And then whenever he gave his approval,  then Bill Abbott came down to see me and we agreed to go with him.  7  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Where were you assigned to live and work in Ethiopia?  Well, we got there   the housing was a little bit scarce and we first were  assigned to live over by the lake, which was close to a little power  station that they used. I think the power station had been built by Italians  and it was there by the lake so they had plenty of water for cooling and  so forth. We had a little house right close by and we lived there at first.  We didn   t live on the main campus. The main campus was across the  lake and most of the people worked there at the college. Well, we would  drive over for assignment and work over at the university, at the college,  and then have to retire back to my home by the lake at night.  My wife had quite an experience there in that one day she looked out the  window and she saw an Ethiopian man and an older man making this  sign like this, and she thought,    My goodness. What does he mean? It  looks like he   s trying to say he   s going to kill us.    Well it turned out that  he was trying to sell slaughtered chickens. If she wanted a chicken, well  he would get her one. (Laughs)  And so we had quite an experience, but then we got moved over   when  some of the older staff members left for home, well we got one of their  houses over on the main campus and lived over there. Then the  agricultural engineering building was one of the buildings that were  there on the campus. I am told that when the president of the university  here at Oklahoma State   he wanted to set up a sort of a typical  agricultural and mechanical college, and so there were buildings for  agricultural engineering, buildings for livestock, buildings for poultry,  and there would have been a plot so that they could put in field crops  and test them. So it was a sort of a typical college for investigation and  for working on A M type of arrangement, and so that   s where I  worked. Primarily the courses that I taught were in irrigation and in  surveying and in basic electricity and some shop work. When I say shop,  I   m talking about where you taught things with metal   using metal for  welding or for other interests in the shop area.  You talked about first living by the lake. How long did it take you to get  from that house to the campus?  Not too long. Fifteen minutes.  Did you drive? Did you have a vehicle?  Oh yes. We had a Volkswagen, a little     When we first got there, we had a little car that was just loaned to us by  Wes  W. Wesley  Hobbs when he was on vacation.  8  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  Yeah. One of the   Dr. Hobbs had left on vacation and he had a car and  he just left it with us and let us use it.  Until we could get our car.  So it was about a 15-minute drive then from the house at the lake?  Ten minutes, I guess. It wasn   t long. All the people walked everywhere.  Later on, I had another vehicle, a larger vehicle, a Jeep, and I   d give  some of the people walking a ride, and oh, this would be excitement for  them if they had never ridden in a car before in their life and didn   t  know hardly what wheels were, and they liked that. We   d give them a  ride. Ethiopian girls would be just dressed in one long piece of cloth  wrapped around them, and whenever they needed to use the bathroom  they   d just stoop down and whenever they   d leave well they   d      Okay, you were telling me about communication in Ethiopia and then we  were going to talk a little bit about Kennedy   s assassination. Were you  going to expand on that some?  Just a little bit about the Kennedy assassination, yes. Because that  happened in Dallas and of course I happened to be the one that was  listening to the radio that night, and I just happened to pick up that news,  and I went to my next door neighbor, which was Dan Bigbee, which was  at breakfast with us this morning. He lived next door to me and I told  him the news, so he and I just split the campus then. He went to houses  over here and I went to houses over here, and we would knock on the  door and tell people that and they couldn   t believe it. Said,    What kind  of crazy joke is this?       No, no. Kennedy   s been shot.    And so, as my  wife said later, His Majesty threw a   what kind of party?  A banquet at his palace in Harar.  Yeah, and of course His Majesty   you don   t stay in a motel   he had a  palace in every town of any size. He called it a palace   that   s where he  stays. So he threw a banquet over there for all the Americans, and we  were in line and we got through the door facing like that, he stepped  around and there was Haile Selassie shaking hands with all the  Americans, and then he had a party for us to eat either meat raw or  cooked.  What kind of meat?  Beef.  Beef?  9  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Beef. It was piled up high, and some of the Ethiopians would take that  raw meat and just enjoy it. We didn   t like that   didn   t try that.   Joined by son Jeff Moseley   Did he make a speech, Dad?  No. They had a girl singing, and we took as much as we could and then  we got up and walked out.  So you actually got to meet then Emperor Haile Selassie?  Yes. Yes.  Was there any special greeting or was there just    Hello    or    Thank  you        No special greeting, just    Hello.    That   s all. And about once a year he  would visit the university campus and he always come in an old     Cadillac.     an old Cadillac and he had a little dog with him. He always had a little  dog   because he was a little man and his little dog   and he   d have his  car and a little dog would get out and generally had a motorcycle   man  on a motorcycle would be leading him ahead and      Well, we have a picture of President Bennett when he met with Emperor  Haile Selassie, and it   s Bennett and Haile Selassie and a little dog. It  was a little white-haired dog of some kind. I   m not sure. This is when  President Bennett met him in Ethiopia early on.  Yeah.  It   s when the Emperor said that he would come back and visit OSU at  some point in time.  You know he came over there, and you know what happened over there?  He got there and he wouldn   t get off the plane. You know why?  Oklahoma State.  They   d put his flag upside down.  You know one of the stories I remember about Kennedy   s  assassination   at that time in U.S. history, there were questions about  10  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Peters  J. Moseley  Peters  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  what that also meant as far as other countries coming and maybe seeking  revenge for the Bay of Pigs. Anyway I heard that there were several of  the American family men that got their hunting rifles out and at night  they would stand guard around the campus. Yeah.  They were afraid that there would be something terrible happen since the  President was killed. They were worried.  There was a sense of the unknown and so there was a group of the  hunters, I guess, that decided to kind of set up and help watch the  perimeter of the campus.  And these were Ethiopian local     No. These were the American families living there and they just didn   t  know what it meant, if there would be any reason to feel any threat from  somebody coming after all Americans because of the President   s death.  We didn   t know why anybody would attack a President, and so there  were questions about are Americans internationally maybe going to be  subject to a similar challenge? It   s my understanding there were some  Americans that organized   and as you talk and interview, you might ask  about that   but they set up a watch for several, maybe a week or two  weeks afterward and at night time they would watch the perimeter of the  campus.  And these were men who had weapons because they were hunting?  Yeah. These were hunting rifles and they   d just take that responsibility.  I didn   t know about that.  Did you participate or celebrate any Ethiopian holidays or      We went over to Harar. The town was fairly close to us. It   s an old  Muslim town, but this was a celebration of one of their holidays and  they wore real brightly colored umbrellas. They had them, and they had  some people jumping. See some of them can really leap high   just stand  still and jump.  Similar to the Maasai, like in Kenya   the Maasai are jumpers.  Something like that, yeah.  I believe you   re describing a Christian observance, Timkat?  Yeah, that was a Christian observance. It wasn   t a Muslim observance.  11  Peters  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  But Ethiopia is traditionally an ancient Christian country, and so this is  a modification of a Christian celebration then.  We went to one of their big special Kulubi Day celebrations when they  had the big umbrellas, and we drove to a church at Kulubi, and the  people were all outside the church celebrating. We just watched.  Since Dad was involved in the village life, he was invited to weddings.  I   ve been with him to weddings in the village. Some of the farmer  community, which would be the Islamic celebrations, and then of course  some of the students would     You were one of the students on the back of somebody in one of the  pictures that I have   a slide picture   and when you go to church over  there, you don   t sit in chairs. You   ve got a leaning stick you put under  one arm and you could lean on it.  How long did it take for you to feel culturally comfortable or  acclimatized? Did it take very long or did you feel comfortable fairly  quickly?  He   s always at home wherever he is. I felt a little bit odd over there at  the lake house. When he would be gone, I would be there by myself with  the children, and I was kind of worried about the town people. I didn   t  know, and I had just gotten there from the States, and I was saying,    Can  I live here two years and not go home and see my family? Because I  won   t be able to come back for two whole years.    But it went away. I  felt at home right away, but right at first I thought two years is a long  time. (Laughs)  Well, and you had an interesting experience with a garden   there was a  gardener there.  He told about that. I was a little bit shaken up.  What do you think caused the most conflict for other Americans there?  Were there cultural things that they had trouble with or do you think  there was a fairly decent comfort level?  We kept pretty close to the campus. What other Americans experienced,  I really don   t know. They would generally be associated with the  government in some way, and they would be in Addis Ababa, the capital  city, and I didn   t know much about them. I really don   t know.  But I think one answer to that question is the challenge would be  homesickness.  12  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  That   s right.  Because there wasn   t a real easy way of learning what was going on  back home.  You couldn   t communicate. You couldn   t call on the phone. You were  cut off from your home.  A big day was whenever the APO  Army Post Office  brought in some  packages from Sears and Roebuck.  Once a week we got mail from APO   they would send a pouch from the  embassy and we didn   t have to go through the international mail to get  packages or letters, but it was kind of like the government gave us APO  benefit.  So it would be mailed directly to the embassy and then the embassy  would handle the     Ship it.  Like a courier service?  Once a week, and so we would all look forward to that mail once a  week.  Did you travel back to the United States during your tour? How often?  We could sign up for two years, and we   d have to stay there for two  years and then come home, or we could sign up to return after two years.  So we didn   t get to go back to the States but every two years.  So you made then three trips back? Two trips back in 1964     1966 and then 1968.  Okay and 1968 is when you returned for good.  But you did have a special trip back. You brought Brenda back.  I had to come back for medical reasons with Brenda when she was six  years old. She had asthma and she was so bad. We were using a doctor  in Oklahoma City to send us pills and medication, and it wasn   t working  and she just couldn   t survive really. So we had to fly back together, the  two of us, to Oklahoma City and go back to the clinic and get the allergy  doctor to work with us.  13  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Well, on these trips back to the United States for these leaves, how long  was your leave?  Three months.  During the three months, had you already committed to another tour?  So were you looking forward to returning to Ethiopia during those three  months?  Yes, we really were because it was home, and our little boy that was  born there, Scott, was just 14 months old or so when we came back for  our visit and he cried the whole three months because of the heat. He  wasn   t used to hot weather and traveling, and he   d get mosquito bites on  him. When we finally got home, we walked in the door of our Ethiopian  home after three months, and he just started smiling and I said,    See,  he   s home and he   s happy and we   re happy.    We enjoyed our time over  there.  Well, they typically take one month, which would be two weeks  traveling to and about two weeks coming back. That might be an  exaggeration, but for those     No, that   s about right.     and then we   d take about a month in the States, so even though there  was a three-month recess     We traveled.  Yeah, we   d use the one month in the U.S. to travel and catch up on  family reunions, so it was a pretty busy time off, overloading on  catching up with what was going on with family and then also doing the  sightseeing, going to the U.S. and returning back from the U.S.  So you didn   t just travel directly from Ethiopia back to the United  States?  No.  You took this as an opportunity then to visit other countries in the world.  That was our vacation, you know, and oh, Yack   s daddy wanted us to  come home so bad the first time. Yack told him,    We   re gonna take two  weeks and see Greece and we   re gonna take the kids here and there,     and he wrote us,    Son, why don   t you come on home? You know a  rock   s a rock and a tree   s a tree, and if you   ve seen one you   ve seen  14  Peters  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  them all.    (Laughter) So we always quote that. We just say,    A rock   s a  rock and a tree is a tree.     Well, he was a wise man. (Laughter)  He didn   t see much use.  Yeah. We did   we were able to visit quite a few countries that normally  we wouldn   t have. We made one trip and landed in Italy. Was going to  rent a car and whenever I left home, the only driver   s license I had was  written in Amharic and so I left it at home. I got over there and they  said,    You got a driver   s license?    I didn   t have anything. They said,     I   m sorry. We can   t rent you a car without an international license.    So  we took a train. We took a train and went on through France   went on  to Paris   and that   s the only time we got to see France.  Let   s see. What was your diet like when you were in Ethiopia? Did you  have any    American    foods? How were these provided? Or did you rely  on Ethiopian-produced material?  Well, we had a fellow who would slaughter cattle for us, and you took a  suitable animal to him and he   d slaughter it for you and take the  intestines and so forth out and hang it up. I remember one time, just  taking the side of the beef down to the shop where I had a band saw     just put it there and cut it into pieces.  All kind of pieces  (Laughs)  That   s what Genevela had to cook with or had it cooked.  Then we   d slaughter the chickens and freeze them.  And lots of vegetables. The Ethiopians didn   t eat vegetables much. I told  you about eating the bread     Right.     but they didn   t eat     So what vegetables were available for you?  We had a garden. Well you had a garden.  You had a garden?  We grew beans and     15  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Potatoes.  We got a lot of fresh vegetables. We learned about   what was that they  grew on the campus farm? I can   t think of it.  Did you grow any okra?  No.  Too cold. We tried.  I was telling you about the seasons were determined by moisture, not by  temperature, and there just wasn   t any good season for okra to grow.  We had massive castor bean shrubbery, and of course those were just  deadly poison, but we   d grow it on the end of our garden   these ricin  beans  (Laughter) We   d go out there and play with the castor beans, you  know, as kids.  Yeah.  We had a good diet. We really did. And being over there, I had people in  the house helping me with the kitchen and the food preparation and so I  had six years of some help with the children. When Scott was a baby,  the maid would put him on her back with a little shawl and she would  skate around and wax the floors with him on her back. (Laughs) When  we left after five years of having her take care of him, she was waving  goodbye to us at the airport, and he just looked at me and he said,     Mama, we should never have left her there. She should have come with  us   say come back with us.     A lot of the things that I remember about the diet   when we arrived,  there was no fresh milk. We drank powdered milk, and it was a very  poor substitute for milk.  You kids couldn   t get used to it.  It was really not easy to eat cereal with powdered milk and it was just     it was really not good. So we were very pleased when Mick  Milton   Wells came and he started a dairy herd. He brought the calves from  Kenya and they were air freighted and brought onto the campus, and so  we were very excited about these calves growing into cows, and we  were down there watching. Finally they got to a point of production of  milk, and then milk was rationed. The garden boy, Ahmed, would be on  a rotation and we would be allowed to go down   because production  wasn   t big enough to supply all the families   and he would go down  16  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Peters  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  and have these narrow tins and they would dip fresh raw milk and bring  it up and then have the cream on the top, and it was tremendous to us. So  we went from just terrible watery poor white substance called milk into  having the finest milk   I   ve never drank milk since. I mean it was rich  and it was tremendous as that raw milk that they had with the dairy  operation.  It was creamy. We had fresh eggs. We had a good diet.  Another thing that Dad might want to talk about is once a week he  would go and join the men at the cafeteria for what was called the Wat  Club.  I want to hear about some of the Ethiopian food.  Yeah, wat and injera. Wat is the stew that   s made with a very spicy  sauce, and injera is the bread, and that   s where it   s mixed up and then  left to sour overnight, then the next day they   d take it and make  pancakes   it looks like pancakes except it   s just cooked on one side and  then it   s just real foamy on top, and then it   s rolled up and then torn into  pieces and passed out to people to eat. That   s injera, and Jeff mentioned  something about a club where mostly the males of the faculty would  meet once a week at somebody   s house and have wat and injera.  I think you ate the wat and injera at the cafeteria with the students and  then you came to the house for the dessert   the different houses.  Oh, yeah. Okay. I believe that   s right.  So when they would go up to the cafeteria, well Ahmed would go down  and he would bring to our home the wat and injera. So once a week we  looked forward to wat night because we got to enjoy having catered  injera and wat while they were down at the cafeteria.  Did you enjoy the taste from the beginning? Or was it an acquired taste?  I don   t remember not enjoying it.  It was a little bit acquired because we thought we could take the hot and  spicy because we liked Mexican food. But when we got there and ate the  first batch of it, it was so hot we could hardly take it. We finally learned  to enjoy it. (Laughs)  Yeah, we had come over to Ethiopia from New Mexico, and we thought  we were pretty acquainted to hot food, so one of the people when he was  going home soon   Dr.  Leonard F.  Miller was going home for a home  17  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  leave   and they said,    Well, that   s pretty hot now. You sure you like  it?       Oh, yeah.        We can take it.        We can handle that.    It turned out we couldn   t  (Laughter) It was hot.  Extra hot.  My kids today just love Ethiopian food though.  He taught Jackie how to make it.  And they just get tears in their eyes. They want to go to the Blue Nile  Restaurant and eat Ethiopian food.  So you still eat Ethiopian food if you have a chance?  Yes. We love it.  Yeah. It   s good. We enjoy it.  Let   s see. Did you bring back any other Ethiopian customs, besides the  diet, anything else? You still have some language skills   a greeting that  you maintain. Any other customs from Ethiopia that you still celebrate  or any clothing? Did you bring back any traditional clothing?  We brought back some, but we can   t wear it. (Laughter)  How did you record your stay in Ethiopia? Do you have pictures,  diaries, letters?  I have quite a few slides from Ethiopia of people and also of the area  around there. The other day on TV we saw somebody visiting Ethiopia  and we took slides of a certain area   we called it Rock Valley, but it  was a huge rock balanced on top of another, and there   ve been lots of  battles fought in that area, but nobody had ever knocked that rock off.  The rock is still standing.  Because they could take a high powered rifle and knock it off, it looked  like, but it didn   t     Did you keep any letters or did you keep a diary? Anything like that  while you were there?  18  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Peters  J. Moseley  Peters  J. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  No, not really.  You did keep some tapes. I   ve got his   Dad would send back reel-to-reel  tapes, and the technology to play those tapes is anybody   s guess  where you   d find it, but I do have copies of those reel-to-reels and he  would sit down and methodically dictate and talk about what was going  on and then he   d bundle up small boxes like that and send them to his  parents or family members and they could listen and they could send  back. So the surrogate telephones were the tape recordings.  So you still have some of these recordings?  I do. I don   t have a player to play them.  Okay, but if we find a player to play them?  Yeah. Dad had them in a shoebox in the garage so I   ve got them out of  the garage and I keep them inside the house where they   re less likely to  deteriorate.  Let   s see, we   ve talked about some of these things here. How did you  keep in contact with family and friends in the States?  It would be only by mail.  By mail.  And the tapes.  And the tapes, yeah, because there was no phone system hardly. We had  one or two people that made a phone call home and it was because of  death or something serious, you know, that they would phone. It seemed  like the Landry   s  Joe W. Landry  called somebody.  What did it cost?  I don   t know.  How long would it take a letter to come from the States to Ethiopia or  from Ethiopia back to the States? How long did that take?  It was two weeks at least, because the APO was a week or maybe it  would be two weeks. So it took a long time.  That was also the magic about Christmas because typically since you  couldn   t trust the mail, Mom and Dad would do Christmas shopping on  19  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  the summer recess when we were back in the States and they   d find  ways to contemplate what we would need for the Christmas that was  upcoming and find ways to bring those things back without us knowing  about them and keep them in safekeeping. But if you knew that a bicycle  was something that would make sense, well you   d have to find a way to  acquire that far in advance of Christmas because you   d have difficulty  ordering that kind of an object and getting it shipped through the mail  service.  Have you been able to maintain any of the relationships with friends and  acquaintances from Ethiopia?  Yes. I greeted some   a couple awhile ago.  Has it been helpful to have the OES then to maintain those  relationships   the Oklahoma Ethiopian Society?  We never had those.  She   s talking about coming back to Stillwater every other year for  reunions and meetings.  Has that been helpful to you to keep up with folks?  Yes, it has. We have some people in Houston that we have contact with,  but they won   t come up here because they   re true     They   re Eritreans.  They are Eritreans. They are not Ethiopians, they think.  Well, the war changed that because they came to college at Alemaya,  but we didn   t really differentiate between Eritrean students or Alemaya  or Ethiopian students. We just thought they were all Ethiopians, but then  we didn   t realize there was such a gap or chasm there that they didn   t  like each other. The Eritreans thought they were better than the      Kind of like Republican and Democrat?  And so then when they had the war, now the couple that is such good  friends of ours, we saw them not too long ago in Houston. They won   t  come back up here because it   s an Ethiopian get-together and they   re  Eritreans. It   s sad, but we   re still friends.  Good. Dr. Moseley, as you think back now, how do you feel about your  Ethiopian experience? Do you think about it much? Did it have any  20  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  effect?  I look upon it as one of the better points of my life. I really enjoyed  Ethiopia. I liked Ethiopia, and I   m glad that Bill Abbott came down to  interview me down when I was in New Mexico. I really enjoyed  Ethiopia.  Do you think it changed you in any way?  Made me more aware of people in foreign countries   their ways of  doing things and how it could be improved   but that   s about the only  change that I     Do you think you taught more while you were there or learned more  from your experience? Do you see what I   m trying to say? Sometimes we  go overseas and we think we   re going there to share information, but  sometimes we end up bringing more information home than what we  shared. Is that true in your case?  No, I don   t think so. They just knew so little that I think anything I  presented would be new to them.  So what did you learn?  Well, I learned something about the food   that   s good   and I learned  also that there are a lot of people in the world that need help. I know  that. Not only Ethiopians, but other nationalities   they could use some  help.  Have I not asked any questions that I should have? What did you tell me  that I haven   t asked?  Well, he   s looking at a book that Bill Abbott   s      I didn   t intend for that to get over there. This was the orientation book  that     Bill Abbott sent us this and told us what to expect and it gave us   Jeff  had this     I was bringing it in for you to look at, but it was   Dad has the original  of this that he shared with me and I made photocopies of it and brought  one to this conference just because some of the conferees didn   t get this  orientation book.  Is that right?  21  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Yeah, that   s what   I   ve asked around.  Well, maybe they got rid of theirs or forgot about it or something.  I noticed several things in there. It talked about and discussed such as  the country was told whenever I was over there, a large percentage of  the country is actually owned by Haile Selassie, a large percentage of the  country is owned by the church, and then a large percentage of the  country is owned by individuals. And I had the experience, some of the  people were irrigating some land and later on they put them in prison  because they irrigated some of Haile Selassie   s land. I went over to the  prison   their prison was just sort of a corral. They were kept in there  and then they had guards standing there watching out for them, but there  wasn   t any buildings or anything. Good thing it wasn   t raining. I went  over and testified   I actually testified in court concerning this man that  he was just using land that wasn   t doing anybody any good, and he was  putting it to use to raise crops or something, and Haile Selassie wasn   t  doing anything with it, just letting cattle grazing on it, I guess, is all.  What was the result of the trial?  Unknown.  Unknown. (Laughs)  Unknown.  Did they release him eventually or     That I don   t know. I really don   t know. I rode over on that scooter I was  telling you about. I rode it across the hills to the little place called  Ejarsagoro   that   s where Haile Selassie was born   but I really don   t  know.  What do you think is the legacy of the OSU / Ethiopian experience? Is  there a legacy you can identify?  Well, I think the people, for instance that we have in contact, that we  made contact with, I have a few people that I know that came over here,  Ethiopians, and other people from our group from OSU know people  that came over from Ethiopia and live in parts of the country. I think it is  a very strengthened tie of Ethiopia to America   I really do   or America  to Ethiopians, either way.  What did you do after you left Ethiopia? You returned to the States in  1968.  22  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  And worked on my PhD at OSU and finished that up and then I moved  on to   where did I go?  Sam Houston State.  Yeah. Eddie  L.  Dye, a friend of mine that I   d worked with a short time  in Ethiopia, but he had been here in OSU before. Whenever they said he  was coming over, I knew the name and I couldn   t place his face, but  when he and his wife and three children got off the plane in Addis  Ababa, I knew I   d seen him before. He moved. He was head of the  agriculture department at Sam Houston State University, and he got  permission to take a leave of absence and he went to Ethiopia for a year  and a half. When he came home, he contacted me and asked would I like  to join the faculty down there. So I went down there and wound up  retiring down at Sam Houston State.  Sam Houston State. That   s in     Huntsville.  Huntsville, Texas.  About 70 miles north of Houston.  And you still live in Huntsville?  Yeah.  Today, until you retired? Anything else you   d like to add?  I was gonna say something about the water. We boiled every bit of it.  Every bit of water we used for human consumption, it was boiled. In  some cases, when we got some vegetables, we made a special water.  We had to   Clorox and water     What? Clorox?  All of our fresh salad or anything that we didn   t cook, we had to use  Clorox bleach water to clean it and rinse it.  Well, you would boil the water. Would you use anything like iodine or      No, we just boiled it and filtered it. We had a filter   they filtered  through.  23  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Yeah, that   s right. We poured the boiled water into   they were filters  about this big around, I guess, and they stood up about this high      In the kitchen     Poured it in there and filtered through, and that   s the only place in the  world that I   ve ever seen those filters, but I guess that they are used in  Africa and lots of places.  So why were you boiling the water? What was in it that was a problem?  Well, we didn   t know  (Laughter)  Just to be sure.  To be sure. Because it wasn   t treated when it came out of the ground.  That   s right, and we were told that it   s possible that the lake area was  infested with   what   s the disease?  Bilharzia  Schistosomiasis .  Bilharzia, yeah. Bilharzia. Being a bug man, your dad would know that.  Liver problems or something     It   s a snail   one part of the cycle is in a snail.  That   s right, and it can infect human beings.  I suffered from that in Sierra Leone.  Oh, no.  Did you?  Yeah. In some places in West Africa when young men and women are  reaching the age of puberty and begin bleeding because these organisms  attach to the bladder and then there   s blood that comes out and so they  think they arrive as adults, it   s a sign that the organism is growing in  numbers but     My goodness.  Some of the students had it.  24  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Peters  J. Moseley  Peters  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  It was not even proven, but they kind of thought that it was infested, and  so     You couldn   t go swimming in the lake.  Were there amoebas at all?  That   s probably why we boiled our water.  Did the children or you have any diseases while you were there?  I was diagnosed   and probably, I   m guessing misdiagnosed      Misdiagnosed.     with having an eye disease called trachoma, which was a very hard  diagnosis because if untreated it leads to blindness, and the drops that I  was given were very oily and burned, so I was taking these drops. In  hindsight it was probably allergic reactions to some of the things in the  air, but the diagnosis we got out of Addis Ababa was that I had picked  up this interesting exotic eye disease. So I was treated   it was just  horrifying because here I was and mid-high, I guess, thinking that I was  carrying a potential disease that would blind me. Then I was putting  these drops in that were just very, very painful. So I don   t know why I  stopped taking the drops, but after awhile I thought I   d rather be blind, I  guess. (Laughter) I   d learn Braille.  We went to the States and examined him.  You said Brenda had an asthmatic condition?  Yes. As a baby, as a little girl, she got really sick.  Any of the other children or you as adults?  John   I used to take John and Brenda down and give them their shots.  Weekly injection for their allergies. On Wednesday, they knew   they   d  go hide.  We got the stuff from Oklahoma City.  Allergy clinic.  They   d send stuff over, with needles and everything, and I learned to  give them the shots. They   d see me coming and run  (Laughs)  25  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  J. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  Peters  Y. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  Did you tell Dave about testing   showing John and me, Sunday after  church we asked about your shotgun and if it was loaded?  No, he didn   t go to that little story. I think you might turn this off     (Laughter)  I cannot mandate that you answer this question, and we can turn the  recorder off if you choose.  Oh, it   s a great story. You might want to leave the recorder on.  If you   re willing to tell it, we   ll leave it on. It   s up to you.  Well, yes. I had a shotgun in the bedroom     Master bedroom.     and John, being inquisitive, he just said,    Daddy, is this shotgun  loaded?    I said,    Well, I don   t think so, but point it away from  somebody and pull the trigger.     No, you did that, Dad.  You said,    Let   s see           Let   s see.        and you did it. You said,    Let   s see.     Apparently there are several versions of this story. (Laughs)  Anyway, it blew a hole through the ceiling.  And we had Scott, who was not a year old, and he was laying in the bed  asleep, and the shotgun went off and he woke up and he was just  petrified and his hands and feet were just up in the air (laughs) and  everybody went running in the bedroom thinking who got killed   we  were all survivors of that.  Knocked off one of the asbestos tiles off the rail.    Well, let   s just see,  boys.    (Laughter)  I had to get up on the roof and patch the roof.  Can you see Don doing something like that?  26  Peters  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  Y. Moseley  J. Moseley  G. Moseley  J. Moseley  Peters  G. Moseley  Peters  Is there anything else you   d like to share with me now?  Well, and traveling. The youngster   Jeff was   how old was he when  we went over?  I was starting third grade.  He started third grade.  Jeff was   in the airplane, he   d just find somebody that had an empty  seat and he would sit down and entertain them, you know, talk to them  and so forth   and so that was     We   ll be editing the transcript. (Laughter)  Oh, I think that   s enough.  That   s a wrap.  All right. Well thank you Dr. Moseley, Mrs. Moseley, and Jeff. I   m not  sure if we did this officially or not, but I appreciate the time and I  enjoyed it, and we   ll get back to you with the transcript later.  All right.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
