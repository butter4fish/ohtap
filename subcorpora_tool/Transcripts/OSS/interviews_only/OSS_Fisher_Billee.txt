 Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Today is Monday, October 29, 2007. I   m in Stillwater, Oklahoma  interviewing Billee Fisher. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the  Oklahoma State University Library and this recording is being  conducted as part of O-STATE Stories, an oral history project of the  OSU Library. Thank you for joining us today.  Well, I tell you what. I want to tell you how old I am.  Please.  You know what, I   m proud to be this old. I was born August 31, 1915 so  that was a while back.  That is a while back.  It wasn   t yesterday, it was the day before.  Have you always lived in Stillwater?  No, no. After we were married. My husband was the construction  engineer on the Tulsa Airport because the airport at that time in Tulsa  was about like Stillwater   s is now. And can I tell you something that not  many people know about   but anyway. He was a civil engineer, I know  that much. I   m the only girl he ever dated. He was with the United States  Department of Professional Engineers and we were sent to Tulsa. They  needed a bigger airport in Tulsa. So we were over there and it had been  worked on probably three months. He got new specifications in. That  hardly ever happens after things are going along in construction so far  and then get changed. But they lengthened that runway a long ways,  widened it, made it thicker with more concrete and more rebar   that   s  the metal things in it   and he couldn   t understand that.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  They were just almost finished with it, just oh I think within maybe two  or three weeks, and Pearl Harbor happened. He always felt that someone  higher up in the nation knew that something terrible was going to  happen to the United States of America and they needed bigger, stronger  airports in the middle part of the United States, because there was none.  Dallas wasn   t even a big one then. But, you know, that could be a little  bit of history that not everybody knows about. And it could be that the  higher ups knew that we better have a bigger, stronger airport in this  part. He  husband  was a designer and made sure they did it all exactly  right. He did that way with all his work.  He was in the university architects    office as their construction engineer  for about twenty-two years   something like that. He was in charge of  building the Student Union. I can tell some stories on that. (Laughs) And  the Library. I can tell some stories on that. Also, that big high dormitory,  oh I forgot the name of it, the north dormitory. But anyway, he just did a  wonderful job. He was perfect in his work. But he gave up on me before  we were married. He never tried to correct me but he should have. But  he was a wonderful   good looking too. I   ve got his picture around here.  Oh it   s in there by my bed. Oh, he was a good looking guy.  Tell me about the Student Union.  About the Student Union? Okay. Well, did you know that the highway  from Ponca City came right down Washington Street? Came right to  where the campus is now, to Sixth Street. It went east on Sixth Street to  Main Street, south on Main Street to 14th Street, quite a ways down, and  Main Street south of 14th - I can remember there was a big old house  right out there where the street is now. And there were several houses in  that area that had to be bought and demolished. But that highway then  down 14th east of Perkins Road, south on Perkins Road to Perkins. And I  can tell you how Perkins got its name. Back in the run of the 1889, there  was a senator and his last name was Perkins. I don   t know what his first  name was, I did at one time but anyway. So they named that little town  Perkins after the senator that helped get this part of Oklahoma open for  settlement and the land runs. And both sets of my grandparents were in  the land runs.  Wow.  Yes, and they would tell me stories about it and I can remember a lot of  them, a lot of those stories. They were wonderful grandparents. I had  wonderful, wonderful parents. My daddy was in the Payne County  Sheriff   s office a long time. And, (Laughs) I guess I   ll tell it   yeah. It  was a long time ago. That was during the days of prohibition when  whiskey could not be made or sold. He  Billee   s father  was in the  6  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  sheriff   s office, you see. They   re in that building that   s there now. And  his office was on the very ground floor, the very northeast corner of that  building. Anyway, somebody must have told him something and I was  in about second or third grade. Anyway, I went to school at Jefferson  School, which would be between the 3rd and 4th Street, east and west, on  the east side of North Main Street. And that was a grade school called  Jefferson. And I was never a very tall person. I always got to sit in the  front seat, but maybe it was because they could watch me better, I don   t  know. (Laughter) But, I always got to answer the telephone when it rang  because the principal   s office was right next door and I could hear the  phone. And that was a fun thing for a kid that age to get up and answer  the phone when it rang.  What happened in prohibition? You were about to tell me something.  Well, see my grandparents homesteaded on 160 acres of land on the  east-west Mehan Road. And it   d be two miles east of Perkins Road on  the north side. And my daddy bought out his brother and sisters   bought  out their interests in that as they inherited it and then he bought the other  160 acres. So he owned that mile through there on the north side of  Mehan Road. Evidently somebody knew he owned it because he came  and got me out of class. I was in the fifth grade or something like that,  and he said,    Babe, you want to go out with me?    And I said,    Oh  yeah.    And I went out there with him and he had a great big ax. Have  you ever seen a picture of a whiskey still?  No.  Well, they had great big round barrels, oh about this big around  Billee  motions  and they had corn and other stuff over here in something else  and they had a kind of pipe that went around like this around in circles  and then down on in and that was the distilling part and it would go into  this big thing over here, as whiskey. And he took that great big ax out  there and he said,    Watch me now.    And I remember it like it happened  today. And he took that big ax and went boom, boom, boom and broke  up all   and that whiskey just ran out all over the ground into the trees.  There were a lot of trees around it. And I think somebody knew that he  owned that. Reason they thought, well they would put their still there  and it wouldn   t be found   in the sheriff   s office, whoa. (Laughter) And  it was found and he broke it up. I can visualize it right now. Oh what  that was about 85 years ago, or 86. But I remember it.  Wow. Well you told me  on the phone  a great story      (Laughs) Okay, well when my husband, my Bill, came back after he got  his degree here, we were away quite a while and he had a chance to  7  Nykolaiszyn  come back here and be in the university architect   s office. And we  bought a house in Perkins because my parents had moved from Duck  Street to Perkins to be near my grandmother so they could take care of  her, just a block away from her. And so when we came back, we bought  a house in Perkins, too. And my husband commuted up here to campus.  We bought a house just (Laughs) a block from where my grandmother  had retired in Perkins. I know a lot of Perkins history too. (Laughs)  Anyway, it was kind of an interesting place but they bought that, a  fourth of a block through there, the northeast quarter of that block. A lot  of it   s been sold off but my grandmother then lived on the block on the  east. And see, people didn   t have indoor bathrooms then, so she had an  arbor leading from her backdoor, close to the backdoor, almost half a  door back and the outdoor toilet was out there. She had bricks put down  for a sidewalk underneath that arbor like this you see? And I remember  when I was a little kid when we   d go down there, and we had an indoor  bathroom in Stillwater, but she didn   t have the facilities for that in  Perkins. I can remember, I   d run down on those bricks down there and  I   d run and grab them   I liked the green grapes and I liked the purple  ones too. And we always called her our    grape grandma    (Laughs)  because she had grapes. She had great big beautiful rose bush near her  front door and that rose bush had come   and the lilacs too, she had  lilacs. I   ve got some out here. And that lilac stalk came from England in  1812 and has been in the family first in Connecticut and then in Kansas  and then in the land runs into Oklahoma and they planted them out here  over here where my grandparent   s homesteaded. And so then I got some  of that, and it is right here.  Oh, I volunteered for many years down at the museum too, the Sheerar  Center. And (Laughs) I   ve took some down there and told them and  that   s all typed out in the little sign where it came from and when. That  lilac stalk   and my grandmother had these climbing red roses there on  her front porch. I   d go down there and visit her, she was fun. I   d break  off one of those big old long thorns and put it on my nose and act like I  was a rhinoceros.  And that grandmother saw Abraham Lincoln. After he was assassinated,  you know, his body was put on this big train and brought back to Illinois  where he was buried. But anyway, her parents, they lived in Illinois and  they took her down there to the railroad station because it stopped at  every one. And they lifted her up, she said, so she could see the corpse  of Abraham Lincoln. She said that was one of the highlights of her life.  Real history, you see.  What   s one of the highlights of your life?  8  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Oh, I guess meeting that Fisher guy. Well, he put up with me for sixty-one  years. (Laughter) And he never did go with girls, because they   his  older brother was crazy about all of them and that just made him the  opposite way. Can I tell you how we did finally meet?  Sure, please.  Alright. My older sister had a farm out on east-west Mehan Road and  north about a quarter of a mile. And they had great big pecan trees there  and our Methodist youth fellowship would go out there in the fall and  pick up big sacks like this  Billee motions  full of pecans. Our church  would send them to an orphanage in Ohio and that was good because  they didn   t have the pecans in Ohio. And so my Bill thought, Wilbert  was his name but everybody called him Bill. See he   s Bill and I   m Billee  and our son is Bill. (Laughs) But he thought that was a good thing, so he  went out there with us that time. There was probably eighteen or twenty  kids, young people. And we went out in the back of the big cattle truck.  The only time I ever rode in a cattle truck. But it held all of us, you see,  and had great big thing around the sides so we couldn   t fall off. We went  out there with my sisters and we took a picnic supper with us and we  picked up pecans and we ate out there and had picnic and that Bill Fisher  climbed a tree, a big old pecan tree to shake down more pecans cause we  got them all picked up that was on the ground. And he saw me down on  the ground and he started throwing pecans at me. He hit me several  times. I looked up there,    Hey you crazy guy, what are you hitting me  for?    And I thought,    Hey he   s kind of cute.    (Laughter)  And the rest is history.  When we got back in that cattle truck, we   d picked up, oh I forgot how  many big sacks full of pecans but the church did send them up there. But  when we got back in the truck, he got back in the truck next to me and  sat by me on the way back in. And then, see that probably would have  been in September and then we had a big Christmas party at our church,  in the basement of our church. And do you know about our Methodist  churches here in Stillwater?  No, ma   am.  Well let me tell you this real quick. See you know where the Methodist  church is there on Sixth and Seventh?  Yes.  Well that was the North Methodist Church because they had dealings  with the Union. And the South Methodist Church was across the street  9  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  on Sixth at the northeast corner of the courthouse square. And it was a  beautiful church building, big tall paths in front and everything. But that  was the South Methodist, but our church was the United Brethren  Methodist Church because our church people didn   t have strong feelings  either way because we were united now in our country. We were united.  So we were United Methodist Church   United Brethren. And that   s  where we all went, my folks went and where my husband   s folks went.  They were both in the same Sunday school class, my parents and his  parents.  Now how soon after the Christmas party did you   ?  Evidently he was talking about it to somebody and I was still in high  school. I was just standing over here in a certain place and guys kept  coming over and looking at me. Pretty soon they had a hold of that Bill  Fisher, one on each side, and they drug him over there. And they said,     Go ahead.    And he said,    No.    They said,    Go ahead. We say go  ahead, you better.    And I said,    Well what had he better do?    And they  looked up above and there was another college student behind me  holding a big sprig of mistletoe. (Laughter) That   s how we keep one up  there now. See it?  In the living room, there is a sprig of mistletoe  hanging from the ceiling   Oh wow.  (Laughing) Well that one   s artificial, but it was a real one. And they  said,    Go ahead.    And they made him kiss me. That was the only time  he was made to kiss me.  Now, did he attend Oklahoma State? Oklahoma A M?  Oh yes, oh yes.  What years did he attend?  But my parents first sent me to school in Missouri to get away from that  Fisher boy.  Oh yeah? It didn   t work, did it?  No, it didn   t work and they were glad it didn   t.  Where did you go to school in Missouri?  Drury. And I did   well, they   d be some handsome men come by and get  me and take me to class. But I wouldn   t date any of them because I kind  10  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  of liked that Fisher boy back in Stillwater, Oklahoma.  And was he going to college then?  Uh-huh.  And what was he studying?  Civil engineering.  Okay, okay.  And then they let me come back home. Every time I eat a cantaloupe I  think about it because we did   elope. (Laughter)  Well, I never heard that but it makes sense. (Laughs)  He borrowed his uncle   s car because kids didn   t have cars then. We  knew if we would ask, our parents would say no. And they would, they  thought we were so young.  Right.  So he borrowed his uncle   s car and we didn   t want to get married here in  Stillwater because it would be in the paper. So he drove down to  Chandler and we had a look around for a church. But he thought,    Well,  we got to get a license.    We didn   t think about that even. And that     where to get that license was up on the third floor of the courthouse in  Chandler. And my feet wouldn   t take me up there. So he went up and he  got the marriage license for both of us. Then he got back in his uncle   s  car and drove around looking for a Methodist Church and went next  door thinking   that   s where pastors used to live is next door to the  church. They don   t do that anymore but that   s the way it used to be. And  so we went next door and sure enough that was the pastor. We told him  we wanted to be married. He goes,    Well, where   s your witnesses?    We  didn   t know we had to have witnesses. And I   ve got a copy of that  marriage license up there in the hallway. I   ve got a lot of pictures in  there. So he got the witnesses. We found the church over there and they  married us. And I think they knew it was right because we were very  happily married for sixty-one years before he passed away.  What year did you get married?  Oh boy, 1934.  And how old were you and how old was he?  11  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Well girls had to be eighteen and boys had to be twenty-one. And he   d  been twenty-one for two weeks. But we knew it was right, and it was.  And what did you do after you got married? Did you go to school?  Yes, interior design was my major. And his major was engineering     civil engineering. We stayed out a year to save some money. He had  wonderful parents and so did I. They had a big house on the corner of 3rd  and Husband. And that big house is still there. There were six bedrooms  on the second floor, two bedrooms down. But they had a big family.  They had seven children and two grandmothers and an uncle living with  them. (Laughs) And that   s where they lived. Then when we married, we  were out of school a year and he worked as an engineer doing a  seismograph. Do you know what that is?  No.  Well, see they   d dig a hole and drop dynamite down in it and they would  measure so far out from that dynamite hole and put instruments all  along. And it would set off that dynamite down there and that would  record how long it would take the shakes to get out there to each one of  those instruments. That   s what that is.  Now, who was the Dean of the School of Home Economics?  Okay, I got to tell you. Her name was Nora Talbot. And, you see,  Washington Street was a highway then. I don   t know what the building  is now but it was on the east side of the highway. Nora Talbot was very  tall and a lot of big white hair like this  Billee motions , you know. Oh,  such dignity. Her students didn   t have much dignity. But anyway, one  time in class somebody came running in there to tell her something. And  she turned around and said,    Goodbye.    And ran  We couldn   t imagine  her doing that. But you know how kids are, I followed her. She went  downstairs, and on the first floor was a nursery for people who had to  bring their children, their little ones up there   preschool. She was down  there on her hands and knees with a lot of paper towels and one of those  little kids had gone to the toilet on the floor down there and she was  down there mopping it up with paper towels.  Wow.  She lost her dignity to us then. (Laughs) Oh that   s something I   ll never  forget.  What else do you remember about studying in the School of Home  Economics?  12  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Well, I remember an awful lot because we just had everything that we  needed. We had all kinds of refrigerators, all kinds. And we had to learn  how to put the big pan under the one that had ice in it that would melt  and run down into that big pan, under the refrigerator. And it looked like  a beautiful piece of furniture. It was wood, big   probably, might have  been walnut. Reminds me of the one my folks had. And we   d forget to  empty that and so my daddy, he was a smart cookie. He drilled a hole,  put it on the outside wall, and drilled a hole through the wall and put a  piece of garden hose on it. And then my momma planted flowers out  there, so as the ice would melt down, it would go through that hose and  water those flowers out there.  You didn   t have that luxury on campus though?  No. (Laughs). Well, how Stillwater got its name. Did I tell you that  ever?  You did not.  This is one of the stories and I think it   s true because following the Civil  War, the big cattlemen were in Texas and to make any money they had  to sell those cattle. And they had the cattle runs, you   ve heard of that?  Well see they were almost up I-35, this side of I-35, not very far. They  had thousands of head of cattle. The cowboys would drive north to the  end of the railroad in Kansas and that   s the only way they could get  them to market to make any money. So the cattle and the drover, the  head cowboy   D-R-O-V-E-R. But anyway, as they   d cross the  Cimarron River down there in dry, hot weather they needed a lot of  water. They could not drink that water in the Cimarron River because  it   s salty. It runs through the salt plains out in western Oklahoma and  they couldn   t drink it and they   d be thirsty in hot weather. So they   d get  across the Cimarron River, just barely across   and the drovers would  say,    All right, let   s start pulling a little east right here because there   s  still water there.    And they   d point. And there was not a town here then  but there was still water here where there wasn   t water anywhere else.  And that   s because Stillwater Creek is fed with springs. It didn   t depend  on rain at all. There   d still be water here where there wasn   t anywhere  else. And they   d say,    Let   s go a little east, there   s still water over  there.    So that   s how Stillwater got its    name. It might be true. It sounds  reasonable.  Oh (Laughs) I   ll tell you something. Of course, towns were always by  the railroad track.  Right.  13  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  And I remember my daddy saying when they built Old Central, which  was the first higher education building in the state of Oklahoma. People  would say,    What in the world did they build that college building way  out there in the country for?    And it would have been in the country  then.  There was a creek over there by Perkins Road. And where Perkins Road,  there   s a bridge not far from the depot and I wish somebody would  check this out for me because one of my friends, she lived about half a  block from me, we were about the same age. And her daddy worked in a  mill there   a flour mill. People would bring their wheat and even their  corn, and make corn meal, to that mill. And they would grind it all down  and pass, hook it up in something I guess   seemed like it was a cloth  sack, I think it was. But anyway, I wish somebody would check that out  because why would they build that mill on a creek bank if it was not a  big water wheel that turned the machinery in that mill? It sounds  reasonable that it had been a water wheel mill there. And somebody  ought to find out for me because I   m curious. (Laughs) But I think it  must have been. And my daddy said when he was a kid, he said there  was that creek that runs through there, still does, and he said they   d go  down there and they would jump in that creek because there was great  big catfish about that long  Billee motions  that lived in that creek. And  they   d dive in and get those catfish and drag them out. And what did he  call that?  Noodling  Anyway, they   d put it on some kind of a stringer  and take them home. Now that had a special name of diving in and  getting fish. Can   t think what it is.  Somebody just told that to me the other day and I forgot what it was.  Well that   s what my daddy did in that creek there on Perkins Road.  Now what did your dad do?  Well, he was a sheriff     A sheriff.     for years. And I told you, didn   t I, about going up there and sliding  down the banisters?  No, you did not.  Oh (Laughs) well I went to Jefferson School, I told you where that was.  And so I would go back over to the courthouse, it wasn   t very far, so that  I could go play around in the courthouse till my daddy   I could get a  ride home with my daddy. I loved my daddy. He was a wonderful man.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  (Laughs) I would slide down those banisters. Do you know what the  courthouse looks like inside?  No.  It   s all marble inside and they had steps about this high  Billee motions   going up to the second and third floor. And the banisters were about that  wide and it was all marble inside. So I would go there and slide down  those marble banisters and play around in that courthouse till my daddy  could leave his office and we   d go home. About two years or so ago, my  granddaughter was visiting me and I was telling her about it and she  said,    Granny Babe, let   s do it     And we did.  No you did not?  I did. (Laughter)  Wow.  And she did too. (Laughter)  Keeping the tradition alive.  I   d probably do it again if I was ever there because that was so fun. See  they were so slick and they were wide so I couldn   t fall off. And they  were slick and do-woo-woo. (Laughs)  Tell me what else you remember about the campus.  Oh, the campus?  The campus, since your husband was so instrumental in helping some of  those buildings being built.  Do you know where Theta Pond is?  Yes.  Do you know why it   s Theta Pond?  No.  Because the Theta fraternity was across the street south on College  Ave   well it   s University Avenue, it used to be College Avenue. See  that was a highway down Washington Street, right through campus was  a highway. And it was a custom then, when newlyweds got married,  15  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  they   d have a shivaree. Have you heard that word?  No.  They   d go to their apartment, all their friends would, and make a lot of  noise and sing and yell and scream and go around their apartment. And  then the newlyweds would have to come out and then the guys would  kiss the new bride and (Laughs) and the girls would   anyway, that was  a chivaree and it made a lot of noise. So that   s what they had a chivaree  for. Then the custom was to take them down to Theta Pond on campus  and throw the groom in the water. And that year was a very dry year. We  had about, in Theta Pond, about that much water. No, about that much  mud and about that much water  Billee motions .  Wow.  Because it was a very dry year. That was back when   well, you   ve  heard about those years? That was that kind of year. And they threw Bill  in and they said,    All right Babe, go get him out.    And I said,    Okay.     And I went in and I got all covered with mud and they ran off and left us  there. He was wet all over and muddy and I was pretty much that way  too. Then there was a young woman that liked his older brother pretty  well and she had a car and we were about   oh, probably we weren   t  over at Old Central yet anyway, but almost south of it. And she came  back and got us and we got in her car and got it all muddy and dirty.  (Laughs) And there used to be great, big white swans on Theta Pond and  I haven   t been by there in quite a while. I don   t know if they   re still  there or not.  There are ducks.  Oh, they looked so beautiful floating around on Theta Pond, yes. And  then they had a big shower for us and some people brought dishes  because they knew what we had done, you know. We had eloped, cause  we could.  Right. Cantaloupe.  (Laughs) So we had a very big shower and then they had another shower  for us of canned goods. And our friends took all the labels off those  canned goods, can you imagine that? (Laughter)  It   s always a surprise.  So a lot of times for a meal we   d have pork and beans and pork and  beans. (Laughs)  16  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Now I heard you saw Frank Eaton who became Pistol Pete.  Oh yeah.  Yeah. What did he do in the Student Union?  With the students?  Yes, what did he do?  Well, you see with three sons I was Cub Scout den mother five times  and some of my little Cub Scouts are still around and they call on me  and keep up with me. I think that   s nice. One of them is a banker  downtown now and I   ve known him since he was about seven or eight  years old. But anyway, it was a fun thing for me to be a Cub Scout den  mother.  How many kids do you have?  Three sons.  And how many grandchildren?  Three.  And how many of your sons went to Oklahoma State?  Three.  Three. All three went? Wow.  (Laughs) Well see their daddy had an office there when they were in  school. Yeah, we came in threes.  Tell me about Pistol Pete.  Oh, well you see I told you about being Cub Scout den mother. Have  you ever been to Perkins? He has a museum where he lived. Have you  ever been there?  I have not.  It   s an interesting place because it was left like it was when he lived  there. And see, I   ve been back down there two or three times and it was  just like it was when I   d take my little Cub Scouts over there and he   d  tell them stories, and those   boy, probably the late    50   s and early    60   s  17  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  now, they remember a lot of those stories that Pistol Pete would tell  them. He   d try to teach them to rope. Well, I don   t think any of them  ever learned how to rope. But they still remember some of his stories  and that was when Pistol Pete was up in French Lounge  in the OSU  Student Union . I told you about that.  Tell me again.  (Laughs) Well the French Lounge is up on the second or third floor,  according to what you count floors in that and my husband was the  construction engineer on the building. But anyway, the real Pistol Pete  was up there one day and must have been in his nineties. It was about  14, 15, 16 students up there with him. One of them said,    Well, Pistol  Pete we heard you   re quick on the draw. Are you still quick on the  draw?    And he said,    I   ll say.    And he pulled that gun out and it went  off. I mean those kids were out of there like that. And it made a hole in  the base board of the French Lounge in the Student Union. So I look  every time I go in there, I look in the baseboards but I haven   t moved  any furniture yet to see if it   s still there. But it didn   t even make the  newspaper because that was Pistol Pete. But it   s worth a trip to Perkins  to see his museum. It really is because he had a very official position     he was a United States, what?  Marshal?  Marshal? Well, he was a Marshal but I think it was called something  longer than that. I ought to remember but I don   t. Anyway, we knew that  guy. He was one of a kind.  What do you remember about the library?  (Laughs) The OSU Library?  Yes.  Well my husband was a construction engineer on that. And you probably  remember in history reading that people had to find water on the runs of     89. They had to have water first and they didn   t have time to dig a well  a lot of times so they   d build their cabins by a creek or a spring. And  then there were some people that said they could find water by dousing.  Have you ever heard that word?  No.  I don   t know how to spell it but I   m guessing D-O-U-S-I-N-G. But  they   d walk along with a piece, an elm branch and when they got over  18  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  water, it would dip down, they said. And that   s where they   d dig. They  probably didn   t need that but that   s what they thought and said. And so,  when my Bill was doing some surveying to build the library on  campus   see now, that used to be a highway up on Washington. And he  thought, he looked around here and said,    Well now, there ought to be  some water lines through here somewhere.    And he said,    There ought  to be through here or here to get water to this building or that building.     You know, so you   d know where to find that so he wouldn   t dig down  and break a water line. And there was a student there who was helping,  he was a student engineer. And he said,    Oh, my grandfather used to  douse for water.    And my husband goes,    Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.    You  know? (Laughs) And he said,    They did.    And there weren   t trees  around there then like there is now, either. And he said,    I know what,  I   ve got a coat hanger out in my car. I will go get my coat hanger and I   ll  douse for water with that coat hanger.    And my husband goes,    Oh  yeah, yeah, yeah.    You know, he was an engineer. So that student was  walking along there   closed off, it wasn   t Washington Street anymore,  the street was closed off. And that thing dipped down, that coat hanger  dipped down. And my Bill said,    All right, dig there.    They did and they  found water.  Wow.  (Laughs) He said,    Well that   s not because that coat hanger moved  down.    And it probably wasn   t because that   s about where it should be.  Now you told me a story on the phone about not being able to wear  pants in the library. Tell me that story.  (Laughs) Well, in the early    60   s, dresses got very, very, very short. I  mean very short. And that   s when so many young women started  wearing slacks. But my daddy didn   t ever want me to wear overalls or  anything like that. He said,    I want my little girl to look like a little girl.     So I   ve never worn them, except once in a while. This time I was going  into the library to look up something about real estate or land or  something like that. And there was a student there at the door, at the  south door. He said,    Sorry you can   t go in.    I said,    Why?    He said,     You   ve got on trousers and we don   t allow women wearing trousers in  the library.    I said,    Oh, you   re kidding.       No, you cannot go in.    So I  said,    All right.    I turned around, went around back to my car and rolled  up those trousers, put my coat back on, walked back around and he  couldn   t see them and he didn   t dare say anything. And I walked right in  the library and found out what I needed to find out. (Laughs)  Now you   re the first woman realtor in Stillwater.  19  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Yes.  How did you go into that type of business?  Well, because my major in high school and college was interior design  and that kind of falls into real estate. Now I   ve always been interested in  land and property, I   ve always been. So I thought, well you had to take a  very hard examination. I guess you still do, I don   t know. We did that,  had to go to Tulsa to take it. And I passed it the first time. And this  fellow I was with said,    Well, a lot of people fail it a time or two.    But it  was so reasonable, all the questions were, it was easy to pass. They were  all so good to me and some of them still take me out for lunch   those  old-timers. (Laughs) I don   t know the new ones. But we were all friends  and we are still all friends. And that way we serve the public better by  being friends. We really did.  And who did you work for right after you passed the test?  Lloyd Doherty and he was wonderful, twelve years younger than I and  we just got to be family. He and his wife, he has a beautiful wife and he  was a handsome young man. Twelve years younger than I, but anyway  he had a wonderful family. We were a top agency because he knew all  about making loans and making out all that legal paper stuff. You see, I  didn   t have to do any of that. All I did was show the house and talk to  the people. I got half the commission and he paid all the expenses in my  office. I had a private office and everything, you see and everything,  private phone. And he paid all that out of his half. You see, that was  pretty good for me.  Do you think you had an advantage being a woman in the market?  I don   t know, I never thought of it. But I talked to the people first and  found out what their needs in a home would be. I would show them  houses that filled their needs and that   s about the only thing I ever went  by is to fill their needs. And I hardly ever had to show very many houses  because if I filled their needs with what they wanted and what they  liked, why that was it. It was that easy. And it was. It was easy.  And how long did you do that, how many years in real estate?  Eighteen, I guess. And you know what? I sold a woman named Fisher a  house when she came to town and she found out I was having so much  fun, she studied up and she finally passed. And not long ago, she said,     You know what, I still make money off your name because people  think they   re calling you instead of me.    I said,    Oh good you want to  share a little commission?    But they were ready to move away again and  20  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  they thought Fisher, but it was another Fisher. (Laughs) But it was a fun  thing to do. It really was. It was fun, I enjoyed it. We were a top agency.  Now did your husband spend his entire career working at the university  architect   s office or did he leave after that?  He retired.  Okay, but he did retire from the university?  Uh-huh. And he retired   took an early retirement because we had  bought a lot of property in Arkansas. And we had a house over there on  Beaver Lake. Have you ever been over there?  No.  Oh, so beautiful  We bought a house on the lake and we   re about as far  from the water as from here just on the other side of that hedge out in  our backyard. We had three boats in our backyard. We had a hard life     we only had three. (Laughter) We had a rowboat that we could fish out  of up close. And then we had a speed boat that we would ski behind.  Wow.  You know, one of those stream line things. And we had a pontoon boat.  And that was my favorite because we could have six or eight chairs     lawn chairs on that pontoon boat. And we   d have parties on that pontoon  boat. In fact, I got a letter not long ago from some friends and they were  reminding me of that.  Tell me about the story behind Duck Street.  Oh  (Laughs) Yeah, because the people that lived next door, her name  was Kenworthy and she was one of my teachers in the fourth grade. Her  name had been Duck and when her parents got old, why the  Kenworthy   s brought Grandpa and Grandma Duck to live with them  because they had a nice little house. And then they would try to tell me  stories too, the Duck   s. I lived on Duck Street, and the street was named  for her Grandpa and Grandma Duck. One time I got a letter from a boy  that I   d met down at OU at an art contest. And I got a letter addressed to  Ms. Babe Williams, 212 Goose Street. (Laughs) And it was delivered to  Duck Street. Wouldn   t have been now.  So what about Georgia Street?  Well you see a man named Paul Swim owned this farm right here. And  21  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  that   s why it   s Swim Avenue up there. And there   s Georgia down here  to the south. And Mrs. Swim   s name was Georgia Swim and so when he  developed this area, he named the street Georgia for his wife. And then  Swim up there. He borrowed my husband   s surveying crew to lay his  farm out into lots and blocks. He didn   t work on Saturday or Sunday so  Mr. Swim used it on Saturday and Sunday to lay his farm out into blocks  and streets and things. But then one of our dearest friends named  Vassar   they had a big place in Perkins that makes farm implements.  It   s a big area. And Jack is still my friend. His wife was killed by a  drunk driver right out south of Stillwater. Well she wasn   t killed but she  lived about eighteen or twenty years as nothing, but she was breathing.  And she had been an airline hostess before she and Jack were married.  She was beautiful, wonderful. We were neighbors down there in Perkins  when we lived in Perkins. Oh, I just feel like fighting when I think of a  drunk driver. I would, I think, if I was next to him, I would woo-woo-woo-  woo. But that   s how these streets got their name.  And this Mr. Swim had named this street, because we saw the plat     that   s a map, P-L-A-T. And he had this street named Broadway. My Bill  brought me up here, and had little yellow flags around showing where  they had been surveying from here to here to here to here. And he  showed me this lot. And he said,    Do you think that   s a good one to  build on?    I said,    Well honey, if you think so, I do.    Because it   s small  in front and big at the back. Ninety across the front and 157, I think  across the back. And that   s where our kids loved to play and our Cub  Scouts and all that. But anyway, when he got the plat and saw that this  street was named Broadway, he called Mr. Swim and he said,    I found  out, I want to buy that lot.    We bought the first lot out here.    I want to  buy that lot but you   ve got that street named Broadway. Well, we   re just  not the Broadway type.    (Laughs) And we   re not. But he said,    Well, all  right. What do you want to name it?    And my Bill said,    Well, name it  Crescent Drive. It makes a curve, a crescent to the north.    So he erased it  on their plat down at City Hall and lettered in Crescent Drive. So when  we got ready to build he said,    Well what   s that number out there?     Nobody knew so he called down to City Hall again and said,    Well what  number would this be out here?    He told them where it was. They said,     Oh well, choose any number you want in the 1700 block.    He said,     Well, all right, I choose 1717 because our oldest son was 17 years old.     So he chose 1717 and that   s how he named the street and got the house  number.  That   s pretty interesting. Not many people can say that. Was it the same  Swim   s that owned the Swim   s Store by campus?  They were, I think that was his son. One of his sons was Swim, named  Swim too, but I forgot what his first name was. It will come to me when  22  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  I   m not thinking about it because I knew him. But I know a lot of  Stillwater history.  What else can you tell me about Stillwater?  Well, I remember down on south Main, people used to drive horse and  buggies and wagons and buggies and there was a great big red barn. It  would be in the ten hundred block on Main on the West side. It was a  great big red barn and people would drive their horses and buggies into  town and they   d park them there and tie their horses up in the barn.  (Laughs) And that was there till   it might have been torn down about  the time I was married, or maybe right after. And should have been  saved as part of Stillwater history.  There was a big house on Lowry. Do you know where Lowry Street is?  Well it would be Main Street, then Lewis Street, then Lowry and then  down to the depot down there. Well there was a man named Lowry that  gave some land to the city and so they named the street Lowry Street     L-O-W-R-Y. And he had a great big beautiful house. He was a friend of  my parents and that house should have been saved as part of our history  because it was close to the railroad track and that   s where people used to  want to be. Not anymore, but they used to. But that Lowry, Chester  Lowry   that   s why Chester Street is named Chester and Lowry Street is  named Lowry. It was for Chester Lowry. And they were friends of my  mother and dad and I   ve been in that big, beautiful home they had and it  should have been saved. But it seemed like at that time long ago, it was  about tearing down, tearing down. But that   s part of Stillwater history.  So you know how Chester and Lowry and Duck were named. (Laughs)  And going to high school there where our library is and we used to have  concerts at a park right south of it. We used to have concerts there, once  or twice a week. My parents would take me to that concert outside. And  they had a big concrete bandstand, they used to call them, made of  concrete. It was about as far as from the front door to the back door and  round and concrete seats all the way around and the back of it was  concrete. And the back of it, like this, that was all concrete about that  wide. When I was a little kid, I would get up on that and run around on  the back of that concrete. I wouldn   t do it now but I did then. And then  they had great big   like a divan made of concrete. This big circle here,  here, three of them. And they should have been saved too because that  was part of Stillwater history. I think that bandstand and those seats  should have been saved. My parents used to take me to the Opera House.  Oh really?  Yes. Did you know we had an Opera House?  23  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  I did not.  My folks used to take me to the opera. I had wonderful parents to put up  with me like they did. But one time my daddy talked cross to me, should  I tell you about that?  That   s up to you. (Laughs) I   m going to have you tell me about the  Opera House though.  About the opera, well it is where the antique mall is now. Do you know  where that is? On east 9th on the north side and oh it was a beautiful  building, inside and out. And they had the balconies around the top, just  like we see on movies and TV. And that should have been saved.  Instead, all of that was torn out and there was a furniture store there for a  while, I don   t know what   s there now. Antique mall, I guess   just a lot  of stuff.  What about movie theaters?  Oh, we had the Leachman in the 600 block on the east side toward the  south end. And we had the Mecca, which means    everybody come.     And that was on the east side, right north of 8th. Oh, about that far north  of 8th. And the Mecca and the Leachman and oh, there was another one.  What was its name? I can   t remember. But I   d go see Hoot Gibson, Tom  Mix (Laughs) and it cost a dime to go to the movies. But you know back  in those days, a lot of people didn   t have a dime for their children to go  to the movies. Isn   t that pitiful to think of that? But I told you, though,  about Mr. Nichols calling and asking what groceries to bring?  No.  Oh, I didn   t?  No.  Well Mr. Nichols   s store was right north of 10th on the eastside. And his  name was Nichols and it was N-I-C-H-O-L-S. He called my mother  every morning and said,    Mrs. Williams, is there anything you want on  the morning delivery?    And if there was, she would tell him, and he  would have it delivered. Things cost practically nothing. A lot of things  didn   t cost a nickel in Mr. Nichols   s store. And he would call in the  afternoon,    Mrs. Williams, is there anything you want on the afternoon  delivery?    And if there was, he would have it delivered. Times have  changed. A lot of things, like I say cost a nickel. Even when we were  first married, our first grocery bill would be around  15 a month for Bill  and me. And we bought everything we would need   chocolate syrup or  24  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  whatever. That   s probably the most expensive thing we bought was  chocolate syrup.  What did you like to do for fun, you and your husband?  Oh, well we   d go fishing. We lived up to that name. I   d go fishing with  him and he   d go shopping with me. Now that   s a good marriage.  Where would you fish?  Everywhere we could because we had a car. And a lot of kids, young  people, didn   t have cars then. But we would fish over here in Stillwater  Creek out here. And lots of times we would go down to see my  grandparents because their homestead is out there. And my daddy had a  pond built and stocked with fish. That   s the land my son bought about a  couple of years ago, out there. We   d go out there and fish and wherever  we wanted to go, we   d go and that was fun.  Did you play card games at all or   ?  Oh, once in a while I   d play bridge, but I didn   t much like to. That   d be  the only thing I   d play. I don   t like to be sitting still and thinking that  long.  Did you ever go dancing or listen to music?  No, we didn   t know anybody that did. Oh, I take that back. One time an  aunt of mine, out there on north of Mehan Road out that way, they had a  barn dance. Have you ever heard of that?  No.  Well, a lot of people had them then. And the barns had an upstairs to  them where they stored hay, big barrels of hay. It had a nice real smooth  beautiful floor. And when they used up all their hay, people would have  a barn dance up on that second floor where the hay had been kept. They  called it a barn dance and they did those kind of dances where somebody  would sing a song and they would do motions that would fit the songs  that somebody would sing. And they had violins and drums and things. I  went up there one time. But only once because I didn   t know how to do  all that stuff they were doing but it was fun to watch them. So I   ve been  to a barn dance once, in a barn. (Laughs)  I like the idea of my oldest sister and her husband, they moved back on  my daddy   s farm and they had a barn, big red barn, great big thing. The  west part of it was for their horses and had a door and the horses would  25  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  come in from the north and they had a manger through there. So I knew  what a manger was when I would hear the Bible stories. And it was open  in the middle part and they had a buggy in there, and they just didn   t  want to throw it away because they had cars. But they had that buggy in  the middle part. And then on the east side, it was all concrete based and  that   s where they would ride the cows in. They had what they called a     something, I think of it now. Anyway, the boards that go like this and  old cows heads would go through that and then they would pull the  boards together and hold the cows still while they were being milked.  And that was concrete floor too because then they would wash that  concrete floor after the cows got through being in there, to keep it clean.  They would have   I imagine maybe eight cows in there and it would be  about that size. And then they had another one that had boards across the  door and a window on the side, big room. That   s where they came up  when they   d have a wheat harvest, thrashing machine would come up  and they would unload that wheat into that big room and she wouldn   t  go out the door because they had the boards across it. And there would  be wheat about that deep and the next room had corn that they did the  same way. And that was a wheat crib and a corn crib. Have you ever  heard of a corn crib?  I have not.  Well, that   s what they always called it. And a great big red, painted red,  like this and it went out like this and like this. That big part up there,  they had to take down to get the bells of hay up in the loft where they   d  have the dances. They didn   t have dances, but other people did. One  time, when it was down at the big red barn and my big sister that lived  out there on the farm, we were in town but she and her husband and  children lived out there. When it was down, she painted a great big swan  on that part of that barn that was down and that swan   s   back of it was  about as big as those doors over there and big neck up like this and the  head up there. So it got to be known as the Swan Farm. They did not  raise swans but because of that big red barn, they called it the Swan  Barn.  (Laughs) How many brothers and sisters did you have?  I had four older sisters.  Wow, and what did they do? When they grew up what did they become?  Mothers.  Mothers.  26  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  (Laughs) That   s all.  What else do you remember about campus?  Oh, well one thing I remember   I think I might have told you about this,  about the dormitory. Well this was back in the affirmative action days  when everything had to have a certain percentage of black people. See  this is my husband   s department, the building built. And when they got  ready, the last thing they did on the bricks on the outside. Well the  contractor could not find enough black brick layers and so they stopped  the building. They couldn   t build it until they got a certain percentage of  black builders. The contractor had to go ahead and pay all the rest of the  guys until it was finished. And so that made that dormitory cost a lot  more because they had to bring some black people in from, I think it was  Chicago, I   m not sure but I think it was Chicago that he told me. But  what difference is there whether they are black or white? To me, that  doesn   t matter. Some of my best friends are black. The color of their  skin doesn   t matter. I   ve got a handsome young black man that goes to  our church, and I   ve known him since he was in high school because he  used to come here and play with my kids here in this yard. But I get hugs  from him every Sunday, too. (Laughs) And there   s the most beautiful  young black woman. We were all out at Parkersville yesterday, have you  been out there?  No.  That   s an interesting place. We had a great big dinner out there  yesterday evening   there   d be well over 100 people in that big old barn  out there. And one of our young women in our church has the most  beautiful voice and the people that came by and got me, they went by  and got her, and she sang out there for us as part of our refreshment. Oh,  she   s got a beautiful   she sings at our church a lot too. Beautiful voice  and beautiful young woman. Her skin is black but it doesn   t matter,  she   s beautiful inside and out, yes.  Do you remember when President Bennett died?  Yes, because I was in school with his son. I went to school with his son,  Phil, Phil Bennett and we were good friends. And he was dating a girl  named Francis Corbin and we   d tease him about it. And Francis lived on  the corner   beautiful home on the corner of-- it would be 2nd and Duck  Street on the northeast corner. Great big beautiful brick building,  beautiful building, big house. Her name was Francis Corbin and she and  Phil Bennett, we were all in school together. She and Phil were married  and still are. That was quite a while back.  27  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  I remember a lot of Stillwater history, but I think of that big old red barn  down there on South Main. I like to think of that. And that house was   6,500. It would probably be worth  260,000. (Laughs) Oh, I don   t  know how much it would be worth now. Beautiful home cause I   ve been  inside it   beautiful, beautiful. But I think the city should have bought  that home, make it part of Stillwater history. I think we   ve missed out on  a lot of things that way. And did you know there   s a Eugene Field  School here?  Tell me about it.  Well that would be on West Sixth on the corner of Washington and  Sixth. There   s a grocery store there now. And that used to be Eugene  Fields School, grade school. And then when that was sold, then they had  built the Eugene Field on out west of there, about six blocks or so on the  north side, another school out there. Oh, did I tell you about this  Billee  pulls out what looks like a feather pen ?  You didn   t, tell me about it.  Well you know I   m a historian. (Laughter) But you   ve heard of a pen  knife that guys carry around to sharpen their little knife? Do you know  why it   s called a pen knife? I do. Because when they were writing the  Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, their pens were  feathers, you knew that? Well one guy was hired just to go around and  sharpen that feather because after using them a while they go like this,  see the feather because it   s not that strong and it would go like that. So  they had this one guy hired to go around with a little knife and when it  got that way, then he   d sharpen it. That   s why it   s called a pen knife  because they would sharpen pens with a little knife. And that   s why it   s  called a pen knife. (Laughs) And you see that   s what this   you can see  how that feather would, as it   s being used would go like that. So they  carried a little knife and that was all he did was sharpen pens with a pen  knife. I don   t remember where I got that but I had to have it. Did I have  to? Yeah. (Laughter) But that   s my pen knife and that   s why men carry a  pen knife, to sharpen pens with.  Well what other stories about Stillwater or Oklahoma A M do you want  to share with me today? Is there anything else we forgot?  Well, yes, I   m sure there is. Let me see if I   seems like I wrote down a  few things. Because I know a lot about it.  I know you do.  Well one thing I remember about Boomer Lake   because that dam was  built and it didn   t have the street across it then. It was just a dirt dam.  28  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  And that   s when we had that long, long dry spell which everybody  knows about it in history. It went on and on and on and on. The spillway  was right by the bride part now. And the spillway was shaped like a big  funnel, about thirty feet across the top. Then it went down to about that  big and a pipe came out on down out that concrete funnel into the creek,  which you crossed down here   same creek. But when that went over the  spillway, it was a big thing because we had had dry weather for so long.  My daddy got me out of school to bring me out to see that water over the  spillway. It went over that big funnel and then down to the center and  there was so much of it. It couldn   t drain out that way and it started  coming up. See it went over, and down, and couldn   t get out that little  pipe. I don   t know how big that pipe was. And it went up about ten feet  in the air, over that, down that funnel shape, back way up in the air. I can  remember like that it happened today, over the spillway. Water went  across the street down here down south of us in that creek down there.  Oh that was so exciting because it had been built quite a long time  because that was the dry years.  And did you know that they built this shelter belt, do you know about it?  Well north of here, up by Tonkawa, great big trees, a great long line of  trees probably, I   m guessing 45 or 50 miles across up there. They call it  the tree belt, shelter belt. And what that was supposed to do, was when  the winds came from that way and got to those trees, it would turn up  because the big trees, you see, and then that would make in the moisture  up here make it drop.  Do you remember any bad dust storms coming into Stillwater?  Oh we   d look out sometimes and we couldn   t see over four or five  blocks. It didn   t matter to dust the furniture, wouldn   t do any good.  We   d just almost get rid of it and it would be back again. It would make  you feel bad sometimes to breathe. And that   s why, anyway my parents  always kept all the windows and doors shut to help keep that dust out in  the dust days. Oh, now have I told you a time my daddy talked cross to  me?  No, you didn   t.  Oh, I want to tell you that because we had gone out to my big sister   s  that lived out on old homestead. I think I told you my daddy owned that  mile out there and they lived on that farm and did some farming and he  worked in the oilfields too. Rusty was his name because he had dark red  hair. But they had cows and they sold milk in great big cans like this.  We were out there and they   d make ice cream and the cream would  come up and we   d make ice cream. (Laughs)  29  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  We   d go out there on Sunday afternoons and for some reason, you know  the old ice cream freezers were made of wood about this high and  another can down in it that real cream was in and a big handle at the side  like this. And why, I don   t know, but I always like to sit on that because  it was cold I guess because there would be a gunny sack on top of the  ice. And there was another girl out there that day. I don   t remember who  she was. I was sitting on it and my daddy said,    Babe, get up and let her  take her turn.    So I didn   t. And he said,    Babe, get up and let her take  her turn.    I didn   t because I wanted to sit on it myself. That was my  place because I was a baby and I was spoiled rotten. Still am. (Laughs)  But anyway, finally my daddy said,    Babe, get up.    And I didn   t. He  finally looked down at me and says,    Babe, I told you to get up. You get  up off of there,    and talked real cross. And, I got up because that was the  only time my daddy had ever talked cross to me. I went upstairs in my  big sister   s bedroom and I cried,    My daddy talked cross to me.    Pretty  soon he was up there and had me on his lap. And he said,    I   m sorry I  talked cross to you.    And I said,    Well daddy I   m sorry I didn   t mind  you.    And that was the only time he ever talked cross to me because I  didn   t up get off that ice cream freezer. (Laughs)  What did your mom say?  Well, she probably was inside. I don   t remember. I don   t remember her  saying anything or doing anything. He knew where I   d gone, upstairs to  my big sister   s bedroom, laid down on the bed and was crying and  crying,    My daddy talked cross to me.    Can you imagine raising a  daughter and never having to talk cross to her except one time when she  didn   t get up, didn   t mind him?  That   s pretty good.  And he was sheriff. I   m sure he didn   t do the other people that way.  (Laughter)  Do you remember the first time you rode in an airplane?  Oh, I remember that. The air field was on East Sixth on the north side.  They had a plane shield, big meeting here. And that was when there  were two wings like this and then sticks up and down that way between  the two wings. My daddy took us all out there and he and my big sisters  rode on that plane. It cost him, one at a time   cost him 50 cents to ride  on it. Well, that was a lot of money then. But the pilots would walk  along between those two, the wings. See, they had the up and down  things and those pilots would walk out on that. Oh, it scared me. And I  said,    Oh, I hope they don   t fall off.    And daddy said,    No, see they  grab a hold of those things, they won   t fall.    Anyway, he rode on it and  30  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  he took my big sisters and I said,    Daddy, let me ride on that airplane.     He said,    No, you are too little to ride on an airplane like that.    I didn   t  get to ride on that airplane. But I   ve ridden on a lot since.  Is that the first airplane you ever saw up close?  The first time I ever remember seeing one. And then there was that  airfield out there on Mehan Road during World War II and that was a  mile and a half east of Perkins Road, on Mehan Road on the south side.  And there is a great big field out there just as flat and nice. And they had  the concrete runways out there. I think you don   t see them anymore.  Maybe they tore them up or maybe the grass grew over them, I don   t  know. We   d go out there and he   d let me watch them take off and land. I  loved that. My oldest son has his own airplane. I like to fly with him, I  like to fly   it   s fun to fly with your son. He   s a good pilot. He has his  own airplane and it is fun to ride with him. I think it holds six  passengers. I don   t know what kind it is but it   s blue and white.  Tell me your children   s names and what they   re doing now.  Okay, my oldest son is Curtis Hoy and Hoy is a family name, it   s been  in the family for 100 years, H-O-Y. He   s retired and he has a home in  Rogers, Arkansas and one in Moab, Utah and one in the Bahamas. And  he   s taken me to those places in his own plane. That   s fun   fun to fly  with your son. (Laughs) And he flies over here and he was here about  two weeks ago, I guess it was, with his wife. He   s our oldest. Then our  next son is Dave   his name is Davis after my father. Davis Allen but  everybody always called him Davie and he lives in California. He sends  me tickets to fly out there to see them and I do that and then they come  here too. But he is the one that had been in Southern California where  terrible things are happening now  brush fires . And just recently they  moved back up north where they used to live. He said,    We didn   t like it  down there like we thought we would.    He said,    We could look out to  the west and see the ocean not very far and look to the north and see  snow on the mountains in Southern California. And look to the southeast  and see desert.    But I didn   t visit him there. I didn   t particularly want to.  But he will be sending me a ticket and so I   ll be going out there because  they   re back in the northeast again. And our youngest son is Bill. And he  has the most wonderful wife and daughter. I have no idea what that  daughter   s IQ is but it   s way at the top. She   s really smart. She   s taller  than I am but she   s, how old is she? She   ll have her birthday in  November. She   ll be 15. She and I have more fun together. We always  have had. We used to play charades, she and I would. We   d act out silly  things and we would try to guess what we were saying. But she is a  beautiful young woman, oh she is. Her daddy is an importer/exporter.  He   s the one that has a room about the size of this full of stuff. I don   t  31  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  even know what they are. They   re just machines, machines, machines  but he knows what they are, and she does to.  Do you remember each one of their majors in college?  Oh, I should, shouldn   t I? Well, Davies    was in business and Curtis    was  in engineering, like his daddy. And Bill was   well, he went down to OU   University of Oklahoma  for two years. We couldn   t hardly stand that,  but he did in business and then back up here. (Laughs) We couldn   t  understand him wanting to go to OU but he made such good grades, he  got some kind of a scholarship down there. So we let him go, but we  didn   t like it. But he did. And he is tall. He   s about 6   2    or 3   . He didn   t  get that height from me. I was the tall one in our family, did I tell you  that?  No, you were?  Yes, because there were five girls, a grandmother, a mother and five  daughters. But they were all five foot two or shorter. Except me, I was  five foot two and a half.  Wow.  So I was the tall one. Half an inch taller than the others. (Laughs)  That makes all the difference.  But I haven   t shrunk, I   m grateful for that. Because I drink my milk and  my orange juice.  Well do you have any other stories you   d like to share with us?  Oh, I probably do. I probably do. I think I wrote down a list of things to  tell you. I don   t know what I did with it now.  Well, if we ever need to come back, I mean we could always do that.  Well, let me look in there by that other phone.  Okay, that   s fine. Go ahead and look.  Yeah, we   ve got how many phones? One, two, three, four   got five  phones in this house for one person. Wasn   t that way for a while because  everybody was here. I like roses.  Yeah, they   re pretty.  32  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Oh, I told you about the pine cone though, didn   t I?  No, you did not.  I have quite a few pine cones. See that? My little granddaughter painted  that. See, it says,    To G-Babe, from Alyssa.    She was about four years  old   three or four years old.  Oh wow.  But I painted that one.  That   s nice.  And those pictures that are behind you. And the daisies. I didn   t paint  that one. Oh, can I read this?  Billee is looking at old pictures  That  was the Fisher family down in front of the old Fisher house. That   s my  husband, isn   t he a handsome one?  Oh wow. Are you in any there?  Here I am.  That   s nice.  I didn   t tell you about my colored glasses did I?  No.  May I do that first?  Absolutely.  Look at them.  Billee brings out red-tinted glasses  That was one of our  pastor   s, John Weir over at Hillcrest about five or six years ago. He said,     Well, Granny Babe, I got you some new glasses, some rose-colored  glasses. You use your glasses all the time. You see the world through  rose-colored glasses and I knew you   d worn yours out so I bought you a  new pair.    (Laughs) I   ve been teased all my life, but they are rose-colored.  They definitely are.  Oh, I don   t know about me  (Laughs) But this is a story that my brother-in-  law, who was a band director wrote and I thought this was kind of  cute. He says, see my husband   s real name was Wilbert but they called  33  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  him Bill.  Billee begins to read     When Billee and Wilbert decided to  marry they did it the intelligent way. Went out of town and got the job  done before Dad Williams or whom else could say nay.    We did that,  really.    That big-hearted, prank-minded Uncle Earl Fisher offered the  use of his car as his part. To report it as stolen was a trick he had  planned but was talked out of it by his old big kind heart.    We didn   t  know that until later.    So married they were, for better or for worse, in  the middle of the dust bowl and depression. Hitler and the offing, and  Roosevelt was president with NRA, CCC, and more alphabetical  progression. A good engineer with belief in himself made Wilbert an  engineer with the WPA. There he taught broken men to have pride in  their work for those temporary work projects are still used today.    And  they are.    Sometimes I remember back in those days back then when  Billee had bought groceries and had change left from a ten. Less than ten  dollars worth of groceries that Idabel Store sold, was a lot more  groceries than their car could hold.    We lived in that little town of Idabel  for a while.    Bridges and culvers for Oklahoma roads, the dam at  Dennison, the rubber plant at Borger, runways at the Tulsa field. Those  are a few things he engineered with the use of concrete and steel. The  assembly line in Pexton, for Douglas at Tinker was one of his projects,  too. See engineer for Muskogee and architectural inspector for  Oklahoma State U. Wilbert building credits was excellent construction,  Billee was building future credits with family production. First came  Curtis, then Davie and finally Billy Al, plus painting, pottery and real  estate, wow, you   ve been busy gal. So the two of you with family and  friends, enjoy this special golden day. Just remember that you   re living  now and this I just have to say, we   ll all remember and laugh and cry for  those years that went before. What we want to do now and we   re serious  too, is get started on fifty years more. Love, Harold.    (Laughs)  That was for your fiftieth wedding anniversary?  Yes, and somewhere else I   ve got another kind of like that because, see,  we were married sixty-one years when he left.  So he worked for the WPA?  Well, he did the engineering for the Work   s Projects Administration.  What type of buildings was he involved in?  What buildings? Several different buildings and dams, lakes and  everything because he was an engineer and he knew them all.  Are there any buildings left that we would still know?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. (Laughs) But I like that story of the library.  34  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Yeah, that was a good story.  They don   t make girls do that anymore. But he didn   t dare say anything  when he couldn   t see them.  That   s right. (Laughter)  And they were rolled up. With the coat on, he couldn   t see them. Oh,  my. But this is a nice place right here. There   s not another house built  like this one.  And did your husband build this house? Did he draw the plans for it?  Uh-huh. And there   s not another house like it and I can tell you why.  And he was here all the time while it was being built. Like I say, he was  a perfectionist at everything but me. (Laughs) Oh let me tell you this.  That reminds me of that. But he had that old arthritis from drinking  coffee. It got so where I   d turn over at night, that would hurt him. And  so he got to sleeping in one bedroom and I would sleep in our old  bedroom. So I   d go in there and tuck him in at night and put his  medicine there by him so he could sleep well and not hurt so bad. I put  his medicine and reached down and kissed him good night and stood up,  and he looked up at me and he says,    I love my cute, little wifey.    And I  said,    I love you too.    I went back in my bedroom and he went to sleep  left to be with the Lord that night. That   s the last words he said in this  world, that he loved me.  Aww, well I think that   s beautiful.  I do too. Of course, we told each other that several times every day. But  that was the last things he said in this world, he said to me.  Wow, that   s nice.  And he was such a wonderful guy. He had to be to put up with me like  he did. (Laughs)  Was he originally from here, from Stillwater?  He was born over in Crescent, where another grandmother had done.  Because see, his daddy was   he helped get the school of veterinary  medicine started at OSU, his father did.  Oh really?  Uh-huh, because he evidentially was a little bit of a politician, too, and a  republican politician. And he helped get this here because he had  35  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  something way up high somewhere. And he helped get it here.  Wow.  And we knew McElroy, you know I told you about Norm McElroy.  You didn   t tell me about McElroy.  I didn   t?  No.  Oh, well he used to come to the Fisher house because he was a doctor of  veterinary medicine and so was my father-in-law and my oldest brother-in-  law, Leroy, was also a doctor of veterinary medicine. And so that   s  where McElroy would come because the big family, he liked to be  around. He used to live on East Sixth, on the south side. A big, beautiful  brick home out almost to Jardot, not quite but almost. That   s where  McElroy lived. He didn   t live on McElroy Street. (Laughs) That would  have been good if he had, wouldn   t it?  It would be if he did.  Because the street wasn   t named McElroy then.  What was it called, do you remember?  Huh-uh. It might not have been there as a street, I don   t remember.  Because Leroy is over that way then   but I have a lot of good, happy  memories.  You do.  And, oh this   you see this picture of this little doggy up here? That   s  our Charlie. He weighed ten pounds.  Oh really?  And you know, that was painted for us and he charged  300 to paint  anything. But he didn   t us. He was an artist for Hallmark Greeting  Cards, that artist was. He also painted that picture there in the hallway,  next to the corner. You see the flowers? He painted that for us, too. And  I   ll tell you how he got acquainted with us. Because you see we had that  house on Beaver Lake and they had this man from Hallmark Greeting  Cards, that   s who he was, and he was teaching some lessons and I went  out and took watercolor lessons from him. We found out he was staying  36  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  in a motel. And we said,    No, don   t stay in a hotel. We   ve got one, two,  three extra bedrooms here and we   ve got three boats in our backyard so  you stay with us.    And so he did. Then his wife came and stayed two or  three days with us. And that little Charlie weighed ten pounds or so and  he   d stand on his back legs, like that. Back and see how his feet would  go like this? Front feet? That artist said, well he   s praying for people to  come see you. And that   s what it looks like.  Yeah it does.  And he charged an outrageous price for anybody else, but he did ours for  free. And we were grateful for that. But he was grateful that he had a  place to stay instead of that motel for him and his wife, and he liked to  ride in our boats too. And we wanted him to.  You have quite a memory. You remember a lot.  I   ve been blessed all my life. Starting with the parents I chose. And then  the man I chose.  Definitely.  Because I   m the only girl he ever dated.  Well that   s good.  And he never even thought of dating anyone else, either. (Laughs)  Well, with that I   m going to end our interview today. I do appreciate you  speaking with us and telling us a little history about Stillwater and about  the campus.  Sometime let   s take a ride around over town and I could tell you more  about the town.  Definitely.  And did you know that the president of the university, Bennett for  instance, lived on campus. Did you know that?  Yes.  Is that still marked off as his home?  I believe it   s not there anymore.  37  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Nykolaiszyn  Fisher  Oh, I hadn   t been on campus in quite a while.  I think it was a white-framed house, I heard.  Uh-huh.  It   s been removed. I think they built a chapel over it.  Oh, I need to go by there sometime and see. But I   m afraid of traffic  around that campus now.  Oh, it   s crazy, it is crazy.  Well I remember a lot about that campus that I could tell. I remember  Morrill Hall, is it still called Morrill Hall?  Yes, it is.  I had my art lessons on the top floor of that building?  Did you really?  And it was way up there, fourth floor. It was in kind of the attic part. But  it was worth it, because I liked doing it. (Laughs) Oh, my I   ve had a  blessed life.  -------  -------
