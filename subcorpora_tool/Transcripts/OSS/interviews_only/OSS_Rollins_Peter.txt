 Gill. Today is January 14, 2009. I   m visiting with Dr.  Peter Rollins in the library of the Oklahoma State University Campus in  Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories project  of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Peter, I appreciate  you interviewing today. I know you have a long history at Oklahoma  State University, but could we move back even before that and ask if you  can tell us a little bit about your early family life, where you grew up.  I   ll be happy to go back if I can remember. I remember the room we   re  in. Roscoe Rouse used to have his office here. He was Head of the  Library, later called Dean of the Library when I came to Oklahoma  State, so it   s a familiar location for me.  I grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts which is a suburb of Boston,  directly west of Boston and contiguous with it. Brookline was a suburb,  very wealthy   in fact the nickname of the football team was the  Wealthy Towners. I think there are wealthier places now, but it was a  pretty rich suburb. My father was in politics there, republican politics,  and was the town lawyer, had served in various roles in the town  government. My grandfather was the town judge, municipal judge, and  had been the town clerk which is a more powerful position than one  might assume from the title.  But in any case, I grew up in Brookline and went to public schools there  which were excellent schools. Superb schools. I was pretty much a cut  out in grammar school, but I got interested in the world around me  gradually as I got older. I sang in the Trinity Church Choir. Trinity  Church is in Copley Square in Boston. We practiced three times a week,  we sang twice on Sunday and I had to take the street car back and forth  each time. I was actually paid to perform this professional service. We  also sang with the Boston Symphony. So what I   m leading into is I had  spending money and in the sixth grade; I subscribed on my own to the  6  Gill  Rollins  Christian Science Monitor which was delivered to our door at 3:30 P.M.  each day. My parents were bewildered why I would want this, but it  turned out I was very much interested in foreign affairs and history at  that time.  Because I loved this library, the Edmon Low Library, so much, I have an  interesting anecdote about that. The public library, the branch in  Coolidge Corner which was two miles from where I lived, refused to  allow me to take out what they deemed adult books on history and  politics because I only had a children   s card. And I saw that as a deep  insult. I think one of the reasons why I   ve given so many books to the  Edmon Low Library, I think it   s over 6,600 now, is because I   m sort of  paying homage to the library still, and will never be held to get that adult  card.  But any case, I went to the public schools and on my own in many cases  got involved in intellectual interests. However, in high school we had  outstanding teachers and a very interesting curriculum. By the time I  was a senior in high school I had read David Hume, John Locke, Jean  Jacque Russo, Marks, Ingles, major figures in the intellectual history as  well as taking standard courses. The last two years we were allowed to  take advanced placement classes so I had Creative Writing. I called him  Gruesome Newsome, Mr. Newsome, poor guy had been in World War I  and been gassed, so he was hunched over and his lungs were a mess. But  he was a terrific, terrific teacher. He made us re-write everything four,  five or six times. I learned from him and I   ve been doing that ever  since   yesterday  Be attentive to language, how we put it together, how  we communicate, whom we   re communicating with, and what way. Mr.  Newsome   I won an Atlantic Monthly Poetry contest as a junior in high  school. I won an Atlantic Monthly Short Story Contest as a senior in  high school. Was offered a four-year, all expenses paid scholarship at  the University of Pittsburgh with a major in Creative Writing. My father  told me that he had the money to send me to college and he would rather  see me on the sacred soil of Dartmouth College than to have me go to  another school.  There   s a family story?  Yeah, there   s a family story that goes with that, going back to my  grandfather who was a municipal judge. Grandfather was a Teddy  Roosevelt-type progressive republican. He was a shooter and a fisher  and loved to kill things and serve them at the table. One of the things he  was most proud of was shooting two pheasants out his back window one  morning while he was shaving and still had shaving cream on his face.  He had the old razors that you   d strap around. One of his proudest  moments. He and his family would go to Maine in their Cadillac. I guess  7  Gill  Rollins  in those days   this would have been 1915-1920   they   d have two or  three flats on the way and they   d have to change tires, patch the tires and  all that. Used to stop at a little store and buy their equipment. The name  of the store was L.L. Bean. It was a little store, not many people knew  about it at the time. They   d get their waders and their hunting equipment  to go out and kill things, salmon and deer and so on.  It was a mixed blessing when dad got home from killing deer. We had to  eat venison for months at a time. It   s really kind of a fun novelty the first  15 or 20 meals. But they never wasted anything. They loved nature in  their own way. That was fun. Grandfather was a Dartmouth graduate,  and it is he who told my father, when they   d go up they   d pull the car  over to the side of the road when they reached the upper level there  where Dartmouth is located. He   d say,    Now we   re on the sacred soil of  Dartmouth College.    And then he would start the car and drive on to the  campus.  He set your path for going to Dartmouth?  Oh I was going to Dartmouth from the fourth grade as far as I know. I  was admitted as a junior in high school, also called their early  admissions program. And so unlike a lot of people, I never did worry  about college  exams    I took them, but I never did worry about them  because I   d already been accepted to Dartmouth in writing. The family  had gone there since the early 1800s and was an old New Hampshire  family, there was a Rollinsford, New Hampshire where they came from  on the main border. In 1884, one of the Rollins graduates of Dartmouth  gave the school sufficient money to have constructed an H.H.  Richardson-designed gothic structure called Rollins Chapel. When I  went there, one of my problems was I always had to go out and stop  people from playing stick ball against the side door of the Rollins  Chapel.    Get away from that, it   s my chapel.    And there were portraits  of Rollins family members in the library and other buildings. They all  had the Rollins lazy eye, the family characteristic.  But everybody went to Dartmouth College and everybody went to  Harvard Law School. It was the standard critique. And I know whenever  I wrote home to my father for money, he would break out this letter  written in 1838 by Daniel A. Rollins in which Daniel Rollins explained  to his father that he had exceeded his budget and he was at Harvard Law  School at the time. So it was a big Dartmouth tradition. But I was  launched from Brookline High School and I loved the place. My wife  and I go back for the reunions and we sort of embraced the whole  tradition. It   s not a place I wanted to break away from and change  because it was what really launched me into my intellectual career. And  I think a component of that is my mother died when I was in the eighth  8  Gill  Rollins  grade, and I started taking life more seriously earlier than maybe other  people. My dad was in politics so I learned to cook and I had charge  accounts in various restaurants in town. I would go to a good restaurant,  just charge the meal and come home and do my homework. I usually did  3-6 hours of homework a night even when I was playing sports and  varsity sports.  3-6 hours     Yeah. Sometimes you would get in an hour at the study hall in school  which I would use for my homework. I would go to bed around 1 A.M.  So I really got into the academic work. The most illuminating moment, I  know you were asking about this in the exchanges we had. As a  freshman in high school, during the Spring Break, I think I was running  spring track. I was never very good. I found out why, let me explain. I  have a congenital defect that doesn   t allow the blood to flow as fast as it  ought to or wants to. Bicuspid Aortic Valve. But anyway it   s supposed  to have three, and it only has two. I   m having it operated on next month.  But in any case, I went home from spring track and walked home about  four or five miles with my friends, we   d all break off at various points. I  threw open the windows in my bedroom, and had a leather chair and  footstool. I had to do four book reports for Mrs. Triska of English. I  remembered the books that I read. I remember the excitement of reading  them. I remember the excitement of sitting there with my feet up, I had  two windows in my bedroom, breeze blowing through. And it was just a  wonderful feeling, traveling through space and time intellectually. And I  thought to myself, I wonder if you could ever get paid for something like  this? And that   s the illumination.  The books that I remember to have read in that ten day period, and  written the reports for were Red Badge of Courage  by Stephen Crane   which came in a lovely paperback, twenty five cents in those day; The  Cruel Sea,  by Nicholas Monsarrat  World War II; The Bridge of San  Luis Ray  by Thornton Wilder  which is sort of a classic. The teacher  was very confused why I would like such a book. And I   ve forgotten the  fourth one. I   ve suppressed by the fourth one. But in any case, I didn   t  get the reviews from the internet, I actually wrote them myself. It was a  wonderful experience. So that was just sort of an example of what  Brookline High School did for me and a lot of other people.  There are a lot of our graduates who are prominent in the arts and the  humanities. One of them is the owner of the New England Patriots and  all that good stuff. But in any case   and there are people who were  picked to be the greatest achievers and all, the most intellectual. I   m  proud to say I   ve published about twelve more books than the one who  was the most bright. But be that as it may, who   s counting. So Brookline  9  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  was a great launching point, my high school.  Then I went on to Dartmouth College. I do want to say that the library  was very good with its open stacks approach, like OSU. The professors  were good. There is a Dartmouth Film Society which is famous. Those  were all good influences. The teachers were great. Dartmouth at that  time was always looking for the scholar athletic, someone who excelled  in sports and academics and they found a lot of them. However, when  they lived in the dorms and interacted outside of class, it was more of the  athlete that came out. And I don   t mind locker rooms. It   s a good place  to take a shower, have a few laughs, get dressed and leave. But I do  mind the locker room atmosphere all day long, and Dartmouth had too  much of that. After the first year I said everyone hates school the  freshman year so I   ll give it another year and see what happens. Well I  still didn   t like it. And I met someone. Of course this is an individual  report, other people have other reports.  The Dartmouth English Department had what they called a new  criticism approach to literature, was the text only, not the historical  background. The idea being, I guess in the    30s there was too much  emphasis on the historical background, not enough on the details of the  work of the literature. Well I hated that, I couldn   t stand that. I was  taking courses in history and literature, concurrently. I ran into a friend  of mine who was actually in my homeroom at Brookline High school  who was at Harvard in what was called the History and Literature  program. A Kennedy, who was considered for the senatorial seat in New  York, went through that program also. I met her when she was a student,  I came back and gave a lecture. She   s far more intellectual and articulate  than has been presented by the media, I assure you. And a nice person.  But in any case, the History and Literature program had it   s own carrel,  carried his own carrel in the library, which he shared with others, but  you could make in-library borrowings and have the books there while  you   re working on your special     As an undergraduate?  As an undergraduate.  Impressive.  Oh I loved the idea. I have an anecdote about getting my carrel here at  Oklahoma State when I showed up I   ll share with you. But in any case, I  transferred to Harvard and to the History and Literature Program, I had  to be interviewed and all that. My father   I said,    Well should I apply  for scholarship?    He said,    No. I can afford to send you. Let people who  need the scholarship support apply and receive it. I will pay for it.     10  Gill  Rollins  Gill  However for the first four or five months he wouldn   t speak to me  because I had left the hallowed halls and the sacred soil of Dartmouth  College. At dinner he would say to his wife,    Lillian      he   d  remarried      Lillian, would you ask Peter to pass the salt please. Lillian,  would you ask Peter to pass the pepper, please.    This went on for quite a  while. So he was not approving. My brothers got into Dartmouth so  there was a lot of surrounding tradition.  In any case, I thrived in the History and Literature Program at Harvard. I  told my professors I wanted them in my senior thesis project to tell me if  they felt I was capable of going on as a scholar in graduate study or not.  If not I   d go to law school and make a lot of money and use whatever  combativeness of spirit I have in the court room. Didn   t particularly  want to do that, I thought it would bring wrong aspects of my  personality out and didn   t want to do it, but I could do it, make a lot of  money, drive around a nice car, nice house and all that. So I worked on a  project on Orestes Augustus Brownson, a 19th century intellectual who  figures pretty large in Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.   s Age of Jackson. Turns  out Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. wrote his undergraduate thesis in the History  and Literature Program on Orestes A. Brownson. So I was in good  company. That project was a thrill for me, and here again that   s another  launching point as an intellectual. When it was done, the professor said,     Yes, you should go on.     I had a dream in which I was sitting on the front stairs of Widener  Library at Harvard University and a man in a white suit with a cane, a  big white hat sort of thing, you see Orson Welles wearing this, came up  the stairs. He said,    Are you Peter Rollins?    I said,    Yes I am.    He said,     I   m Orestes Brownson. You   re the first person who has ever  understood me. Thank you so much.    I said,    You   re welcome.    And he  turned around and left. So I took it as confirmation that even Orestes  Brownson approved of the project. Any case I went on     That   s a vision, that   s a strong direction.  Yeah. You can   t get more approval than that, by golly. But Dartmouth  was a good school, it just wasn   t right for me. Harvard was a great  school and the library and the atmosphere, I had some wonderful   Perry  Miller, Alan Heimert, Michael Weinberg was my tutor, a junior in the  History and Lit Program. I just had some wonderful influences and  mentors. It was like having a car, I had all the gasoline, just a matter of  whether I could drive the thing. It was just a great experience for me.  So your career   there   s a lot of points and counter points. After your  undergraduate degree you were commissioned into the Marines. Could  we talk a little about your experience there?  11  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Sure. While at Dartmouth, I signed up for the PLC program, Platoon  Leader Corps program. Now my father had been a Marine officer in  World War II. Served at the Saipan, Guam, Tinian operations for the  dam and been a Marine as an undergraduate, reenlisted. So it was a  family tradition I went on with. I signed up for the Platoon Leader  Corps, went to summer camp, summer of freshman year for six weeks of  boot camp. A lot of physically challenging   walking the summer with  heavy weights on your back and a rifle. At that point it was the M1,  which is heavy, and the rifle range, which I didn   t do all that well. I was  a sharp shooter, but you had to stop during rapid fire and reload a clip. I  fire left handed which all rifles in the service are built for right handed  shooters. So I had to take it off my shoulder, put in the clip, put it back  in my shooter. That   s time consuming. So I was only a sharp shooter.  When they went to the M14 I was an expert in the rifle and pistol. I  didn   t mention this, but we had a pistol gallery in the cellar at our home,  so I   d go down there and fire weapons and all that sort of stuff. It   s all  part of that WASP tradition. But I was a pretty good shot with the pistol.  And that was the 45 semi-automatic 1911 Colt which is the most  miserable thing built. The bullet moves so slowly you can see it going  out to the target and inaccurate, so you have to be really careful. But any  case, I digress.  So very challenging and dropped a lot of people. I wasn   t dropped so I  went on. Then there was a hiatus until my junior year which was  standard for the Platoon Leader Corp. Six more weeks the summer of the  junior year. Successfully completed that. One of my first helicopter   I  wouldn   t say helicopter ride, but I was carried by a helicopter to an  objective that time. That was pretty exciting. It was the old   not the  Huey but whatever preceded the Huey, I   ve forgotten the name of it, but  it looked like a beetle  A good helicopter, but noisy. Any case, did that.  Went back, had my senior year. And then after I lost some weight, the  chief doing the physical made me lose weight before they would  commission me. So after I lost about twenty pounds   you know those  weight charts are absurd. Someone like me is supposed to weigh 145-  135 pounds. I haven   t weighed 145 pounds since when I was a  sophomore in high school. But anyway I did get down to where I  weighed 158 or some ridiculous weight for me. But was commissioned,  was sworn in by my father. He was a noted republican all his life, so he  administered the oath. And this took place I   d say about 50 yards away  from where the Boston Tea Party occurred.  Was that by design?  That was at a Marine Corps recruiting station. It just happened to be  there but it   s all a part of history. So then I went off to six months of  basic school which all officers of the Marine Corps, whether they   re air  12  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  or infantry, go through and successfully completed that. I wanted to go  into Intelligence but it turns out you have to have a genius IQ and I  didn   t have one. So I think there was one guy in our class who qualified  in that regard. But I was so lucky, because all of the head marine  Intelligence officers then ended up being glorified weather men aboard  carriers and they just tell the pilots what the weather is like over the  target, which is ridiculous. So I had the thrill of being a Marine Corps  officer, infantry and that   s an honor which I cherish. I did three years.  Had a reading list, I, just by design, structured a reading list of books  that I would not read in graduate school, general education. So I had The  Satop Khan which had been given to me, so I read through that which  was a lot of pages there. But I read all of Freud, Marx   s Das Kapital  which is like that  thick . All kinds of good stuff.  Decline and the Fall of the Roman Empire?  Oh yeah, I love that   Isn   t that one a given.  I love that.  The paragraphs and long sentences.  Oh, pretentious mastification of the inglorious tribune. The malicious  rhetorical tintinnabulation and that sort of thing. Master in polysyllabic  language. But any case, takes a while to read. Adam Smith   s Wealth of  Nations. Read that whole thing through, cover to cover. Wonderful book  by the way, just wonderful. But anyway, the point of all of this, I took  the graduate record exam as everyone does who wants to go to graduate  school   wasn   t accepted anywhere at that point   and took the afternoon  exam in history. Appearance wise, they assume you knew something  about one facet of history by your major and then they   d try to see what  else you knew, for everyone. So someone might be an expert in  European History and then they   d have to answer in American History,  and vice versa. So the test looked like it was based on my reading list. It  was unbelievable. And I   d read the history of China and some other  stuff, and I knocked the top off this exam. It was just unbelievable how  well I did. So I got full scholarship offers from Harvard, Chicago and an  offer   I missed the deadline on one thing, but an offer from Berkeley.  At that point there was what   s called the National Defense Education  Act, NDEA, which had been launched under Eisenhower because of the  threat of the Soviets in engineering. A guy named Richardson from  Massachusetts was famous for being fired from the Justice Department.  He would not   I forgot who he was   Elliot Richardson was asked to  13  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  fire Archibald Cox. And he wouldn   t do it, refused to do it, so he was  fired himself. And then a guy named  Robert  Bork came up and he fired  Cox. But in any case, Elliot Richardson had convinced the Eisenhower  people to include the humanities in the NDEA fellowship, so I got one  of those. It paid every penny of my graduate education. Gave me  2,000  a semester for anything I wanted to pay for, books and whatever. And  then I was getting the GI Bill every month,  350 bucks a month    385 I  think. And there was a Massachusetts Vietnam Bonus. I actually took a  pay cut when I moved to Oklahoma State as a faculty member.  Let me ask you   going back a minute. Are there any experiences that  you can remember   you did combat duty in Vietnam?  Yes, oh yeah.  Not going into all the details, but are there some highlights there that  impacted your life and certainly some of the film you did, documentaries  and criticism looking at American Wars, was that influenced by your  experience?  Sure, there   s a number of things that   sort of the output rather than the  experience. The output of the Marine Corps experience is, number one,  learning to love the ordinary person and to respect the ordinary person  irrespective of how much schooling he might have. I taught two Marines  how to read. I got 20  of our company their high school degrees  through  inaudible . They had to take a history class in addition to the  test, so a GED. But I was dependent on them, I was respectful of them,  and I learned to love ordinary people. It was a great experience.  The second thing I learned was the importance of leadership. You  should be able to take orders, you should be willing and happy to give  orders and make sure that they   sixth true leading step, supervise the  execution of your order, make sure they are carried out. The third point  was the importance of serving my country. Which when I thought I was  dying in the hospital after my first heart attack, I thought back on what  had I done that I was most proud of. Not the only thing I was proud of,  but one of the things was having served my country in a time of need.  And I suppose the fourth thing is, and I understood what the Vietnam  War was all about, what was happening, and then coming back and  seeing how reckless an adversarial press was so-called reporting the war,  selectively putting out stuff. And the worst papers at the time were The  New York Times, Boston Globe would mirror The New York Times, but  CBS news was just atrocious. I would take a street car to school and then  get a train out from downtown Boston, and I could read the whole New  York Times in that period, cover to cover. Unbelievable what I read  there.  14  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  So at a later time I got some grants and made a two and a half epic about  the Tet Offensive, which is a microcosm of the misrecording. But then  later because people had seen it and hired me basically to go to  Washington for a couple of years and make a couple of TV shows with  Charlton Heston as a narrator called Television   s Vietnam: The Impact of  Media and Televisions in Vietnam: The Real Story. Both of these are  available through Amazon and through the Accuracy of Media website.  But anyway, I was highly motivated by my Marine background, or first  saying, informed of what was happening, of what people were trying to  do on the battlefield, what they were not trying to do, and then to be  shocked and very disturbed about what I saw being reported to a  domestic audience which didn   t have my  experience  to deal with. They  only had what they found in the newspapers.  Peter, for the record, you were actually in combat situations with your  troops. So you were seeing the battles in the field as it happened.  Yes sir. Not a lot, but shot at, carrying parts of bodies to helicopters.  Things like that, yeah.  Picking back up from Vietnam service in the Marines and as you  indicated to get your grant to go to college, you did graduate work at  Harvard. Is that correct?  Well I had to choose. I had to choose among Harvard, Chicago, and  Berkeley. I   d gone to Harvard, I knew the library, I knew the professors,  I knew the program. Any such program before World War II was called  the History of American Civilization named after the book by Charles  and Mary Beard which was very popular in the late    30s. After World  War II, it was called American Studies. But any case, I knew the  program, I knew the professors, Kenneth Heslin and Alan Heimert, Joel  Porte. Perry Miller died before I got back. I knew the library, and said,  hey, this is the way to go.  So what year was this when you started your Ph.D.?  I started Ph.D. in    66.  So for your undergraduate, you graduated in what year?     63.  So three years later?  Yeah. And it was a great experience. Of course graduate school is a  pain. It is degrading in so many ways. And so I kind of, I won   t put a  15  Gill  Rollins  halo around it, but intellectually speaking it was just a marvelous  opportunity. You know, humanities had to work and sweat to just to  grind out the daily bread. And to have this opportunity to study and to  pursue my interest was an unbelievable, unbelievable benefit. Which  I   ve always felt I should somehow fulfill the promise of that benefit.  And I have. As far as I know, I have. But I always know that I   ve got to  do it. So I was instilled with a certain dedication to the field. A joyous  field. Especially once you   re out of graduate school.  Let   s see, another one of these anomalies in your career, we   re talking  Harvard University now. I   ve got to ask you, what year did you come to  Oklahoma State University and what influenced your decision to seek a  faculty position in the English Department at Oklahoma State University  in the middle of the country from Harvard?  Well the question often asked, in 1972 how did I apply for and be  chosen for a position at Oklahoma State University? Answer is the job  market was horrendously bad at that time. It was better later. It was  better in the    60s, real good. But there was an interdisciplinary position  open at Oklahoma State as advertised in one of the Language  Association   s job listings. It turned out part of the job entailed helping to  edit the writings of Will Rogers, which OSU finally turned out to 22  volumes plus an index volume of his writings. So I came out here with  partial commitment to the English Department and partial commitment  to the writings of Will Rogers Project.  Professor, now retired Regents Professor Joe Stout was the director of  the project when I arrived at the doorstep. Joe and I had a good working  relationship. He was very instrumental in helping me to write clearly and  directly, much more so than I had ever before. So it was a very good  influence in that regards. He sort of left it up to me to interpret the  literary, symbolic and other aspects of the writing. He kept himself busy  with the very big job of annotating and validating the details. But he was  a tremendous influence on me. Now just for the record, since the record  may reflect other things and opinions, Theodore Agnew, Professor of  History, had been the previous director of the Will Rogers Project. And  his work, prior to Joe   s writing and my writing, to the best of my  knowledge, has never been fully or adequately appreciated, although I  noted recently he got a posthumous award from the Emeritus Professor  group and I think one other group. But he did a lot of work. And the  people at the memorial who weren   t scholars were unappreciative of  what he was doing and how important it would be. But then again it  provided the fuel for the project for the next 15 years. But he felt they  should get it all down first and then start publishing and there was this  thirst to get something out. So you immediately get two short books. But  Agnew did a terrific job and every day on that project, Joe and I and  16  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Glen Shirley who was working for the press on this said to ourselves,  it   s a good thing Agnew did this, it   s a good thing Agnew did that. So  the people closest to the project appreciated the contribution of Ted  Agnew of History.  Who did you interview with in the process? The head of the department  at that time?  My initial exposure was to Clinton Keeler who was Department Head.  Let   s see, I wrote down a few dates. As far as I can tell   well in    72, I  think he was Department Head from    72 to    75. Clinton Keeler also had  an interdisciplinary degree in American Studies from the University of  Wisconsin. He studied with a very famous professor Mary Turpie; very  famous person in the American Studies Association world. So he was  very interested in interdisciplinary people. I think the administration,  Dean  George  Gries in particular, was very concerned that there be a  combined History and English input on the writings. Keeler was sort of  the facilitator of this when I came in to work on the project and teach  classes in English. Keeler was a great guy and I loved him to death.  Very supportive, wrote poetry. I don   t think he liked to give orders. If  you can be too nice of a guy sometimes when you   re department head, I  think he was one of those people who are just too nice of a person. But  that   s okay. That   s a flaw that few have, and those who have it should be  praised for it.  Yes. I   ve got to ask you because you told me you took a cut in your  salary. So you agreed to be hired, and what was your salary at that time,  do you mind sharing with us?  Well I tried to think of what it was and I   m going to say that it was  somewhere between  9,000 and  11,000.  Wow.  To get started. So I took a big salary cut to come out here. But I   m glad I  did. Unlike others, because I had served in the Marines and met people  from all over the country, ordinary people, I didn   t have the culture  shock problem that maybe a lot of easterners have when they come out  here. I certainly have seen the culture shock and its negative  ramifications. I   m not a victim of that. It   s also true that if I   d gone to  Arizona, I would have found the good things about Arizona. Or Alaska,  I would have found out what was good about Alaska. But the point  being, every place has its virtue and its beauties and it   s up to you to find  them and to draw sustenance from them.  Peter, speaking of that, what was your first impression of Stillwater and  17  Rollins  Oklahoma State University early in your career?  Well my very first impression was during my job interview. And I have  a long Morrill Hall story that I   m handing over to you about that. But in  any case, I had given a paper at the Popular Culture Conference in  Toledo, Ohio. There was a 40 MPH wind. The roads were all iced over  and full of sleet. You couldn   t get out of the hotel except to go to a  White Castle hamburger place halfway across in an island, not even  fully across the street, but got your shoes all full of stuff going to it. It  was just hell this climate situation. So I flew down to Oklahoma State. It  was 75 degrees. Robins were hopping around in the front lawn of the  Business College and Morrill Hall. It was a Saturday when I came down  and there was a   George Carney of geography had organized a music  festival. So I went to a couple of events and it was wonderful. He played  and sang with them and was very much involved with that. And I  learned a lot about the geography department as an interdisciplinary  department from that other exposure.  But I brought my tennis clothes with me, and sneakers. Keeler picked  me up Sunday morning. We went to the tennis courts just east of what   s  now the architecture department building. It was built in 1918 as the  ROTC building, including its natatorium. And there were these lovely  tennis courts with grass in between them and high bushes 360 degrees  around them. I got to play tennis with one of the great people of  Stillwater, Oklahoma, George Berry, the former president of Stillwater  National Bank and one of his Vice-Presidents, Pete Kiplinger. Now I   ve  forgotten who won. But it was just a great set of tennis, weather was  perfect. These were local people who made a very positive impression  on me. I didn   t realize that George was this millionaire and all that  because he was just a wonderful   as you know, having met him I   m  sure   down-to-earth lovely guy giving free tennis lessons to children,  including my son when we were out here. So that was a great  impression. And they had events for the faculty where I was questioned  and went around and met people and so on. I had brought a film with me  and I   d show scenes and I   d analyze for them, they   d want to see it. I  won   t mention names, but one professor had just been preferred over  another for full professorship and there was a lot of static in the air. And  I think they kind of forgot that I was there on a few occasions, they were  all so worried about the anger or they thought might be anger between  the two professors involved. So strange sort of circumstances.  Then when we drove out here, we came out early just to get settled,  came out in July instead of August, moved into a brand new apartment  complex in 1972 out on a very empty road, Perkins Road, nothing there  but all the fields and a few apartment houses. Of course, it   s changed  since then enormously. Now one of the economic arteries of Stillwater.  18  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  But any case, took a wrong turn. It wasn   t a wrong turn but I selected to  take Route-33 just to get a peak of Langston as I drove through. Then I  was taking a left on 177 at Perkins Road, I saw a mini tornado on a devil  duster out in a field, churning up dust. I thought,    Oh my goodness,  what   s happening?    And at that time, and I don   t think now, I don   t  think the southern approach to Stillwater is the most glamorous one you  could take. I   ll leave it at that. So I gradually got more and more  positively impressed. The campus is a lovely, lovely place as far as  Morrill Hall and English Department building at that point. I got a  terrific office. The former Head of the Department had some sort of  brain problem and had to go into the rest home. So I got his   not the  department head office but his back up scholarly office. So great office.  I was glad to have it. I had a nice Olympia typewriter there. A big office  typewriter. I have a story about Olympia typewriters I   d like to enter into  the record.  My first impression, I brought in books. I saw box after boxes and boxes  of books. And met Jack Campbell who was sort of the first sergeant of  the department, did the scheduling and everything to do with the plan. I  don   t know if you met Jack, but he   s a character to remember. He was  very welcoming and just a great guy. Jack could make you laugh under  the worse possible circumstances. Throughout my career here while he  was living, if I felt miserable I would go to Jack   s office and I would  leave happy and laughing. But in any case, I think the first impression  was the interview and moving here was the lovely campus. The weather  was hot. Didn   t have an air conditioned car at the time which I realize  was a necessity. But we had central heat in the brand new apartments,  we were the first people to move in. We landed well here in Stillwater.  So your first teaching assignments, do you recall what you were  teaching that first year?  The first teaching assignment of memory   I had a reduced load because  I was working with the Will Rogers Project   was the American novel.  That was one night a week, a two-and-a-half hour class. Basically I  started with Cooper and coming all the way   I   ve forgotten what was  the most recent work, maybe Grapes of Wrath, maybe something later  than that.  Did Mary Rohrberger teach that also?  And Dr. Rohrberger taught that. Other   s taught it, it was circulated on  the faculty. So that was my first class at night. I was very gung-ho so I  did a lot of student counseling and worked with them on their projects.  Had some funny experiences with the student excuses, why they  couldn   t show up for classes. I   ll give you one example. I got called  19  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins     (cough cough) Dr. Rollins, (cough) so sick (cough) can   t come to class  tonight.       Well that   s fine, if you   re that sick please don   t come to class,  you   ll get everybody else sick.       (Cough cough) Thank you.    Then I  called the girl back. She said,    Hi   Who   s this?    Of course she was  faking it. And then I had another excuse that was written by the doctor,  this girl was so sick that she missed class. So I called the doctor, I said  what the heck, it   s a new environment. I called the doctor   s office. It  turned out the letter had been forged by his secretary who was the  roommate of the student. So I sort of had a break-in lesson in how to  filter and evaluate student   s cases. The one that OSU students have used  for years which they think is a prima facie, unquestionable excuse is,     My pickup truck wouldn   t start.    Then I   d ask them,    Well do you live  in a community where there are other students?       Oh yeah a whole  bunch of students live around me.       Could you get a ride to campus?        No, my pick-up truck wouldn   t start.    So that was lesson number three,  I learned that pickup truck wouldn   t start seemed to be a prima facie, an  unquestionable excuse.  Well Peter, you talked a little bit earlier about Jack Campbell, could you  give us some names, are there some other faculty members and  administrators within the department and the university as well that  influenced you professionally and personally in your career?  Well Clinton Keeler definitely, by bringing me and in understanding  disciplinary interests scheduled me for things like the American Novel,  American Romanticism and a lot of other classes. I had you in a class, as  you know, and I   ve forgotten which one it was. It may have been  romanticism. It may have been something else. But I remember having  you in class, you were an excellent student.  You   ve got a faulty memory I think.  You were an A- student if I remember correctly. And another thing, you  were from History, which was unusual to have a history student, I don   t  think right, but it was unusual to have a history student in a literature  class. And you did well. I remember it very well. We were in Morrill  202 I think the corner room.  Ours was a graduate seminar class.  Was it?  I was working with Odie on my Ph.D.  Oh yeah. Odie Faulk was also a member.  20  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Dr.  David  Berkeley was shocked when I had a class under him as a  student athlete as an undergrad.     Sir I am informed that you are a student athlete   .     Yeah and we were doing Shakespeare and the whole bit.  Oh yeah. Dr. Berkeley was, I remember   you asked me influence,  Gordon Weaver was my department head. I was a graduate coordinator  with him. I had a very good experience with Gordon. John Crane was in  my department   I was trying to figure out what years, he left that job in  1988, went to be a dean out in California in I think Chico, Cal State-  Chico. But any case, he was the one who basically got the Regents  Professorship going. So in 1983 I was approved by the personal  committee, proved at the Dean   s level, and all the way up, so I could  became a Regents Professor in 1983 and was so until my retirement. I  have the distinction of being the lowest paid Regents Professor for all of  those years no matter who else was added. For all those years. And I  know this from research with the Department of Statistics here at the  university. I   m proud of that   Well you had another thing to be proud of, you were the first person in  the English Department   .  The first ever, and still the only one.     to have the Regents Distinguished Professorship.  Yeah, Regents Professorship. But that   s okay, I don   t mind being the  lowest paid. It   s a badge of honor.  Speaking of some of those things, could you share a little bit about   you  were teaching a novel course, but then could you share a little bit about  how your career evolved and fit into the curriculum of the department  over the years?  Well the English Department when I arrived here started a class on what  they called Film as Literature in which students read short stories  because Dr. Rohrberger was a short story enthusiast. Practically  speaking, probably a good technique for a classroom. They read short  stories and then they   d see a movie based on the short story and discuss  the differences and the similarities and the art form, which characters  they left out, the message and all that good stuff. And so that was on the  books when I got here. And then there was an interest on my part  working in film giving academic papers and national regional  conferences on film and the department, as many departments do, went  21  through a series of revamping the curriculum. And at one point they  went to generic descriptions. So we had an Introduction to Film, Film as  Literature, Film and Culture, Film as an Art Form and we sort of added a  slot all the way out and that was a natural formula and I sort of gradually  shifted over into that.  Every once in a while I taught a 7:00 Intro to Lit class. But generally  speaking I taught the film classes. And then we hired a guy called  Leonard Leff who was just a terrific asset to me and to the department  and to the students, loved by students and justifiably as a general, very  bright traditional scholar, no BS about theory and that sort of thing. A  productive scholar and independent thinker. So we were very lucky to  get him. He taught some of these classes as well. We worked together  well and then I think we   ve   as of today, I think there were probably  four or five faculty members teaching film. And then at the Introduction  to Film like the Introduction to Literature level, there are hundreds of  students taking such classes. So basically I get the credit for starting it. I  merely exploited the opportunity that had already been provided by Dr.  Rohrberger and the department to take the department in that direction.  But I was ready to go.  Sort of the way I capped my Will Rogers experience, I applied to the  National Endowment of the Humanities to make a film about Will  Rogers in the 1920s. And we did make Will Rogers    1920s Cowboys  Guide to the Time which is shown daily at the Will Rogers Memorial  today. I think they alternate with the NBC documentary, but be that as it  may. It was the first National Endowment of the Humanities Grant to  Oklahoma State University ever, and many such grants followed.  Some years later I was selected as a Kellogg Foundation National  Fellow; that was the first such award given to Oklahoma State and there  have been others to follow. I received a massive grant from the  Rockefeller Foundation to make the first Vietnam film. I don   t know if  we   ve tapped Rockefeller or not thereafter, but I broke the ice for OSU  and NEH. I think I   ve gotten a total of three or four grants from NEH  over the years, but others have too. I guess the bona fidas of OSU, I  helped get the bona fidas of OSU up there at the office which is down in  the pavilion of the old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, in the same  building there where the Endowment for the Arts, by the way, which  they were hoping to do for years. And I   ve got to say this, I applied for a  job there as a program officer, was interviewed. They asked me,    What  would be the first thing you do if you came into the National  Endowment as a program officer?    I said,    I would identify my  counterpart at the National Endowment for the Arts. We   d work  together, sometimes he   d get...    And then I was told,    Oh no, no, no, we  never talk to those people.    They were in the same building and had  22  Gill  Rollins  worked for like a decade together in the same building so they could  fulfill the same mission. And as a lesson there as I   ve seen elsewhere  certainly on this campus but in every bureaucracy, certainly in  Washington, it   s often that the passion for turf often overwhelms the  commitment to the mission to be carried out. And it   s silly and stupid  but everybody does that. I expect I   ve done that. But I   ve usually been  challenging somebody else   s turf, so I haven   t usually been the victim of  it.  I   m Peter Rollins. I   m being interviewed by Jerry Gill on this second  tape. Slate it.  You bet. Well Peter, in your lengthy career, you   ve researched,  published, and presented many formats and mediums including books  and articles, media, film, critiques, film documentaries, media  consultant, presenter. Do you have a favorite medium? A favorite role?  And if so, why?  Well it   s kind of tough to pick out one aspect or facet of being a  professor. I   ve been interested in most, but I can tick off a few. I   ve  always considered teaching my job, and I don   t mean that in a negative  way. That   s my job, I   m supposed to do it. I always came into the  classroom with a real or forced enthusiasm for the subject and always  communicated my enthusiasm whether I felt it or not because that was  my job and I wanted to perform it at the best of my ability. Now, I got  into the field of popular culture studies, which was a natural outgrowth  of history of American civilization work I had done. And I discovered  because I volunteered for it or because I was there that I had to get into a  lot of leadership positions in the popular culture movement. That meant  that I went to regional and national popular culture meetings every once  in a while and the national meeting all the time. I was President of the  National Organization from 1980 to 1982 and program chair for about  three years prior to that in sequence. And I invented the areas, or even  the whole concept of having area chairs that they use. I invented the  poster that they use and perfected the format for the programs that they  use, and the procedures.  Little things I did that other people wouldn   t think are important, but the  fact that let   s say you have ten panels on film, instead of having them all  occur in different rooms at different times, you put them all in the same  room seriatim. So somebody interested in film could just camp out there  and that would be like their home for the meeting. It seems like a small  point, but my predecessor in programming, you   d go to the third floor  for this and then the next logical thing you   d go to the first floor and  then back to the second floor. Chaotic. It was done I guess to suit the  typist or some other rationale rather than an intellectual one.  23  Gill  Rollins  So I got into these leadership roles, and I really enjoyed that. As I say, I  invented this area chair concept and I was and have been an area  chairman many, many times. That   s probably the most exciting role to  have for me because it forced me to be in discussion with people all over  the country, all over the world, about things that they were passionate  about, interested in, and I could share that excitement on a subject, so  being an area chair was an education unto itself, having a seminar across  the globe. I really enjoy that very much.  I believe that writing is important. Mr. Newsome back there at Brookline  High School showed me how difficult it was to write clearly and  effectively. So I   ve been a re-writer. Joe Stout, as I mentioned, he taught  me how to write directly and effectively, and that helped a lot, simplify.  So I enjoy writing but I do not find it easy to write. And anybody who   s  a good writer who says it   s easy is a liar as far as I know. I always try to  communicate that to students. If you are having trouble writing a paper,  getting your thoughts on paper, join the club. We   re all in that boat.  That   s why writing is important because you crystallize and distill and  put together ideas in a format that really brings things together in a way  that oral communication often does not. So I enjoy writing things down,  putting them on paper.  It   s hard to say I   ve enjoyed filmmaking. Filmmaking is a tremendous  amount of fun at times. But you   re dealing with many people, many  sources, many legal restrictions, many technical or perceived technical  restrictions and all these things add up. So I admire anybody that makes  a movie because of all the BS that goes along with it. You may have a  concept, you may know what you want to do, but that   s about 1/8 of the  project. Budget, personnel, location. One of the biggest tasks I had in  making a film was interviewing Walt Whitman Rostow at the LBJ  Presidential Library out on the lawn and getting the large fountain there  shut down for the interview. Dealing with the physical plant, the safety  and security   I mean, why do I have to do stuff like that? But it   s part of  filmmaking. So you really have to cut your way through a lot of jungle  to get the job done. The results are often memorable and of permanent  value.  You alluded to the Regents Professorship earlier, and you also received  the Distinguished Service Award and the National Lifetime Achievement  Award from the Popular Culture Association. Can you mention these  and other highlights, milestones in your career that were special to you?  Well I always felt that I ought to do 300  and I have been rewarded for  it. At OSU, I was without any question the most published professor in  the English Department. There is no question of it. Gordon Weaver  published a lot, but I was looking at his   I went back and looked at my  24  department heads on the internet, those I could find, and he sort of  tapered off after he retired. But me, I didn   t do that as a competitive  thing, but there it was. I got tenured first time around   quote    early  tenure,    whatever that means. And then the Regents Professorship in     83. I was the associate editor of the Journal of Popular Culture; I was  the associate editor of the Journal of American Culture; did the first  kickoff issue of the Journal of Regional Culture for Ray Brown; worked  with Mr. Brown in all sorts of way; was an officer at various levels and  President of the Culture Association. And I worked my heart out in these  things. People recognized the things that had been done because there is  a lot of lethargy and sloth in the world we live in and if you are working  and you are achieving and you are accomplishing you do stand out. It  just happens. So I didn   t have to do any back stage politicking for these  things. They were in many cases recognition.  Now why I could never get a pay raise that was more than the 2  salary  raise that everybody else got is beyond me. Although I do have an  interpretation of why, and I apologize for being a Vietnam veteran to all  who don   t appreciate Vietnam veterans, that   s all I can say. You know, I  propel that when I came out here, I had an interview at a four-year  college in western Massachusetts. The Vice President told   this was  when John Kerry was testifying to the Senate in the 1970s about all our  war crimes and et cetera and the Vice President of this four-year college  said, not to be named,    We don   t want your kind around here.    I said,     Excuse me?    He said,    We don   t want you here. You are a war  criminal, one of those Vietnam war criminals. We don   t want your kind  around here.    So that   s an ingredient that   s gone through the career also.  I do want to be remembered, if I am remembered, in part as an example  of Vietnam veterans who achieved something in civilian life after their  service. I   m not alone in that, believe me   the head of the American  Express and many other business leaders. John McCain, whom I know,  who I interviewed, he was in one of my films when he was a  Congressman. Served his country under much more difficult  circumstances than I did. But there are many, many who will testify, and  I actually have statistics of this in my writing, who will testify that they  are higher achievers because of their military experience rather than  being held back by it.  But there are many facets of being a professor and being an intellectual,  sometimes there   s what   s called a public intellectual, and I   ve pursued  those, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. I   ve given papers on  Vietnam at conferences where the panels have been picketed   in  Cincinnati the Young Socialist League picketed our presentation there.  So it   s been interesting.  25  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  I   m going to ask you a question here, I hope it makes sense to you.  Who   s the real Peter Rollins? There   s the former college rugby player,  the tough marine, the veteran of Vietnam. There   s the critical research  historian, there   s the popular culture guy. Who   s the real Peter Rollins?  What   s the ethos here?  The real Peter Rollins is the person who discovered as a freshman in  high school that through books and intellect you could pursue ideas and  themes in time and that you were geographically free to go anywhere  you want with the mind. And I   ve pursued that with great joy with the  excuse of being a college professor. As you know, Odie Faulk wrote a  book, This Beats Working for A Living  :The Dark Secrets of a College  Professor , well I know what he meant. Of course, he was one of the  hardest working people, in some respects, as you know from his history,  maybe too hard of a worker, he was too in a hurry. But when he said,     beats working for a living    he wrote that book because he had higher  respect for the duty of the professor and intellectual than he saw around  him. It wasn   t that he was lazy and he wanted to tell people how to be  lazy.  Well Peter, you talked earlier about students and the joy that that  brought to your teaching was an important thing. Can you share some  stories about your experiences with students, undergraduate, graduate  students that you taught and mentored?  Every class has its own personality, group personality. Some are good,  some are wonderful, some are average. Every once in a while there   s a  rotten one. It was important to me to communicate the seriousness of  what we were doing to the students. I discovered in the first year or two  at Oklahoma State that I had to make the humanities as demanding as  business professors made accounting demanding or the chemistry  professors made the chemistry demanding, or the students wouldn   t do  the homework and would sloth off. So I was a hard nose professor of  undergraduates and I have received, my wife asked me to mention this, I  received letters over the years of people saying,    You know when I had  you as a Professor, I hated you. And now that I   m eight or ten years out  of college, I now understand what you were trying to do, now that I   m  older.    And I can   t tell you what a thrill it is to get that sort of letter.  Now one of the things I did with students at OSU was immediately get  them going to conferences, graduate students, and getting them  published, you know get them started on book reviews, a book review  here, a book review there. My feeling being that if they were getting a  job at the end of the cycle, they had to distinguish themselves in more  than one way from other candidates for a job. And I had great luck with  that, both with the students producing and going to meetings. One of my  26  Gill  Rollins  students ended up the head of the English Department at North Adams  State College in Massachusetts. I remember he was a candidate   they  had 600 candidates. I remember calling in to the department and talking  to her,    This is really a hotshot person, Harris J. Elder. Pull his  vitae ,  take a look.       Oh yeah, this looks good. We   ll put him on the pile.    He  ended up being the chairman of that department for quite a while.  Recently, I had a back-to-school, some lady went out in business and  came back to school and got her Ph.D. in English/American Film  Studies. She   s now an assistant professor at Michigan State. They loved  her so much they made her the managing editor of the Journal of  Popular Culture. She   s had one book already, and she   s got one where  OU press is interested in the manuscript. She   s just a hotshot. And I had  something to do with inspiring her. People have a problem with me, but  once I become their mentor, it does not end at graduation. The harassing,  the demands for production, productivity do not end at graduation. I call  them, I write them, I ask them,    What   s happening in this project, why  isn   t it done?    And this can drive them nuts, but that   s just the way I am.  I had one student, Paul Walters who wrote a master   s thesis on Flannery  O   Conner, a good one; Flannery O   Conner and neo-orthodoxy, 1950s.  Really an excellent one. Too long of a story to get into it, but Paul had  some trouble with a journal up in Kansas which gave him instructions to  change the article in a certain way and they   d publish it. Well he sent it  back, and they sent it to other readers and they said to put back in the  things that he   d taken out, it was a separate set of readers. So he decided  to become a lawyer. He   s a lawyer down in Oklahoma City. But he in  his dedication says,    I want to thank Dr. Rollins for his dogged  dedication and supervising this project. And I want to thank myself for  putting up with his dogged determination.    That   s the best summary I  can give of the mentoring that goes on the graduate level. But I always  take pride in what they do.  Were your department, specifically, and the university, in general,  supportive of faculty needs and goals? Particularly, of you specifically?  I don   t know enough about budgeting at Oklahoma State. I always  thought of Oklahoma State as sort of a General Motors-type leadership,  which is things come from the top down rather than people at the lower  levels being consulted. That was just the leadership style that existed for  years. It may be less so now, but everything was Whitehurst says this  and Whitehurst says that. There   s a funny side of that. I was on the  curriculum committee my first semester here and we were picking  classes to show and that won   t get enough student credit hours and this  one, I said,    Why are we picking classes on the basis of student credit  hours? Who said we should?       Oh our budget is determined by  27  administration.    Well   it was Jack Kimball   I said,    Jack who said  that?       Whitehurst.       Well who in Whitehurst?       Vice President of  Academic Affairs.    So I called Vice President Boggs    office, talked to a  responsible person.    No, we never allot budget by student credit hours.  That   s a myth. It isn   t true.     So they had been essentially picking classes because their mindset was  top down, not on the virtue of what was there or how it fit to the needs  or appetites or creative interests and process but what would be  approved at a higher level. English had a constant problem with the  number of sections of comp which had to do with population coming in  that would juggle the budget. I   ve never dealt with budgets so I don   t  know what liberty there existed. I was always treated as a special person  by my department heads. Always. Like a thoroughbred. And I  appreciated it, I never complained about it. But overall, I mean the travel  support here is miserable. It always has been for professors. But I   m not  sure the money is available   or perceived to be available. And I won   t  get into budgets, I don   t want to get into the complaints. But I never  made any money here. I had a thrill. This was a great place to work. It  was a wonderful work bench.  The library that you and I are sitting in was a wonderful place to work  from. And what it lacked in books and journals and such, they made up  with by initiative on the part of the staff. I just saw Mr. Oberhelman  downstairs as I was coming back up. He   s just one in a long line of  people who are enthusiastic, extremely helpful, takes the initiative. Terry  Bassford was a terrific guy in that position. He ran things on the third  floor. Ken Tracy went out and started his own bookstore at some point;  he was terrific. They work well with my graduate students and work  well with me. I was going to say took initiative. I can   t say enough about  the library as a workbench for me. So that was a really positive thing.  And I don   t know if anyone will ever care about this, but having a carrel  at the library is a big deal for a true scholar. Because you could make  inside the building loans and you don   t have to take home 400 pounds of  books. They   re available there at the library. You can go up and pull  them out rather than somebody else send you a card and all that; it saves  money I think. But I had one of the early carrels because I caused such a  stink about it. I said I was guaranteed of it when I came out here, and I  don   t think I had been but I said it and they found one for me. I ended up  with the last ones with Professor Fischer, Professor Berkeley and I had  this last carrel. It was a noble brotherhood of scholars. But I hope when  the library goes underground, or whatever it   s going to go to, I think  someday they   re going to go down eight floors or whatever, that they  allot space for faculty carrels. Of course, you have to monitor these  things because some people like to work at home but they still want a  28  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  carrel for some reason, and they don   t rate one. I mean they   ve got to  use it or lose it. But it   s a tremendous   a real scholar needs that locked  place for inside the building loans and just to leave a sport coat while he  goes down the hallway. So I used it a lot.  Peter, looking at the English department, how has it evolved over the  years in your mind? And has it reflected, or how has it not reflected  national trends?  The OSU English department was pretty much an old school, or new  criticism type place like Dartmouth had been when I got here. And that  was the fad in graduate schools when these people went through. Except  for Keeler, Clint Keeler, who was interdisciplinary, and that   s why he  was so receptive to whatever talents I may have promised. But they were  pretty traditional scholars and most of them inactive or mediocre or  nonexistent in their publishing aspects, Dr. Berkeley being the  exception. Dr. Berkeley being a proud and active scholar and publisher  and producer of scholars who published and so on. And so I was an  oddball coming in, both because of the interdisciplinary and because of  the productivity. That was appreciated around here. And it was  interesting, I have not seen much of it since, but George Gries was the  Dean of Arts   Sciences when I came in, if I had an article published or  something significant, he   d write me a little note:    This is great, please  keep it up. George.    And you know, that meant something to me. I   d  urge that on any academic leader to take the time to reinforce   you  know, like a football coach. Tell them when they do something right.  Not just when they do something wrong.  Positive reinforcement.  Yeah, oh yeah. And over the years the department added things like  rhetoric and comp. That is, I guess you would say the scientific study of  writing and the teaching of writing. And that   s helped the composition  program enormously. It added technical writing, which for this school is  a perfect fit. It   s a technical school, pretty much. It added creative  writing which was a big impulsive   Gordon Weaver was the first major  creative writing   he attracted a lot of students, deservedly so. There was  a certain phrase while he was here, he was just dynamite, magnetic and  productive in attracting students from all over the place. We had  subsequent writers who were also good. We have the poet Ai, she   s the  big headliner here. She   s a very crafted poet, so we still have good  people here.  We added the film aspects of it. Now it   s become pretty much a multi-disciplinary  department. That   s sort of what   s happened nationally. I   m  an old fogey so I think a lot of the new things, probably the way the old  29  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  people did when I came in, thought the new things I was introducing  were frivolous, stupid, a reflection of the current intellectual fads. But  that   s just a typical old fogey attitude toward new things. I had the same  criticism made of me when I was introducing   I mean who wants to  study motion pictures? That   s ridiculous  Dr. Berkeley said to me once,     Sir, I do not approve of your field of study, but I do approve of your  industry in that field.     That sounds like him.  We made a 45-minute movie about Dr. Berkeley which I have here on  CDs. The library already owns it but I thought I   d bring one anyway. It   s  called The Best of the Old School. So he was the type of old school  scholar, but he was productive. I wouldn   t agree with everything he  would come up with, but at least he was productive and put things out  there on the table you could discuss   argue. Argue or agree with.  You must have had opportunities to teach, work in other universities and  other professional areas. What kept you at Oklahoma State University  all these years?  I   ve been away on a lot of grants over the period I was here.  Sabbaticals and things?  Yeah, supported by outside sources. With the, what do you call it? The  skin while the university takes overhead. Unlike a lot of people in the  humanities here, I   ve brought in thousands and thousands of dollars. Of  course I   ve had the advantage of go away and do this and in the mean  time bring grants to OSU. So it   s been a career while I have been away.  The funniest story in this regard is that I was offered a job over the table  like you and I are sitting in at Bowling Green State University in the  department of popular culture. And literally, as the offer was being  made, the phone between Ray Brown and me rang. Brrring, brrring. Ray  picks it up, it   s OSU. They want to talk to you. OSU had just gotten the  National Endowment grant to make the Will Rogers film. So back I  came. I would have enjoyed myself there, but I   ve enjoyed myself here,  I really have, and have been productive here.  Is there anything in particular that sticks out in your mind about why  you made your entire career here? When you said you   ve gone different  places, had different offers, there must have been some attraction to  Oklahoma State?  Well, there are   you   re leading the witness.  30  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Teasing him.  Leading the witness. I   ll say psychologically there   s an interesting point.  My dad was a lawyer in the same office, his firm, entire professional  career. My brother Phil was district attorney for Cape Cod for his entire  maturity once he was elected after the Kennedy fiasco. They kicked the  democrat out and voted as republican and he was there until he chose to  retire. There   s a big portrait of him in the courthouse. My brother Dan  worked as an electrical engineer for the government for his entire career  where he got a big high GS rating when he left. So there   s an example of  my family, people sort of not being unhappy with what they   re doing  and feeling like, oh let   s pull the roots out and see how the plant is  growing type of thing, but specifically with respect to me, like I said, the  library   s been wonderful. The department didn   t meddle in my desires to  float new courses and teach new subjects in new ways. A lot of places,  the curriculum committee has to go,    Oh look at this assignment, it   s too  short. Your third week there   s too much reading.    Meddling. And of  course if you want to meddle, you can really get carried away with it, as  we   re going to see with the new administration in Washington.  But be that as it may, nobody meddled if I can say it politely, nobody  meddled with me. And that was worth thousands of dollars   that  freedom and liberty. I mean, I   ve been free to do what I wanted, to do  the teaching enthusiastically, do the grant enthusiastically, do the  scholarship with flourish. I   ve just had really a gift in that regard. I  didn   t know at the time, but because I was giving money heavily to  TIAA-CREF I retire, and apropo of my salary, my salary went up  significantly. After I retired  I made it big. Big time. I have friends who  are making two or three times what I was making here, and weren   t half  as productive as I was. They were at engineering schools, but there they  would pay the humanities professors on the same platform as they would  the engineering professors. There   s no differential issue, nothing, or for  the record, the differential as I perceive it here is the humanities are  down and then slightly below the humanities, the art department. And  then way below the art department, the drama department. It   s an  unfortunate disgrace I think, but there it is. I think the new  administration, President Hargis, has different priorities. I hope that  works out.  I hope it does too. Peter, picking up some of your thoughts, good and  bad, favorite memories of Oklahoma State University, people, places,  events? Are there some special moments that you recall over the years?  Well I have some anecdotes here that I   ve written up with great detail  and effort that you might include in the record. But special moments:  coming down for the interview and the robins were hopping in the front  31  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  yard, it was 75 degrees, maybe 80. And I   d just come out of this blizzard  in Toledo, Ohio. You can   t tell me that isn   t significant  Getting my  carrel in the library, very important to me; working with graduate  students; working with undergraduate students who are serious. These  have been very special. But any particular moment that I can identify,  it   s more of an enjoyment of the    gemeinschaft    of the Stillwater and  Oklahoma State community. It   s less impersonal. What you see is what  you get. People try to be friendly. Sometimes they are too friendly. You  wonder why on earth this person   s so damn friendly. I do. It   s been a  pleasant atmosphere. Now another thing about Stillwater, then and now,  it   s small. It   s simple. I don   t like a disturbing or agitating external  environment. I   m busy thinking. I like a nice, simple, quiet environment  where I can drive down Sixth, take a left, pull in the driveway, watch the  news, have dinner, and work for three hours after dinner. That   s the  good life. In a small town environment, and whenever possible,  depending on where I lived, I used to bicycle or walk. And I would  walk   let   s say from campus, not from Morrill Hall, from Morrill Hall it  would be maybe three miles   but I   d walk, and I used my 3-Speed  Rudge sport bike at other times.  So the simplicity of life in Stillwater had a real benefit. Now people say,     Oh the restaurants are         who gives a damn? You know. I was told  once by a Jewish theologian that the best place to eat in town, if you   re  lucky, is at home.  That   s good.  I think so. And a lot of truth to it.  Has it been   other than salaries, I know we   ve talked about that   .  Oh did I mention that?     have there been frustrations and disappointments in your career?  I think the fact that I was a Vietnam veteran in the early days that I was  here was an honorific thing. As we got more sophisticated, as we got  people coming in, new people, it became a disgrace.    How terrible a  person could be involved in the military, oh my goodness     And so in  some respects, OSU has become very cosmopolitan. Part of which of  course is disdain or distaste or just plain repugnance for the military,  which, of course, came from the reporting of the 1960s and other times.  Now, as I say, in the early days it was an honorific title, but less so as  time went by. But that too encouraged me to make sure that veterans get  spoken for. So as recently as October I did a series of six lectures on the  American fighting man in film in Stillwater, the American Legion Hall  32  Gill  Rollins  and elsewhere. And when they had steak dinners, we had over 100  people there. When they served a steak dinner  But I had groupies, had  some groupies come down.  One of the reasons I did it is because I know I   of course we   ve now  won the war in Iraq, I don   t know if you   ve heard. During the war,  especially when it was getting bad, I   d wake up every morning feeling  miserable for the poor guys out there. Think of them getting up, putting  their boots on, cleaning their weapon. And I thought, well I bet you  every veteran feels that way. So I thought, well I   ll give a series of  lectures, and when their war comes up they come. I did World War II,  Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War; a series of six presentations. A lot of  work. I had PowerPoint, I had clips, and the films. It shocked me, the  AV equipment actually worked, every time. Shocking  Somebody   s got  to speak up for veterans, sometimes they can   t do it themselves. That   s  my job. I actually became sort of a regular defender of General  Westmoreland in print and elsewhere and had a lot of dealings with  General Westmoreland. Of course he   s the whipping boy. Everything  that went wrong in Vietnam was all his fault, according to historians.  You   re a historian, you know what I   m talking about.  Peter, looking back, what do you feel has been your legacy, to OSU and  to your profession?  Right. My wife and I talked about this. My legacy, I think, is that a  professor at Oklahoma State can be a world class scholar. I did it. My  track record shows it. As I   ve mentioned, I   ve given over 6,000 books to  the library or as we call it the li-berry. To the library. Each one has a  plate in there, you know,    Gift from Peter C. Rollins.    And when  somebody opens that book I want them to say,    I can be a world class  scholar too because I   m at Oklahoma State.    That would be the best  legacy.  The other would be that my Vietnam movies, which are still sold, still  sell on Amazon and elsewhere, narrated by Charlton Heston and hosted  on camera, that these continue to be used in the classrooms   and they  are   to provide a different point of view on the Vietnam experience so  that the flawed perceptions of the period, which work their way into  things like Hearts and Minds by Peter Davis or the WGBH series,  Vietnam in Television History, so that those distorted views of the  Vietnam experience don   t prevail and there   s a countering voice. And  my shows are now on DVD and they are documented. Now on DVD,  you can put in your computer and you can have PDF files of articles and  readings, all that sort of thing. So they have that and a 30 minute lecture  by me on the programs. And this is selling. It   s not selling like crazy, but  it   s selling. And teachers use this. That would be an important legacy  33  Gill  Rollins  too.  How do you hope people remember Peter Rollins?  How people remember Peter Rollins. It depends on who the person is  and where he is in his life. I   ve told you, I   ve had a number of students  who   ve written to me five, eight, ten years after they left OSU saying,    I  hated you. I didn   t know why you acted like that in class. Now that I   m  out in the working world I understand why you made such demands of  us. I try to make those demands on my people working with me and they  don   t understand just like I didn   t understand.    So with undergraduates I  think there   s a lot of that. Because of the boot camp mentoring attitude,  which continues long after the graduation of the graduate students, they  will remember me as a demanding setter of standards. What they don   t  know is that I have people setting   and I still do every day   setting  standards for me in memory that I   ll never live up to. I mean great  professors, even Orestes Brownson. I mean he was very nice to  complement me on that undergraduate essay. But this guy wrote these  many books.  I   ve done very little as compared to Brownson or Perry Miller, but  probably more than some of my mentors. One of my mentors wrote a  book that changed history, colonial history. I don   t think I   ve done   in  fact I know I haven   t done anything that dramatic. The other thing is as  an academic leader of popular culture, I took a magazine, Film and  History, which was  800,000 in debt. Had a tax rebate. I got them out of  debt, started it up, and now it   s a flourishing publication. Film and  History, an interdisciplinary journal on film and television studies. And  it   s on Muse, which is one of the big high octane internet resource  providers. Also on EBSCO and others. We know from statistics that  Film and History is read by at least 50,000 people when it comes out  electronically. It   s a much smaller hard copy subscription but every  research library in the country, including OSU, gets the journal. But  50,000 people. So that   s my legacy, I brought it up to that with the help  of my dear wife, I put together a proposal and had tentative offers from 4  major schools in the country to put Film and History there. Ended up  going to the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. They   re going to  actually put together a Film and History building sometime in the next  five or ten years and they will have conferences there. We already had a  conference this year in Chicago with 450 speakers. So that   s off on its  own, going on its own.  I started the regional pop culture organization on my own, I was joined  by a former student Michael Schoenecke, he   s a professor at Texas  Tech. And we passed that on to two young scholars, they   re carrying it  on. They meet in Albuquerque every year and that   s totally without my  34  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  help now. One of the things I learned, and I won   t mention any names,  one of the things I learned about the leaders, they stay too long. One of  the solutions is getting the system set up and the people set up to carry  on when you are gone. So both Film and History and Southwest where I  was involved, that has happened. They can live without me. In fact,  sometimes I resent the fact that they   ll live without me.  Life   s going to go on without you?  Status anxiety. I   ve got time for one more question.  Well that brings me to my concluding question, perfect timing.  That   s good.  I was going to ask you, are you going to tell us about your bucket list? I  mean you   re retired now. What are some of the things that are important  to you now?  Well I worked for two years with some help from the English  department. But two years. I put together a CD-ROM called The  Benjamin Lee Whorf Legacy. Now Whorf is a person over whom I wrote  my dissertation. He was a linguist who was very much into the conflict  of science and religion in the 1920s. Wrote a novel, and hope to get  involved in a debate with Mink and the novel wasn   t published. I had  access to his papers which were later destroyed by somebody. Yale has  some of them and I have many that they do not. But I saved them and I  saved them and I saved them. Finally I did a CD-ROM of his papers that  were given to me by the wife, my dissertation, I had a book I wrote on  Whorf, I wrote various articles on Whorf. All of those are on the CD that  is Word searchable. It   s called the Legacy    Now this has already been  purchased by Harvard, Chicago, Michigan State. Michael Harris  has  helped  to get them in research libraries so that others can do research on  Benjamin Lee Whorf, a person about whom when I went on job  interviews the people would say who? Who? Was he related to Richard  Whorf? Richard Whorf is a Hollywood actor. He was, he was his  brother. But any case, that   s one.  I finished this Why We Fought America   s Wars in Film and History. It  was just picked this month as one of the top 15 books on film by Choice  Magazine, a publication of the American Library Association. And  that   s a big deal. The publisher has been approached in the last two  weeks by the History Book Club to consider it as an offering from the  History Book Club, which is, in terms of popular readership, that   s a big  deal.  35  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  And this is all in your retirement.  Yeah.  Quote unquote.  Yeah. But I love and live that role as a professor. That   s what I am. And  not every moment is joyful and sometimes I have to bark like a dog to  tell people to leave me alone so I can continue to do it. You know, if you  work at home people assume you don   t have anything to do. I   m serious   I learned to cope with that a long time ago, but if you work at your  house, they   ll call you up and,    Can you watch the dog for me? Would  you take the cat out at three? And let   s go to lunch.    And stuff like this. I  have certain set work hours and I just don   t answer the phone. Although,  I   ll always answer when you call.  And I   m going in for open heart surgery, so I finished my Selected  Writings, I   ve been working on that for two years, got that done, 600  pages. Got it to a publisher, they are distributing it to jurors, so while  I   m being operated on it   ll be evaluated. If I live through the operation,  which I   m hoping to do, I   ll come back out, polish it up, and my  Selected Writings will be   which were published in disparate places. I  started some magazines that failed. Vietnam Veterans Institute Journal.  I had, I don   t how many, five issues and then I left the organization and  it just went downhill. Or they chose not to carry on, and they did other  things, they had dances and so on for veterans, which are good too.  But any case, if I live through this operation, which I assume I will, I   m  going to set free a little bit and I   ve got a lot of things that I   ve always  wanted to do, which I haven   t done. I always wanted to go back and re-read  Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Now I   ve already done that.  And also, you can get it on tape  With two British actors reading it. The  distinguished statribution of the metaphoric polysiaic. And I just love  when you can put it in the car and drive around listening to The Decline  and Fall of the Roman Empire. And here   s a question for you: according  to Gibbon, what was the key development in roman history that brought  down the Roman Empire?  I   ve got to tell you, it   s been so long.  Well no, there   s no reason. I   d forgotten too.  I   ve forgotten. I   m sorry  It was the removal of the praetorian occurrence from the prominence of  the praetorian guard as a unit in Rome. Eventually they ended up picking  36  Gill  Rollins  Gill  Rollins  who was in charge of the Senate, murdering those who gave them a hard  time. A real lesson in the over-centralization of power, which the people  who wrote the Federalist papers knew a lot about and tried to   they said  you couldn   t avoid faction, but you could try to structure government to  limit the impact.  Peter, I appreciate it. I know it   s been a long interview for you. Just to  give you one last question. Is there anything we haven   t covered that  you   d like us to record while we   re talking today?  Well, I   d like to reiterate, since I   ve said it three times now, I   m  reiterating that the Edmon Low Library was a wonderful work bench for  me and what deficiencies it had by the virtue of the collection are more  than made up by the creative and self-starting initiative of the librarians,  the humanities librarians with whom I worked with. Enormously  grateful for that. As Mr. Besford, Terry Besford, told me and my  graduate students once that the 45 made everybody equal in the frontier,  and interlibrary loan made every scholar equal worldwide. The  interlibrary loan services have always been terrific. You can now order  them on the internet. So what we lack maybe in our core collection is  made up for by the initiative and services that the library has worked out  and that big collection in Chicago. So I   m eternally grateful to the  library as a work bench. And honestly a craftsman has to have a work  bench. So I had one, the Edmon Low Library.  We appreciate it very much.  And I enjoyed having students like you. (Laughter) You were a good  student.  -------  -------
