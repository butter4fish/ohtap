 Larson  Today is October 28, 2011. My name is Mary Larson, and we   re here  with Jerry Dunn from the class of 1961. We are at the Edmon Low  Library today as part of the Homecoming festivities. Mrs. Dunn, thank  you so much for agreeing to do this today. We really appreciate it.  Welcome back to OSU for your fiftieth reunion   Thank you.  Were there some special reasons you decided to come back for this  particular reunion?  Well, this was my hometown, first of all. We live in Dallas, so it   s a  convenient trip to visit friends. Some of them are living here, and we   re  going to stay with them. We   re football fans, sports fans. My husband is  a golf professional, so sports is a venue we love, and that   s why we   re  here.  So what are some of the things you   re looking forward to seeing or  doing while you   re back in Stillwater?  Well, even as we came into town, it   s always just fun to see the familiar  spots and how the names have changed of some of the places that are the  campus life. We didn   t have Eskimo Joe   s, but on that same street was a  place called Swim   s, on the corner, and then it became something else  even while we were here. There was a Chili Bowl in one of the houses  that we would always have some lunch in. How the buildings have  changed, some of them, not all of them. Many, many new buildings.  This was a brand new building when I started here, as was the Student  Union.  Doesn   t have that new-building smell anymore, does it?  5  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  No, it doesn   t. (Laughter) Yes, that   s true.  You mentioned that you grew up in Stillwater. Can you tell me a little bit  about your early years?  Well, the early years. My mother was a teacher, a widow, and we moved  here when I was five or six because she wanted to make sure that I had  an opportunity to go to college if her circumstances never changed. So  that   s why we were in Stillwater. She got an opportunity to teach at their  high school. It was a college town, so that was the plus.  What subjects did your mother teach?  She was first an English teacher. Didn   t like the seventh-grade boys and  the way they didn   t like English, so she got her master   s in business.  They needed to learn to type and shorthand because they were going to  work, so they were serious students.  So you grew up around all of this on campus.  Yes, yes.  What were your impressions of campus when you were a youngster?  You just took it for granted. It was here. It was part of your backyard.  You played here. You went here. In fact, all of our girlfriends in junior  high, we would meet and pay fifty cents to sit in the end zone at the  football games for the college. It was always fun because my maiden  name was Lewis and I always thought, well, maybe Lewis Field at that  time was someone in my family. It wasn   t, but, you know, you kind of  thought,    Well, maybe that   s a good name to have.    So my name was  Jerry Lewis. In that time, he was the comedian of the moment. I won  many elections with that name. (Laughter)  We   ll talk a little bit about your political involvement on campus as we  go through this. You came to OSU because it was your hometown  university?  Actually, no. I had an opportunity   a lot of my family had gone to  Texas Christian. When it just came down to the wire, I knew too much  about it here. It was very comfortable, and all my friends were going.  Everybody went here. We scattered into different sororities, different  groups, different things in college, but it was the best place to go as far  as we were concerned.  What was your major?  6  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  My major was elementary education, but I had minors in both English  and business. My mother made sure I got the business, and I liked the  English. Then I needed to know that I could teach, and I did, so that was  good. It was a great education.  Very practical set of degrees.  Yes.  Did you have any scholarships or a job?  I had a scholarship. It was a county scholarship, I think at that time, a  hundred dollars. As we   d been looking at what the different tuitions are  at places and it was giving the 1961 tuition, it   s mind boggling to think  that we probably went for about a thousand a year. It was probably less  than that because I didn   t live in the dorm. I did live in the sorority  house part of the time. Whenever someone would go out to teach, I  would live for six weeks, and maybe one year I lived the whole year. I  loved that. I loved being on campus. Being an only child, that was  exciting and wonderful to be out with everybody else, so it was fun.  Your mother was continuing to teach in the high school?  Yes, she was, and in the meantime, she had married. He had gone to  college here. He had been raised here, and she had finished at  Northeastern State Teachers College, but she got her master   s here after  we had moved here.  So you have some very deep roots.  Yes, very much so.  What were some of the classes that you particularly remember?  Some of the classes, there were some very interesting classes. One of my  favorites was sociology with Dr. Mayes. I remember his name  particularly. Also, economics. I do not remember his name. It was a  Russian kind of name. I can see him still, and I remember it was a real  foreign subject for me at the time. At that time, you didn   t pay too much  attention. No one in the family talked too much about stocks or  economics or the world situation. I remember taking almost verbatim  notes and then going home and typing them up. By having studied them  twice, then when I reviewed them, I made an A in the class, not because  I knew so much, but because I had really studied and wanted to know. It  was a very valuable class for me, and it has had a continued interest for  7  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  me since that time. The sociology, of course, would be fascinating for all  of us. We weren   t talking much psychology or sociology in those times.  He was quite a maverick in his field. Not in my particular class, but I  think he had had a woman of ill repute from somewhere in the area  come and speak to the class. That, of course, caused a total buzz all over  campus. You know, it was a business, so it was a sociological study, so  to speak. Anyway, for that time, it was quite unusual to have that  happen. Had a lot of good teachers, lot of good professors.  So there were people doing some cutting edge things?  Oh, yes. Definitely. Definitely.  Were there any other faculty members you felt were influential in your  development?  Yes, there was a marriage class, and that was fascinating. Things were  just not talked about much in those days. You saw your own  relationships, but you never thought too much about it, your family  relationships. Of course, every girl came to college in those days  thinking they were going to marry. I didn   t come to get married, but I  knew that probably I hoped to. It was a fascinating class, and I met lots  of interesting people talking about lots of different things. That was a  very practical class, I thought. I loved all my English classes. The  Chaucer class with, I think it was, Dr.  Loyd  Douglas was wonderful. I  had a Milton class, and I think maybe he was the one that did Paradise  Lost. Those were things that were really brand new for me, yet I loved  the literature, so that was a special part of the college. My mother had  not wanted to teach it, so I didn   t determine to teach it, either. I wanted  to know it, so that was very special. Those classes were great.  Hence, the mixture of your degree.  Yes.  Where were most of your classes, as far as buildings go?  Let   s see. Oh, my goodness. They were right there by the Student Union.  A lot of them were by the Student Union, the first building there. I can   t  remember the name of it. I had some in Gardiner  Art Gallery . Not  Gardiner. Morrill was education at that time. I think in the meantime it  has been something else. There was a lot of walking. I lived at the far  end of University  Avenue . We walked everywhere. Never could wear  pants on campus except Fridays. Certainly different than today. There  were lots of cold winter days. You walked to class, and the wind was  blowing, and you saw your classmates all over campus. It was a  8  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  relatively small, almost private-school size at that time. It was probably  less than ten thousand. Maybe ten thousand. So it was small classes and  there was still lots of international students because of the Point Four  Program that Dr.  Henry  Bennett had set up. I was very familiar with  that because my best friend   s father was vice president, Dr.  Albert E.   Darlow. She and I, actually, in high school served the banquet through  the Student Union. Got fifty cents an hour by serving Haile Selassie  when he was here for his visit to the campus with the Point Four  Program. Our agriculture departments were teaching Ethiopia and many  of the other Point Four programs in the world how to do agriculture.  That must have been very exciting.  It was.  What do you remember from that event?  Oh, I remember we were in our little uniforms, and we were earning  fifty cents an hour. We were probably juniors or seniors in high school.  Everybody signed up to do it. A lot of us had worked there in the  summers when they   d have conventions at the college. We weren   t  necessarily serving the room where he was because it was a big, big  event, but we got to see him, and we watched the other room where he  was. It was fun. It was a very memorable occasion for us to see a world  leader at that time making   not that he made a difference later, but he  did at that time because he was listening to some of the things in the  Western attitudes and the Western ways to improve his country.  We   ve done a series of interviews with some of the families that had  gone over as part of the Point Four Program.  Have you? Oh, good. Okay.  How aware were students of what was going on with the Point Four  Program?  I don   t know that there was a lot of awareness. I wasn   t greatly aware of  it. We knew the university was very involved worldwide, and that was  certainly a point of pride. We were happy to have had that part of our  culture and to have had so many international students. In high school,  even, we had an organization called IUO, International Understanding  Organization, in which we would have speakers come who were the  foreign and international students. We   d come, and we would have  foods, and they would tell us about their country and all that. So it was a  very open kind of town in that regard.  9  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Do you remember any of the Ethiopian exchange students?  Yes. Oh, my goodness. I wish I   d known to think of it earlier. He was  from Pakistan, and he was really a best friend of one of my good friends,  Tommy Hanks. It hasn   t come to me. I can   t remember what his name  was. (Laughs)  You can fill it in later.  He was a very nice person, and I   m sure my friend Tommy has kept  touch with him through the years. I   d be interested to know what that  relationship developed in with the country and the problems there. My  stepfather went to Pakistan in the    70s, I believe it was, mid-   60s to    70s,  worked for the Ford Foundation there. I think it may have been part of  something to do with the Point Four Program. It was particularly with  the Ford Foundation.  So your stepfather was in agriculture?  Yes. Yes he was with the United States Department of Agriculture,  which they have a big office here. He would go out   his job was to go  with the legal people to the farmers and tell them what they could or  couldn   t grow because of what they needed and what they didn   t need.  He was here at the time that there was a big scandal with Billie Sol Estes  in Texas. It was very distressing to him because he liked his job. He  respected all the people, and I remember his being very disappointed  that there would be that kind of publicity for the department that he had  worked for, paying people to store nothing. I guess maybe because he  was involved in that, I had a sensitivity to the things going on in the  agriculture world, although my grandparents, none of them were  agriculture people. They were business people. It was, still. Because he  was, it was interesting.  Where was your family before you came to Stillwater with your mom?  My grandparents lived in Stillwell, Oklahoma. They had seven children,  my mother being the second of the seven. They all went to college. It  was Depression time for most of them, many of them, and he said,     There   s nothing else I can give you except for you to go to college.    He  was, in his day, the entrepreneur of his day. He had been a book  salesman from Tennessee, and then he came to Oklahoma and was  selling books here. Then he and his brother decided they were going to  start the telephones in Oklahoma, so they borrowed five hundred dollars  and bought a telephone exchange piece unit from Sears Roebuck. They  started stringing the wires and started getting customers. It grew to be  bought out many years later by Continental Telephone, so it was a  10  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  major, it was truly a pioneer.  And what was your mother   s maiden name?  Holt.  Okay. Now, getting back to your time at OSU, did you spend a lot of  time in the library?  Yes, actually I started in the library because I did join a sorority and they  had study hours. It was very important. They were interested in you  doing well in school as well as making sure you   d done well before you  got there. We had our study hour here. Whatever nights it was, Tuesday  and Thursday probably, we had to spend three hours here. They counted  the hours, we wrote it down, we checked in, we checked out. From that,  too, we learned to use the library because we were here. It was easy to  get to the stacks and the places we needed to look something up. It was  always very important to me. As a little girl living here, I would walk  from the school where I was, at Eugene Field, which is now at the end of  Sixth Street and is a grocery store. I would walk to the downtown  library, which was at Sixth and Husband, after school, and I could either  be at the library waiting for my mother or I could be in the teachers     lounge waiting for my mother. So the library was very important to me  and always has been.  So you would   ve remembered the earlier library, too, on campus?  Probably, but I probably didn   t have much reason to be here for the  earlier library. I   ve even jumped in the pool at slumber parties.  So you were well acquainted with the library. Are there other memories  you have of it, as well?  Oh, yes. The Homecoming parade, that was always fun to make floats  and to stay up late and have blurry eyes doing that. I rode in a parade on  one of the floats one time. I think it was education queen. We were on  the back of a car. Another year was riding the bicycles for Mortar Board.  That was fun. We rode tandem, double bicycles. That was always fun.  Some years it was very cold. Some years it was just like it is this  weekend, lovely.  You mentioned that you were in a sorority and that you lived at home  part of the time     Yes, part of the time.  11  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn     and in the sorority part of the time?  Yes. That was great for me. In the sorority house, we changed  roommates every six weeks. We just took the drawers out of the chests  and took it to the next room we   d been assigned to with the new  roommates, and the clothes hanging in the closet and took it down.  That   s all we had to move. It gave us a wonderful opportunity. In fact,  I   m here this weekend staying with a friend that was in my sorority, and  picked up a friend that was in my sorority who then later introduced me  to the man that became my husband. It   s all intertwined. It   s a great  mixture of good times and studies. I was one of probably ten in my  sorority class that stayed here to graduate without being married. In  those days, many girls got married in their sophomore year, their junior  year, maybe even freshman year. The timing was such that I wasn   t  going to get married during college. I had things I needed to do, I  wanted to do. Probably hadn   t met the right man, either, but I did meet  him my junior year. We got engaged, and I ended up going to do  graduate study at Kansas State for a semester and then came back. We  got married right after he graduated.  Do you want to talk a little bit about how you two met?  Oh, my goodness, it   s all around here. Yes, it was great fun. My friend  and I, that we drove up here for Homecoming with, we were walking  through the Student Union. In those days, you dated many people at the  same time. You could have a date at eight o   clock and one at ten  o   clock. It was one boy one night, and the other   it was told to us that  this was the way you got acquainted with personalities and to know  which kind you really liked the personalities of. I took that seriously and  enjoyed every bit of it.  It ended up that I was walking through the Union with my friend  Martha. It so happened our sorority was having a party. I had three boys  that I really kind of liked and was dating, but I couldn   t invite any one of  them because they would know that I didn   t invite them to the party, so I  thought I needed a dark horse. I told Martha, I said,    I have got to find  someone else to take to the party.    As we were walking through the  Union, I looked over there, and here was this tall blonde. I guess he was  tall, but he was blonde, very blonde man, sitting with some of the  international students playing Bridge. I thought,    Well, now, he   s a cute  Swede. I probably should take him to the party,    just jokingly. She said,     He   s not a Swede. He   s from my hometown, and my boyfriend knows  him very well.    I said,    Well, then, okay. Tell him that I would like to  get to know him or maybe invite him to this party.     As time went on, and not very long, her boyfriend went out and was  12  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  studying with my husband, who lived at the REA  Rural Electrification  Association  Building and cleaned the place and also took the storm  calls when the REA people lost their electricity. They could live there  for free. He went out to study with him, and he said,    I know someone  that would like to have a date with you.    My husband   s name is Cotton,  so Cotton said to Dike, who was my friend Martha   s boyfriend,    Who is  it? Who wants to have a date?    He said,    Jerry Ann Lewis.    He said,     You have been in my wallet.    Martha   s friend said,    What do you  mean? What are you talking about?    My not-yet boyfriend pulled out his  wallet, pulled out a picture of me that had been in the O   Colly when he  came back from the army. He   d been in the army for two years. He   d  seen me with somebody at a softball game, and he thought,    I   m going  to have a date with her when I can afford a sport coat.     I invited him to the party. He called me, and I invited him to the party.  We went to the party and had a wonderful time, and then he didn   t call.  Well, then a friend of mine came in town. She was going out with  somebody, but they didn   t have a car. I said,    Well, you can borrow my  daddy   s fishing car, but you have to go to the Pizza Palace,    Pizza-whatever  it was called,    down on Washington Street because that   s  where Cotton works on Saturday nights. He may be there and come in,  and you have to tell him that you   re my friend.    This was Bonnie  Carbury. She lived in Guthrie, and she   d left school, and she was now  working in the City. She was coming back here just for the weekend.  They went in the pizza place after they   d gone to a movie, and this big  tall person walks in and says,    I   ve hit a car out here. It   s a black  Dodge.    Bonnie says,    It   s Jerry Ann   s  It   s Jerry Ann   s  It   s Jerry  Ann   s dad   s car.    So from that, he had to call me and apologize for  having hit my dad   s car. Then we dated forever. That was it. That was  the forever. (Laughs)  So you knew?  It was meant. It was ordained. To have my picture in his wallet, who  would   ve thought? What are the chances?  That   s wonderful. Talking about the sorority house and everything and  dating, were there curfews that you remember?  Oh, definitely, yes. The lights would flick when it was time to come in,  and I think, probably, it was eleven o   clock on the weekends. You were  really in trouble if you missed the curfew. One time I did. I went to  Tulsa to a basketball game, and we got back after the hours. Another  girlfriend and I had driven over. You didn   t drive very many places from  campus at that time. I didn   t. The housemother was not happy.  13  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  We are not amused. (Laughter) Well, do you remember if the young men  at the time had a similar curfew, or if they had one at all?  I don   t think they did. I don   t really think they did. One of the boys I  dated was a basketball player. I don   t remember him having a curfew.  They lived in an athletic dorm setting. Of course, no girls were allowed  there, and no boys were allowed in, other than on the first floor, of our  house. Although, we had a houseboy who helped serve our meals and do  things around the house, who had a room in the downstairs area where  we had our study area at the sorority house. I guess there were boys in  the house but not upstairs. (Laughs)  Would he have been a student?  Yes, he was a student. That was his job. He was earning money to be  able to stay in school. Lots of people with jobs part of the time in school.  Right, right. Now, with your sorority, was Homecoming a big deal?  Oh, definitely. It was. It was great.  What was involved back then?  Well, at that time, we would have not only a float but we would have a  house decoration. I suppose they were costly. I don   t remember anything  about the cost, but they somehow came up with it. One time the motor  went out underneath the float, and we had two of the fraternity boys   at  that time, I don   t think you did it with another sorority or fraternity. You  just did it with your own house. We had helpers. Two of the boys were  under there moving the thing along. We would   ve probably been  disqualified had they known that someone was under there in danger,  but we won. It was Jack Frost, and we had three beautiful turntables with  red and yellow and orange that were going around, and Jack Frost was  sitting up there with his big paintbrush. It was beautiful. It was really  lovely.  What year would that have been?  That was probably    58 or    59. Then the other one, maybe in    57, was  Cinderella   s pumpkin. That was beautiful. That was actually, I think,  designed by the friend we   re staying with, Suzanne Fenton Carpenter.  She was quite artistic and wonderful, so that was a really beautiful one.  What else do you remember about the Homecoming events when you  were in college?  14  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Well, we would go to the games, and we were dressed up, pretty much. I  don   t remember it being that cold. I remember going, and we would  sometimes have mums if we had a date. I happened to be dating a  football player, so I went to the game with girlfriends. I did have a  corsage, so that was fun. I don   t remember too much other than it was  always the ballgame was special. I think they must   ve had a dance  afterwards in the evening. They didn   t have any basketball like they do  now. We did have pep rallies, but they would be on campus somewhere.  I think I was here, or maybe it was the year before I was here that they  had a panty raid in one of the new dorms. The guys somehow got into  the dormitory. That   s what they called it. They just took stuff out of the  girls    rooms, you know? I think they got in a lot of trouble for that. I  wasn   t in the dorms, so I don   t know whether it was that year or whether  it was another year. It was new, Stout Hall. It was Stout Hall.  Okay. Now, which sorority were you in?  I was in Kappa Alpha Theta, which is why Theta Pond is named Theta  Pond because the original house was across the street from the pond  when OSU started or when A M started. It was one of the first ones  here long ago, so it had a lot of history, also, which was fun. The house  was at the way end of the street, a big Tudor house. It was great. We had  a wonderful time. When I was here, they had the Rush in the dormitory  because it was being refurbished and made bigger. I didn   t think  anything about it because I hadn   t been, except to dinners. They invited  the Stillwater girls to dinners during the spring of their senior year so  they   d have a chance to get better acquainted with them, which they  didn   t really get to do too much, although we had summer parties all  over the state.  One year, I was Rush chairman, and the girls in the different cities like  Edmond or Ada or Ponca City or Oklahoma City, they would plan the  party and invite the girls that they were interested in maybe pledging.  Then our Rush team would be in a car, and there would be about eight of  us that would go to all the parties. They were actually pretty lavish,  interesting, with cute invitations. I wish I   d saved them because it was  very creative. Everything was. Several years after that when kids began  to work in the summers all the time, it became too difficult for  everybody to do that, which is probably a good idea.  It sounds like you would have been very busy, then.  It was very busy, and it was a creative kind of thing. You were meeting  people, and I went to summer school in Colorado one summer. The  chairman at the house called me and said,    There   s a girl that   s coming  to college from Greeley, Colorado.    I was in Boulder, and she said,  15  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn     Would there be any chance of you meeting her?    I said,    Certainly, I   d  be glad to. Give me her number, and I   ll call her and see if we can make  an arrangement to meet each other.    We did, and two other of my best  friends who were in other sororities, we were all there together for the  summer. My friend Judy came over from Greeley. I didn   t know her at  the time, but she came over. We became best friends forever, and she  was my maid of honor. Now lives in Dallas, very near me. We do lots of  things together. She   s coming this weekend, too.  How many women would you say were living in the sorority?  I think there were probably eighty to ninety, maybe eighty to a hundred.  I think now they can house maybe more than that. We were never  allowed to live off campus. You could move in if you were a  sophomore. I was able to move in because they had expanded the house.  I did move in January after I had pledged, so I was there the second  semester of my freshman year and a good bit of my sophomore year. I  did my student teaching, and then I finished a semester early because I  lived in town and I did summer schools a lot. I was able to finish early  but still came back and graduated.  Speaking of summer school, from what I understand, you started college  the summer right after you graduated from high school.  Yes. We took four hours, a whole group of us. It was kind of the thing to  do was to take the four-hour English class. You got it over with because  that was going to be the most difficult to work in, doing a paper during  the fall semester when everything else was new. So we took it in the  summer, and we wrote a paper every other day. Mrs.  Ruth  Orr was our  instructor. It was wonderful. She was absolutely fantastic. Loved her,  loved the class. She taught us great. It was no problem after having  written a paper every other day, almost, to write papers when they came  up in college. It was a great experience. That intensified writing was  very valuable.  And from what I understand, the week you started was the same week  that the university had its name change.  Yes it was. That was pretty exciting. I don   t know that we really knew  what it meant because we   d always loved Oklahoma A M, but we  became a university. I don   t know that there were any classes that  changed or whatever, but I guess it gave it a broader chance for the  future for expansion and that kind of thing. It was great. We loved being  a part of it. They no longer wore beanies. I don   t know where that got  lost, but when we got here   years before, I remember being in high  school, watching the kids that were on campus as freshmen would wear  16  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  these little orange and black beanies that had a little whirly thing on top.  I remember when we came, they didn   t have them, not that we wanted  them, but they didn   t have them. (Laughter)  So it was both the girls and the boys.  I think so. I   m pretty sure.  So by the time you got here     They didn   t have to do that.  Now, you mentioned Theta Pond a few minutes ago. Do you remember  hearing stories of the alligator in Theta Pond?  I don   t. I don   t remember the alligator. All I remember was throwing  people   they threw the boys in Theta Pond when they got engaged. That  was always sort of, I guess, fun. I don   t know that there was an alligator  in there. (Laughter) That may have come later.  You had mentioned earlier, too, that they had expanded your sorority  house.  Yes.  Were there issues at the time with space and housing?  I think probably so. They were building lots of new dormitories.  Everything was growing and expanding. The sorority houses were  considered part of campus housing, therefore that took part of the  pressure off the university for having had to do that. I don   t know about  the land situation. Whether the land is owned by the campus, I just don   t  know that. It seemed to me there might   ve been something that the  universities worked with the national organizations to help them be able  to provide more housing. That was probably the way it was. I went later  to start a chapter of my sorority at Kansas State. That year right after I  graduated in January, I got a fellowship to start that chapter at Kansas  State University. KU had a good chapter of my sorority, and they came  and helped us do the parties. The other girl from Ohio and I did it.  We came, and I went to that fiftieth anniversary this spring and saw  those girls that we had met and had pledged that spring. Of the thirty,  there were seventeen that were able to still come. It was great, and they  took us around and showed us where they had originally been in the  house, what some of the stories were. We basically pledged them,  trained them. We moved to an apartment. That way, we could learn to  17  Larson  Dunn  sing. We could teach them the songs and do all the things that you would  like to do as a group, and then we left. Now I think in the sorority  system, the Greek system, they send someone to stay with that chapter  for that first year. I don   t think they did at that time. We didn   t realize  quite the pressure we were under to teach them everything, to be the  officers, to be giving the Rush party, to do everything. They were some  special girls to have done that. It was a real pleasure to see what had  been accomplished. It was wonderful. The leadership skills that are  taught in a smaller setting like that are really something that you take  with you in organizations and the church you go to and the ladies    and  women   s groups in the community and in the state.  I didn   t happen to get involved in any of the state political things  because we lived in New York in the summers and then traveled some in  the golf tour in the winter. We went permanently to New England to  Boston where my husband had his first position as a golf professional.  We would go to Florida in the winters, so there wasn   t any place that I  was going to be able to invest myself totally, all year long. I just was  able to do whatever I could do in my church and in the golf wives. There  weren   t any alumni groups of OSU in those places because we were on  the East Coast, and they didn   t know anything past the Mississippi.  Probably my sorority had a group in every city up in that area, so I  tended to be involved occasionally with them. That was an entr  e to  meet young women.  Now, you mentioned the leadership skills that it taught you. What other  campus activities and organizations were you involved with? You  mentioned earlier that there were a couple of others that     Well, I started out with the honoraries, with the academics. That was  probably my main forte. Then the Education Student Council, I was on  that and the women   s student council which was called the Association  of Women Students. I worked in that, and we planned things for the  entire women   s organization, all the women on campus. It had nothing  to do with the sororities or anything else. It was for all the women. It  was great. Dean  Zelma  Patchin was the Dean of Women at that time.  Learned a great deal from her. You have to realize this was    57 to    61,  and there was a great deal of unrest going on in the country with  integration. I was very positive about the equality of all of us. We really  had no black athletes or very many black students here at the time.  I had been integrated in my senior year in high school here, and I felt  that it was totally appropriate. So when they had a few sit-ins here in  town at the drugstore, I thought,    Well, absolutely.    I wasn   t radical  about it, but I just thought,    People need to know that this is the thing  that is appropriate. It needs to be spoken as a positive,    so I would go. I  18  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  was then soon president of the women   s association, and I was asked not  to do that. I, at the time, did not rebel against that. I thought,    Well,  okay, maybe I shouldn   t do that.    If it were to be done now, I would  probably have had an answer and say,    We all have to make our choices,  and in my opinion, this is the way we need to go.     Then, I think it was that year, one of the first black football players and  first black basketball players came here. One of them happened to have  been from my boyfriend   s hometown. I think it was Fritz Greer was his  name. I didn   t know my boyfriend at that time, but in later years, when  we talked about it, he was from Duncan, Oklahoma. As we   ve seen now,  I noticed that this weekend there   s the black golf tournament. I thought,     Good for them.    They certainly went a different road when they had to  come here. I   m sure it was not easy. Even though we   re not the deep  south, there was still probably a lot of difficulty for them along the way.  It   s very good to see the success. We went to the bowl game where  Barry Sanders had been named Heisman Trophy winner, so that was  special. We have a picture of myself and our daughter with him, and that  was fun. He   s a nice man.  Now, you mentioned some of the sit-ins and so on. What was the general  feeling in town, do you think, at the time?  I think probably there was a positive feeling about it. I don   t think that it  went too far. I think that it was a natural thing. It was probably at the  drugstores. That same drugstore downtown on the corner of Fourth and  Main, (I don   t remember who owned that drugstore) I would go there in  high school to lunch every day our senior year with all my friends. We  had a ham salad sandwich every day. Behind the counter, working there,  was Jo Ann Roderick. Myron Roderick, they were dating at the time,  and he was sitting down at the other end. Of course, we didn   t know  who they were, but somebody pointed out that he was a wrestler on  campus and very well known. I didn   t know her at all, but we all thought  that was so special. In the later years, then, I still have lots of close  friends here, and she   s involved with lots of them in her sorority life.  We   ve all grown old together. He   s certainly done a wonderful thing for  this campus and for the Wrestling Hall of Fame and all the international  Olympic everything. So that was kind of a little aside from having lived  in Stillwater and kind of starting early, recognizing some of these good  things.  That would be one student hangout off campus. You mentioned Swim   s a  little earlier, I think.  Yes. There weren   t any bars, of course, because it was a dry state. I   m  sure that there were parties where it was available somehow, but it was  19  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  never anything that we became accustomed to at all, which I think  served us very well because it   s never been important. I like a glass of  wine at a nice dinner if we   re out, something like that, but it never  became a habit that was associated with having a good time. I   m sorry  that some of the future generations haven   t had that experience to know  that that   s not necessary in the part of their entertainment, but they do  have a good time. I don   t know what the   is it twenty-one or eighteen?  Is it twenty-one?  Twenty-one.  They seem to know about it earlier, don   t they? (Laughter)  Which theaters do you remember?  The Aggie Theater and the Leachman Theater. There was also a campus  theater where I had one of my first dates with my husband, and we went  to see Roman Holiday. It   s where one of my high school classmates has  his pizza, Hideaway, now. That was where it was. Richard Dermer was  in my high school class, and he was the editor of our yearbook. He went  on to discover the game Pente, and then he   s also a world-class kite  flyer. He   s a very unusual, very interesting man, very smart man and  was great in our class. We loved him. We   ve had lots of class reunions  here, too, so I   ve gotten to come back occasionally for those. Twenty  years we were away, so other than to come back to see my family, we  were never here. They died when we moved to Dallas, so we didn   t get  back in time to have much time to come back to see them here. We did  Christmases most of the time, so that was great.  So you had the off-campus hangouts. What about with your friends, with  the other women in your sorority or sometimes on dates, what were the  on-campus things you would do?  I guess we went to parties at the fraternity houses and had our own  parties. They were pretty much in-house or something going on. We still  had proms at the Student Union in the ballroom. They would have a big,  maybe, Sigma Chi dance or a Beta dance, and they were costumed many  times. I remember going to a pajama party at the SAE  Sigma Alpha  Epsilon  house, and we all had to wear   I wore flannel pajamas. That  was fun. We always had party pics, and those were always fun. I still  have those, and they   re hysterical. There was a kid party at the Beta  House, and you dressed like a kid. High socks, and bows in your hair,  and little short dresses. The guys looked awfully funny in their short  shorts and bows and hats, kid hats. Then there was a half-formal that the  Phi Delts had, which you could either use the top or bottom. The top  would be formal, and the bottom would be jeans. Jeans weren   t as  20  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  popular at that time, but I guess we all had a pair of jeans. I don   t  remember much about jeans. We liked nice clothes. We liked pretty  clothes. We weren   t obsessed with it, but we did like them and wanted to  look our best. Wore hats to church and gloves to church.  Well, and you still had the dress code on campus, too.  Yes, we did. We took our housemother to church every Sunday.  Somebody did. It was assigned who would do that. One of my daughters  went to Southern Methodist University. Actually, they both did, but one  pledged a sorority. I was at a mothers    thing there, and they were  introducing the new housemother. They were telling a little bit about her  and where she had grown up. It was the daughter of my housemother.  My housemother had a daughter that was now my daughter   s  housemother.  What are the chances?  Absolutely. My housemother   s daughter had gone to OU. It was all  mixed up. I thought,    Isn   t this a small world?     That   s amazing.  It is. It was fun.  So do you remember, beyond Homecoming and some of the sorority  parties, what some of the traditions were on campus during the years  you were here?  Yes, the Varsity Revue was great fun, and the Sing, the Spring Sing, the  Fall Sing. I think maybe the dormitories by that time were also doing it,  so it wasn   t strictly a Greek thing. I   m not sure about Varsity Revue, but  it was always fun. They always had great shows, and one of my friends  was Miss Varsity Revue. Actually, I wore her wedding dress in my  wedding, so there   s just a lot of intertwined things. That was always a  great show. There were lots of talented people that helped put all that  together in all those groups. That was really at a time that you don   t  think of   we didn   t do much television. We   d had television for a few  years, but you didn   t have the hoopla and see all the big shows, the big  musicals coming through like they do in the cities now. We may have  been to New York City occasionally, maybe once or twice. I went once.  I took my grandparents once and my mother. I didn   t learn how to do  that. I didn   t learn how to do it, but there were plenty of talented people  in the arts here at OSU that certainly knew how to do all of that.  And did you have bands coming through?  21  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Oh, yes, the Shadow Lake Eight were great. That was our own campus  band out of our own band people. One of my boyfriends played the  piano for that one. I liked to dance, so I didn   t keep going with him  because I wanted someone to dance with. If he was playing the piano,  who could I dance with? So, anyway, that was kind of fun. They were  great musicians, and they performed in the summers at different places  like Noel, Missouri, and resort places around the country. Les Brown  and his orchestra, the Allied Arts, all those came. I remember seeing Ray  Charles and big jazz artists, Ramsey Lewis and his jazz people. Oscar  Levant, I may have seen him when I was in high school because the  townspeople could also go. It was great experience to have all these  wonderful arts come to a college town, which I think is still one of the  reasons that lots of people move back to college towns. At one time it  was much less expensive to be able to enjoy the sports and the arts in  college towns that were sort of autonomous like the College Stations, the  Wacos, and the Stillwaters, rather than city schools because the prices  are much more reasonable. They can   t get the seventy-five dollar tickets  like they can from people in the cities. I don   t know about that one  anymore. I think they seem to pay quite a bit for their football tickets.  (Laughs)  Speaking of football, do you remember the first Pistol Pete mascot?  You know, I don   t. Isn   t that funny? I do remember who it was, and I  remember knowing the story of Frank Eaton, but I don   t remember the  costume. I don   t know. It   s strange that I wouldn   t remember that.  Maybe if I saw a picture from that time or looked through my yearbook  and looked at it, I probably would. I knew it was Pistol Pete. I knew that  there was a mascot.  Now, just to change direction a little bit, what were some of the changes  that you noticed occurring on campus during the years that you were  here? You had a broader view of it since you   d grown up here, so you   d  been able to see a longer version of it.  Well, it may have been a little like watching a child grow, though. You  don   t see the inches as they creep up. You don   t see the changes because  you   re right there. We loved the Student Union. It was a great meeting  place, and between classes you could go up there and dance. They had a  jukebox, and it was acceptable to do that. I don   t know that in some of  the next generations they danced very much, so I think they kind of lost  that sociability. When I came, they were dancing through college, and  not wastefully, (it was one of your entertainments) and free. It was pretty  free. Having Cokes in the Student Union and that kind of thing. Going  through the cafeteria line to have lunch if you wanted to not eat  22  wherever you were living.  I don   t know when the changes happened because I got a letter after we  were living in New York for my husband   s job. The question they sent  to me, (I think they must   ve sent it to a lot of the student leaders and the  Mortar Board, in particular) they said, about working women, this was  the question, something like this,    Do you feel working women are more  fulfilled than non-working women?    I   d taught school for two years  while my husband traveled on the golf tour. I would certainly have  rather been out there. On the other hand, that was our opportunity for  him to get to go do that, so I was glad to do that.  I also had a friend whose mother worked as a standup clerk in an  Anthony   s store. I knew that that was not a fulfillment for her. She was  doing what she needed to do to make sure her kids got to college after  her husband was killed in the war. My mother worked because she was a  widow. She was fulfilled to a certain point that she felt that she was  doing what she needed to do, but so far as working because you   re  fulfilled, I said,    That   s only if you   re an artist or have a passion for  something. Otherwise, your work is for a reason.    It may be fulfilling, it  may be for the money, or it may be for the purpose of getting a kid  through college. I can   t measure fulfillment. I don   t know the word  fulfillment in that regard because I think there can be many successes in  that realm. I think maybe the working women, that may have been some  of the changes.  When we went to college, we really had very few choices of things we  might become, or we thought we did. One was teacher, one was  secretary, one was, maybe, physical therapy. That was another one that I  considered. They weren   t big-time jobs, necessarily. You didn   t think  about going out and owning a business, necessarily. There may have  been those that did, but I didn   t, even though I came from a family that  did own a business. That may have been a change. The women were  starting to change. It was the time of Betty Friedan. That was one of the  books we read. There was beginning to be change of the women  becoming more independent, which that was okay.  Then it got so extreme, when I had children, that it was almost like if  you didn   t work you weren   t of any value. It sort of went way over.  There were lots of women that didn   t have families deliberately because  they felt like that was   they weren   t going to do that, maybe by choice,  maybe not. They may have been influenced. I remember Betty Friedan  in later years, apologizing to a generation of women whom she misled  that there was only one way. I think that was a great learning for me to  know in life there   s not just one way. You have to be understanding,  tolerant, look at both sides. I did some debating, and I think that there  23  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  needs to be debate starting in the third grade because there are always  both sides to every issue. We need to be better informed about  everything. I think our generation was maybe a little behind on that for  our time and that maybe the future generations began to be a little more  involved in what important issues needed to be discussed and for us to  be a part of.  It sounds like there was change as far as the racial makeup on the  campus during the time you were here.  Definitely, yes, and to me it wasn   t particularly noticeable because I had  had it in high school, too. It was something I agreed with and was very  positive about.  So do you have some favorite memories of OSU that you haven   t talked  about yet?  Well, I don   t know. I think it   s the friendships, the people that have  continued to be like my sisters, being an only child. The investment in  each other during those years that were pretty carefree in a lot of ways  were wonderful. Being in each other   s weddings, going on girl trips,  going on the sneak to Dallas with the seniors that were left at the  sorority house. There was just lots of   we didn   t go very far. We didn   t  do much in Oklahoma City. We didn   t do much in Tulsa. Everything  was right here. It was sufficient. The people, the games, we might go to  Tulsa to a game, but we wouldn   t go very far to a game. Maybe some  did, but I just had a great time here. Part of it was social, but part of it  was academic. I was very focused on my academics. I wanted to do  well. I wanted to achieve. My mother instilled that in me, that it was  extremely important. If you had god-given gifts, you treat them well. It  was an all-encompassing campus experience for me.  Okay, well, we had talked earlier about how you met your husband, and  you mentioned a little bit about how you moved around over the years.  Do you want to talk a little bit about what you two did after you  graduated from college and how all that developed?  Sure. We   ve had a golden life in a lot of ways, and we have been  married fifty years this year. My mother and father were not particularly  delighted that I was going to marry him. I broke an engagement with  him once because as an only child I wanted my parents to like the  situation. They weren   t verbally against it, but they weren   t particularly  interested in a golf pro. I didn   t know he was going to be a golf pro. He  was studying to be a CPA, so I thought, well, that means he   s smart. I  didn   t really know about his golf, but lo and behold, later I learned that  he   d been national junior champion in the United States. I guess I  24  could   ve assumed that he might want to do golf somewhere, and he was  on the golf team here.  He   d gone to the University of Houston the first two years, which was  the national championship team. As a national champion, that was where  he gravitated to. Got a wonderful scholarship, supposedly, there, but he  was from a non-college family. Didn   t have any help, no one to advise  him, no one to have had any experience. When he went there, he had no  car, no money, nothing. He bummed a ride to the golf course. He gave  half of his food stipend to another golfer that had no food stipend. After  a year and a half, it was such a struggle that he decided that he could not  stay down there, so he came back and came here for part of the spring  semester and then realized that he did not know what he wanted to do.  He was spinning his wheels. I didn   t know him at this time.  Then he joined the army. It was peace time, and he says the whole time  he was in the active army he guessed he kept peace because there was no  fighting anywhere. He was actually on the airplane to be sent to Korea,  and this was, again, before I knew him. Lo and behold, they called his  name to get off the plane, and he didn   t have any idea why. They were in  Seattle or wherever it was they were changing planes to go to Korea. He  had been traded. At that time, they had football teams and golf teams  and basketball teams on all the posts around the country where the army  could be entertaining themselves. They needed a golfer at Lawton,  which was fifteen miles from Duncan, Oklahoma, his home town. He  was sent to Lawton to play on the post team.  He could type real well and had had some college, so they put him in  charge of supplies or something so he could keep track of everything  and type and do all that. He was to meet the general at noon every day at  the golf course. Chi Chi Rodriguez was there but didn   t make the team,  so that was kind of interesting. Anyway, he was traded to go to Lawton  on that post golf team because wherever he had been, Fort Lewis in  Colorado needed a football player, and it was Ralph Gugliemi, who had  been in the University of  Notre Dame , I guess. I wasn   t familiar with  the name, but all the men knew that name. So that   s where he was  during the service.  After he finished his two years of active duty, he came to OSU to school  and got a partial scholarship. He had been a basketball player, too, so he  played to start the fall before the junior-college players could be eligible  for the second semester to play. He played as the practice team for Mr.  Iba because he   d been an outstanding basketball player, too, but he  didn   t come here to play basketball. He played on the golf team, also,  and became All American here. We are just thrilled at what golf has  done through the years here. They   ve certainly done good, done really  25  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  wonderful things for the reputation of the school and the golf.  You mentioned you   ve lived a number of places.  We did. He worked as an accountant in Oklahoma City for a year or so.  The Oklahoma City Open came through there, and he decided to try out  for it. He did well, led the first day, then didn   t lead. He decided from  that   all his friends were there that he had played competitive golf with  for years through all the parts of the United States. He said,    Would you  think about going and doing this?    I said, (what did I know?)    Sure, this  will be great.    Anyway, it has been a wonderful experience, and we   ve  made great friends everywhere.  When we lived in New York, in the summers, particularly, five years in  the summer, the pro there was an old Italian, Jack Patroni. He wore a  suit and tie to do his teaching. He became ill while we were there, so for  three years Cotton ran his business for him. It was right outside New  York City in Westchester County called Apawamis. It was really a  wonderful thing. One of our best friends, Terry Wilcox, who had also  been a golfer here, he and my husband had grown up together. He was at  the Apawamis first. When we decided to go and do the tour, Terry went  on to another job, and Cotton took the job he had at the Apawamis.  We   ve kept touch with them all through the years, and they   re great  friends. They live in the Palm Springs area now. From there, we began  to have children. We had two daughters, and then we went to Boston and  lived outside Boston for the next thirteen years, really raised our  daughters there. It was a great experience to be there.  Where outside of Boston?  Danvers, Massachusetts, and his club was in Salem, Massachusetts.  Interestingly enough, Danvers, Massachusetts, was where the witch  hangings were. They changed their name because they did not want to  be associated with it. It was Salem Village at that time. Salem Village  became Danvers so that they didn   t have anything to do with that, but  the house is still there, one of the ones that was hanged. So, anyway, it  was quite an experience, and it was really great. We go back every  summer to visit friends there at the club where he was. We did leave in  the winter, and often times we would lease our house to a hockey player  for the Boston Bruins, so then we had the money to go lease a place in  Florida for three months.  The other golf pros from New England and New York would often do  the same thing, and we had sort of a colony of golf pros and wives and  kids that all went to school down there. We called ourselves the high-class  gypsies. It was great, and it didn   t hurt our kids in their academics  26  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  Larson  at all. The fact that I   d been a teacher was helpful. They could take their  work with them. I   m not sure their teachers in New England were very  happy with it, but we decided the best place to be was with Dad, and we  didn   t need to be in the snow in his career. (Laughs) That was okay.  Then we went back to Dallas. We finally got back to God   s country.  Have been in Dallas now   he was twenty-five years at Prestonwood  Country Club in Dallas. Went there to help build a second course for  them. Had one owner. He worked for one owner for twenty-five years,  and he was a blessing for us.  That   s unheard of.  Yes. My husband was quite a freethinker in his own way, a maverick.  He wanted to do things the way he felt should be done by the  professional, and this man let it be done. That way he didn   t have a  board telling him what he needed to be doing. It was God   s way of  putting him in the right place. He   s been retired now, and they had a  great party, big party for him when he turned seventy, had been with the  club twenty-five years, and was retiring. That was almost four years ago.  Just to wrap up, what impact would you say that OSU had on your lives?  It   s just in the bones, truly. In fact, when we moved way off and were on  the East Coast for so long, we missed everybody. We knew no one there  except for our one golf friend, and they left there eventually. He said,     Anytime we go to a bowl game, we   ll go.    In that time period, we  weren   t always going to bowl games, and I think he felt very safe to say  that. Then we began to go to bowl games. We would come home for  Christmas and either come early and go to the bowl game or stay and go  to the bowl game over the New Year   s time. We   d grown with the  knowledge that life is just good. Whatever happens is supposed to  happen, and our blood is orange. That   s all I can tell you. (Laughs)  What advice would you give to OSU students today?  Just savor the time you   re here and don   t hurry it. Enjoy it. Make sure  you get in on all of it. Be the spectator at the sports. Be the participant in  the intramurals. Be the participant in the things you can sing, at the Sing.  Join a club. Do something in the dorms. If they have the social groups  now, do it. Try to be an officer so that you   re really involved. Try to  build a float for Homecoming. Be a part of it all rather than just a  spectator. Spend some time at the library, but don   t spend all your time  at the library because there will be more memories of all of it if you can  have all of it.  Well, I   d like to thank you for sitting down with us today. Is there  27  Dunn  Larson  Dunn  anything that we didn   t talk about that you   d like to add at this point?  I   ll probably think about it tomorrow. (Laughter) It was my pleasure to  share what OSU has meant to me. I really did start when it became OSU,  and that was pretty special. That same week, it became the Big Eight.  OSU joined the Big Eight. I guess I   m a historical figure at this point in  my family. That   s one of the things: you don   t grow old if you keep the  memories of all those special times when you were young and got to this  place.  Thank you, again. We really appreciate it.  Thank you. I enjoyed being here with you.  -------  -------
