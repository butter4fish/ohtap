 Little Thunder Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Friday, December 4, 2015. I   m  interviewing Bob Crocker for the Cowboy in Every County Series sponsored  by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University. Mr. Crocker, you got your undergraduate degree in physics from  OSU, did part-time teaching at a vo-tech school, and then went back and got  your master   s in adult education while also earning your living farming. I  look forward to learning more about your life, career, and your OSU  memories. Thank you for speaking with me.  Crocker You   re welcome.  Little Thunder Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Crocker I was born in Henryetta, Oklahoma, and until I was about six years old, we  lived in Macintosh County near Eufaula. At that time, my parents moved to  Stone Bluff, Oklahoma. They were both school teachers at the time. We  lived there until I was in the sixth grade, then we moved to Bixby. I finished  high school then in Bixby. From there went to Oklahoma State.  Little Thunder What did your   you mentioned that they were both school teachers, your  mom and dad?  Crocker They were both school teachers. My dad also had farmed and ranched as he  grew up and he continued to do that as he taught. When we moved to Bixby,  they bought a farm in Bixby and built a house there. That   s where I grew up  after sixth grade. That farm has since been sold, but that is where I was  living when I went to OSU.  Little Thunder Any brothers or sisters?  Crocker I had one sister Nedra; she currently lives in Stillwater. She is a retired  school teacher from Stillwater Public Schools.  5  Little Thunder It ran in the family didn   t it?  Crocker Yes.  Little Thunder What was Bixby like when you were growing up?  Crocker It was a   probably a pretty typical small town self-contained community.  Principally a rural community. It was close enough to Tulsa that a lot of  people lived there and worked in Tulsa and drove back and forth. But it was  like a lot of small towns of the    50s and    60s where you had a complete  economy in the town. You had stores, you had clothing stores, hardware  stores, gas stations, so it was a little self-contained community. Nice place to  live.  Little Thunder What were your chores around the farm?  Crocker They were the chores that every farm boy goes through. You fed cattle, you  milked cows, you worked the fields in the summer and the winter, pretty  typical rural upbringing. You did everything. Yeah.  Little Thunder What did you do for fun?  Crocker Well, I always said I had a charmed childhood. I had a horse, a dog, and a  twenty-two. (Laughs) Fun, I loved to hunt. I loved to fish, loved to ride  horses, get together with friends, horseback and we would ride. Then, as I  got older, I became very interested in cars. I have been a gear head ever  since. That   s what we did for fun.  Little Thunder What were your favorite subjects in school?  Crocker Science and math were my favorite subjects. Also, I really enjoyed reading  history. I liked history and I continued that my whole life. Probably in high  school, my favorite subjects were chemistry and physics and math. Those  were the things I liked.  Little Thunder Were you sort of on a science track by high school?  Crocker I think so. I think I wanted to do that. That   s the reason that I enrolled in  science at OSU when I did. I think I was on a science track by high school.  Little Thunder How did you end up choosing OSU for college?  Crocker Had friends who went to OSU. I thought that if you were going to pursue a  study in science you probably should go to OSU or OU  University of  Oklahoma , one of the two. Since I had a lot of friends at OSU, one of my  good high school classmates went to OSU on a football scholarship. Others  6  went there like myself in science and engineering, so it was pretty well not a  question, I was going to go to OSU.  Little Thunder And probably pretty well not a question if you were going to go to college  either?  Crocker No, that was not a question. I was going to go to college.  Little Thunder Your parents would see to that.  Crocker Yeah.  Little Thunder So what years did you attend OSU?  Crocker From sixty, I enrolled in the Fall of    60, and graduated in the summer of    64.  After that, I had   at OSU, I was in advanced ROTC. I got a commission in  the Army following graduation. Then, went on active duty in the army of  September of    64.  Little Thunder Okay, all right. We will talk about that a little more too. When you enter as  a freshman, are you planning on a physics major per say?  Crocker Not necessarily per say. I had enjoyed high school. Just decided to enroll in  that. A bachelor   s in physics is pretty much a general science degree. That is  the reason that I enrolled in physics.  Little Thunder Who is a professor or professors who stood out for you?  Crocker At OSU? Well I   ve been thinking about this since we talked about the  interview. I can recall the amusing ones, not the difficult ones. (Laughter) I  had one math professor I thought of often, I think his name was Professor  Shultz. As I recall, he was a small man, he wore the same sport coat every  day, and he would draw vectors on the board in the math class, and he had  his sport coat pockets full of colored chalk. He would draw vectors on the  board with red shanks and yellow heads. By the time class was over, it   d  look like the coloring board. He was a great professor. The other thing  unusual about him, he required you to take math tests in bluebooks. Not a lot  of people probably don   t remember blue books. That was unusual for the  math professor because you would have to bring quite a stack of bluebooks  to do a test. I remember him. Another one that was actually a chemistry  professor, Colonel Breedlove, he had been a chemical officer in World War  II, and of course, this was just fifteen years after the end of World War II.  He loved to regale us with stories of his World War II experiences. He also  had a favorite faux student that he called S. L. Jones, Slow-Learner Jones.  Slow-Learner was always the guy that could not get the concept in  7  chemistry class. He was a great professor. I had a lot of good professors at  OSU.  Little Thunder What buildings did you have most of your classes in?  Crocker Well the chemistry/physics building, classroom building, Whitehurst, those  are the ones that I remember. I think it was Whitehurst where you had to go  to enroll in classes. At that time, you had to go get cards. Then, you go over  if you had a class that was difficult to get in that you needed, you would  have to go at like three a.m. in the morning to get in line to make sure you  got at the head of the line to get in that class, because once it filled up, you  couldn   t get in. That was the process then.  Little Thunder My goodness, that   s devotion.  Crocker Well, everybody did it. That   s the way you did it if you had classes that you  really needed to get in that semester, you had to go through that process, so  I   ve done that several times. You go over there early, way before daylight,  and wait to get into that class.  Little Thunder Get your place in line.  Crocker Now of course, it   s all computerized, but this was long before that.  Little Thunder What was the environment on campus outside of the sciences track like do  you think?  Crocker It was friendly. Student Union was popular. The gathering place. I used to,  there were ongoing chess and bridge games at the Student Union where you  could just sit down and join in.  Little Thunder You didn   t play for money though?  Crocker No, not for money, didn   t have any. (Laughs) No, it was a friendly campus.  A very friendly campus.  Little Thunder Where did you live?  Crocker I lived off campus all four years. I lived, I think it was, I guess it was  Willard Hall on Knoblock, I lived right across the street from that my first  year, then I moved down to 324 1/2 South Knoblock. I remember that  address well because I lived there two or three years. It was right down the  alley from the Hideaway Pizza. I lived off campus. We would, usually I  lived with one or two other guys, and we would make our own meals, which  was a lot of fried spam and other unhealthy things.  8  Little Thunder Were they, some of the friends that had gone to OSU?  Crocker No, they were not. Let   s see. No, they were, the first year I lived with, it was  a big boarding house and I lived with one person from Bixby who had been  a friend in high school, and after that it was other guys I met at school.  Little Thunder Were you also working part time?  Crocker I worked some. I worked at a grocery store on North Main Street, some part  time. But usually not, I usually did not work part time, but I did one  semester, I worked over there.  Little Thunder What other types of activities or on campus organizations were you involved  with?  Crocker Well, other than partying, which maybe we should avoid, (Laughter) I did  play a bit of golf in those days. Wasn   t any good at it. The golf course then  was out north of town. I   d go out there and play golf some. Other than that,  not much in a way of activities on campus. Other than going out with friends  to eat and things like that.  Little Thunder What sporting events did you attend?  Crocker Well, my favorites were the wrestling matches. (Course OSU has a  tremendous wrestling program). As I recall, the four years I was there, we  won the national championship three. OU was the runner up and the other  three years we won it, I think OU was the runner up. I would even go to OU  to the matches. I was a big wrestling fan. We had a tremendous program. I  like basketball. We go to basketball games. But without a doubt wrestling  was my favorite.  Little Thunder Had you done some of that in high school?  Crocker No, I had not, I was not a wrestler. I was too skinny. We had a great  wrestling program Myron Roderick was the coach. He is famous over there.  Little Thunder Right?  Crocker Yes.  Little Thunder What was your favorite place on campus?  Crocker Probably the Student Union. Went there about every day and drank coffee or  visit. I expect it   s still a favorite place.  Little Thunder What do you recall about any campus traditions?  9  Crocker Campus tradition? Nothing comes to mind as far as a campus tradition. I can  recall some specific campus events that were meaningful to me. Particularly,  I was in school when John Kennedy was assassinated. They had a memorial  service on the steps of the library two or three days after his death. I  remember that specifically. That was a difficult time. The other thing I  remember that while I was in school that stands out is the Cuban missile  crisis. I was in ROTC. Course this was the time of the draft. Most men there,  if they weren   t in school, they were drafted. You know, for a few days, we  thought we might be going to war. Everybody was glued to the TV. The  same with when John Kennedy was assassinated for two or three days all  you did was wanted the news. Those two events have stayed with me all  these years. I remember those well, particularly that memorial service for  John Kennedy.  Little Thunder How did classes handle that? Because I know that sometimes professors,  you know, when that is heavy on students    minds?  Crocker I don   t recall any classes being canceled. Now they were canceled for that  memorial service. As I recall, it was like ten o   clock in the morning one  morning. I think President Willham spoke, president of the student body  spoke, perhaps a minister or two, but they were canceled for that and it was  a big attendance. The quad out in front was pretty filled. I remember that  one.  Little Thunder Tell me a little bit about dating?  Crocker Dating? Well, I had a couple, three girlfriends, and most of the time, I was  in school. I did have an automobile. Dating was a pretty typical thing there. I  would go to movies, go out to eat.  Little Thunder Where did you go to the movies?  Crocker Well, I can   t remember the name of that theatre. It was down on Main  Street. Don   t remember the name of it. That   s where we would go movies,  and go get pizza or something. That was about it.  Little Thunder Right? You were probably popular with that car? (Laughter)  Crocker Yeah, I probably was. I did have a car most of the time I was there.  Little Thunder How often did you go home while you were in school?  Crocker Oh it kind of tapered off the longer you were gone. When I first started off,  every couple, three weekends. Then, less and less. I   d typically get home at  10  least once a month even all through the school. It was fairly close. Two-hour  drive, easy to get to.  Little Thunder Brought some of your friends home too?  Crocker Yes, they   d ride home with me. We would carpool back and forth.  Little Thunder What do you remember about Homecoming?  Crocker Let   s see. I remember a couple of Homecomings. I guess, I was in a military  society called Scabbard and Blade. Seemed like, maybe it was Scabbard and  Blade, we worked the concession stands during Homecoming, a couple of  games. We didn   t have a particularly successful football program in that era.  It was hard to beat Nebraska or OU and those were the ones that counted. I  would usually go to Homecoming.  Little Thunder You mentioned the memorial service at the library but any other memories  of the library?  Crocker Spent a good bit of time there, but it   s a nice library. Nothing particular  other than that memorial service that stands out.  Little Thunder How about Theta Pond or     Crocker I remember there was a   I don   t know what organization that was. They  had the, Theta Pond was kind of run down. There was a group on campus  organized a clean-up. Went over there a couple of Saturdays and helped  clean up Theta Pond, and made quite an improvement on it. It was a central  point of the campus.  Little Thunder How about any pranks?  Crocker Pranks?  Little Thunder Any school pranks?  Crocker No. I wouldn   t admit those anyway.  Little Thunder (Laughter) What are your memories of the town of Stillwater?  Crocker Well, I remember Swim   s drugstore. That was a popular place. Went there  to drink coffee a lot because I lived pretty close to it.  Little Thunder They had dancing, too, didn   t they?  Crocker Dancing?  11  Little Thunder Maybe not?  Crocker I don   t think so. Then, Campus Drug down across from the fire station, that  was a real popular, when I lived on South Knoblock, South Knoblock down  by Hideaway, that   s where we would go for coffee every day or cokes. I had  a lot of friends that were in the Fire Protection Program, lived across the  street in the fire station. I remember that from Stillwater. Other than that, not  much.  Little Thunder And how about graduation day?  Crocker Let   s see, I think Richard Nixon spoke. No, it wouldn   t have been Nixon,  (that was in another). I went back to see Nixon speak. That was later on. It  was at the football stadium. You know, just time to get it over with.  Little Thunder Anxious to move on. Now you mentioned after graduation, then you entered  the service?  Crocker Yes, I was in the military two-and-half years on active duty at Fort Bliss,  Texas. This was during time of the Vietnam War but I never did go to  Vietnam. I had a great time in El Paso at Fort Bliss. That was a good, one  good outcome of going to OSU, was going through ROTC, getting  commissioned. That opened a lot of doors. That was a good experience.  Little Thunder Now, you hadn   t met your wife yet?  Crocker No, I met her when I was in the service in El Paso. Her dad was a career  military officer. We started dating while I was on active duty there. We got  married about six months after I got off active duty.  Little Thunder After you left the military, then what happened?  Crocker After I   okay. I worked about six years in engineering positions. With my  degree, I could get jobs in engineering positions, I worked for Public Service  Company of Oklahoma for about a year. Then, I went to work for American  Airlines.  Little Thunder So you were up in this area?  Crocker Yes, I moved back to Tulsa area after graduation. Then, of course, we got  married. We got married while I was working at Public Service Company.  My wife finished her degree then. She was like about a year at TU   University of Tulsa . She started teaching school in Tulsa. After Public  Service Company, I started working at American Airlines. I worked there  five years. All this time I was involved with my father and his farming  12  operation. So then, I quit at American Airlines and started farming full time.  And that   s what I   ve done since.  Little Thunder Was your father also raising mainly wheat and     Crocker Cattle. Cattle, wheat, soybeans, operation similar to what I have now.  Little Thunder When did you get your own farm?  Crocker We bought this place in, actually bought it in    73 or four. We moved here in     83. We   ve lived here ever since. Thirty-something years here.  Little Thunder What are some of the special challenges of farming?  Crocker Weather, markets, (it   s a long list). Drought, of course, (that is why they   re  wheat control), now, it   s a lot of unknowns in farming. You can mitigate  some of them. Yeah, it   s just like farming has always been. Pretty much at  the whims of the weather and the market. You just try to do the best you can  and make the best decisions that you can.  Little Thunder What are some of the rewards?  Crocker Well, rewards are when you get that really good crop, which occasionally  you do. Of course, the other reward for me particularly is I like being  outside. I like the work. I like the equipment. You are your own boss. I like  that. It   s a pretty independent lifestyle. It   s what it is. You can be pretty self-sufficient  if you   re on a farm. I really appreciate that. I think that   s the  biggest reward is the self-sufficiency.  Little Thunder How did you get interested in teaching at the vo-tech?  Crocker I had a friend that taught over there. He knew my background and they  occasionally would need subs in their auto mechanics and industrial  technology programs. I would go over there and sub. I got interested in it.  I   d always wanted to go back to school, so I used that to go back to school in  adult education thinking that might be something that I might want to  pursue. I just did it at a part-time basis. I never did do it full time. They had  great programs over there. I enjoyed it and did a good job.  Little Thunder What was the name of the vocational school again?  Crocker It   s Tulsa Tech.  Little Thunder Tulsa Tech, right?  Crocker Tulsa Tech.  13  Little Thunder They are outstanding.  Crocker Yes.  Little Thunder But you went back to OSU for your master   s as well?  Crocker Yes.  Little Thunder Were you then commuting to the Stillwater campus?  Crocker Well, by this time, OSU has a Tulsa campus. I was able to do most of it in  Tulsa. They were, oh, there was some commuting. Maybe one class each  semester. We drove back and forth quite a bit. Probably more than half of it,  I was able to do here in Tulsa. It made it easier, but no there was some  commuting back and forth. We   d carpool. We would meet in Tulsa, a big  group of us. Meet in Tulsa and carpool back and forth. It took, as I recall,  two to three years to do it.  Little Thunder What were some of the highlight classes or professors in the master   s  program that stood out?  Crocker Oh, I had some good professors. Gary Bias was a great professor. He taught  strategic planning. Bob Nolan, good professors, really interesting. I enjoyed  the program. It was a good program. A lot of reading, interesting subjects. I  think I liked it.  Little Thunder How did your master   s degree kind of change your approach to teaching vo-tech?  Crocker I don   t think it changed it. I did it more out of self-interest I think for myself  rather than trying to change the way I taught at vo-tech. Gave you a little  better appreciation for what vo-tech does. No, I don   t think there was any  change.  Little Thunder Of course, you had this background in repairing cars and I   m assuming  farm equipment too. Did that play into your ability to teach over there?  Crocker Oh yeah, yeah. Teaching both the industrial technology and the auto  mechanics was something I was quite familiar with. With or without the  degree, that is what I do. That   s one of the things I enjoy about farming, is  working on that equipment, solving problems.  Little Thunder Constant repair and solving problems.  Crocker Yes.  14  Little Thunder How did attending OSU and earning your degree impact your life, do you  think?  Crocker Well, I think any education is good. It doesn   t matter what you do. It just  broadens your viewpoint, so I think that   s a general impact of anybody that  continues their education. I   m an avid reader. Always have two or three  books going. I   m just a big believer in education in general. That would be  the impact I think as opposed to a specific impact, it   s a general impact. I  think it   s a positive one.  Little Thunder You   ve done some traveling too?  Crocker Yeah, my wife and I are   we like to travel and camp. Historical sights,  travel pretty much all over the western United States. Yeah, we like to  travel.  Little Thunder Have you stayed connected to OSU?  Crocker Only through my sister and her husband who is a retired OSU professor. I  stayed connected that way. Then, of course my involvement in getting the  master   s degree, but other than that, no I   m   I follow the sports some, but  I   m not avid about it. Now it   s good when they win. It   s better when they  beat OU, which doesn   t happen often enough (especially this year). No big  connection.  Little Thunder You   re not really aware of any other cowboys in Broken Arrow area?  Crocker Oh yes. Yes. Have a neighbor here who is real active OSU alum in the ag  community. There are several of us around here that are OSU grads. We  kind of know that. We mention that to each other occasionally.  Little Thunder Is he also farming?  Crocker He farms also.  Little Thunder They have such a strong course ag background, but you didn   t even take a  class, right?  Crocker Nope, I didn   t take one ag class.  Little Thunder Yeah.  Crocker Nope.  15  Little Thunder You already knew. (Laughter) I   m not sure, have you had anybody else in  your family, or extended family attend OSU?  Crocker Well, my sister, my sister graduated from OSU. She eventually got her  doctorate there. Yeah, that   s the only immediate family member.  Little Thunder Uh-huh.  Crocker Yes.  Little Thunder What can you tell us about Broken Arrow, if somebody were visiting, what  should they know?  Crocker Broken Arrow has evolved somewhat like Bixby, even more so. When I was  young, it was a self-contained rural community close enough to Tulsa for a  lot of commuters. It   s now a big suburb of Tulsa. It   s over a 100,000 people.  It   s also developing a real active downtown area as a lot of cities are. Have a  good strong school system. My wife retired as teacher from Broken Arrow.  We enjoy being part of the Broken Arrow community. It   s an active good  community.  Little Thunder What advice would you give to students at OSU today?  Crocker Oh, realize that you are being given a big opportunity by going there, and do  as well as you can because it will pay off. As I said earlier, just in general,  the educational background enhances you. It   s a good institution. They   re  fortunate to be there. Hope they make the best of it.  Little Thunder How about faculty or administrators? What would you tell them?  Crocker I don   t know I could give advice to faculties and administrators. I think they  do a pretty good job. I know, universities under stress now, financially, and  I   m sure that they   re all colleges are at, I know. I couldn   t give advice to  faculty. I wouldn   t feel qualified to do that.  Little Thunder Yeah, I just want to briefly mention your interest in music both and art,  home filled with art and wonderful things. Do those relate back to your  undergrad experience in any way?  Crocker No. It does not. Although Stillwater has developed a very strong musical  culture, now with the Red Dirt movement. My wife and I both really enjoy  music. We like to dance. We go quite often dancing. I try to do a little music  and that is all I   ll say is that I try. A little guitar picking. No, no relation to  OSU. Tulsa, Stillwater, Strong particularly country western music  background. We went to see Garth recently. One of seven shows, with  16  17,000 people. It   s amazing. He started out playing at the Student Union at  OSU.  Little Thunder Great.  Crocker Yes.  Little Thunder Did you ever see him play there?  Crocker No. Never did. He was long after. He is quite a bit younger than me. I have  friends say that is where he started.  Little Thunder That is a great story. Well, it seems many OSU Students and alumni are very  loyal to this school. What do you think it is about OSU that strikes such  loyalty?  Crocker Well, I think it may be there is roots as an agricultural college, and this is an  agricultural state. Initially, it started out to service that community and I  think that has continued. I would say that might be the roots of it. The ag  connection, course now it   s branched out into much, much more than that. A  lot of OSU students come from small towns and rural backgrounds. I think  they connect there pretty well. They   re welcome there.  Little Thunder Is there anything you would like to add that we didn   t cover today?  Crocker No. I   m interested that you are doing this project. I think it will be, maybe  be a good addition to the archive of OSU   s history and broad background of  grads. Yeah, I appreciate the opportunity to participate and hope it   s been  worthwhile.  Little Thunder It has. Thank you very much for your time today.  Crocker Well, thank you for coming down.  Little Thunder We are just going to add a quick postscript about being in the National  Guard which you just remembered.  Crocker Okay. While I was at OSU, I was also a member of the National Guard.  They had a 120th Engineering battalion, a company of it there in Stillwater.  Captain Buck was the company commander, and he was also in the Broken  Arrow   Stillwater Fire Department. The day that John Kennedy was  assassinated, I remember, specifically, I was in my car on Sixth Street going  to the National Guard armory to conduct some business and we all  remember where we were that particular moment. That   s stuck with me this  whole time. I remember exactly where I was. Then, of course, it was a  memorial service. It was, the National Guard was a good experience.  17  Little Thunder You spent how much time with the National Guard?  Crocker Well, I was in there two years and you   d have a meeting once a month, and  then also we had, we would go to a six-week summer camp. It was a pretty  big commitment. Also, while I was at OSU, as part of the ROTC program, I  went to a six-week summer camp at Fort Sill. That was part of the  requirement for advanced ROTC. So I had both the National Guard and the  ROTC background when I went on active duty.  Little Thunder But you didn   t actually have to, the national guard was never called up for  an emergency?  Crocker No, never was called up.  Little Thunder All right. Well thank you again, Bob. I think it   s important to add that.  Crocker Okay, thank you.  -------  -------
