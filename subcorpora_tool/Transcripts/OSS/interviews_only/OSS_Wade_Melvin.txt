 Peters I   m visiting with Melvin Wade this afternoon. It   s September 15, 2017. We   re in the Angie Debo Room of the Edmon Low Library. Melvin, if you would, please say your name and then spell it for me.  Wade All right. My name is Melvin Wade, M-E-L-V-I-N, W-A-D-E. I   m a native of Greenville, Mississippi, and I was a student here from 1961 to 1969 at Oklahoma State University.  Peters Well, Melvin, you   ve already started answering some of my questions I was going to ask you. Where did you grow up? So you grew up in Greenville?  Wade That   s right. I grew up in segregated Greenville, Mississippi. At the time, Greenville was about forty thousand in size, and since that time, it has been reduced to about thirty thousand. One of the reasons is because the industries and the Air Force base that were there during my early childhood left and migrated elsewhere.  Peters Would you mind telling us about your family and what you did in Greenville during your youth?  Wade My father was a job printer and had his own small business. My mother was a teacher at O   Bannon School for the years that I recall. I was a student at Coleman High School, an all-African American school. I did high school there until the spring of 1961, graduated, and then came to Oklahoma State University. I came because my mother was a woman with great foresight. She knew that I should leave Mississippi and migrate elsewhere. She called my dad   s oldest brother, who was an attorney in Tulsa, Oklahoma,  Primus Calvin  Wade. He agreed to accept responsibility for my coming to Stillwater, and he was the one who actually recommended Stillwater. It was really the only school that we all, as a family, could agree on. There were just three of us. I was an only child. We came, we interviewed, and we liked it. Fortunately, I was able to get admitted. 5  Peters How did you get here from Greenville? Did you travel by car? How   d you make the journey?  Wade Those were years where so much travel in the South was done by bus. The years that I came here, again, the desegregation of the buses had just then begun. I remember one instance where someone, a bus driver, asked me to sit in the back of the bus. I would usually come by Greyhound bus. My mother would usually follow the pattern of giving me a box of fried chicken, and the chicken was supposed to last until I got here. (Laughs) It really was an unusual experience for me because I was seeing people I did not know, and occasionally I would be able to engage those people in friendly conversation. I had a degree of reserve, but once I got talking, I enjoyed talking, and learning about people, and telling them about my own world. Usually I would come directly here, and it was usually an overnight kind of thing. It would usually take me until the next day to get here.  Peters Would you spend the night someplace, or would you be on different buses, working your way across from Mississippi?  Wade That   s right; I would be on different buses. At that time, it was such a challenge if you were African American to travel in the South. Coming from Mississippi and crossing into Arkansas, for example, was not a safe place for anybody to stay. Of course, there were black motels, but the period to me, from my perspective, was fashioned around dissolving barriers. I would not have necessarily wanted to stay at a black motel on the way unless it were a high-quality motel. I would probably have not been able to stay at a white motel. Indeed, the challenges were sometimes on the buses, as I mentioned, regarding where I would sit on the buses. There were a couple of times the bus driver would leave his seat and ask me to sit in a different place, but it only happened a couple of times, as far as my memory recalls.  Peters How would you know if a hotel or motel was a black motel or a white motel? Would they have a sign out front?  Wade Certainly, this was impressionistic, but you sort of understood from the way districts were populated. If you traveled and you saw the makeup of the neighborhoods as you were riding, then you presumed that if you saw a lot of white faces that the neighborhood was predominantly white. If you saw a lot of black faces, then you assumed that the neighborhood was predominantly black.  Peters Did you ever feel unsafe while traveling, or concerned about your safety?  Wade Those times when the bus driver would leave his station, the typical thing was for him to sit in his seat and then to announce what he wanted to 6  announce while seated in the seat. If he then got up, then that became potentially threatening, so on those occasions, you would listen very carefully. By that time, I was also infused with the momentum of the movement, and so I rarely would do anything other than what I wanted to do. I was determined to take on those particular battles because of the energy of that time period.  Peters All right, so you   . I   m sorry, I didn   t mean to take you off on that detour, but I appreciate providing perspective on travel at that time.  Wade Absolutely, absolutely. No problem at all.  Peters Okay, so you get approval from your mother. This is her brother, your uncle     Wade Yes.  Peters    in Tulsa. Do you know why he recommended   . Of all the places, did he feel that Oklahoma State would be a   . Do you have any recollection of why he thought this would be a good place for you to come?  Wade That conversation probably took place between my mother and him, and I was not party to that or those conversations. He could have recommended Langston  University , which would have been safer but which I probably would not have agreed to. As I   ve learned about Langston and the role that Langston played in the desegregation of Oklahoma State University, my opinion of Langston with its very meaningful history has changed. He could have recommended the University of Oklahoma. Actually, I found a picture of my uncle at an event over at Langston University, (I found that to be interesting) I think back in maybe 1960. The University of Oklahoma I had certainly heard about because I was a fan of University of Oklahoma football before I even knew anything about Oklahoma State University.  Peters We   ve heard rumors that they do play football at the University of Oklahoma. (Laughter)  Wade I knew Coach Wilkinson, Bud Wilkinson. I knew his reputation in the football world. Sometime around that time period that my family was considering all of this, they were in a long win-streak, something like a forty-nine-game winning streak in football. None of the other sports I knew anything about. I didn   t even know about Coach  Henry  Iba until I got here.  Peters You arrive in    61, 1961, here in Stillwater. What is your major?  Wade I think my original major was English. I had a difficult experience with a Professor  David  Berkeley, and so by the end of my freshman year I had 7  changed that to history. By the time I met a few great people in speech communication, I changed my major to that, and that was my third and final major.  Peters Speech communications is where you ended up. Where did you live when you were on campus?  Wade I lived in Cordell Hall, I lived in Bennett Hall, and there was one more that I lived in. I have a picture of it, but I can   t recall the name of it. It was not in the fashion of most of the residence halls here, red brick and everything. It was a different composition to the residence hall, and I think it must have been a newer one.  Peters If you ever show me the picture, I can identify most of the buildings, so let me know. You live on campus while you   re here. Roommates, did you select your roommates? What I went through was potluck; you got who you got. (Laughter) Did you have any choice in roommates, or was there any division that you found?  Wade Mine was potluck, too. Dr. Lillard Ashley from Boley, Oklahoma, was my roommate. At the time, I didn   t know that he was going to be a doctor, but I   ve since affirmed that in my research on African American students who were here during the 1960s.      Peters You   re telling me about your roommate. Were black and white students roommates, or were there any restrictions on roommates based on race? Are you aware of anything?  Wade My understanding was that people were grouped together by race and that the university knew the racial composition of the students who came, and that they assigned students on the basis of race. I don   t recall white roommates until I was in later years, certainly beyond my sophomore year when that happened. My roommates off campus included Gene Reid, who is here now. I think there were either three or four of us who were rooming together off campus. I recall roommates in a newer structure. I have a recollection of being inside in 1963 when President Kennedy was assassinated. We heard the news, and at that time I was rooming with a student from Oklahoma City named  Alonzo Kelly . I believe one of my other roommates was named Frank, and he also was from Oklahoma City. I recall rooming at one point with Joe James, the great Oklahoma State wrestler who was the first African American heavyweight champion in wrestling here.  Peters A number of different roommates and different locations over a period of time, both on and off campus.  8  Wade Yes, that   s right, but the only racially mixed group was off campus.  Peters Okay, what on-campus activities did you become involved with? You had your coursework, which changed as you moved into speech communications. What other on-campus activities were you involved with?  Wade I was drawn to the ones where African American athletes were prominent, and then maybe once I started, then I would be open to broader participation. I certainly attended a lot of the wrestling events and gloried in several of the individual wrestlers. Certainly, Joe as my roommate was very important. I enjoyed all of his victories, and ultimately he would go on to win the national wrestling championship. Then there was Yojiro Uetake, who I   m sure I   m butchering his name. He was from Japan, and certainly every time he wrestled, I certainly rooted for him, too. Bobby Douglas, during my later years, sometimes. I think maybe I was in graduate school by that time, but Bobby Douglas was certainly one of my favorites, too. Basketball, Jim King was here under Coach Iba, and I rooted for him and enjoyed his playing style. He was a very smooth person, type of athlete. Let me see if there were any other athletes. I didn   t do baseball.  Peters Did you attend football games?  Wade Now, that was curious. Oh, track, too. I ran a year of track here and met wonderful contemporaries that I hope I will be encouraging them to come back next year for the reunion that we   re going to work on. Ray Mitchell was a half-miler, I believe, from Chickasha. Wardell Hollis was, I think, both a football player and a track person. I think he was hurdles. Wardell lives in San Antonio, Texas, now. Ray Bothwell was a 440 runner and was conference champion one year. There were several of the white athletes that were friends. Charlie Strong, who was a quarter-miler, was a friend, and the Perry twins  Dave, John  were also here. Arnold Droke was here.  Arnold ran on the two-mile relay unit at a time when the unit was one of the best in the country. Arnold and Wardell actually became either colonels or lieutenant colonels in the US Army, and so I have admired their careers over that time. I was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity after, I believe,    63. The fraternity played an important role in my graduation, giving me the structure and friendship patterns that you need in order to be successful so that it helps when you   re a part of the group. Sometimes maybe when you are thinking,    Let me go to this party,    then the fact that people are announcing study hours helps you ultimately, even though you don   t see it at the moment.  Peters What event did you run in track? You said you ran track. What was your event? 9  Wade I was a lower quality quarter-miler. (Laughs)  Peters Quarter mile, okay.  Wade Let me see. What is the other thing that I did? Politically, I became active. Ron Stevens, who is here for the weekend, started a newspaper called The Drummer, which apparently was one of the first off-campus, underground newspapers in the country. He asked me, I   m thinking around 1963, to write an essay on race. I stayed up either a night or two doing it and really enjoyed what I came up with and how he responded to it. He put it on the   if I   m remembering correctly. (Laughs) There   s always the possibility that memories can be dulled by the passing of time. If I remember correctly, he put it on the front page of that particular issue of The Drummer.  It was a way of distinguishing myself from maybe my classmates and my college mates, and made me happy to be able to do so. Then my second political act was an interesting one. One of my most important mentors was a professor by the name of Brad Brown. Brad was a member of the NAACP and was deeply committed to the NAACP wherever he lived. He just was in Florida, and he   oh, man, I think he may still live in Florida. Brad was so committed to the NAACP that at times it was difficult to tell he was not African American. One day, he and I were in a discussion, and he revealed to me that the university had different housing lists for different racial groups of students. I had no idea that this was taking place.  He mentioned this to me, and after I saw the impact that it had on him (as he was telling me, his face became all red) I said,    Why is this a different order and a different significance to him than it is to me? Maybe this is something I should be concerned about, too.    (Laughs) I mentioned it to my best associates: Margaret Williams, who would become my wife; and Nimrod Chapel, who was an activist even after I had gone; Cynthia Emery, who became Cynthia Chapel, his wife; and Glenn Shoate. We decided something needed to be done, so we made an appointment with President  Robert  Kamm, and we told him. He was not quite yet president. He was going to be installed, I believe, the next week.  Peters He   d come from   he   d been the dean of arts and sciences on campus. In 1966,    65,    66, then he was promoted but given the position of president.  Wade That   s right, so this was 1966. He was scheduled to be installed right out in front of the Library. That   s where all the chairs were. We had had this meeting with him a brief time before. I think it may have been the week preceding everything, but it might have been a little before that. It was before it enough for us to be aware that it was an impending installation. We said to President Kamm,    We   d like you to resolve this issue before your installation because there are students on campus who are planning a protest 10  at your installation if you do not, if you are unable, or if the campus is unable to resolve this issue.    The day of his installation, President Kamm, in the Daily O   Collegian, published his statement that the housing list would be ended. Now, from Professor  Pauline  Kopecky   s book  A History of Equal Opportunity at Oklahoma State University , it does not seem that the housing lists were actually ended, but the mere fact that it was stated gave us a great victory.  It kind of energized us and made us need to develop an agenda of what we were going to do in support of improving racial issues at Oklahoma State University. One of the things that we chose to do was to start a Black Heritage Week. Though Professor Kopecky   s book   I suspect she did more of her research in 1968 than in other years. She seems to have not known that there was a Black Heritage Week the year before she claims the first one took place. I was the coordinator for the first one, and that year, I called   which was, I believe, 1966. It was after President Kamm   s program. I   m a little confused on the exact date. I managed to call Adam Clayton Powell as he was traveling through the United States. Adam Clayton Powell was the most important congressional leader who was of African American ancestry during the twentieth century.  Peters Congressman from New York.  Wade Congressman from Harlem in New York and then the chair of, if memory serves me correctly, the House Education and Labor Committee. He had been deposed from Congress by this time, censured. Happened to remove himself to the Bahamas because if he was in New York or in Washington, DC, he would have been arrested, but somehow he could travel through California. He was at one of the most radical programs in higher education at that time. He was visiting the campus of San Francisco State University, and those of us who were in liberal, campus politics, like you and myself, we remember San Francisco State and how important it was. Of course, it wasn   t very far from Berkeley, and Berkeley had its influence on us here as students. Suddenly, the free speech movement, for example, and we talked about Timothy Leary, bringing Timothy Leary to campus, Timothy Leary, the LSD advocate. We talked about Gabriel Vahanian, who was a    death of God    speaker. We didn   t necessarily believe these things, but we thought students were, that they should be exposed to these things.  Peters Were you a part of the Forums committee? There was a committee on campus that brought in speakers, so this was in addition to that. These were other individuals that you were considering.  Wade That   s right, so I had a lot to learn. When I came here, I had never done this type of thing, organizing a speaking event. That first year, I asked my friends. I don   t remember exactly who I asked, but I asked my friends in the 11  student senate to give me the power to make telephone calls in organizing this event.    If you support me, would you please back me,    so that I would have opportunity to call around the nation and ask people to come to Oklahoma State University. That was how I got the ability to call Adam Clayton Powell. Little did I know that this would come to the attention of the board of regents. Somehow there were policies being made to prevent    radical speakers    from coming to the university.  Peters These were policies at the board of regents level that you think   .  Wade Professor Kopecky is my source on this, and the equal opportunity book because I had no knowledge of this at the time. I   m reluctant to speak about it, and my own information is very limited about this. I do recall that it got attention in, I believe, the Daily Oklahoman, if not the Tulsa World. Because of the backlash to this prospect, we had to give up on Adam Clayton Powell, which is a difficult thing for me to do at that point. We did subsequently invite for that year Asa Spaulding. Asa Spaulding was then president and owner, CEO of the largest African American insurance company in the country, North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance.  We also invited a student from Yale University Law School who was the second African American Rhodes Scholar in the nation  Stan Sanders . They both came, just for their expenses, and made their speeches. Then the next year, President Kamm and Abe Hesser must have had epiphanies because they recognized that there was something important about supporting the Black Heritage Week. My ex-wife, Margaret Williams, at the time planned that event with the support of the rest of us. She had the brilliant idea of inviting Melvin Tolson, or doing this in the honor of Melvin Tolson. Professor Tolson had just died between the time that I did the first Black Heritage Week and the second Black Heritage Week. He was her mentor while she studied at Langston.  Peters This is Melvin Tolson Sr., I believe.  Wade This is Melvin Tolson Sr.  Peters Right, and he had an extended career at Langston. Then at some point, did he go to Texas after Langston?  Wade The Texas one at Wiley College is the one that   s the subject of the movie starring Denzel Washington. Somehow, he managed to encourage students to learn how to debate, and then to arrange for them to compete with the US national champions, and they, incredibly, won.  Peters Melvin Tolson Sr. had inspired your wife as a mentor? 12  Wade That   s right.  Peters I   m sorry, so continue with your description of early black history   .  Wade Yes, so Professor Tolson, before his death, comes to the university and speaks. I did not know and most of the black student community here did not know he was here. He spoke here, and then shortly after that, he passed. Margaret had the brilliant idea of designing a program that would be in tribute to him for Black Heritage Week. That   s the one that got more attention and more support. It may have been because it was seen as more academic than mine, which was seen as political, yet in some respects hers was certainly at least as political as mine, in fact, more political. That   s why it was such a brilliant strategy.  Peters Who was the speaker? Do you remember?  Wade There were at least four speakers, and the only one that I can recall was Professor Joy Flasch. Professor Flasch spent almost her entire career at Langston, and I believe she still lives in that community. She would now be about eighty-five, eighty-six years old, and I talked to her earlier this year, long-distance. She is the one whose documents, I recall, are online. It   s something like her talk is somewhere online. The others, time fails me. It was such a wonderful event, too. It was the first event that I can recall that I ever attended that was entirely devoted to an African American. It probably was the first conference devoted to Melvin Tolson in Oklahoma. May have been the first in the nation. I   m not sure about first in the nation but certainly in Oklahoma.  Peters Let me backtrack briefly. You mentioned this university list that was a part of your inspiration in getting involved with political activity. This was a list of residence apartments off campus? Is that what this list was about?  Wade These were residences that were off campus that were available for rent to Oklahoma State students.  Peters It was a segregated list?  Wade Absolutely, two separate lists. One for African Americans; one for white Americans.  Peters I just wanted to make sure everyone was clear about the intent of these lists. These are university-approved lists that obviously segregated the population into different housing arrangements in the city of Stillwater.  Wade My assumption is that a person who wanted to rent their property would contact an office here at the university. That office would then be open to 13  them, explaining that this particular list should not be circulated and available to all students but only to groups that were selected by the person who was renting the property. Perhaps there was some overlap of the lists, but they were separate. Somehow, Dr. Brad Brown, who was then a member of one of the science faculties, (may have been biology) he found out about it. As a committed civil rights worker, he said,    This is offensive, and we must find a way to end it,    and mentioned it to me and the students who were in my little group. Together, we were able to work on eliminating the list, at least as open policy.  Peters As a university-sponsored activity?  Wade That   s right, but according to Professor Kopecky, the list remained.  Peters So you   re a student here. What opportunities did you have on campus while you were here that you remember, things that you hadn   t thought about, maybe, that arrived on your doorstep? What kind of opportunities were made available to you as a student here?  Wade Aside from Ron Stevens and The Drummer, which I thought was an important accomplishment for me in terms of my evolution as an activist, then I also had the benefit of some people in my own department, the Communications Department, that took me under their wing. The first person was Professor Lee Gilstrap. Professor Gilstrap, we would call him Colonel Gilstrap, and I don   t remember students calling him Professor. I think he encouraged people to call him Colonel Gilstrap. He was a World War I hero. He was kind of folksy in his approach, but he also did me the great favor of saying to me that,    You   re the best student in this class.    I think it was about halfway through the course, and it made such an impact on me for the remainder of that semester that whenever I did homework, his homework came first.  The words were instantly transformative, I guess, is the best word to say. No teacher at Oklahoma State had even come close to ever saying those words to me. In addition, he encouraged me to join the debate team. Now, I joined and quickly revealed myself not to be a good debater, but at the same time, I found out that people also did oratory. I worked very hard on the oratory. Initially, Professor Dale Stockton was important there. A year or two after Dr. King had made the celebrated    I Have a Dream    speech, Dale Stockton had that speech on the agenda for his class. If I remember correctly, either I took the class or had some responsibility for the class. To hear the words of the    I Have a Dream    speech, that was a first-time occurrence for me, so what he did was very important in my opinion.  Not many people were knowledgeable of the African American experience at that time and would have had the courage to place something like that on 14  their agenda for the class. If I remember correctly, it was a rhetoric class, and we actually analyzed the speech. Gail Beil was also very instrumental. In 1958, she was quiet, and she had, I believe, won the same oratorical contest that I   m talking about. I represented the university at the oratorical contest, the national oratorical contest that she won. If I remember correctly, I think she told me she won it in 1958. I competed a few years later, so she was my coach for that. She would listen to me. Even to have somebody listen to a speech that I had written, at that time, was important to giving me a sense of belonging here at the university.  When I went to  Windsor Candidate, Oklahoma  where the competition took place, she was the one who was sort of like the personal guide for me, the person who constantly reminded me that she was taking care of my best interests. She was very important because of that. No other academic department reached out to me in that way to make me feel special. Then I   m trying to remember. There was a third person, who was   oh, I guess that is Dale Stockton, Colonel Gilstrap, and Gail Beil. Gail, I would work with in my professional career at the University of Texas at Austin. There I was a lower-level faculty member at the university. I started an event called Juneteenth at the capitol. Juneteenth is the date that people in Texas, African Americans, begin to celebrate emancipation.  The celebrations have become strategically placed enough so that they   re celebrated in many states throughout the country. Juneteenth is the largest African American emancipation celebration in the nation. When President Lincoln decided to go through with emancipation, to all of the seceded states, he sent generals. The dates the generals arrived in those states tend to be the dates that they celebrate African American emancipation. Because Juneteenth is celebrated in a warm month, its popularity has extended widely over the country. There are even states on the other side of the Mississippi who tend to celebrate Juneteenth. I worked with others to initiate a celebration at the capitol, and Gail Beil, who I had met here at Oklahoma State, had moved by then to Marshall, Texas. She was one of those who actually is a Tolson scholar. She   s very aware of what Dr. Tolson had done.  Peters Because Wiley College is located in Marshall, Texas.  Wade That   s right. She had known Mr. James Farmer, the president of the Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE, long before I knew him. After finding out that he was a Texan, I invited him. Then Gail said,    You know I know him, don   t you,    (Laughs) and then explained to me her connection with Wiley and how she had met Dr. Tolson early on and had done research on him. I asked her for her help in working with Dr. Don Carlton, who is the archivist at the University of Texas at Austin. At the time, he was director of something called the Texas History Research Center there. He had the resources to be able to professionally protect those papers and to pay for the 15  papers. Gail helped with the negotiation because she knew him better than I knew him. I had just met him for that one occasion. What we typically did is we awarded people who had distinguished Texas histories who were African Americans, at the capitol.  We gave those awards at the capitol and usually would invite politicians to present the awards whenever we could and whenever they were willing. Gail and I have a long history that started here at the university, so when you ask about special kinds of things, then those take on special significance. Colonel Gilstrap saying matter-of-factly,    You are the best student in this class,    then maneuvering to get me involved with the oratory team when I did not know that there was even an oratory team on campus. Then Dale Stockton and the    I Have a Dream    speech. Dale was murdered. Shortly after his class was through, he visited or had an appointment at a hotel in Dallas, and he was murdered in the hotel. Yet he was a brilliant teacher, and the memory of his teaching was stamped on me. In many respects, I would say he was the best teacher that I had in terms of his competency here at Oklahoma State University.  Peters You shared some of the opportunities that came your way while you were here. What were some of the challenges that you confronted? We talked briefly about the university list for residences off campus, but what other challenges did you face as a student here in the early   60s, mid-  60s?  Wade By the time I had met Dr. Kamm, it was important for me to find ways to express my newfound activism. From what I could tell, President Kamm and Vice President Hesser seemed to make that difficult. The support that one would hope to get and that I got from people like Colonel Gilstrap and Gail Beil, (and not quite Dale Stockton, but it was only because he was murdered so soon after I had the opportunity to take his class) their encounters made me feel special and made me feel empowered. President Kamm, particularly after the incident I described happened, made me feel like he regarded me as a nemesis and therefore became my nemesis. I never felt like I could invite the president of the university to meet Stan Sanders when he came to the campus or, if he had come, Adam Clayton Powell.  That just was not going to happen, (Laughs) or to meet Asa Spaulding. Those were a part of the challenges. Here, you   ve discovered this new field that you like, and, yes, it isn   t a university department. It isn   t a university program, but it   s an important part of your learning. It will become the basis for the work that you do over your lifetime. The skills that we were talking about, when I was able to become the inaugural director of the Center for Black Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara, the only thing I had to prepare me for those responsibilities was my activism here at Oklahoma State University. To have that not supported because of the background, (and I think this really was a background issue) Dr. Kamm did 16  not understand us and did not understand our background, and we did not understand his background.  I never thought he was insincere. I thought that he believed in the actions that he took and that in his mind those were important ways to protect the university, but it suggested that the institution was more important to him than the students. I think it   s an important lesson to know that the students are what makes up the institution and that they must be protected, they must be nurtured, they must be encouraged, as other elements, components of the university must be protected. If any of those components are not respected and encouraged and nurtured and strengthened by your actions, if they   re somehow left out because of the way you grew up   . The fact that some of these people may have been absent from your background, and from the interactions of the community that you grew up in, that is a problem to the development of the institution.  I think that was a very crucial barrier that we had to deal with. Professor Berkeley, in that first class that I took in English, I thought there was a letter grade difference. He gave me a C, and I thought at least a B. I was pretty confident in the classes that I thought I had the skills to excel in, and I was pretty frank if I thought I was in the wrong class. There were times where I certainly was in over my head. I think it   s important for faculty to help students understand why there   s a difference in their assessment and why you   re coming away with the feeling that other students were given a fairer assessment than you. At the time, because of his background, again, I don   t think, I never got the feeling Professor Berkley was interested in meeting with me. I was just a student in his class and, as far as he was concerned, a cipher.  Peters You were drawn into political activity in part because of the civil rights issues?  Wade Absolutely.  Peters Are you aware of other issues that are going on on campus at the same time, groups involved with free speech, groups involved with concerns about the war in Vietnam? Is there any kind of overlap or interaction with those other groups then?  Wade I do believe that there were separate racial spheres of activity on the campus when I was here and that I was enabled, as the FATAGS  Friday Afternoon Tea and Glee Society  reunion suggests, I was able to cross into both of those spheres. The spheres were not overlapping spheres of activity. When I called Adam Clayton Powell, I think I entered some of those separate spheres, so that Powell made me aware of the free speech issue. The Sociology Department led a political event that was actually right outside 17  the Library. The Library was the primary stage for the speeches that they led, and we as students were present there.  There were some of us who spoke. I think Glenn Shoate, representing our little, small group, which would go on to become the nucleus for the Black Student Organization, I think Glenn spoke at that gathering, and it was one of the few times that blacks and whites, in terms of politics on a public stage like that, interacted. We were by no means front and center at this boycott, but we were given, for the first time I think I recall, an opportunity to have our spheres connect with each other. That was right outside this Library here, on the steps on the platform right outside.  Peters By the fountain area, that patio.  Wade Yeah, yeah, that   s right. When those spheres crossed, it was usually something very important and a very important time in terms of the way we saw things, so that was free speech. Vietnam, Chic Dambach and a student who is deceased now by the name of Bill Dawson were my initial sources for information about the Vietnam War. Chic was a graduate student in communications, and Bill also was a graduate student in communications. They would come and talk about the war, and I listened noncommittally at the outset. Then it began to make sense to me over time, so they were certainly informed much earlier than I was. As I listened and then began to see the things that were taking place in the university administration, I was made aware that there were parallels between the way our national government was operating and the way our university administration was operating.  I became interested in their issues, and so I made a decision not to engage in the Vietnam War. Didn   t discuss it with my family or anything like that but made a personal decision to not be involved in the war. This must have been, again, after Dr. Kamm is installed. At that point, I   ve decided   in 1968, I get this invitation from Dr.  Leslie  Kreps, who is then chair of the Speech Communications Department. Senator Fred Harris has asked if anybody wants to be involved in supporting his administration in Washington. I had never been to Washington DC. It   s fascinating now to think that in these rather small worlds that I had been in, that there is an opportunity now to engage in a much more important world. I decide I   m going to accept the opportunity to go to Washington for a year, and while I   m in Washington, Dr. King is assassinated.  That transformative act   I cannot understand how a man of nonviolence could be subjected to that type of treatment. I understand Malcom X because his approach is so radically different, but Dr. King? How does that make sense? Once that happens, and seeing the plumes of smoke   . I had a roommate in Washington, and we had just gone to see Dr. King for the first 18  time in my life the Sunday before he was assassinated. At that point, he comes to the Washington Cathedral, which is this very large, structured church outside of DC, and Dr. King is there. We were hoping he would give one of those stem-winders. Well, it was a relatively temperate speech, and so there isn   t much of the feedback that exists between   . The audience is predominantly white. To the best of my knowledge, other than my roommate and myself, I don   t remember seeing anybody African American there.  You could tell he was tired. Dr. King was tired, but then to see him assassinated   . The first day, as we go through Washington DC, we see all these people who are trying to find out the facts. This was the period where they had transistor radios, and they were much like, I guess, cell phones now. People are listening to the radio station, trying to get the news. It was very quiet. The very next day, all hell busts loose. At that point, people are engaged in anti-government activity, I would say, would be a fair statement. Then maybe the following day or soon after that, we have boycotts in the streets. We have tanks in the streets. The Army has been deployed over the Capitol, and then a curfew is issued. For somebody who   s grown up in the United States, even in segregated territory, this still is unusual because there are actually people with rifles out there and with Army gear.  As best I can interpret it, this was enough to really make me change my position on the war. I come back, and I   m a black draft resister, the only black draft resister I was aware of at that time. There may have been others. Joe Gilchrist was his name, is the person that I   d become aware of, and I   d meet with him on occasions and ask his advice. The Unitarian minister, who for the love of me, I can   t remember his name, I met him because he prevailed upon me to do a Malcolm Boyd play for his congregation. I was one of the characters. I think it was about a three-person play. I   m not sure of that, but that   s my recollection. So we did the Malcolm Boyd play.  Peters That   s here in Stillwater?  Wade Yes, that was   I have a recollection of a coffee house or someplace that was off campus, maybe acting as a coffee house.  Peters The Wesley Foundation, the Methodist student center, had a coffee house, and it had a larger auditorium with a stage upstairs.  Wade I think that was probably it, and I was just over there last night to hear about their new building plans. I think it was the Wesley Foundation place. That was my only connection to this Unitarian preacher, but he did me the favor of a lifetime, white preacher. Did me the favor of a lifetime by recognizing when I came back that I did not know a great deal about how to maneuver through the process of being inducted into the draft. He asked me to meet 19  him, and then he explained to me what I was up against. He said,    Don   t ignore the letter when it comes to you.    He said,    I   m going to explain the activities that you should go through, and then at the very end they will ask you to step forward. Do not take the step forward, or you will be in the Army.    When I was drafted, I did exactly what he said. I kept in touch with him through that process.  He arranged for an attorney in Oklahoma City through the American Friends Service Committee to handle my legal case. I regret today that I didn   t say thank you to either the preacher or the lawyer. The lawyer made it possible for me not to have to travel between here and Oklahoma City while my case was proceeding through the courts. Then out of the blue, the different protests that were against the war, that were being staged on college campuses over the nation caused President Nixon to declare a six-month moratorium on the prosecution of draft resistors. My case comes up during those six months. I think Joe   s case does not come up. I   m not certain of that exactly. I got the impression that somebody in this very, very small group of people actually went to jail, and I didn   t. I thought I was going; my family did; my wife   s family thought that that was likely. It caused trouble for me.  Peters Were you trying to be a conscientious objector, CO status, or in a different classification?  Wade I don   t think, again, my thoughts had proceeded that far until the six-month moratorium had come on. Then I had a few months left, maybe six months left before I would be too old for the draft. I decided to apply because I was certainly in the spotlight now for a conscientious objectorship. The problem was that by this time I think my only way out   I could no longer do deferments. I did apply for a CO, and my case then was referred back to Mississippi. The Mississippi Draft Board then contacted my mother to determine whether or not I should be given a CO status. My mother was terribly conflicted, and so she said,    No, I don   t thinks he   s a conscientious objector. I think he   s confused.    That blew that. (Laughs) Were there any other causes? Free speech, I mentioned Gabriel Vahanian and Timothy Leary, and those were the two, other than Adam Clayton Powell, that I was aware.  We talked about it incessantly, but I think the people who had the greatest insight were the people who were working on speaker-related projects. Mine were exclusively the ones that I have described while I was here. One of the speakers who came to campus informed me about black studies, that there was such a thing that existed, and it was, of course, a very important discovery. There   s a African American movie actress named Nia Long, and she was in some of the Eddie Murphy movies. Nia Long   s father is named Doughtry Long, and people started calling him Doc Long, short for Doughtry. Doughtry Long, after a poetry reading on the campus, attended 20  one of our parties, and when he heard   he asked about what was taking place on the campus. We told him about the political climate here, free speech, and I   m sure other issues came up. He also mentioned this term,    black studies   . He said,    You all ought to really get interested in black studies.    It may have come about because we had told him about Adam Clayton Powell, too, about Adam Clayton Powell   s passing through San Francisco State.  He may have said,    That isn   t the only thing that is being born at San Francisco State. Be aware that the first black studies department in the country is being born at San Francisco State University.    Immediately, when I heard the term    black studies,    that was like magic to us, like a magic word. I asked my colleagues with this committee that was the nucleus to the Black Student Organization that exists now, I asked them if we should do something about black studies on campus. Ultimately, we talked about it, and Patrick Riggs, who was the son of Professor James Riggs in the department of humanities on the campus at the time, took it seriously. He asked his dad,    Would you be willing to help the students out and teach this course on black studies,    that was being informally proposed by us, the black students committee. Professor Riggs surprised us all by accepting that responsibility. I think his course was the first black studies course on the campus.  Peters What department was he in? Do you remember? Humanities you said?  Wade Yes. He and Cyclone Covey were the students who we knew: Cyclone Covey because of his whirlwind style, and Professor Riggs, who was much more laid-back and generally seemed to be more open to student ideas. We wound up teaching the course because Professor Riggs, he didn   t know anything about black studies. To this day, I   m grateful to him for opening that responsibility. I had no idea that the advocate, the person who was at San Francisco State who was promoting this approach of black studies in this generation after black studies had been initiated by people like W. E. B. Du Bois and Carter G. Woodson, who was the so-called father of Negro history   . All those things had faded out and faded into something other than, whatever the opposite of prominence is. Oblivion, I guess. In our textbooks, we never saw anybody who was black who we could be proud of. We would be taught that the legacy was slavery, and there wasn   t much beyond slavery. The knowledge I have gained since emanates from   well, no. I guess for me I was aware of Dr .Woodson because my high school teacher introduced that information, but the real knowledge comes after this point.  Peters You said there was someone in San Francisco State who had inspired that. Who was that individual?  21  Wade That was Dr. Nathan Hare, and he had a wife, Dr. Julia Hare, who I think she has a PhD. He had a PhD. He was a sociologist, and he got started at Langston University. I think that   s where he got his first degree, at Langston University. Winds up at Howard University. Then the students at San Francisco State become aware of that and asked him to come from Howard to San Francisco State, which has either a black president or a very radical, white, liberal president. That   s how the first modern black studies department gets started with this guy from Langston. Brilliant man, sociologist, laying out the foundation of what black studies is supposed to be about. When I find out about him, I   m very interested. To the extent that I   ve been able to gain knowledge, I   m reading that knowledge as a lay person because I think I   m actually going to jail. This is the last years of the J. Edgar Hoover FBI, and so here in Oklahoma they have put a person to surveil my wife and myself.  They tried to convince me and her that I would be best off   because I   m still vulnerable. They don   t know that I   ve applied for CO. They would say I   m best off accepting their offer to have everything wiped off the board if I would just join the Army. I still don   t like (Laughs) the Army and don   t relish the idea of being ordered around in the context of a military army, still, I guess, mobilized by the fact that Dr. King has been assassinated, having the lies that people were telling about the US Army, revealed to me by Chic and Bill, and deciding that,    No, this is the wrong direction for me. I   m really not interested in doing the Army thing.    Curiously, I have a son who is a military person. (Laughs) I find myself several years later at West Point Military Academy where he   s in school, rooting for Army. (Laughs) I don   t think I was involved   I can   t remember being involved in any other issues than those three.  Peters Are you familiar with the Race Relations Committee? This was about 1965. Apparently on campus there was a Race Relations Committee. I don   t know anything else about it.  Wade I did not know, but I would ask Earl Mitchell, Dr. Mitchell, or Dr. Brad Brown. Brad, I hope, is going to be a member of the committee. I   ve asked him to be a member of the committee, and I think he will be willing to do that. The two of them will be deeply involved, as will Dr.  Jason  Kirksey, with the event next year. Dr. Mitchell is a wonderful source of history. I would imagine that the white, liberal faculty who were connected to the boycott, not the boycott but the event right out in front of the Library, I would think that those would have been the people who would have been involved. Brad Brown   from their side, people like Margaret Brooks, Mary Rohrberger, I would think those would be the people that would be involved with that. Remember, there are these separate universes that are difficult to cross. Here for FATAGS, I   m the one who is the real link between the two. I 22  invited Harold Fields, who was a senator at that time. It   s possible he may know, at least have heard about it, too, but we   re the only two here.  Peters Do you remember the visit by Julian Bond in 1967?  Wade I do. Yeah, I do.  Peters He was a speaker who came, was allowed to come to campus.  Wade That   s right. They destroyed the moment, however, by inviting John Tower, the conservative senator from Texas, to be here during the same timeframe. We were actually thinking about   we were real happy that Julian Bond was here, but we were disappointed that John Tower was here. Around the same time, the singer Andy Williams was here, too.  Peters Are you aware of the Johnny Bright incident which happened here in 1951?  Wade Yes, I didn   t know it at the time, but because the research that I did on the bios unearthed Johnny Bright. It   s a disappointing moment in the history of the university to have this potential All American football player come here with a target. It just goes completely against what amateur sports should be about, and the university suffered from it.  Peters That incident was 1951, so a little over ten years, eleven years before you arrive here. Drake University comes to visit our campus for a football game. Drake were a part of the Missouri Valley Conference at that point. Drake leaves the Missouri Valley Conference after that season, in most part in fact, football, exclusively because of that incident.  Wade Did you know that they have been much more prominent in other sports? The problems in football affected the whole trajectory of their athletic schedule. They   re never again a major football power in the country because of the Johnny Bright incident.  Peters Basketball, other sports have continued, but not football?  Wade That   s right. That   s right.  Peters When you came here, you weren   t aware of that event?  Wade No, they wouldn   t have wanted that. The apology didn   t happen until way after we had gone, so twenty-five years later. That would have been, I think in the 1970s, when the university issues its apology. One of the presidents before Burns Hargis initiated   .  Peters That was in the 1990s. 23  Wade Was that the 1990s?  Peters It was over forty years after the event, so a long time. In fact, it may have been   . It was a long time.  Wade It was a long time. That   s right.  Peters A long time coming. I   m going to mention some names here. Oliver Willham would have been president before Kamm. Do you remember any interaction with President Willham at all?  Wade No     Peters No, okay.  Wade    or President  Henry  Bennett.  Peters Or President Bennett. He was long   . Of course, you had some interaction with Dr. Kamm, Robert Kamm     Wade Oh, God, and Abe Hesser.  Peters    and Abe Hesser. Any more to add about either of those gentlemen before we move along?  Wade Other than that they were my nemesis, so I spent time thinking about them. I think there   s evidence now that in the case that they spent time thinking about me, too, and ways to suppress my influence on the campus.  Peters You mentioned Brad Brown and the influence that he had in your life, and James Riggs with the first black studies course. Did you know Earl Mitchell when you were here as a student?  Wade Yes.  Peters He arrived in the mid-  60s sometime.  Wade Earl arrived about    66 or    67, and because Brad was great friends of both of us, he was the way I knew about Earl. I think it   s wonderful to have a faculty member   . One of the reasons we want to honor him is because I have been at six other universities, and nobody ever had a fifty-year span of which a professor or an administrator or any staff that I know of that was connected with the university for fifty years. This is a resource, so we think honoring Dr. Mitchell will enable a lot of people to get over their pain caused by the university and be willing to come back. 24  Peters It   s a tenure that few can match anywhere.  Wade That   s right. That   s right.  Peters Other personalities or individuals? You   ve mentioned Margaret Williams. She was your spouse for part of this time.  Wade Yes.  Peters Nimrod Chapel, what can you tell us about Nimrod Chapel?  Wade Nimrod was probably in that group of most important student activists of the 1960s. Nimrod had gone into the military before any of us had ever met him, and so he was a little older than the rest of us. He brought that worldly experience and sense of humor into the committee that I was talking about that was the nucleus of the formation of the Afro American Society. Trying to remember what about the other incidents because there was some incidents that either I had a test, or Margaret and I were engaged in something else, that Nimrod and Glenn were involved in. Our spouses   .  Peters This is Glenn Shoate?  Wade Yes, Glenn Shoate. Our spouses-to-be tended to support us, what we were doing. To make it more effective than usually it would have been, they brought some skill to it that we were totally lacking in, or thought of some strategy that we were totally lacking in. It underscores the importance of men and women in innovative movements working together because they bring something completely different. Nimrod went briefly to Langston and then came here, and he was a person who was good with his hands, technology, and that kind of thing. He indicates that he was the first person to graduate with his type of degree who was African American at the university. He was at everything and involved with everything that I was involved with. The Black Heritage Week that I did, he was involved in. Wasn   t involved with Ron Stevens because he and I didn   t know each other at the time, and he was still in the military.  If Nimrod had not been involved with the meeting with Dr. Kamm, I   m not sure we would have done it. In fact, I   m pretty sure we wouldn   t have done it. I needed him to be there because he had the experience so that if things in any way got out of hand, Nimrod would know what to do. During this time, he   s the best person for certain things. The women had incredible skills, but this was new to them, too, and they were taken out of their worlds. They were women who were raised to be good women. They were dependable. If they said they would be present, they were there even if they didn   t know quite what was going to happen. Nimrod and I were more risk-takers, and 25  Nimrod was probably more a risk-taker than I was. He was one of those people who would take students over to Wesley to meet. After the organization really got going, there was something which disappointed me.  I   m not sure whether it was 1969 or    67; it was one of those two years. We got together and asked the students to join us, and about thirty or thirty-five students joined us to get the organization off the ground. By that time, by    67, I am trying to find everything out about San Francisco State University that I can. I find out some way that the name of the black student organization at either San Francisco State or Berkeley is called The Black Student Liberation Front. Again, naively and without doing spade work, I just assumed that this would be a wonderful name for the organization here. There was a young woman who nobody is able to identify who spoke that night that the meeting took place. Title of her talk was    I Am a Negro.    Now, all of us are so politicized at this point that no name with    Negro    is going to make it through that group with our approval, and we   re the ones who has called the meeting.  After her speech, we look at each other, and we say,    It   s not going to be Black Student Liberation Front,    (Laughs) and so that   s how the name Afro American Society came out as a name that was endorsed by the students. I was disappointed. I   d have been irate if we had come out of there with    Negro,    but it was good that it happened because they had a sense that it was their choice. We could have tried to say that we   re still going to name it that way, and would   ve lost people had we done that. It was discussion that was happening around the country. Oklahoma State was among the many schools that had that discussion. We resolved it in a way that preserved the integrity of the process that said,    No, we won   t act like it   s just us who should make this important decision. This is a decision that   s important to have buy-in from the student community.     Peters Did the women ever talk about the discrepancies they had being women, because early on, hours of the residence halls were different for women than men? There were a number of issues in which the sexes were treated differently. Did they ever talk about those things with you or share some of their frustrations or concerns?  Wade Unfortunately, we were in tune with the male chauvinism of the times. The movement had these contradictions built into it. That is one of the reasons why people tend to praise the Black Lives Matter movement now. Back then, it was about the women doing the real work of the organization, and the men   taking credit for it. I think they may have discussed these things, but it   s one of the difficulties in my research right now. I have more successful men than successful women, and it doesn   t feel like it   s the right thing to me. On the campus, too, I felt like it was the women like Margaret 26  and Cynthia who tended to do work, and then we tended to be the spokespeople for their work. That was true of Glenn, too. He was, also.  I don   t know any of the men who were on campus when I was here who would have embraced this feminist model that many of us have become in later years. We didn   t get it. That   s why I praise this movement now because they have involved sexual orientation, the women. Some of the women who are in the leadership of Black Lives Matter are women who are lesbian and who have different sexual orientations than any of the rest of the people who are around. The women typically allowed us to lead because they felt that that was what the movement was about. When I find the group that was able to build respect into what they   re doing, I will be very happy to praise them because they were not the usual.  Peters Were you involved with any other off-campus groups, churches in town, other organizations in the city, the community of Stillwater, or was most of your activity really focused on campus?  Wade On campus, and so that was why the Unitarian initiative that the preacher asked me to involve with, that   s why it was so unusual. He asked me to do it. I don   t remember how he convinced me because I know I was too busy to do it. I probably was one of the few people who would have taken something like that. I don   t even know how I   d heard of Malcolm Boyd at the time, but I had heard of him and knew that he was a white liberal.  Peters You were developing relationships, connections with individuals at other places, so either at San Francisco State or   you had called, I guess, apparently. You were aware of other organizations or other groups traveling a similar path with you at different institutions, weren   t you?  Wade Only in a very generic way. More than relationship forming, for me it was about information because I had such a limited stock of information. I had never done this before, and so my feeling was,    What are you doing? What does black studies mean to you? What kind of courses are you teaching that constitute black studies?    It   s not to build relationships. I don   t understand that value at that point. The woman who   s going to speak tomorrow, that was one of her questions about the black student activism here on this campus. I told her I never picked up a phone and never even thought to pick up a phone to call people at the University of Oklahoma. I should have, and it would have added to the impact of our movement had we done this. I should probably ask Alonzo Batson, who was the next really important heir of this legacy. He was the leader who managed the boycott. As I have learned the counts of the boycott and President Kamm being forced to meet with the students, that has been a great satisfaction to me, that President Kamm, who would have never met with us, had to meet with these students because the governor asked him to, or demanded and sent the helicopter. 27  Peters Were you familiar with the incident where the sociology department resigned as a group?  Wade Yeah, that was the one. That was the one that was the.     Peters That was a part of this incident?  Wade That   s right. They chose to start this protest because of the contradictions within the department. That was the first time I remember that type of protest on the campus. I had never   . From 1961 to    69, I was not aware of anything like that. We still drew our support on the campus as student activists from other students. There were individual mentors for us, but we still relied upon students. I will say this. I think the role of white students has been understated in terms of the history of change on the campus. Just as they supported Nancy Randolph Davis, I have to say that I think I was supported. The willingness of people to   once we got Adam Clayton Powell, who was the hot potato. Nobody wanted to deal with him, but they made the travel expenses available, which is somewhat of a buy-in. Anything black is controversial at this point on the campus.  For them to provide support when Abe Hesser would not have supported him is an important step to me. There were more white students   . Ignore the fact the difference in populations, but there were more white students in the first black studies class than black students. Patrick was popular among certain   . He   s the son of Professor James Riggs. He was a white student that for a time, (I don   t think it was that long) he bridged white students and black students, at least insofar as he kept white students at some level aware of this process of us creating or initiating the course. I think their role is understated based upon when I talk to others, and that seems to be true throughout the   50s and the   60s. You would have expected white students to be the opposition.  Peters Are you familiar with an incident in the Library involving black students and the stacking of books in the stairwell?  Wade Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don   t know a lot about it. I, as a black student, was not involved with that, but people do allude to that. There are people who know more about that particular one than I did. It happened toward the end of the   60s. In some ways, I was beginning to broaden my reach. My Vietnam awareness comes later in the   60s, and I tended to get involved with those movements. There are others who would be much more knowledgeable than I would be.  28  Peters I   ve never been able to determine the extent of that activity, whether it was a few students and a few piles of books or an extensive movement. I   ve never been able to determine it.  Wade Yeah, Nimrod would have been a great source for it, but he passed earlier this year. I   m sure I can find somebody who would be willing to talk to you about that.  Peters From what I   ve read so far, it was a fairly minor incident that happened. Any other issues with the OSU residence halls while you were living there?  Wade Not for me. After a certain point, (I don   t remember exactly) I began to move off campus, and why did I move off campus? It just did not feel supportive in a lot of the residence halls. The white students who were activists did not typically live in the residence halls. I said,    Well, you know, maybe I should be off campus, too.    Gene Reid, who is here today, was one of my roommates from that period where I was staying in off-campus housing. Not to my knowledge.  Peters You   ve alluded to some of your activities after you left OSU. Anything else you want to add about your life after Oklahoma State University?  Wade I became involved with the Multicultural Center movement. In my view, why that movement is so important, because of the importance of the (let   s see; what is it called) co-curriculum movement. The co-curriculum is everything that is done outside the classroom. The largest advantage that I think I gained at Oklahoma State University was in the area of the co-curriculum. What I learned at Oklahoma State University provided a basis for my entire professional career. If someone had asked me,    What qualifications do you have in order to be director of a multicultural center,    I could not say that there was classroom knowledge or a classroom framework or a disciplinary framework that I would have been part of.  I could not say that there was any organization that I was a member of that supported interests in the co-curriculum, yet it   s the co-curriculum that enabled me to know what I needed to know about being a center director when I left in    69 to become the inaugural acting director of the Center for Black Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara. If I had not had that, if I had not had the experience with college administrators that I learned dealing with Kamm and Hesser, I would have been totally out of my element. Because I had that experience, I was able to give what I still think of today at the end of my career as a reasonably decent performance in a career that is very challenging, because you are, in fact, an educator. It   s just that you   re doing so outside the framework of the curriculum. There   s still people like me around who think that the curriculum   particularly in our times, because it wasn   t fitted for life in our world. 29  One problem, of course, there was no black studies. If you were Latino and here, if you were Native American and here, even if you were a woman and here, if you were Asian American and here, if you were a gay student, or a lesbian student, or a questioning student, it would have been hard to find relevant material as to how you relate to your own other significant community here at the university, at Oklahoma State University, or at any other institution of higher education. That   s what those students at San Francisco State were saying to their college administration, that,    We   re not prepared for the real world unless these courses are being taught. They should be respected, and you should create a department for these courses in the same way that you   ve done for other valid curriculum.     Peters Melvin, any other topics or subjects that I haven   t been smart enough to raise with you? Do you think we finished for today? I   ll leave it in your court. How do you feel?  Wade I   ll summarize with one important thing. My wife and I, we had a professional collaboration. She was certainly my best friend ever in life, excluding my parents, of course. My wife was someone who after our experience here at Oklahoma State University, she became director of African American Studies and an associate professor of black studies at the State University of New York at New Paltz. As you and I have mentioned, she was an authority and a linguistic scholar, but she was an authority on the life and history of Dr. Lorenzo Dow Turner. Dr. Turner was a specialist in the Gullah languages and the Geechee languages of the Sea Islands, off the coast of Georgia and South Carolina, also, in general, the first widely respected academic linguist of African American ancestry in the country. That would have not happened without Langston and Oklahoma State University.  It needed both of those experiences, but if they had been separate from each other, I don   t think she would have done it without Oklahoma State. That   s not just the fact that we met each other, but it   s because of those experiences, again. We needed to be able to interact with administrations and then to work out the problems of negotiation when you are strategically asymmetrical with each other. The other person has the larger share of the power, and the question that needs to happen is,    How do you change the universe that you both are part of so that you   re able to make it a profitable experience for you both?    Margaret and I were able to do that, and after all these years, I   ve learned that Oklahoma State University did that for us. When you leave, you don   t think about these things. It   s only after reflection that you see the significance of them. Margaret and I never talked about them, but I know her well enough to know that she would have agreed with that assessment.  30  I was able then to work with her in Omaha, Nebraska, to develop a black studies department. She changed the landscape at State University of New York, New Paltz, in the same way or in a similar way to the influence of Dr. Earl Mitchell here at Oklahoma State University. What it suggests to me is that to some degree I was wrong in my approach, that I thought it was important to be present at a lot of universities. She, I think, functioned best when she could put roots down at a university. Between Earl and Margaret, who had such an enormous impact on their institutions, there should be a recognition now of this model for change agents. More consideration should be given to what happens when people decide to make a stand and to overcome and absorb the momentum of racism, sexism, classism, and other isms in order to help an institution develop itself. Both Margaret and Earl made that type of commitment, and I respect that model more because of what they   ve been able to do.  Peters There   s a certain institutional memory that people with longevity can bring to the table because of their experience over a long period of time.  Wade That   s right. That   s right. In some sense, we   re coming up on that for this restricted period. I   m back, and hopefully next year there will be so many others returning to talk about the   50s and   60s. If you can engage that memory, then there are potential benefits for everybody, especially in the area of healing, not just for the people who were in some ways the victims, but from everybody. There   s potential healing that can be done. I know some of that healing has already taken place this weekend. I have people who said as much.  Peters Thank you very much, Melvin. I hope you will contact us next year and maybe consider some individuals willing to talk with us with the oral histories program at Oklahoma State University.  Wade Oh, absolutely, absolutely. I   ll start working on that since, as you know, part of the project is, in fact, to publicize and to publish the bios of certain people. We should talk about that. (Laughs)  Peters Okay, we will. Thank you, Melvin.  -------  -------
