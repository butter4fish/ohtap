 Larson  Hargis  Today is August 23, 2011. My name is Mary Larson. We   re here with  Mrs. Ann Hargis, the First Cowgirl at OSU, to talk a little bit about  Willham House and its history and your experience of the house since  you   ve been here. If we could start at the beginning, could you give us a  little biographical information about where you were born and raised?  Oh, sure. I was born in Ohio. Middleton, Ohio, USA. Needless to say,  moved before I learned how to talk because my accent is a Dallas  accent. I was raised in Dallas and am a product of state schools. I went  to Dallas public schools, and I proceeded to go to college at my state  college, which happened to have been in Austin. I   m a graduate of the  University of Texas and majored in math and Latin, which, to me, is  interesting in that I did major in math and Latin, but since Burns and I  married, nobody really asks that much about my educational  background. Once we moved to Stillwater, it became my identity. So for  forty years, it wasn   t part of who I was, but now it is a big part of who I  am.  How did you happen to choose math and Latin?  I started majoring in business, and I wasn   t mature enough for  economics. It just did not sink in. So I went back to my roots, and I went  back to   I actually had a roommate who was a physics major and  decided I loved math. Actually, I was talking with a student this morning  who is a math major, and I said I went through college not even thinking  that I was in college, because math was like working puzzles. It was like  crossword puzzles in the library, and I   d listen to music and do my  homework, and it wasn   t like I was struggling, it was like I was playing.  I just took one course and then another course and likewise did the same  in Latin. So you see, I had very few electives, but I just took courses I  was interested in at the time.  5  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  I took some Latin, myself, in high school, and it is very formulaic, too, so  I can see how it would parallel math very nicely, actually.  Yes, it did. Yes.  So you went to UT for college.  I did.  What did you do after you graduated?  Upon graduation, in those days you either taught or were a nurse, and I  did get a teaching certificate along with it, but as I graduated, I  interviewed through the College of Engineering. In those days, we didn   t  have job interviewing techniques, so I decided to use this major  corporation as my guinea pig and go through their interviewing process  so I would learn how to interview for a job. It just happened to be IBM.  So IBM kept calling me back for another interview and then did an  aptitude test and, lo and behold, offered me a position I couldn   t refuse.  So I became a systems engineer with IBM. In those days they were  hiring females, and they preferred females who had an aptitude but had  no previous training so they didn   t have to retrain, so I was just in the  right place at the right time.  How many other women were you working with at the time? What was  the percentage, do you think?  Ratio? Very, very few. Very, very few women. It was an exciting time.  What was that experience like?  I found myself as a college graduate being in charge of major accounts  in Houston and feeling that I was way over my head. I was still calling  everyone  Mr.  and  Mrs. , and I was taught not to do that, and it was  not in my makeup. It was an exciting time that I had to mature in a big  hurry as, I think, a young single female in the work force. So very  rewarding.  How long did you work there?  I worked full-time probably for six years, give or take, and then I  worked part-time afterwards. So even after Burns and I married, I  worked for IBM.  Since you bring up Burns, how did you folks meet?  6  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  What I love to say about the fact that Burns and I even met is we have  been connected with OSU since the day we met. We met in Houston,  Texas, around the swimming pool of my apartment complex. Burns  actually lived in Bartlesville, but his parents had moved to Houston, and  he came to Houston not knowing a soul but visiting someone who lived  in my apartment complex who was, first of all, an OSU grad, and second  of all, grew up in Stillwater, Oklahoma. His name was Tom Geiss.  Burns came to see Tom, also, because of his roommate who also was  from Stillwater, an OSU grad named Jay Belts. So Burns and I have  always    And of all things, I had on an orange muumuu, which I never  wore. It cinched it. (Laughter) It   s kind of comical that we   ve been on  this track since the day we met, and now the pieces start fitting together.  It all starts to make sense.  Yes.  So how long did you know each other before you decided to get  married?  We met on June 8, 1968, and we were engaged the next Christmas and  married on June 8, 1969. He actually was in law school at the time, and  I, of course, was working, so we were able to see each other probably  every other weekend or once a month. It would either be in Dallas, or it  would be in Houston, or I came to Norman, as a matter of fact, where he  was in school. We really didn   t know each other that well when we got  married, but we knew the basic things.  You knew what you needed to know.  We knew it was good.  And you put in a lot of driving time.  Yes, and a lot of telephone time. I always say we had a telephone  romance, basically.  Sometimes, you can cut through things if you   re conversing more and  you aren   t doing all the social things that sometimes people do with all  their friends. You get to know each other more quickly than you would if  you had to be in larger social groups.  Could be. I think maybe that telephone line takes out some of the   you  don   t know, but it could be that you   re just listening, and you   re really  listening on the telephone, and you   re not watching body language or I  don   t know, but it worked.  7  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  It seems to have stuck, certainly. (Laughter) I know there   s a lot of  history to cover between when you first met in 1968 and when you first  got here in March of 2008.  That   s right.  Do you want to give us a brief overview of some of the high points?  High points. Married, two children. A son and a daughter, both married  with children, so we   re grandparents. In the process of that, I think I  almost always worked part-time and was very much involved in the  community so have always been a volunteer. As a matter of fact, our  children used to play  go to meetings.  They never played  house.  They  would grab the briefcase and go to meetings, if that doesn   t give you  some idea of what we were like as young married family. So basically,  in Oklahoma City, we lived our entire married life in Oklahoma City  until we moved to Stillwater.  And did you and your husband have a conversation when the OSU  Presidency option came up?  Many.  What was his   ?  Well, I will say that Burns was approached for this job. He didn   t  exactly apply for it, and when he first started visiting with me about it,  my initial reaction was,    Why?    We had a sweetheart of a life, we had a  very comfortable life. Everything was moving along very well, and we  were very happy where we were. The more the process went on, the  more I realized that he really was the right person for the right time. So  it was more like,    Why not?    by that time. We had moments, initially,  like first of all,  thinking  surely they   d never want Burns to do that or  surely Burns wouldn   t want to do it, but I think the more he talked and  the more people who visited with him about potential, the more exciting  it became, so we haven   t looked back.  And he   d been on the Board of Regents, so he had some sense of what he  was     Correct. He knew what the university needed, but he didn   t come from  within the ranks of a university, so he had his hesitations about how he  would be received and his ability to manage a major university through  education. He has attacked it as a businessman and a community person,  and he   s left the academics up to the people who know more about the  8  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  academics.  He   s certainly made a lot of inroads around here.  Well, I hope so, I hope so.  Well, that brings us to the house here. What can you tell me? You  inherited the house, essentially, from the Schmidlys     Exactly.  And you moved in, would it have been March 2008, or a little before?  Burns was asked to be president in December of 2007. Someone else can  get into the legalities of why he was not to become president  immediately. It had to do with the fact that he had been on the Board of  Regents, and state law prohibited  that . You had to be off the board for  a certain amount of time. So there was a period of time where we were  in limbo. He had been named, and the community assumed that he was   president , but he really wasn   t. I used to call the house   before we got  the keys to the house, we were allowed to come in the house and  measure and take pictures, but we always had police escort, a campus  policeman. That was for legality for him, and it was totally  understandable, but I called it    before we got the keys.     So when we initially knew that this is what we were going to do  it  was  in December, and we saw the house, you can imagine, with no green  grass. It was sort of barren. There was not even a salt and pepper shaker  in the house. There was a grand piano. There was a table in storage that  we knew we had, and there were mattresses on the floor. So starting  from that point, we actually decided that we wanted the university to  furnish the house, so that this home now has university furnishings.  When we leave, we will leave with nothing. I think the furniture fits the  house, and I think that it is a gift to the university, and it   s the way we     We   re the sixth president to live in the house. I think previous presidents  have always brought their own furniture, so we left our things in a home  in Oklahoma City. A lot of that is because, when you think about it,  there   s a state legislature, there   s a campus, there are future students,  there are alumni, there are many reasons why there   s business to be done  in Oklahoma City, and although it   s only an hour away, you   d be  amazed at what long days there are and that by nine, ten o   clock at night,  it   s just a lot easier to put your head down on a pillow in Oklahoma City.  So we make choices, and I jokingly call it  travelling with bananas,   because Burns likes bananas in the morning, and you get three days of  bananas and they   re no longer good. So I usually just keep bananas with  9  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  me, and if we decide to spend the night in Oklahoma City, I   ve got the  bananas. If we   re going back to Stillwater, I   ve got the bananas.  (Laughter) You   re set either way.  I   m ready with my bananas.  What was the arrangement of the house like when you first moved in?  Obviously the layout was essentially the same, but were the rooms used  the same?  I will say one decision we made was the original dining room to the  house we had not used but heard that it became very claustrophobic  when we had receptions. When there were receptions in the president   s  house, the ceiling is low, and it   s a little congested, and people were sort  of bottlenecked in that particular room. So we moved the dining room  out into the major living area of the home and turned the dining room  into a sitting room.  Okay, and the dining room area was   ?  Off the kitchen. So that   s the only change that I think we   ve made.  Okay, so most of the other spaces had been used...  Self-defined. Yes, I would say the major entertaining area of the home is  downstairs, and I think that the previous owner, of course, you   d have to  talk to them, but it is my understanding they used the downstairs more as  their private home for out-of-town guests and family. We have it set up  strictly for entertaining.  I know when we talked to Dr. Willham, he had said that that downstairs  space had been used for entertaining when his parents were here. Not  that they did a lot of entertaining, but when there were university events,  like some of the annual breakfasts that were held, that those were held  downstairs.  Yes, and I will say, it   s very confusing to me. I would like to have been  a little fly on the wall to understand how previous presidents have  entertained in this home, because the home was built in 1960, and the  kitchen is 1960 modern, but that being said, had no microwave. In 1960,  we didn   t have giant economy size of anything, so most everything, the  cabinet space, is about the size of, I would say, a regular Campbell   s  soup can. So there   s very little room for catering in this kitchen, plus you  have to carry everything on a tray downstairs. We tried to entertain that  way, and catering services were carrying trays of food up and down the  10  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  stairs all night long with congestion of people, bottlenecks. So we   ll get  into how we   ve redone that a little bit later, but I   m just curious as to  how anybody ever entertained in that predicament.  We can discuss the entertaining a little bit now, if you like, or we can     We can put it together any way we want to     Since we   re on that topic, we might as well. We   ll discuss that.  Okay. I would say the home has evolved through the years. I think every  time a president has been here, upgrades have been made. At some  point, bathrooms were made ADA compliant, and other features in the  home have been  upgraded . With that being said, there   s still one front  door, and it   s upstairs. There   s no way to get downstairs unless you go  across the lawn. There   s no sidewalk. Well, there was not. Then, I also  mentioned the catering situation with the kitchen. There really was sort  of a warming kitchen downstairs, but I think it was original to the house.  I   m not sure. We have since put in ADA-compliant sidewalks, which  helps not only those who need it for disabilities, but also catering can get  their food in and out downstairs more readily. The kitchen has been  remodeled for that very idea. Now we can cater things out of a kitchen  downstairs. The caterers do not need to come upstairs. Everything is  down there that they need, so it has really smoothed out the  entertainment and the flow of this house.  And you don   t have to be courting disaster with people and trays of hot  food on stairways with other people trying to come up and down stairs.  Yes, and then also, when the entertainment is over, you don   t have to  cart everything back upstairs. It has made a huge difference, probably  the biggest difference in this home, and it wasn   t here before.  When we   re talking about changes that have been made either to the  building itself or the grounds, you have the ADA-compliant walkway,  you have some changes to what used to be the warming kitchen  downstairs. Is there anything else in terms of either the building or the  grounds?  We have tried to be very mindful of our economic situation on this  campus, and although the home is as old as it is and it needs some major  repairs, we try to be very prudent with what is being done with the  house. So we have done minor painting. Before we painted    The  bathrooms have been painted warmer colors. All bathrooms were white,  fixtures were white, walls were white, everything was white with no  amenities.  11  Larson  One of the things I wanted to tell you, in a way I   m digressing, but one  of the things that we love to do in using this home is treat it as kind of a  living laboratory for the school. We have done certain things with the  housing, design, and marketing department through Human Sciences.  They have done a flow study. One thing they did was take    The front  door is sort of against the stone wall of the house, which is a little  congested with people coming in and out. They did a flow of how  people enter the home, where they go when they enter. It was a  fascinating study. We   ve used it somewhat, and then they also did a  study, this is bringing back to the light painting, a study that, if you  wanted to participate in this study, you were asked to go into two similar  bathrooms downstairs and just wash your hands, look at yourself in the  mirror, and spend a little time, and then go in the other one. So you  compare the two, then you answered a questionnaire.  What you didn   t know was the study was being done on lighting. We  have a lighting expert on campus, Paulette Hebert.  Several groups  participated  in a study of different incandescent lighting and the effect  of people in those bathrooms,  including faculty, a Stillwater Rotary  Club, and her students . So that was a fascinating study. Also, the same  group did lighting studies of displays in the house because     I   m kind of skipping around, but this is how we use it as kind of a  working lab. We have an OSU grad,  Gale Jarvis,  who happens to be  president of Madame Alexander Dolls, and a couple years ago she was  being recognized on campus. Because of that she shipped boxes and  boxes and boxes of these wonderful dolls, more than we could display  anywhere. I believe the library has catalogued those. We do have a  display cabinet in the house with some of the dolls that we will trade out,  but there was also a lighting study done on the lights in the cabinet  where they   re displayed and the effect of sunlight on the dolls and  preservation of the dolls. We have loved sharing the home with groups  who do things like that.  We   ve had landscape architect students do a study of a patio off the  kitchen area of the house and do different studies of how it might be  better utilized, so we had seventeen renderings of how that could have  been done. We   ve got art students who have done projects in the house  and on the lawn. We   ve had three-dimensional art on the lawn, which  has been fabulous, because the students have a public place to display  their art, which is great, but we also get to add to the interest of the  house and the entertainment of people coming and going in the house.  And I know you   ve had other exhibits, too, over time, because when I  first came here as a new faculty member, when you had the reception  12  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  here, there were chair models.  Yes, yes. Small chairs, that was the 3-D art class, as well. Those students  took the smaller pieces, and then turned around and did them in the  lawn. So at one point, we had like twenty-five different chairs out of a  particular project, which I believe they were given a finite amount of  lumber, and they had to design a chair out of that amount of lumber.  Some of the chairs had three legs, some of them had missing slats in the  back. It was a great little project. We also are having a class out in a  couple weeks to do a study on curb appeal, so we   re always looking for  ideas for students to come in and get to know the house and enjoy the  house.  It sounds like basically you   ve made the president   s house interactive.  Oh, we   re hoping to, because it   s what brings it to life.  Had there been, to your knowledge, a lot of projects like that  previously?  I   m not aware of projects. I know the home has always been used for  entertaining, for having groups in, but as far as having hands-on  projects, I   m really not sure that I   ve heard of any. This just sort of  evolved through conversations, and when we   d have groups in, I love to  say that and also get some ideas for ways it can be used that we   re not  thinking about. I will also say, backtracking, when we arrived, of course,  since there was no furniture in the house, there also was no artwork in  the house. So consequently, all the artwork in the house is from the  permanent collection of OSU.  One of the very first parties we had was to invite people who made the  home livable, and that would have been the electricians and the  groundsmen, and all the people who worked on the home came in to see  the home, as well as the art department. It was fun to watch the faculty  and students of the art department view their art, which they had not  seen because it had been in storage. So it was like a gallery opening.  That was great fun. That was just great fun. We also used the stairwell of  the house to have an interchanged art exhibit of current students' art. So  twice a year we go to a showing at the art department and select pieces  to hang in the house for that semester.  How was the rest of the art chosen for the house? Pieces that are  downstairs and then some of the faculty pieces that are     Chosen by the faculty themselves and with our    If there are pieces that  didn   t work    And they are travelling pieces, because some of the  13  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  pieces will be used for some other reason. Like for instance, Doel Reed  has been displayed here in the house. Certain pieces, like we had some   Robert  Rauschenbergs (we   ve got fabulous art on this campus), were  here long enough. I think there was some concern that maybe they  needed to be moved because of the climate. I mean, this is really not  museum-quality lighting and climate, so they have been replaced with  other pieces of art. The Doel Reed project has taken many of the pieces  that were in the house that were Doel Reed's,  and they  have been used  for other shows. They   ve been replaced with other things. It   s kind of  fun to change it out and enjoy different artists.  You mentioned Doel Reed. Are there other university faculty  pieces ?  We have university faculty pieces in here, and we   ve got collections of  different artists.  Do you think you   re at liberty to say what your favorite piece is that   s  currently in here?  Oh, I   m very partial to a Jasper Johns that   s in here. Yes.  Well, before we go past any of the changes that have been made, are  there any other small things on the grounds?  Well, I was also going to point out the fact that the Friends of the  Library have donated and decorated the bookshelves behind me, and  also the Friends of the Hotel Restaurant Administration have done a  similar bookcase in the breakfast area of the home, so that   s got dishes  that are used by Ranchers  Club  and Taylor's and cookbooks and  various items that are used there. So that   s great fun.  Along with the other changing exhibits, you   ve got some of these as well  and the Madame Alexander Dolls.  That   s right.  Which are remarkable.  That   s right. Aren   t they fun?  I did not know an OSU grad was currently the     Yes, Gale Jarvis. A tremendous asset to the university and a great friend.  Turned out to be a good friend.  Now, we   ve been talking a little bit about how interactive this space has  14  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  become, which brings up the issue of this house as an extension of the  university and all of the public and private spaces. Which rooms are  which at this point, do you think?  Well, I love the question    Garth Brooks was in here, and he said,    I   m  going to ask you a question I   m asked all the time. Do you really live  here?    I said,    Yes, we really live here.    You are in our dining room, our  living room. This is the living room of the house, and it is our living  room. What I have found out, I would not have known before we held  this position, is that I believe what a president and his family needs is a  separate, private area. Not this large, efficient, because you   re really not  in it all that much, but a place to hang your hat which is separate from  the public areas. I think the public areas, there again, are the front door  to your university, and I think they need to speak for the university, how  you feel about yourself and how you want to present yourself. I feel that  there   s a lot to be done.  I tell you another off-the-subject thing, I   ve decided    In our lifestyle,  we travel a great deal. As a matter of fact, someone who is keeping track  of this   we wouldn   t have known this if somebody didn   t say, for  entertainment purposes   we are here an average of ten nights a month.  In those ten nights a month, we   re entertaining about six. We are not in  this house by ourselves very often. If we   re gone two-thirds of the time,  what do you think we   re doing most of that time? Packing and  unpacking. So I believe if you do a design purpose for a president of a  land-grant university, the garage needs to be next to the master closet,  because we are hauling luggage in and out of the house. It   s never the  same luggage twice, because the situation is different every time you  travel. That will be one thing I will keep in mind if ever things are done  with the president   s house, and I truly would like to leave that for the  next president. I would like for that next president not to come in to such  a shock as we did.  (Laughter) Well, at least the next president will have furniture.  Well, that   s true, too  That is true. And they will have the option of  whether they want to bring their own or mix their own with what the  university owns. Did I answer your question?  Yes, and are there some private   ? When you give a tour of the house,  do you usually include the master bedroom or an office?  I never do. I will tell you, the president always would. He would open up  his closet or his chest of drawers. He just is an open person. There is a  master wing to the house, and it literally is a bathroom and a bedroom  with a sitting area. I close that off for the general public. We also have a  15  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  cat who is in that area, so I close Stella the cat into that area, because I  think there are some people who maybe would not like to have cats  around. But no, the rest of the house is really open for visitors, and I will  say, as well, because the house was built in the sixties, how did we have  bathrooms and bedrooms in the sixties? Our guest wing consists of a  hallway, off the hallway are two bedrooms, and off the hallway is a  bathroom. So if we do have overnight guests, they share a hall bath with  the other guests in the other bedrooms, so it   s not ideal in the twenty-first  century, but that   s what we have at this point.  I get a sense from talking, say, to Dr. Willham, who was here when his  parents were here, that obviously the responsibilities of land-grant  presidents have changed, and now fund-raising and entertaining are so  much more a part of the duties. So much more than it was previously,  and this house was designed when entertaining was not a high priority.  That is very true.  I guess that   s reflected in the catering situation and the private versus  public space?  And I will say too, I keep educating myself as to, whenever you   re out  and you entertain, you really don   t need to know how the food was  prepared or how it got to you. As long as you   re comfortable and the  temperature is right and there   s flow, you don   t need to know what  happens in the back room. But as far as one who does this    And I will  say, the other thing about this job, what has worked for us (and I don   t  know about other presidents) is that we literally sit down maybe six  months out, we try to do it per semester. We have to use the calendar to  book ourselves in this house in order to entertain. So we like to entertain  at least two nights in a row and then skip a week, and then two nights in  a row. That   s ideal. It doesn   t always work that way, and a lot of times  we have changes in the plans. The entertainment has to do with your  being here physically. That is a big challenge. We   re still trying to figure  out if there   s ever a way that we can get all of that down to entertain at  least four nights a month. It usually turns out to be more, but those are  four scheduled nights.  In addition to that, there are over four hundred student organizations, I  don   t know how many faculty organizations, staff organizations,  community organizations. There   s no way to have an annual event in  this home without slighting somebody. I was trying to think of things we  do yearly. It   s different all the time, the variety of groups we   ve had in,  but we have kind of tried to celebrate our outstanding alums before one  football game and have a brunch. But there again, it depends on when  the game is scheduled. Then we also have a caroling, Christmas  16  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  decorating event in the home, which is interesting on a college campus,  because we usually come back from Thanksgiving, go directly into dead  week and finals, so there   s not that much entertaining in the home during  Christmas, although we   re going to start using the community because  we can   t really use students. But if the home is decorated, we really  would like to entertain. So we   re trying as well to connect with the City  of Stillwater and use some of the civic organizations, the Chamber of  Commerce, United Way, Rotary Clubs, and have some community  involvement as well.  I   ll tell you one of the most fun things we did was the very first night we  moved into this house, we had a slumber party with our children and  grandchildren. We all came up and threw out sleeping bags and spent the  night in the house, which is a great way to break in the house. But we no  sooner pulled up than our immediate neighbors started ringing the  doorbell, and like a small town, they brought home-baked goods, they  brought little toys for the cat. I mean, it   s a wonderful location and  wonderful neighborhood for this house. So actually, our grandkids  connected with some of the children in the neighborhood. I used to say  when they came, we either had no children here or we had eight  children, because they would go get their friends and bring them back.  We do enjoy sharing this house with the neighbors.  I guess that lends itself to the question of how events are actually  scheduled here. Through the president   s office, do you lay out the  schedule as you said, you try to lay things out, but do other groups try to  make reservations to have things here?  We have not had that much of that. Now, through word of mouth and  through contacts, we did have the Rotary Club meet here, and that was  during the lighting study that I told you about. A lot of that was to get  some outside input for that, but also be able to use the home to say to the  community,    This is your home, too.    Normally, we really are so busy  with the university, and there   s so many groups we   d love to have in.  When you think about it, every year, the group changes. So because you  have the faculty council in one year, the next year it   s a different  council. So it   s very hard not to just say,  We will do that every single  year,  but if we do it every single year, it   s at the expense of some other  group. So it   s a juggling act we do every year. We have lists of people  we   d love to have, and we can   t slide them all in.  Well it sounds like, if you folks are entertaining that many nights out of  the month, you certainly have a full plate and a full house.  We do have a full plate, yes. And for any time that we are entertaining  here, that means we are not doing something somewhere else. So when  17  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  you think about how many activities there are on campus, which we also  love to get a piece of the action of that and see, learn what   s going on on  campus, but if we   re here we can   t be doing that too, so it   s a juggling  act which we enjoy, but it   s definitely time management.  It   s a challenge.  It is a challenge.  Now, with the house itself, either with the public space or with the  private space, what room would you say is your favorite? Do you have a  place that feels particularly cozy?  The home itself is built in a cross, and that opens up four different areas  outside when you think about it. So you can be on the east in the  morning, or on the west in the morning and the east in the afternoon,  however you like the sun. I will tell you, my very first morning in this  house, to walk across getting a coffee, look out the window    The house  faces east right here, and to see that glorious sunrise is probably one of  my favorite memories. A first memory, but a favorite. Depends on the  time of year.  So it just changes with the changing seasons?  It changes with the time of day and with the season.  What about the grandkids? What room do they like?  They love the downstairs. They absolutely love it downstairs.  There   s enough room for them and all their friends?  Maybe that   s what it is, and they can play under the stairwell.  That   s got good fort space.  It does. Good fort. Exactly.  (Laughter) I haven   t forgotten how to think like a five year old, although  none of them are that young anymore.  No, they   re getting older. They   re getting harder and harder to find time  to get together.  Let   s talk about staff, too, and the issue of how you get staff from  different places.  18  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  How does this all come together, how do they do it ? I would say, we are  an extension of the university, and as such, there is not an employee  assigned strictly to this home, so it   s teamwork. How they work it out  time wise, effort wise and priority wise is beyond me. For instance, the  yard crew, it   s the same crew that works on the campus, so we share  duties. We have event planners who also plan things through the U Club,  plan other things on campus, and get caught up in the most incredible        Oh, by the way, we have this unusual group coming in from this  unusual country and will you do   ?    It doesn   t fit under any particular  category, so it falls on the shoulders of people who are sort of at large.  So there   s a team of people, working as a team, and it   s incredible how it  all fits together, but it does. It   s a great team.  Could you talk a little bit about who some of the key staff members have  been since your arrival? I know people have been shared, so it   s coming  and going, so maybe you do or don   t want to get into that.  Yes, I do. I will tell you an interesting situation that happened a little  over a year ago. We found ourselves with    The person who  coordinated events at the house, who was also in the president   s office  doing double duty, left, and so we needed someone. We decided to go  through part-time employment. Through part-time employment, we  found someone who was looking for part-time work. I don   t know if  you   ll be able to use this or not, but the job description read: Needed:  part-time work, one to twenty hours a week, must live within twenty  minutes of the president   s house, no guarantee. Well, what are you going  to find for that?  We happened to have found a young man who had just moved to  Stillwater who was way overqualified who had fourteen years  experience at the Ritz Carlton. He took the job. He took the challenge.  Part-time wages with a family of three children, a wife and three  children. I guess he had savings enough just to let him do this for the  pleasure of getting his foot in the door, but Jeremy Brown has taken this  house and entertainment to a new level. He   s brought sort of a five-star  approach on a minimum budget to the president   s residence, and it has  been very, very rewarding to work with him. Also, of course, he   s doing  so many things on campus, and he finds himself working with the Wine  Forum, working with the vendors that come in with that, working with  the students. He is all over campus. He   s managing the U Club, and he   s  finding guest entertainment and guest projects and taking busloads of  faculty/staff on adventures, and he   s always coming up with new things  to do.  I knew Jeremy from about three different places on campus, so he is     19  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  He   s all over the place.  He   s ubiquitous, but as you say, it   s one of those positions that it   s  shared across    It   s not a staff position  solely at Willham House . It   s  just here     Right, right.  We talked a little bit about how events are scheduled. Are there any  really memorable special events that you recall having here? I mean, I  realize they all have unique qualities.  They do.  Are there any special moments, particularly interesting stories?  Well, of course, I loved the very first event we had to thank people for  getting the house ready and to welcome the art department. I thought  that was spectacular. I believe Easter time we tried for the first time to  involve the neighborhood, so we had jumping bounce houses. (Laughs)  We had bounce houses and Easter egg hunts and the Easter Rabbit. It  was very, very fun. It was very successful. Of course, the president was  running around in my little electric cart giving everybody rides, so I   m  sure there were some parents going,    Wait, what is he all about?    But  we had a big time. That was great fun. We have some events being  planned that are a little unusual too, a little different, so there   s always  something out there that hasn   t been done before.  Something to look forward to.  Yes, something to look forward to.  Now, in analyzing the house, what would you say are some of the best  points of the house? Are there things that work particularly well, I  guess, as far as either the public area here, maybe with the view?  The setting of the house is phenomenal. As you approach the home, it  sits on seven acres of land, and there are over one hundred acres behind  the house, which is university-owned land, undeveloped. It   s where our  cross country team works out and has their competitions. They work out  there and run there. It is wonderful. You don   t even know you   re in  Stillwater, you don   t even know you   re in Oklahoma. It   s real hilly.  There are horses back there. It used to be a golf course. It is a great  getaway place.  20  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Like I said, the neighbors are great. The home itself, I think what I   d like  to say about the home is I respect the fact that people who come here for  the first time have a real sense of pride that I wouldn   t take away from  them for anything in the world. It   s an honor to be in this home and to  share it with other people. Physically, as it works, I think there are a lot  of things that could be done, but as far as someone walking in the front  door, it   s a pleasure to see the look on their face.  What are some of the special features around the house? I know you   ve  talked before about some of them.  I want to tell you, there   s a graduate of OSU named Joe Mitchell. Joe  and Connie Mitchell came to the house, and he   s another one who said,     I went to school here, I   ve been an alum, I   ve never been in the house,  and I   m an architect major.    So as he walked in the house, he said,     Look at this cabinetry.    Actually, he explained the whole prairie home  architecture and the meaning of the beams and the meaning of the stone,  and he brought the house to life. But what tickled me, as we walked  down the hallway he said,    These units are the same units that they use  in Kerr/Drummond.    They are dormitory units. They   re the closets, the  chest of drawers, and the shelving that go in the dorms. They   re in every  room of this house.  And they   re built into the hallway, too.  Cabinets in the hallway. It   s almost like who built the home   and that   s  why I think it   d be fun to find out who built this and how did they come  up with the idea of putting   because I want to always preserve these  cabinets. I just want to have them. They just have such history behind  them. There are three up and down the hallway of the guest wing, and  each guest bedroom has its own. They   re identical. They   re like pre-fab  units. If they were ordering for the dorm, they   d say,    Just order me ten  more units, and I   ll put them in the president   s home.    And I didn   t  realize that for a long time.  I was going to say, they certainly look like they fit in the home. I mean,  they fit the architecture and everything. It   s part of a piece.  Yes, it is.  It   s good in that it ties this house back     Back to the university. Exactly. I say, too, because I do work with some  of the students as they move into the dorms, and as I watch them unload  their things in their chest of drawers, I   ll say,    You know, we have those  same units in the president   s house.    And it   s great. It   s a connect.  21  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  How many people can say that?  That   s right.  Are there any other little special features or special touches around here  like that that are particularly noticeable or quaint?  Quaint? The home still has the original telephone system in it. It   s the  cord phone with multiple buttons. I could tell you maybe twenty buttons  per phone, and when we were first touring the home, as I said, before we  got the key    Every room has a special little cabinet, a wooden cabinet,  and you open the cabinet, and there are these large, they look like office  telephones from the 1960s. I saw all these buttons, and I thought,    Isn   t  that strange? , where you would hit a button to call, I guess, the kitchen  and one for the master bedroom or one    I couldn   t figure out the  buttons until the officer said,    Oh no, ma   am. Those are to call campus.     It hadn   t dawned on me that this home was connected with the business.  It   s really part of the business. So I guess the buttons would hook you up  with the president   s office and maybe with admissions and the police  and the hospital, I don   t know what all, but anyway, it   s kind of fun  because they still exist. Don   t know how to use them, but they   re still  here.  (Laughter) Have you ever tried them out just to see?  Well, I do use the phone in the kitchen. I   ve used it because you dial 8 to  dial out.  Is there an intercom system in the house?  Might be, but I   ve never used it. Don   t need to.  Are there any other recollections or stories   ?  Let me check and see if there   s something I had. I just took a little note  that I wanted... I think I pretty well covered it. There are other people  that will be talking to you about the size of groups that we entertain, and  we can seat about fifty downstairs. We   d like to be able to have larger  seated dinners downstairs, and we can handle maybe seventy standing  upstairs, so that   s the extent of the group. If it gets larger than that, we   re  sort of bound by the size of the house, but we would like for it to be  more versatile for different groups.  So overall, just to wrap up, what would you say your future goals are? I  know you   re trying to make this more interactive and trying to make it a  22  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  larger part of both the university community and the larger Stillwater  community, but what   s your grand plan? If you had your druthers, what  would you like to see for this house?  Well, I would love for the home to be a monument to what it is on this  land. I would like for it to be of use. Whether it is redesigned for the  twenty-first century or whether it is used for a faculty house or a  gathering place, I believe it has a history all of its own, and I want to  preserve that history. Whether it   s the president   s house or not, I don   t  know. That being said, when we first got here, because the history    I  think you   ll find that the Board of Regents has said for over fifteen years  that something needs to be done about the president   s residence. It   s one  of those things,    Yes, great, go ahead and do it.       You do it.       No, you  do it.    But when we first arrived, we said we wanted to be on campus  and we wanted to connect with the students and the faculty and staff, so  we had a whole group, a committee, who looked at different locations on  campus. We actually have a layout of the university as it sits today, a  three-dimensional layout. It   s got all the sidewalks, the trees, the  buildings, and everything.  We had a fifth-year architect student who had a rendering of what could  possibly be a president   s house, however large, and held it in her hand  and would take that building and would put it down on campus, and you  could turn the door to open on the north or on the east, and then  everyone would stand around and say,    Well, you can   t do that because  it blocks Old Central.       Okay, well we   ll move it somewhere else.    We  checked about eleven different locations, and they all had drawbacks. So  we decided to really study before we would eat up any more green space  on campus, at which point, I came up with the idea that I wanted the  president   s residence to be on the top floor of the Student Union, but  that   s not going to happen as you can tell. With all the renovations being  done, that won   t happen. So what we   ve done is come back to this  particular area, because there   s a lot to be said about not spoiling what  we already have going for us on campus. Also, I hope that we   ve  realized you can become a huge part of this campus without actually  living on campus. So we are very involved on campus physically and  don   t feel that there   s a need    Plus, in doing research, many university  presidents are moving off of campus. So we want to respect the wishes  of the next person who comes along and the next and the next and not  make a decision for them that they have to live with.  As the university moves north, too, you   re getting closer to it without  having to go anywhere.  That   s true. When you think about it, when the home was built in 1960,  it was built a mile away from the north end of campus, which was the  23  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  library. And look how far the campus has already moved north, so we   re  less than a mile away from campus.  As the athletic area fills out, it   s going to be closer and closer. Pretty  soon you   ll be two blocks away.  Well, that   s true   Well, thank you so much for your time.  Thank you as well, and if you think of anything else you need to ask me,  give me a call because I   m not thinking real clearly right now.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.   After turning off the tape we thought of something else. What would you  like to add  about event planning and some of the folks that were  involved with that?  One of the key things that make things happen around this house, no  matter what the president does, is a group of junior and senior students  who volunteer their time. They   re called the President   s Partners. We try  to have probably two, depending on the size of the group,  representatives of students at every event, which again connects us back  to the fact that we   re all here because of the students. Without the  students, we wouldn   t be doing what we   re doing. It also gives those  students a chance to interact with some of the guests we have in this  home. So they volunteer, they greet people at the door, they kind of  handle things as things need to be handled. If it   s raining, they carry  umbrellas and walk people out to their car. We also use the President   s  Posse at the president   s suite at football games, or if we have any event  on campus, they are a willing group of participants. Needless to say,  they   re outstanding students or they wouldn   t be part of this group.  That gives them some experience, too, in understanding how people  entertain at a certain point.  Exactly, and it looks good on their resume.  So is it mainly their junior and senior year? Is it for one semester or two  semesters?  Juniors and seniors for as long as they want to, and frankly, we have  some who want to be at every event. It   s really kind of fun, and some  24  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  Larson  Hargis  that we see very seldom, but they are members of the Student  Association, it might be the Student Government Association, they   re  members of the Student Alumni Board. So there again, they are  participating on campus, and it is typical of so many things in life. You  see the same students who are your top ten seniors, they   re all  President   s Posse, but they   re in so many other things, too. So we will  see them on campus a lot of times in different groups that we visit.  So once someone comes in as a junior, you may see them a lot for the  next two years?  That is exactly right. As a matter of fact, we were over at  Kerr/Drummond today greeting new students. One said,    I   m a new  President   s Partner     She   s real excited about being a part of that group.  And do you know how students become part of that group? Is it  something they apply for?  They have their own selection committee  choosing from  the  applicants.  Do you know how many there are or how many you may see?  I bet we have twenty to twenty-five on any given year. So when you use  two each, it   s a good group, and they   re very busy.  I   m sure that   s a help to you handling a lot of these receptions.  It   s a help to us, but also, there   s a great sense of pride when you   re able  to say, a lot of times, like at the football suite, you have invited  particular people for particular reasons, and when you can say,    This is a  student majoring in microbiology from Wewoka,    it connects people.  You will see a lot of times your Board of Regents exchanging business  cards, and it   s just a wonderful way for the students to connect and for  alumni and faculty to appreciate what we have on this campus.  And if you bring the community in, for members of the community to get  to know what fine, outstanding students we have.  Absolutely. Absolutely.  Okay, well thank you. Is there anything else that we forgot about?  I   m just thinking    Just give me a call if you think of something. If  somebody else mentions something in an interview you want to know  more about, I   d be happy to answer it.  25  Larson  Hargis  Thank you.  You bet. Thank you.  -------  -------
