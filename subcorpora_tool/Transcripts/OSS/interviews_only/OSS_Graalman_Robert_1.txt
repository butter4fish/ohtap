 Gill. Today is June 30th, 2009. I   m visiting Dr. Robert  Graalman in the OSU Library on the Oklahoma State University campus  in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories  Project by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Bob, thanks  for taking the time to come visit with us today.  You   re welcome. I   m excited to be here.  What if we started at the beginning? Could you go back and tell me a  little bit about your early life, where you grew up, a little bit about your  family?  My family is from western Oklahoma where I grew up in Okeene and  Fairview. My grandfather and father were both in the banking business  in Okeene and Fairview. I graduated from Fairview High School in  1965. I have a sister, Nancy, who also came to OSU and was a student  here, a very good student. My dad actually came here as a sixteen-year-old  freshman in 1938 and finished two years in the history department  and was told that he had completed all of the courses, so he needed to go  to the University of Minnesota to finish his bachelor   s degree. So, off he  went where he graduated from University of Minnesota. Then during  World War II, he was a naval officer and waiting for his assignment  after graduating from Officer Candidate School. He was a person who  was very gifted with language and interested in puzzles and various  things. He was shipped back to Stillwater, Oklahoma, to study the  Japanese language at the OSU branch of the Japanese language school in  the Navy. There were campuses here and in Boulder, and he was sent to  the Stillwater campus seventy miles from his hometown where he  finished that part of the war. He learned the Japanese language and was  headed to Japan to be an interpreter when the war ended.  5  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  One interesting thing that you might want to include in your history is  that part of OSU   s involvement in World War II. Jay Boggs, who may  have come up in some of your conversations, pulled me aside one day  and handed me my Dad   s card that he used to enroll in that program, and  he said there were a hundred other cards. He said that perhaps that group  of individuals who studied the Japanese language here was the single  most outstanding group of eventual businessmen and academics that he  had ever seen come out of OSU because these were the brightest naval  officers from all over the country.  So, it was a natural that OSU would be in my blood. I always tell people  that I was brought here the first time in 1949 as a two-year-old baby to  go to an OSU basketball game, and, unfortunately for that game, I was  so frightened by the noise that they had to take me out. But fortunately  something must have clicked because I started going to basketball games  and haven   t missed many since then. And for that reason, for proximity  and the family   s love affair with OSU, is why I ended up here in 1965.  Bob, could you share a little bit of your undergraduate experiences in  leadership organizations you were involved in, academics, and personal  life?  Not too many. I was in Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and I was a pre-law  major and was very excited to be at OSU. People always ask me because  of my job whether or not I was really involved in the upper realm of  academics at OSU, and I have to confide that I didn   t really know too  much about that at the time. I don   t know if that was my own immaturity  or the information just wasn   t available, but I was a student who enjoyed  every minute that I was here, felt that I learned a lot and most  importantly met my wife-to-be and made a lot of great friends. That has  been instrumental, I think, in the quality of my life, very much so.  Were there some highlights for you in your undergraduate experience  that you recall, events, activities?  Well, I always remember, of course, the first dance. I think that was  called the Ribbon Dance, and I met some really great friends the first  night at OSU. I was around a group of men who eventually made a big  impact on OSU. In fact, out of my fraternity there are three individuals  who   ve been selected for the OSU Hall of Fame, which I think is a  pretty rare thing. In three successive years which is, I think, is really  remarkable   Don Nichols, Steve Jorns, and Jim Carreker. I just  remember being around those people. It was always a very stimulating  experience and a lot of talented leaders that I was able to associate with.  Bob, you went on to graduate school. Can you share a little bit about  6  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  your graduate instruction?  I went to law school for a while and it didn   t click. I had taken a course  here from a famous OSU professor named David Shelley Berkeley and  he was in the English department. I   d also met the person who was my  fianc  e-to-be just before I left for law school. It was also during the time  of great duress for a lot of people because of the Vietnam War, and I  don   t think people realized how much of an impact that had on young  people at the time, regarding their academic planning. For a variety of  reasons, I left law school and came back here to pursue a master   s  degree in English, and that   s really where I think my academic side  kicked in. OSU was a great school for me to become acclimated socially  as an undergraduate, but graduate school was where I really started to  feel the urge to become a better scholar, and I got a master   s in English  here. Went to the University of Tulsa following that for my PhD in  English, taught there for a while after finishing my degree and then went  off for my first job at Illinois State. After three years at Illinois State   with  a temporary contract that had expired, we found ourselves with  two children and nothing to do. We   d always wanted to live in  Stillwater, thinking that perhaps life would be better for family in  Stillwater than it was for students, and that has turned out to be the case.  I came back to Stillwater under very unusual circumstances. A friend of  mine knew Bob Hamm, a legendary OSU professor. I did not know Bob,  but my friend told Bob about my desire to return to Stillwater, and I  think Bob   s history at OSU has been one of trying to help people   s  dreams come true. And even though he didn   t know me, my friend  vouched for me and he gave me  500 to come back in 1981 and help  him    write a textbook, proofread a textbook.    He didn   t really need my  help that much, but he knew that this would help us, and with that  500  we set up our household, and both my wife and I landed jobs. I was in  the Dean   s Office of Arts and Sciences, and my wife was and still is  teaching English as a Second Language at the English Language  Institute. So, out of Bob Hamm   s generosity to a virtual stranger, I was  able to get my start here. I   ve always told people that was typical of the  OSU experience, and that   s something that I   ve tried to turn back to  other people.  Bob, can you share a little bit about the genesis and early expectations  in the Scholar Program and about your personal involvement at the  front end of it?  I   ll give you a little history on that leading up to the actual establishment  of the office. After a few years in the Dean   s Office of Arts and  Sciences, I became OSU   s first merit-based scholarship director.  Obviously  OSU  always had a financial aid director, but we   d never  7  had anyone to coordinate the scholarship program for students of ability  without need   some of them. So, in 1988 I was named to that position,  and the job description had several elements to it: coordinating  applications, recruiting National Merit Scholars and various other things  typical of administration of higher education. At the bottom of the list,  really, was to help students of high ability who wanted to apply for  major national and international awards such as the Truman Scholarship,  Rhodes, Marshall, a whole list, Udall, Goldwater. There are many and I  had not paid much attention to that because I thought I was supposed to  think to be doing things that were higher up on the list. (Laughter)  This is one of my favorite stories other than the Bob Hamm story. About  three years into the job, my secretary was waving at me that someone  important was coming through the door, and I looked up to see one of  my boyhood heroes, Henry Bellmon, which got my attention very fast.  (Laughter) In fact, when you think of OSU   s heroes, Henry Bellmon,  Henry Iba, and Henry Bennett, I tell all my students,    I don   t care what  gender of child you have, you need to name them all Henry (Laughter)  because they   re going to be something.    And Henry Bellmon was on the  selection panel for the Truman Scholarship Program, and he was  concerned in Henry   s sober and emphatic way (Laughs) that he hadn   t  seen any OSU students come through as interviewees, and he said he   d  seen a lot of Kansas State and Texas A M people and he knew that we  had students every bit as good as that. Then he held up a copy of my job  description and he said,    They tell me you   re responsible for this.     (Laughter) And I immediately began saying,    Yes, sir,    real fast and he  said,    Well, young man,    (at the time I was still qualified to be called  young man)    maybe you should work a little harder on this.    I said,     Indeed I will.    He laid a   this is a critical moment in OSU history  because he gave me the business card for the new executive director of  the Truman Foundation which was Louis Blair, and he said,    If you get  this man to campus, he can help you attract and mentor students, and  then I think that you   ll get the situation to pick up.    This is Mr. Bellmon  still speaking.  So, a few months later we brought Mr. Blair in and he gave a couple of  seminars to students and faculty. Bryan Begley was our President of  Student Government at the time, and he was there and he applied and he  became our first Truman Scholar in that era. There had been several  before, back in the late    70s, early    80s, but he was the first of a later  generation, and then we had, I think, nine in the next eleven years. As a  result of that I had become a fast friend of Henry Bellmon and a real  admirer of him and I think he of our office. That has all led to a chance  to maybe endow our office with the Henry Bellmon fund, which looking  back will surely be the highlight of my career, that association.  8  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Was Smith Holt dean?  Smith Holt was Dean of Arts and Sciences, and I left his office in 1988  to take that job, yes.  Can you talk a little bit about the conception of the position, a little bit  about when you moved, the mechanics around that?  Yes. Well, first of all, I   m going to put Smith in the category of some of  these other people as instrumental to my career. I learned a lot about  responsibility and effort from Smith Holt, creativity, and one of the best  employers I   ve had here or anywhere else. He was always looking for  ways to promote OSU at a very high level through programs that he  invented. I hope somebody out of his office, maybe Joyce Cox or  somebody, can talk about that someday, but he was always encouraging  me to go beyond what I was doing in arts and sciences. When this job  came open, he thought I should apply because, in addition to the  accounting-type responsibilities, which I have no qualifications for  (Laughs), there were also responsibilities for improving the academic  profile of OSU, and so Jay Boggs was the person who hired me. Cindy  Ross interviewed me. She was in his office.  Jay wanted OSU to have a better system for giving students  scholarships. At that time an incoming freshman had to fill out at least  nine scholarship applications to be considered for all freshman awards.  That was not helping us with our efficiency, and so that was the first  thing that we did, and Jay Boggs was also a critical element in the  development of our office. So, we hired a couple of secretaries, and off  we went leading up to the story of Mr. Bellmon   s entrance into our  office, and following that, we had about four or five years of  continuation doing all the scholarships. At a certain point, we realized  that we had a really outstanding program that might be able to stand on  its own, and it was   let   s see. Who would have been the provost at that  time? Probably Norm Durham, Jack Vitek, and, of course, Jim Halligan  decided that we should split off from the scholarship area, generally,  turn that back over to financial aid, which worked well for efficiency,  and then just promote our office as a specific entity for the recruitment  and mentoring of OSU students.  What year was that, Bob?  That was approximately 1994-   95.  At that time it kind of morphed into more of what it is today?  Correct, and it   s been that way ever since, and it turns out that OSU had  9  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  one of the   we didn   t have the first program, but we had the first real  focused efforts along with Kansas State, University of Arkansas to try to  get in and make a pitch that the land-grant students could compete in  these awards. They   d all been dominated by the Ivy Leagues for many  years, so we were really at the forefront of having an overall plan of  finding students and getting them involved in these scholarship  programs and not just for winning, but for the entire general education  program because of all the students we served.  Were there skeptics, Bob?  I don   t know if I   d say skeptics. It was a matter of informing people  more than anything else. Yes, there were some skeptics as there will be  on any college campus of this type, from people who maybe felt they  were misplaced in their academic career and that OSU was maybe a  little beneath their aspirations. Boy, when you are around our campus, in  spite of what people might think, at the time, most faculty really want to  see OSU perform well, and most of our faculty really admire OSU  students for their efforts and for their genuineness. So, I didn   t really  find anybody who resisted. I didn   t find many people to get involved  right at first, but as the years have gone by, we   ve gotten more  involvement.  I do know that at the beginning our students faced some problems  because around the country OSU did not have a reputation for success in  these, and, in fact, because of some things out of our control, there were  some people who made fun of some of the OSU academic preparations  and for instance our first  serious  Rhodes Scholar  candidate Tom  Knox  suffered from that. He faced a rather hostile Rhodes interview  and always, I think, felt upset over that because he didn   t deserve that  kind of treatment. And then Bryan Begley, the Truman winner, also  applied for the Rhodes, and at the state interview he was actually  interviewed a second time, and he said that the feeling was that they  really couldn   t believe that an OSU student (Laughs) was performing  that well in a Rhodes interview. And they brought him back after  everybody had left to run through his paces again. I really think that he  broke ground for Blaine  Greteman  who came along a few years later  and several others.  There was a lot of conversation around that period, I recall, that Bryan  should have been selected, that he had the qualifications.  He did. No doubt about it. I think if he had come after Blaine, he  probably would have.  Bob, how did you become involved in this program emotionally? Where  10  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  does your passion for this program come from? This kind of job, you  have to feel very strongly about to do.  Well, I will say that while my affair with OSU was rich and complete in  all regards, I mentioned earlier that I didn   t really think that I took  advantage of the academic side of things compared to opportunities I  was given. And, so, the opportunity to return some of that might  eventually balance the scale a little bit. I   m not ashamed to say that. I  have a lot of interest in academics now, and I just feel with this job that  it has been cultivated for the entirety of my life which is a rare  opportunity. I   m just as excited about it now as I ever have been.  Another thing is that while I really wanted to work at OSU, I would have  been willing to do nearly anything for the fact that many people think  the best job in higher education came my way, and I think everybody  finds at least one thing in his or her life that you can do well. For some  reason, I can do this well. I   ve been the president of a national  organization of people who do what I do, and I   ve had opportunities to  go elsewhere and do this, but for some reason I feel absolutely that I   m  in the perfect place doing what I was destined to do somehow, and it   s  been a real exciting opportunity for me.  Who have been some of the faculty and staff that have been instrumental  in helping launch and establish the program?  I have to name one, especially. Dr. Edward Jones of the English  Department has been my right-hand person and confidant. You asked  earlier if there is anyone or if we had any skeptics. I would say the other  end of the spectrum is Edward Jones who encouraged me from the very  beginning that OSU students were every bit as equipped to do this and  we should never take a backseat to anyone else. So, he and I sort of  joined forces, and we have been together virtually for every practice  interview we   ve had in this program since those early years, and he even  started getting me in physical shape by inviting me on runs on Sunday  mornings where he would help planning and talk about students. We  actually did a lot of the preparation out on those jogs. Edward is a well  known international scholar in a very esoteric field, and it   s no accident  that three of his students who got major awards have received graduate  degrees overseas in the United Kingdom. Kelsey Williams is now  getting a PhD at Oxford. Joel Halcomb is a Gates Scholar and is getting  his PhD in History at Cambridge, and Blaine Greteman was also  someone he worked with, and when Edward tells me he   s got a student  in his sights, then I always listen. We   ve had other faculty who have  gone to England, and I   ll talk about our overseas program at some point.   Of course, President Halligan realized the importance of our work and  success and made it possible to establish the office independent from its  11  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  earlier responsibilities. This kind of office was a rare thing nationally at  the time, and our model has been imitated often. In gratitude, one of our  first major financial gifts came in his honor from friend Jim Carreker,  and later the Scholars Hall of Fame was named after him and Ann.  I could name many others, but I have to conclude with Gail Gillilan, our  office secretary and manager who has been as engaged in this effort as  much as anyone, and I consider her an educator of top quality, in  addition to her clerical duties. The students adore her and she is able to  keep very complicated budgets and materials organized in a way that  amazes me and others. She   s the type of person that keeps OSU going  behind the scenes, through thick and thin, and we owe her more than we  can ever repay   from my own gratifying career to the success of  countless students and faculty. She and I have shared this professional  relationship for more than twenty challenging and exciting years, and I  can   t imagine any time in our office, or any greater future success in our  office, without her steady hand at the wheel .  You mentioned, administratively, Jay Boggs and some others, but again  faculty, staff, administrators that have been very supportive of you. Do  you want to share any of those names?  Well, Gail Gates has been my longest serving boss in the Provost office,  and for a while I was turning over a new assistant provost or associate  provost every two or three years. After six or seven years, I wondered  what she was up to because she was still asking questions and seemed  interested. So, I have to give her a lot of credit. Jack Vitek was  instrumental because he, too, thought that OSU had a lot of talent that  wasn   t being utilized, and he also helped us to orchestrate the transition  of the Wentz Program to the Wentz Project Research Program that I  supervise. He was really determined to get that done the right way.  Wentz Projects, can you explain that?  Well, have you talked about the Wentz to anybody yet? Might want to  get Trish Houston in here. I   ll just get off the subject a little bit. She   s a  real historian of Lou Wentz. And the Lou Wentz Program, I   ll just give  you some background. He gave OSU back in the    30s some money, and  then added to it was some oil leases. And for a while, we used that  money as a loan program and then eventually a work study program,  which it was really up through the    70s and    80s and very popular, very  successful. But about the time that Jim Halligan arrived, the Wentz  Board decided that they wanted for the new generation of students that it  needed to have a different structure, and so they encouraged us to start a  research program and a leadership program, and so we   ve had that for  about fifteen years.  12  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  That   s the part I was asking about.  Yes, we   ve given approximately fifty research projects, very valuable  awards, high-dollar awards to our top undergraduates for them to  conduct yearlong research projects in whatever field. Not just science,  but in humanities too, with a faculty mentor. I really think of all the  things that have happened with OSU undergraduates, this conversion is  the one thing that really gave our undergraduates a chance to shine  academically. So, Jim Halligan was involved in that. Trish Houston is  the doggedly determined Lou Wentz administrator who has supported  this program throughout, along with a fascinating board of directors, all  of whom have links to Lou Wentz, the man, through family ties and  business ties. And, so, over the years that   s been a really gratifying  association.  Other faculty members you   d like to mention?  Doren Recker has taught for me in Cambridge at our Cambridge  Program. He is the head of the philosophy department and a history of  science person. Let me give you an example of why I   m struggling to  name certain names with this. In my national organization, I am always  asked about the success of our program and why we   ve had so many  young people win these awards, and I always tell them it   s because of  faculty, and when I tell them the numbers who get involved in any given  year as research mentors, practice interviewers, and so on and so forth,  they can   t believe our good fortune because at most schools, you can  count them on one hand. Well, here, in every department across campus  I   m able to find faculty members who are willing to get involved, and  that   s been a really important key. Gosh, just in the English Department  I could name several: Ed Walkiewicz, Carol Moder,  and in CASNR  there   s Ed Miller, Mike Dicks, and Ron Elliott . In history, Jeff  James   Cooper is constantly recommending students who become great  scholars. He was the person who introduced me, for instance, to Blaine  Greteman and Joel Halcomb because he   d spotted them in a freshman  history class even though they weren   t history majors at the time. So,  that sort of story. I think of Charlie Hendrix in human environmental  sciences who loves the Wentz Program. Karl Reid in engineering   I  can   t go past engineering without a whole handful of faculty members  who love to promote their students for these awards, and Karl has been  just a tremendous advocate for OSU students over the years. Current  Dean of Arts and Sciences, Peter Sherwood, is a graduate of Magdalene  College in Cambridge where we take our students every summer  and  where someone like Doren Recker has taught three times for us . He  always comes over and gives a presentation and a tour of the area. So,  I   m worried that I   m going to leave somebody out like that, but maybe I  13  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  can get back to you.  How has the Scholar Development Program, how has it evolved since its  conception, Bob? What are some new components and different facets of  it since you started it?  I already talked about the Wentz Program, and we get about 120  applications every year for the 50 or 60 awards that we give. And that  wasn   t in place when we started, so at the time all we were supposed to  do was to help students with their essays and interviews to make them  better candidates. But with the Wentz Research and Leadership  Program, then we are able to push our students to a higher level as they  get ready for these national scholarship competitions. Then through the  generosity of Blaine Greteman, our first Rhodes Scholar who went to  Oxford in 1997, I want to say in    97 or    98, he felt so grateful about  what had happened to him at OSU that he wanted to return that in the  UK, so he invited some of our best students over to study literature with  him at Oxford. Out of that, we went there a couple of years. Then we  went to Cambridge where we currently have a regular base of operations  every summer, and that program is another factor in our success and  another important yearlong project that we put together. One year, we  took fifteen students to Cambridge out of that program. Eleven of them  applied for major national and international awards and seven won, an  astonishing rate of success. Nearly half of those students who went over  there won one of the top awards in the country. So, we know that  experience, the Wentz experience, etc., has been critical.  Another thing we did that has been instrumental that wasn   t in place at  the time  was we  had some curricular offerings. I always teach a class  in Honors Literature which is the highlight of my year. The Honors  College   I should have mentioned Bob Spurrier. I knew I was going to  forget somebody. Bob Spurrier has been probably as critical in this area  of university effort as Edward Jones because of the quality of the Honors  College and his interest in seeing what these kids do. So, I want to make  sure to emphasize that. I should have mentioned him earlier, but he gives  me a literature class  and a scholar prep class  in the Honors College to  teach. I connect and network with freshmen as a result of that, and then a  famous OSU celebrity, Geoff Pill, whom you know well.  Yes, pretty good.  Was a UK citizen who taught here over forty years, and he always had a  dream that OSU would have a Rhodes Scholar or Marshall Scholar. He  actually started the first group of students, practice group in the    60s and     70s, who would meet at his house and talk about the news and current  events, practice interviews. And they did that for quite some time, and  14  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  then he developed a course called Windows to the World so they could  formalize that otherwise informal group with a one-hour seminar. And  they read, I believe, the Christian Science Monitor and they discussed  those events, and he put them through their paces. After I had been in  this office for a year, Bob Spurrier, again, recommended that we dust off  that course, and I started teaching it and we started with eight people in  the  basement  of Stout Hall. Blaine Greteman was in it, Chris Stephens,  and a couple of others who won awards. Ever since then that program  has grown, and we now teach sixteen students in two sections every  spring semester.  So, Geoff has left his mark, and, in fact, I thought that you might want  this for your records  shows photograph . This, I consider to be one of  the most gratifying historical moments that OSU can have because this  is Geoff Pill in the middle, and this is our first Marshall Scholar, Chris  Stephens, who is also a Truman Scholar, and this is our first Rhodes  Scholar, Blaine Greteman. At this point, Geoff had retired from OSU  and was living in a nursing home in Keswick, England. Bill Ivy, a  longtime OSU administrator and close friend of mine, recommended  that we take those two young men to Keswick and introduce them to  Geoff, which we were able to put together. I think I can speak for  everyone who was in that room, that to see those two young men with  Geoff Pill was probably one of the most emotionally gratifying  experiences that an educator could have. That was a moving and  exciting time to be able to do that, and I think that it   s an important part  of the OSU historical records. I thought I   d leave that with you if you  want. I don   t know if visuals work or not, but I   ve also got it  electronically if you want.  Can you talk a little bit about the process for identifying students and  recruiting students into the program?  Yes.  You touched on it a little bit earlier, but can you go into a little bit more  detail about it?  Well, at first we just worked on campus, and the way that we did that  was primarily word of mouth. I mentioned Bryan Begley coming for  Louis Blair   s seminar way back. Before long, people heard what our  office was supposed to do and they   d come in and say,    I   m going to  apply for a Goldwater scholarship. Are you supposed to help?    And we  did that. We put together some committees to help us pick these students  who would be able to be our nominees, and because there was an  explosion of these kinds of awards such as the Udall and the Mitchell,  we needed to have committees so that we could send candidates forward  15  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  who were indeed qualified. They just didn   t go off on their own without  any help. Eventually, the faculty got involved and began to refer their  students with our encouragement. At the beginning of every fall  semester, we send out a letter to all faculty saying,    Have you spotted  anybody yet who is well read?    We   re not just looking for students with  good grades, but students who are well read, who like to argue, who sit  at the front, and can write well and seem to want to do more than just  make good grades in your class, but really have the desire to broaden  themselves. In addition, those who are leaders, and those who are not  just single majors, but have dual majors with minors and want to learn  language and travel and that sort of thing. We usually get about 200  referrals every fall semester.  How many will you accept?  We   ll invite all of them to a reception, so they   re all in if they want to be  in. Usually, out of those 200, about a 100 will show up for that first  reception, 80 to 100. Then, we give them a lot more details about travel,  research and the various programs and what they need to do to stay  involved, and then it   s just kind of up to them how much advantage they  want to take of our office. A lot of them are honors students, but not all.  About 80 percent in the scholar development are honors, but not all of  them, and out of those 80 or 100, about 50 will stay involved for a while.  Then by the time that group is a senior, there will be 10 to 15 who are  still plugging along and applying for major awards or doing something  really remarkable.  Sort of self select themselves out, really.  Yes, and what we like to talk about is that it   s not just the winning  scholars that have meant a lot to OSU. When you think that there are at  least 400 or 500 students that come through our office every year to do  research or to travel or to do leadership, we think we have a bigger  impact on the general education program. Even if a student never applies  for a major award, just by upgrading his profile, learning a language,  whatever, then we   ve helped. I know it would not be a healthy thing for  my job if I just had to bank on having a Rhodes Scholar every year.  (Laughs) That   s hard to do, as we know.  But there   s also   now, we   re actually doing some high school recruiting  and that   s been very helpful. Now when families come to my office to  talk about OSU, they talk about research and overseas travel much  earlier than they used to. This has become a recruiting tool, and we   ve  had some students who have turned down awards at Stanford, Duke, the  Ivy Leagues because, first of all, they feel more comfortable staying in-state  and it   s less expensive, but they know that they   re going to have a  16  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  real intense experience in the Honors College and my office. It   s very  suitable because the record shows that they can be prepared. So, that   s  been fun, too.  Well, I want to pick up on your comments a little earlier about finding  success for your program. Could you elaborate a little more on what  your goals and aspirations are for the program beyond getting award-winning  students?  Well, it   s primarily that, and everybody associated with our program  knows that if you give every undergraduate a research experience, a  travel experience, and help them learn to write essays better, this would  be a better place generally. Now we don   t have the resources to do that  for more than the three or four hundred that we have right now. But I  would certainly like to see some aspects of the program broadened, but  we couldn   t have forty or fifty Rhodes candidates every year. That   s not  possible, so my goals are to see that we keep our record intact of turning  out students who win Goldwaters and Marshalls on a regular basis, but,  also, that the whole university benefits through things like the Wentz  Program and the overseas program.  Do you have any plans for expanding the program?  Well, if this endowment works then we could maybe add more sections  of the program overseas, more research opportunities, etc. At any school  there is a critical mass of people who really want to do this, and you  have some that just kind of want to dabble on the fringes of it. But when  you meet one who really has what it takes, it   s almost like an athletic  coach who sees somebody who   s going to be a real strong athlete. You  can tell within seconds that there   s a real active mind, a real competitive  spirit there and somebody who intends to go way beyond what other  students do. If I talk to people like Bob Spurrier or Edward Jones, Jeff  Cooper, they understand that, too, and they send them our way.  Bob, back to the competition for national scholarships and national  recognition, can you talk a little bit about the process, how you prepare  students to be successful, the interview and the application stage?  We have kind of a checklist of things that we like students to go through,  and that first year is just to get established academically. We encourage  them to take on more, especially with language and minor areas. If  they   re in business, we like to see them take a minor in literature or in  philosophy or something like that. If they   re in literature or philosophy,  we love to see them take a minor in physics, mathematics, psychology or  something just to show that they   re not limited and too focused in terms  of their aspirations. A lot of these people are so involved in their public  17  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  schools that they tend to overburden themselves socially. So, we tell  them to start slowly, join a club, join a political organization, but to keep  it small until they know they   re established academically, and then they  can bust out and do a whole bunch of things if they want. But you do see  some people who get so overwhelmed, which is typical of a land-grant  school such as ours, who want to do so much public service that they  don   t get their academic things going. We urge them to apply for  research. We have an incoming research program for freshmen that  gives them an orientation to research, and we urge them to think about  trying to get an article published by the time they   re a junior which  would almost get a guarantee that they   re a good candidate for a Rhodes  or a Goldwater scholarship.  Do you have a class for that or just a     We have a class for freshmen, yes. Right. That   s funded by the  Foundation. The Robberson Trust funds that freshman research program,  which has been really useful. We tell them to start doing something  outside of campus and maybe volunteer for food drives, do something  that shows they   re committed to society in their sophomore and junior  years. Get out of the country, not just to travel, but to go spend time in a  country and survive by living in the country, studying in the language,  whatever it might be. Then, of course, to look at the list of major awards  that are out there and see which ones they feel most suited for and then  start thinking about what sort of profile they would try to project as they  apply, and then we   re here whenever they need help. Then, if they get an  interview for one of these awards, we put together a team of faculty who  give them a really rugged (Laughs) practice interview, so that when they  walk into that important interview, they   re not intimidated by the kinds  of questions that are going to be asked.  Can you expand a little bit, Bob? For example, with the committee you  put together to give them a mock interview for a basic scholarship,  whether it   s Marshall or Truman or Rhodes, would it be different kinds  of questions that you ask?  Yes, it depends on which scholarship it is. We have a whole different set  of interviewers for a Truman, which is more leadership, than we would  for a Rhodes or Marshall, which is going to focus primarily on  academics. So, yes, we have kind of a ready group of people out there  for Gates, Marshall, Rhodes, Mitchell. Some of the programs don   t  require interviews, but for the ones that do, we have experts who really  know how to work these students into a trap. (Laughs)  Then you sit down and then you go over the end results with them and  coach them?  18  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Yes, in fact we had a really entertaining time with Blaine when he went  through his because you may recall that he has spiked hair, and there  was a long discussion about how he should leave his hair for his Rhodes  interview, which was actually more comical than it was serious. But yes,  we video tape these things. We recommend that they hold their hands  above the table and maintain eye contact, and we   re not doing anything  really that much different from what would happen on an athletic field. I  think that   s another thing that attracted me to this is that I   m a pretty  competitive person. I have talked to coaches and I feel a real strong bond  there because we work for a long time for one big performance, and it   s  at the highest level of competition. It   s painful when they don   t get it  and exhilarating when they do.  How important to the Scholar Development Program and OSU was  Blaine Greteman being recognized as OSU   s first Rhodes Scholar?  It was a watershed moment. There were two actually, two watershed  moments, I would say. Jim Halligan, and I would agree, would say that  the designation of OSU as a Truman Honor Institution was what  changed the perception of OSU, locally and nationally, where we knew  that we were among the very top schools in that program and that we  needed to never again shuffle our feet and hesitate about what we can do  here on campus. That was in the year 2000.  Can you tell us a little more about that?  Well, every year the Truman Foundation picks three or four schools that  have achieved at a higher level in leadership and academics, and they  base it on performance in the Truman Scholarship Program, and in 2000,  we were informed that we had been chosen as Oklahoma   s first Truman  Honors School. We had a big banquet and the Foundation came down  and presented us with a plaque. We had all of the Truman Scholars who  had ever been picked  from  OSU there, and a couple of them got to  speak, and it was a real, as I say, exhilarating feeling to know that we  were really up there.  But Blaine   s was different because the Rhodes was such a prestigious  award, and the fact that we had never had one, of course, because the  Rhodes is usually associated with humanities, liberal arts, kind of like  Phi Beta Kappa, the honor society. It was perceived as kind of being the  province of the Ivy League, and we had had dismal experiences with the  Rhodes. It just seemed like we could never get beyond the state level.  Blaine laid it all on the line and really had a charmed interview, I should  say. Everything worked out just beautifully, and it   s one of those things  that if you just hit it right, sometimes magical things can happen and it  19  Gill  Graalman  Gill  did. One thing that people don   t remember is that his wife, Mandi  Bozarth, was the candidate the next year and she probably deserved it  every bit as much as he did. But I think that the Rhodes people probably  were a little suspicious of that. Blaine was the first scholar ever to be  married and be a Rhodes Scholar. That was the first year that they  allowed married scholars. He became such a celebrity that the Chronicle  of Higher Education did a cover story on him because at the same time  that he won that, we had been instrumental in starting a national  organization of advisors who work in this area. Harvard had not won a  Rhodes Scholar or had not had a Rhodes Scholar that year. Meanwhile,  Kansas State, OSU, Arkansas and I believe several other Midwestern  state schools had, so the Chronicle wanted to know,    What   s going on  here?        What are they growing out there?     Yes. So, they took a picture of Blaine and interviewed him and  interviewed me and several others, and that was an exciting time too.  There was another incident I would say I have to add. I   m going to get  way off track here and start talking about my students, which would take  us another couple of hours, but probably the most exceptional thing that  happened, which because it wasn   t nationally as recognized as the other  two    It occurred when Ashleigh Hildebrand, who was already a  Goldwater Scholar, and Joel Halcomb both won Gates-Cambridge  Scholarships in the same year, and they only gave thirty-four. The Gates  was a new kind of Rhodes-like scholarship, but associated with  Cambridge instead of Oxford, and the list of multiple Gates winners that  year   I love telling this story. The list of multiple Gates winners read:  Harvard, I think, four; Yale, four; Princeton, three; Brown, two;  Stanford, two; Oklahoma State University, two; and that was it. And that  was a moment of great satisfaction. I   m not sure about the numbers from  the other schools. I apologize if any of them object to that. It might be a  different list, but that was the gist of it. OSU had a most remarkable  program  to have  two winners at the same time. Blaine, the Truman,  and that were critical. Now Blaine also, of course, contributed later with  his experience and in Oxford and leading to our Cambridge, and then he  came back and taught this past year on our faculty, and I think that his  OSU connections and his gratitude towards OSU are also part of the  OSU experience that I   ve enjoyed.  I   m just going to add onto our conversation a little bit about the  highlights and the achievements of the program, scholar recognition and  a number of awards, and some of those. Off the top of your head, can  you share some of the successes we   ve had in the program?  20  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Well, we   ve had over fifty winners of this level of award in the last  fifteen years. What was really neat for me and all of us was that our  alums got very excited about this, and one person who needs to be  mentioned who probably more than any other alum became involved     I   m going to name several here, now that I   ve started thinking. Jim  Whiteneck and Carol Whiteneck are alums in the Tulsa area. He   s a  surgeon, and Carol is not a graduate of OSU but she loves OSU, and  their daughter graduated from here. Jim was excited by what we were  doing and made me an offer once that if he could ever help with  anything that he would be happy to do that. Once we started racking up  these awards, we wanted to recognize them, and he offered to build what  we know as the Scholar Wall, the Halligan Wall of Scholars in the  Student Union at significant expense. That wall is nearly filled now, but  when he built it we only had about half of them, and his encouragement  and his excitement, I think, is reflective of what alums around the  country have felt for the program. We had a person who stepped forward  who was my college roommate at one time, Jim Carreker, who got  excited about the scholar development program and has made gifts that  has allowed us to continue our overseas study program and has been a  very influential supporter of the program in many ways.  You   ve had over fifty major award recognitions.  And hundreds of candidates in the last fifteen years.  Fifteen years?  Yes. I think that the one story that is the most meaningful to me from a  personal and an OSU sense has to do with a scholar who didn   t seem to  be able to lose: Bryan McLaughlin who was a Goldwater winner, a  Marshall winner, USA Today All-American, and NSF Fellow. Four. The  dollar value of his awards, incalculable sometimes. He had a particular  gift for interviewing that was as good as any that I   ve seen. You could  not stump him. He could not fail in an interview and his results were  astonishing. He graduated with his PhD from Cambridge and is now  working in the Boston area.  During that same time, we had a person who was every bit as qualified  named Bart Fischer who was a triple major,  had  a perfect GPA, just as  genuine and hardworking as anyone you would ever want to meet, and  he also wanted to succeed, and he was a finalist in the Truman  competition, the Marshall competition, and the Goldwater competition.  Well, Bart was quite the opposite. For all of his wonderful qualities, he  could not interview. He could not interview. I don   t know if it was stage  fright or what, but he could hardly get past the most basic parts of the  interview, and it was heartbreaking because we knew he had every bit as  21  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  much to offer as Bryan, and some of their activities were occurring at  about the same time. So, we   d be in one room celebrating with Bryan  and in another room comforting Bart who was just so frustrated. His  practice interviews were always really quite good, but for whatever  reason     So, this story got around to some administrators and some alums, and  one of them approached me. He   s always wanted to remain anonymous.  One of them approached me and said,    If you can get some support on  campus, I   ll write a check to send Bart to Cambridge.    His dream.  (Laughter) So, we were able to find local support because the  departments that Bart had worked in were more than happy     agriculture, business, my office, etc., and this man wrote a scholarship.  So, Bart went to Cambridge and I   ve got a prize picture of both him and  Bryan in their graduation regalia at Cambridge holding up the OSU sign  as honors graduates of Cambridge. Now, I just have to say that giving  back to OSU, Bart told me that,    Someday I   m going to give a lot of  money to OSU and whatever else I can do.    But isn   t that the epitome of  the OSU experience?  Great story.  Yes. I love that story.  Bob, you were talking about Bryan McLaughlin   s story which is a  wonderful story. Can you share some success stories about some other  students that have participated and have gone on later in their life?  Yes, and we do notice that winning one of these awards is not  necessarily a guarantee that the students are going to continue to have  unlimited success later on because we have just as many students who  go on who haven   t won the awards but who   ve come through our  program and do wonderful things as well, but there are some that  deserve to be mentioned. The first Truman Scholar, Bryan Begley, has  had a fascinating life. He was asked to be the chairman or CEO of  Phillips Petroleum   s kind of right hand person, trainee I guess you could  call him, for several months and then sent to Norway and England where  he was a Phillips official. Then he went off to Harvard to get his  business degree. He was recruited by McKinsey Consulting Group  which is the biggest consulting firm in the country and spent several  years becoming a partner of McKinsey. He just recently left that to  become a manager of a big foundation in New York City, and he  commutes from Dallas to New York every week for four days, and he is  also now back involved at OSU on some sort of foundation board and is  helping us raise funds for the Bellmon Endowment and that sort of thing.  22  I think of Blaine Greteman, of course, who not only has worked at OSU,  but he was a correspondent for Time magazine in England after he  finished his Rhodes Scholarship and is now going to be teaching at the  Iowa Writer   s Conference, which is the most prestigious writing school  in the world probably.  Kyle Jones is the son of famous OSU graduates, as you know. He was a  strong Truman candidate. In fact, his not receiving the Truman was one  of the biggest surprises of my life. I thought he was the ultimate kind of  Truman Scholar, but he did receive a Pickering Scholarship which gave  him all of his educational expenses and guaranteed employment with the  Foreign Service after a degree at Harvard, which they paid for.  Cassie Mitchell is a great OSU story. She came to OSU as an athlete, but  contracted a rare infection that caused her to become paralyzed. She  switched to chemical engineering and became a Goldwater Scholar and  a USA Today All-American and is just finishing her PhD at Georgia  Tech where she is working on batteries for spinal cord use because she  has to undergo surgery every four months, a very painful surgery to have  new batteries replaced, and she is trying to invent a battery that will last  at least a year, which is how I understand her work. I know that she is  very involved in that. She was a great story, both during her stay and  after.  Ashleigh Hildebrand has just graduated from MIT with her PhD, and she  has just been hired by Conoco Petroleum and has actually sent her work  to the federal government on Carbon Sequestration with is a big topic  now for the environment. She is destined to become one of OSU   s all-time  great graduates.  We   ve had students who have won national awards in aeronautics who  have won Goldwaters this past year. We had a young man who set a  world record for pilotless aircraft remaining aloft within limited space or  something like that. It would be easier, probably, for me to comment on  what these students have done afterwards in ten or fifteen years because  right now a lot of them are just getting out of graduate school and  getting started. But I think the easiest way to describe it is to say that  they have really taken the world   s best graduate schools by storm.  Chris Stephens is a story that needs to be told. He was our first multiple  winner  and was  from Chickasha. His parents were historical Vo-Ag  teachers. I believe his mother was the first ever female graduate of Ag  Communication or something like that. Chris was a very humble, quiet-spoken  person who told me that he wanted to be a Truman Scholar,  which he did in fine form, and then he became a Marshall Scholar. With  his Marshall Scholarship, he was able to get two degrees in the United  23  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Kingdom. He got a master   s at Oxford and a master   s at Cambridge.  Deciding that he was on a roll, he then applied for law school at Yale,  and out of 5,000 applicants, he was one of 200 who were accepted. Then  he eventually served on the Yale Law Review, graduated brilliantly and  is now an assistant US attorney based in Oklahoma City after having  been in private practice for a few years. So, that   s the kind of story you  hear again and again from these young people who really set their sights  high.  Bob, it just occurred to me. You were you talking about Gates, Udall,  Rhodes, Truman. How many a year, total, are offered?  There are thirty-two Rhodes Scholarships every year, approximately  thirty-five Gates and Marshalls. There are 300 Goldwaters which is   the  Goldwater is the most prestigious science award in the country. There  are approximately seventy Udalls which is a new and very popular  program that several OSU students have won. Truman gives about  seventy. They give about one per state and then twenty at-large  scholarships. We have this past year just said goodbye to a person who  is eventually going to make her mark. That   s Cortney Timmons, who is  a legendary OSU student for having won both Udall and a Truman  Scholarship, but she started the nationally-known tailgate recycling  program that has given OSU a lot of credibility. She has a group of  students, or had a group of students, that went around to football games  and helped to clean up the messes that the alums sometimes caused   with  their tailgate parties and collected tons and tons of refuse and  became OSU   s Recycler of the Year as a result of that and then went on  to parlay that into some international awards.  So, you felt like the scholarship programs, whether some of the students  received those awards or not, impact and influence their lives. Do you  have some personal stories about, perhaps, some students that didn   t  win the prestigious awards?  Well, certainly Bart is the best example of that, the person who was able  to go to Cambridge. Let   s see. Which story would I like to tell? We try  to stay in touch with students who don   t win the awards, even if they  apply later. Matt Morgan who applied for all those awards and didn   t  receive an award but went to Cambridge with our program did research,  and even now he is known for his success as a public servant and is  going to law school at the University of Michigan, I believe it is. I may  be mistaken about that. And is constantly asking how he can contribute  back to the program.  Josh Ward also went to Cambridge, received a  PhD and now is a post-doc at Harvard .  Do you have sort of a mini alumni group that     24  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  That   s something that we need to do a better job of. I   m working on that  because I think that this group is going to be the new breed of OSU  donors somewhere down the line, entrepreneurs. OSU has had a certain  kind of donor quality over the years, as you know, because of the land-grant  image that we have, and I think that these students, not just the  ones in this program, but the ones who won President   s Distinguished  Scholarships, Valedictorian Scholarships and all of those things, that  have been a part of OSU   s recent history will someday really come to  the fore and start making generous donations. I don   t know if I   ll be able  to see that or not (Laughs) because some of them still have some time  before they get into leadership positions, etc., but, boy, they   re going to  be a powerhouse group.  Like the old saying,    You plant the trees so somebody else can enjoy the  shade.     That   s right. That   s right.  Well, Bob, you bring up an interesting question. What kind of interaction  is there between the academic program   you mentioned the PDS  Scholarship Program we   ve got with Bob Spurrier.  PLC, yes.  And the President   s Leadership Council. What kind of interaction  coordination is there with those kinds of groups and offices and  services?  You mean with the Scholar Development Program or just generally?  How do you interact with those others?  Well, I give speeches to all those groups all the time, and my  involvement in the Honors College is intense and gratifying. I   m always  over there working with students, and now that their new building is  going to go up, we   re going to try and maintain our visibility with the  Honors College. I speak to the PLC class, the incoming PLC class, every  year and a lot of our scholars have come out of that program. I give  speeches to a lot of orientation classes in every college every fall and  encourage students to set their sights high.  Camp Cowboy?  Camp Cowboy. I   ve done that a little bit. Not as much as some of the  others because a lot of our Camp Cowboy participants are kind of new to  25  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  the state and they probably aren   t quite ready to focus yet for that  experience on the kinds of messages we have. But Alpha  Week , we do  a lot of work at Alpha. As I say, the nicest thing now is as I   m walking  across campus, people like Kent Sampson or Steve Hasley or Karl Reid  will say,    I just met this person and you really need to talk to them.     And I say,    Send me an e-mail and we   ll contact them.     Where I was going with that, is there a lot of interaction between  yourself and other academic units on campus?  From what I can tell, nationally, the excitement and enthusiasm for our  program has remained longer than a lot of the campuses where, after  they have their first rush of excitement, it kind of dies out. I think that  there   s every bit as much excitement now when one of our students wins  a Goldwater or a Marshall or something as there was fifteen years ago  when it first happened. Again I attribute that to the quality of the faculty  and the atmosphere here that is both competitive but also humble, and  the fact that OSU is getting recognition on a national level, I think, still  gives people a real charge.  Could you talk about how the synergy between students and the  university and the alumni   how has the Scholar Development Program  collectively influenced the university? How has it influenced the  students? How has it influenced the alumni?  Well, in several ways. I think that more OSU students have been going  to really high quality graduate schools. Personally, I know that when  OSU shows up at Magdalene College in Cambridge, the faculty and staff  around there say,    We   re really glad you   re back. We   re happy that  you   re here.    And we have receptions there where a lot of the local  Cambridge crowd comes because they   ve heard so much about OSU  students. So, what we   ve known all along for as long as OSU has existed  is now clear on an international level. It   s not because of me; it   s  because of our students and their genuine honesty, integrity and work  ethic that they bring to whatever task there is.  I think that our involvement with the development of the NAFA   National Association of Fellowships Advisors  national organization  has been crucial because, for instance, this week I   m speaking at the  national convention on the history of this whole advising component of  scholar development. So, there   ll be around 350 advisors from all other  schools representing over 200 colleges and universities, and I   m the only  university speaker during the banquet for that conference. So, again,  that   s not just for me. That   s because OSU has invested in this program,  and everyone now, locally as well as internationally, understands that it  has a real impact. One story that I didn   t tell that I planned to was that  26  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  when I gave my first speech as Scholarships Director twenty-some years  ago, I used the word    elite    in that speech, and I was actually told that  that   s kind of an awkward word for OSU to use in a public context  because it has connotations of arrogance and over confidence  Because we   re a land grant.  Land grant. We   re all about equality and being open and opportunistic  and so on and so forth, and I was kind of taken aback by that. (Laughs) I  felt horrible because it was one of the first speeches that I gave at my  new job. I was probably lucky to keep my job, but I did say,    I assume  we want to have an elite football program.    (Laughter) So, I don   t know  what got into me because I   m not usually that kind of a person, but I  was. And now other people refer to this as an elite opportunity. Well,  that word is not as bad as it sounds in this context. I think that that   s  something that doesn   t change anything about OSU. It just adds another  component to it because in my experience we certainly haven   t given up  on everything else that makes OSU the way it is, but we now have  something new, too.  We   ve talked a lot about where the program has been and kind of where  it is now. How do you see it evolving?  Well, we have to be real careful about growth, because if it just becomes  another come one, come all program then you don   t have the resources  to give everyone the attention that we currently give them, and you can  get into real trouble. There   s another aspect that concerns me because  around the country, when   well, first of all, Scholarship Development is  so new that it is not a recognized and routine feature of university  budgets. As long as there   s a tradition of success, the universities tend to  support it. But once there   s some lapse or the individuals leave who have  been involved, who understand how it works, then there has been some  indication around the country that those programs will disappear, and  that   s one reason I   m excited the Henry Bellmon Endowment is there to  forestall that or to make sure that doesn   t happen. If we can cause the  endowment to take place, then everything that we   re currently doing  now will remain, no matter what happens to the state budget. So, you  have to be careful about continuity, and at some point I suppose my  secretary and I will want to go do something else. Not yet, but at some  point, and I want to definitely be in a position where everything that  we   ve done through Wentz and through the Cambridge program and all  the mentoring that we do remains in place, and I   ve got some ideas on  how we can make that happen.  A transition plan?  27  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Yes.  Do you see anything being added or renewed as it evolves and changes?  Anything to do a little differently?  No, not really. Not really. I mean, when you think of the things that  these students do, going overseas, doing research, taking high level  classes, that   s all a winning combination. I suppose that one thing that I  would like to see us do better, which we actually really focused on this  year, was recruit these students again. I mean, it now is a national game  that starts in high school. If you let a year or two go by, it takes a long  time to recover, so I   m trying to be more aware of the recruiting  significance and think that a lot of good things are happening at OSU  that are going to allow us to do that.  Bob, would it be fair   perhaps, usually, now with basketball and  football recruiting, you actually go out and start looking at kids maybe  their junior year in high school, following them?  There   s no doubt that we   re doing that. Yes, we   re actually doing that  through our admissions office, and we   ve been really lucky that at some  campuses the amount of support for these programs sometimes lags a  little bit. But moving from Jim Halligan to David Schmidly, now to  Burns  Hargis , there has never been anyone who didn   t understand the  value of the program and give us full support. Right now with Burns  here, who has a history of OSU, in a certain way reflects my own. We  were here at about the same time. It   s a great time to just continue to  build on what we   ve done, and I see a lot of that happening with every  passing month.  Do you see summer camps, maybe, like sports do?  (Laughter) Well, we do that in England. That   s exactly what we do in  England, so we do have that already. We take our best kids to England  and give them a high-level course, a very intense course, and experience  with that culture and try to make them think about applying for a Rhodes  or a Marshall as something they can do.  Do you think that high school kids come through?  I did that in    81 and    82 for the Dean of Arts and Sciences. I don   t think  I   m going to do that again. (Laughter) Camp counselor   no thanks.  Are there some keys in your mind (you   ve touched on some of those, and  this may be a little bit of a repetitious question, but) to continue success  in the program? You   ve talked about continuity. I guess, keep in faculty  28  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  that are really passionate about it and involved. Are there other keys to  continue the excellence?  Yes, you   re exactly right about all of that, the research, going overseas.  Gerry Auel does a great job with our study abroad program generally,  and we tap into that. I think one thing that we have to be very careful of  is that we have to make sure that this program is not perceived as any  particular college   s domain and that we understand that the key to  motivating students is an interdisciplinary appeal. One of the things that  I feel most fortunate about is that I   m able to interact with faculty in  agriculture, engineering, education, business, arts and sciences, human  environmental sciences. I love talking to faculty about their research and  getting them to nominate students for this program. I think that all these  faculty understand that we   re going at this in an interdisciplinary way.  That is something that I hope OSU is always able to do because when  you look at the number of students who have come out of engineering  and agriculture   we had four straight Truman Scholars out of  agriculture economics, and Louis Blair, the person I mentioned earlier,  contacted me and said he wanted to visit agriculture to see what we were  giving our students, which was satisfying to me because early in my  career I was sent to Kansas State which was already having success with  the same instructions, and I was actually able to train with the person up  there who was making it happen for Kansas State. So, the fact that the  Truman Foundation was like,    Well, let   s go see what OSU is doing,     (Laughs) made me feel that we   d arrived.  Full circle.  Yes. (Laughter)  Bob, what   s given you the most personal, professional satisfaction from  your participation in the Scholar Development Recognition program?  Well, I mean, every student has been different, and they   ve all given me  something to learn by my interaction with them. Of all the students that  I   ve worked with, all the successful ones and the ones who weren   t  successful, I can relate some particular aspect of that person   s character  and qualifications that really meant a lot. None of them seem at all the  same to me. I   ve got friendships now with students that are going to last  me for a long time. Just to go back to the beginnings of my interview  here, I really think that what Edward Jones and all the other people I   ve  mentioned have been able to contribute to OSU is something that I  couldn   t have even imagined when I was a student here and maybe  makes up for a little lost time and puts OSU in a position to really thrive  in the future. I mean, all those things mean a lot to me. I never really  wanted to live anywhere else but Stillwater, Oklahoma. I can   t explain  29  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  that, (Laughter) but I did. So, that   s kind of the situation and friendships  with faculty. Being able to raise my family in Stillwater has just been an  amazing ride.  Looking back, what would you have done differently in the program?  Can you think of anything and say,    Well if we could have changed  something       Were there things you would have changed?  Hmm. That   s really good. Boy, we had so many fortuitous things happen  that I couldn   t have even envisioned like the Wentz Program being  turned over to us. People seemed to show up at the right time when they  were really needed to plan a class or to give a talk or to find a student. I  think that the opportunity to get involved at the national level was,  again, something I didn   t even think about, but it really worked to  OSU   s advantage and promoted our name even more so.  I guess I wish that I had been more technically proficient. There are a lot  of my colleagues around the country who do a better job because they   re  so capable with computers, with their computers, to keep up with their  students and to manage their students and stay in touch with their  students. I   ve always been good at the personal touch, personal  involvement.    Come in my office and let   s talk about this.    I wish I  could have added that too, but it was just beyond me. (Laughs)  But I think, to go back to another question, to take the next step, a future  director will have to be a lot more proficient with technology than I have  been because all of the applications now are online.  Looking back, what would you have done the same? What are things you  say,    This was important   ?  Talk to the students. Be with them at every opportunity. Encourage  them. Give them things they need to be reading. Refer them to faculty.  We have a revolving open door in our office and I   ve never had a  student come through the door that I won   t go out and meet if I   m not  doing something out of the office. But these are high-stress things that  we ask students to do, and they need to know that someone   s in their  camp who really thinks a lot of their abilities and what they   re going  through. That is something that even if I had been more technically  proficient, I hope I wouldn   t have given up. And it   s also very satisfying.  I   m assuming we   re about finished, for this session anyway. This is kind  of a humorous observation by a college roommate who said,    Bob, you  know this is rather irritating. You spent five years at OSU,    (actually  more than that for graduate school)    sitting in the Student Union, talking  to interesting people and probably wasting a lot of your parents    good  30  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  money. Now, for your career, you   re sitting in the Student Union,  talking to interesting people and wasting the tax payers    money      (Laughter) That was Dennis McNeill, my college roommate, and he   s a  great person. I have a lot of fun and I   ve always gotten a kick out of that  story because there   s an element of truth to that. That   s what I do. I get  to talk to great people in the Student Union. That   s my life.  Bob, how do you hope people remember you in your role in establishing  the Scholars Office, and how do you hope people remember Bob  Graalman?  Well, I hope that I   ll be remembered as a good teacher because that   s the  part about my job that still gives me the most pleasure. But also that I  was a friend, not just to students who won these awards, but that I really  had a connection with a lot of OSU undergraduates over the years and  that somehow what we did helped bring together OSU. When we met  Blaine Greteman after his Rhodes win, we took people from all over the  campus to the airport, and it was really neat to see people from all over  the campus who just were proud of what he had done. So, yes, and the  alums, I think that they have begun to see that their degree really means  something on the national, international level too. So, again, that   s not  what I hope for me, that   s what I hope for my office. And for me, it   s  just been a special treat to be involved.  Sort of a wrap question that we   ve talked about in a lot of ways, but  maybe one more time. Why is supporting this program so important to  Oklahoma State University?  Well, I think OSU always had a great reputation as kind of a fun,  friendly place to be, but a lot of studies show that our reputation  academically never really reached what we knew was going on here. So,  to the extent that we were able to put ourselves out in the forefront as an  academic school is important. I think that all land grants struggle with  that a little bit, but OSU has perhaps more than any. We need to get a  Phi Beta Kappa chapter. We deserve a Phi Beta Kappa chapter. We  don   t have one yet, but we   re going to get one. And it   s all reputation in  some of those things. So, we   ve had really great students doing  wonderful things, and slowly, I think, OSU has seen its image improve  as a result. The Honors College is another way.  Kind of, in your words, the program as much as anything else has  helped recognize what was already there. We   ve had  graduates   become CEOs of major Fortune 500 companies.  I   ve had panelists on these major national awards that say,    We get  students from these very prestigious schools who come in and they   re  31  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  Graalman  Gill  kind of all the same. They   re real confident and smooth, etc., but there   s  something different when a solid student from Stillwater, Oklahoma,  who is a double major with a foreign language, and has this wonderful  work ethic who grew up on a farm, comes in. Like Cortney Timmons,  for instance, comes in and just blows us away with her enthusiasm and  her leadership and her knowledge.    So, I think we have a secret weapon  in all those years that we hadn   t been using which is the quality of our  student population, and they   ve proven a lot of us right.  Bob, what else have we not covered? Are there some things you would  like to discuss that we haven   t touched on?  I   m sure I   ll think of a million things when I leave, but those are a good  set of questions that you had, and it really allowed me to both think  freely, but at the same time focus on some things. My only fear is that  there   s so many students that I should have acknowledged. (Laughter)  Somebody will see this someday and say,    Why didn   t you mention me?  (Laughter) I thought we were friends      Maybe we can come back and do this a second time, okay?  Yes.  Bob, I appreciate it. Thank you.  Well, there is one thing you and I were involved in, and that was the top  graduating seniors, and I think to show that OSU is always for  improvement. As you recall, Blaine Greteman was not chosen as top  senior, and you and I were really in a fix on that. I   m happy to say that  thanks to your leadership and the people like Anne Scott and Larry Shell  that we fixed that and that will never happen again. Now, this last year,  out of the fourteen students who were named Top Graduating Seniors,  eleven of them were Honors and Scholar Development connections. But  we also have athletes and non-traditional students with children,  international students, and, again, I think it is the story of OSU that  working together we can put something in place that really makes a  difference in the life of the institution.  And now the Seniors of Significance Award too.  Exactly. A bigger number off the bat, and more variety in the Top  Graduating Seniors. That   s another gratifying experience that we   ve all  been a part of.  You   re very much engaged, and, Bob, we appreciate that.  32  Graalman It   s fun.  -------  -------
