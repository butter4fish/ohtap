 Gill. Today is February 20, 2010 and I   m visiting with  Arthur    Art    Adams III in Bob Adams   s home here in Dallas, Texas.  This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Art, I appreciate you taking time to come by  and visit with us.  Thank you, Jerry.  Like I said earlier, we appreciate the coconut cream pie too. (Laughs ) It  was good.  Thank you for your interest.  Now, kind of setting the stage again as we had in previous interviews,  you   re a descendant and namesake of Arthur Wesley Adams, who was in  the first graduating class  of Oklahoma A   M College .  The first graduate, and as I understand, valedictorian.  Magruder Medal winner and along with his brother, James Homer, was  a member of that first graduating class in 1896 of then Oklahoma A M,  now Oklahoma State University. So the Adams family is also important  to the founding and the history of, really, the state of Oklahoma in that  your great-grandfather, William H. H. Adams, made the Run along with  your grandfather,  Arthur Wesley Adams,  in 1889, which is interesting,  both    89ers. Then William H. H. Adams also surveyed and laid out the  plot for the original city of Stillwater. So a lot of Stillwater, Oklahoma  State University, Oklahoma ties there.  I thought we might back up, first of all, and ask about your life, about  where you grew up, a little bit about your family, some of your early  memories.  5  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Well, my dad was Arthur Wesley Adams, Junior, and of course I   m the  third. I was born in 1939, the year my grandfather died, the original  Arthur  Wesley Adams , the Oklahoma A M Arthur. My dad graduated  also from Oklahoma A M.  What year did he graduate, do you remember?  It would be around 1929. In the twenties, I can remember my dad talking  about the    roaring twenties    when he was in college. Did he refer to  Oklahoma A M as the Princeton of the Southwest?  Princeton of the Plains? (Laughter)  Princeton of the Plains, that   s it. Yeah, so he had memories of going to  Oklahoma A M during the twenties and I guess a lot of people were  having some bad times during that time. I guess he worked a little bit. I  think he worked in a cafeteria   this is my dad   during those times and  got through somehow or other. So my dad went into business with my  grandfather in the oil business. My first recollection is in Fort Stockton,  Texas, a small town out in the middle of the oil patch. They were in  business together   in the oil business. My only picture I remember of  me and my grandfather was I must have been about six months old and  he was holding me and he had a coat and tie. He died probably when I  was six to nine months old. So I grew up out in West Texas.  We moved to Midland, Texas which is also in the middle of Permian  Basin, one of the largest oil fields in the world at that time. That   s where  I went to high school and I was a baseball player. I wanted to be a major  leaguer and so when I got out of high school, when you lived in Texas,  you went to University of Texas. I am a black sheep. I went to the  University of Texas and there were just a couple of us, my cousin Art  Roberts. I know we   re going to get into this, Jerry, but we didn   t hear  much about Oklahoma A M at that time. My dad talked to me about  being in a fraternity, he was a Beta Theta Pi. He talked about Hank Iba,  the basketball teams and he mentioned that they had some great baseball  teams, but he didn   t push me to go to Oklahoma A M, so I ended up at  the University of Texas. I didn   t know much about the heritage.  You played for the Longhorns baseball team. You got into the College  World Series a couple of times?  Yes, where Oklahoma State probably beat us. (Laughter)  So you played in    57   ?     57 through    61. I graduated Midland High School in    57.  6  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams   Were you an  all-state baseball player?  All-state, I don   t think so. We didn   t have all-state at that time in  baseball.  You were the starting shortstop?  Yeah.  Got a lot of balls hit your way.  Yeah, and I made a lot of errors, yeah. (Laughter)  Let me back up and ask you, because I want to talk about your career  and life after but back up to your questions about your dad. You told me  about some of his experiences, but going back to your grandfather, to  his father, do you remember any memories he shared with you about his  father and his experience at Oklahoma State?  Not about his father   s experience at Oklahoma State, no, except that he  was the first graduate.  So you knew that as a kid growing up?  Yes, I did, but it didn   t really dawn on me as being important at the time.  I had my life and I was doing all my stuff and it just wasn   t a big thing. I  didn   t understand it at the time, what heritage we had. He talked about  his dad after college, because they were in business together. You know,  the things he would say about Arthur   my dad was called Wesley   he  would talk about his being the kindest, most gentle person, very  intelligent.  He  would take people off the street and feed them, take  care of them. So that   s what I thought of my grandfather; a great guy just  willing to help people.  He talked to you about being a real entrepreneurial businessperson  and     Yes, because he was successful, had been successful, so I just assumed  that. At the age I was, I just wasn   t into it.  Coming up in our previous interview, the conversation about your  grandfather again, he really did very, very well in real estate and  banking and then in the gas and oil, energy then later probably lost most  of that in the     In the twenties     7  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams        29 crash. So he had to sort of rebuild his life and then he moved out  of Fort Stockton and then became pretty successful again     As I understand it, they were very successful. But I don   t know a lot  about it, Jerry.  Are there any stories about your grandmother that you remember? Did  you know her?  I knew Olive, Arthur   s wife, not as well as my cousin Arthur but she  would come live with us a few months each year. She was a very strong  Methodist lady. Never saw her with her hair down except sometimes if  you   d sneak in at night she was letting her hair down. But she never  played cards, probably never said a cuss word except once to Art  Roberts     And he probably deserved it right?  And he deserved it very much. So you know, just a straight-laced  Methodist lady, high, high morals and ethics. Those were the things that  I really learned from Aunt Olive,    Nanny    as we called her, was her  ethics and morals. And I think that went to Arthur, too   I think that  spoke to Arthur because everybody you ever talk to about my  grandfather said the same thing.  Did your grandmother Olive ever talk about Arthur   s OSU experience?  She probably did and I don   t remember it, because it just wasn   t  important to me at the time at the age I was. I   m sure she did, but I can   t  remember anything.  So now your grandfather and his brother, James Homer, were actually  in business together in Ardmore.  I think they were in the newspaper business. I think they had three or  four businesses together, if I remember right.  I think James Homer maybe was superintendant of schools there in  Ardmore or something like that.  I   m not sure. Yes, I think.  Did you grandfather even work in the banking business in Hugo for  awhile?  I don   t know.  8  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Did he go from Ardmore to Hugo before he went to Fort Worth?  I don   t know. I don   t know. I haven   t read my update lately. (Laughs)  When did you first start learning about the background of your  grandfather at Oklahoma State?  Probably after college. We just didn   t pay much attention to it as my  cousin alluded to. It just wasn   t talked about. We were Texans. Until our  other cousin Bob Adams and Pat got everybody together, it just wasn   t  an issue. We didn   t understand it, it wasn   t important. A lot of the things  that were probably told to me, I just forgot. It   s been such a great thing  that Bob and his family have put all this together. Now we   ve learned a  lot more about our heritage and Oklahoma State   Oklahoma A M.  Is that when you first started learning about William Henry Harrison,  your great-grandfather?  Exactly, I had no idea who William Henry Harrison was until we started  doing all these family reunions.  Let   s go back and pick up your career a little bit, Art. When you left the  University of Texas, can you share a little bit about your career?  Yeah, it   s real easy, Jerry. I went to work for Exxon right out of college  and spent a couple of years with Exxon and then I went to work in the  chemical industry. My degree was in the engineering route to business at  Texas so I had some engineering background. I got in the chemical  industry with Exxon. Then I was out of school about five years, another  guy and I formed a chemical company and that lasted for twenty-five or  thirty years. Thank goodness we were successful. Then, we sold it to a  German company and then I retired when I was, gosh, fifty-two, or  actually fifty. Kind of retired to the Hill Country in about 1987,    88 and  then I picked up into the real estate business at that time, started doing  some real estate stuff. That   s about it. We had a very successful  chemical company and that was fun. I   ve had a good time.  What was the name of the company, Art?  Well it   s gone through several names now but at that time it was Delta  Solvents and Chemicals Company. We had about eleven branches and  actually we had a branch in Oklahoma City. So we did have some  Oklahoma ties there.  So do you still do a little bit of real estate business?  9  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Yes, I am still involved in real estate where I live. I live in the Hill  Country of Texas.  Whereabouts?  Close to Austin, on Lake Travis.  Lake Travis   beautiful country, isn   t it?  It sure is.  Tell me a little bit about your father. What do you remember about him?  My dad was what we called a bean counter. He was a CPA. I started  kind of understanding what was going on when I was in elementary,  junior high. We moved to Midland,  Texas  and he went to work for a  company in Midland as an accountant. I grew up in Midland and did my  thing. Every now and then I   d hear a little bit about Oklahoma A M,  but not a lot.  You kind of already talked about some of his experiences   he was there  in the     In the twenties, so I guess it was before Arthur had lost all of his money  in    29. I guess things were really rolling and rocking in the twenties. Dad  told some pretty good stories about some of his Beta Theta Pi parties.  Partying over at the Betas is probably true. (Laughter)  He had a good time and he graduated out of the business school. He  never pushed me to go to Oklahoma A M   I don   t know, when did  Oklahoma State become the name?  1957.  That   s when I graduated from high school. It was always Oklahoma  A M to me.  Again, you were sharing some of his stories. What stood out in your  mind, some of his favorite things about Oklahoma State?  Gosh, like I say, he loved Hank Iba, he loved the basketball program. He  never did play sports in college but he played a little bit in high school, I  think. He liked baseball a lot. Mainly he really talked more about his  fraternity experiences. That was mostly it.  10  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Can you tell me about your mother and her influence on your life?  Well, my mother grew up in Tacoma, Washington   was born in  Tacoma, Washington. She and Dad were married when my dad was in  business with his dad, Arthur, in Fort Stockton. She was a housewife and  this sort of thing. She didn   t know anything about Oklahoma A M. I  was raised as a Texas boy.  Going back to your parents, were there certain values or traits that you  learned in your family growing up that influenced you later in life?  Like I said, I think more than anything, the strong ethics and morals my  grandmother, Nanny, made such an impression on me. I think it related  to Arthur, our grandfather. I think they were both alike in the stories you  hear. The strong Methodist background, and I think that influenced me  as far as my morals and ethics more than anything. So I was always  taught,    This is what you ought to do   the way it ought to be.    But I  think Nanny was the one that I remember more. I mean, I can remember  when we   d go visit her in the mountains on Sunday morning. We   re  walking around the cabin carrying a cross, singing    Onward Christian  Soldiers.    (Laughter) I can remember that. That obviously made an  impression on me.  Tell me a little bit about the relationship of your dad with his father,  your grandfather. It must have been pretty good, because they went into  business together.  I would assume they got along famously. When my grandfather died, I  think it really was a big shock in my dad   s life. I think it affected him a  whole lot. They must have been very close, the way I can tell.  Did they ever talk about when he went off to school? Was that part of his  plan to come back and work with his dad, do you know?  I don   t think it was a plan, no. No, I don   t think so. I think it just worked  out. I think his big plan was to go to work with Homer, more than  anything.  The kind of reunion we were talking about a minute ago, when you first  started thinking about the larger, extended Adams family, that was in  1991, the reunion that you had in Angel Fire  New Mexico . Was that  when you first got acquainted with the rest of the family and started  thinking about the larger Adams family?  Yes, that   s basically the year that we all got together. I   d known Bob  over the years   occasionally we   d see Bob and Pat and we   d touch on it  11  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  a little bit but this was the first time that we met any of Walter   s people.  We just didn   t understand the heritage until, bless Bob and Pat   s heart,  we got together with these reunions.  That   s when you first started finding out about the Run of    89 and  William Henry Harrison and some of those things.  Oh yeah. Absolutely.  Was it a shock to you to get that group together and what did you think  of that Adams clan?  Well, I was impressed with the educational background of everyone. Of  course, most of them were Oklahoma A M graduates, by the way, but  had gone on and been very successful in different areas of life. I think  that   s what impressed me more than anything. It was obviously a very  educated and caring group   a very caring group. Everybody seemed to  really care about each other. That   s probably what impressed me more  than anything.  We talked about roots, but was it amazing to you as they started  unfolding Dwayne Sehon, work he did as he went back to the 1100s in  England, but look at how far back the family lineage went. You looked at  Elijah, who was in the Civil War and fought at the Battle of  Chickamauga. You go back and look, part of the Adams family are  actually two presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams     That   s what I hear, Jerry  (Laughter)  Is that pretty special for you?  Well yeah, I tell everybody that I   m a descendant of John and John  Quincy, yeah. (Laughter) If that   s what you mean. Yes, we consider it  special, if it   s for real.  What were anticipating, Art, because you   re thinking,    We   re going to  find some horse thieves in the family.     Oh, I   m sure there are plenty of those, we just don   t advertise them.  (Laughs)  But you   re thinking    I wonder who these crazy people are going to be?     Have you established some relationships, friendships, now through that?  Oh gosh, yes. My cousin Arthur and I, we were kind of scared to go  because we   re black sheep from the University of Texas. We didn   t  12  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  know what we were going to find. They welcomed us greatly and it   s  been a great experience every reunion. One reunion we got to stay at the  Adams Nut Farm in Stillwater.  Maybe just another way of asking the question again but we all want to  think about where we   re from and about our descendents. Are you proud  of the heritage that you got?  Oh, absolutely. And the other thing I keep harping on and I think it   s  true, I see in the Adams family a lot of strong Christian background and  I think there   s strong ethics involved in our family and morals. We   re  proud of that.  What have we not covered?  I don   t know. Are we going to talk baseball, Jerry? (Laughter)  How many times Texas beats up on Oklahoma State? (Laughter) The  final question I   ve got is a little bit about the relationship with the  university. Do you feel good about the relationship that the university  has forged with the Adams family?  I think you guys have gone out of your way to make us feel welcome.  Every time we   ve been there for some ceremony, whether it was the  presentation of the original diploma or the Adams Market, you guys  have gone out of your way to make us feel welcome, to make us feel  important. I wish the University of Texas would be that good. Because  you guys really have made us feel great.  I appreciate it, thank you.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
