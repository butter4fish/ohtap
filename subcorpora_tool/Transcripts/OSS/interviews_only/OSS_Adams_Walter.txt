 Gill. Today is December 14, 2009. I   m visiting with  Walter Adams in his home here in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Walter, I  appreciate you taking the time to visit with us.  Thank you, Jerry. Glad to do it.  As we talked about earlier, this interview is for the O-STATE Stories  Project in the Oklahoma Oral History Program of the OSU Library.  Yes.  I know that it   s a source of pride for you and your family that your  ancestors helped found the Stillwater community and that two members  of the Adams family, Arthur and James Homer, were in the first  graduating class of Oklahoma State University, but what I   d like to do is  back up and talk about you first and get your background.  Very good.  Can you share a little bit of information about yourself, about where you  grew up, about your early life, your immediate family, some of those  things?  Sure. I was one of the ones that was born and raised right here in  Stillwater, Oklahoma. Born in 1943 and attended public schools in  Stillwater my entire life. Was able to actually walk to campus, to OSU,  which was a very good process because otherwise I might not have been  able to afford to go. My family moved out onto the original homestead  in the 1950-51 timeframe, and that   s where I remember growing up  when I was, actually, at that time, six years old, just getting ready to go  to grade school. Had the great privilege of growing up on this farm that  we still live on, twenty acres of it. It was a pecan orchard, mostly, so I  5  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  had free roam and free run of the farmland. Could not have had a better  childhood than I did.  I guess this is probably obvious, but I   ll ask the question anyway. What  influenced you to go to Oklahoma State other than one of the other  Oklahoma schools? (Laughter)  Well, first of all, finances, of course. It was very easy to go right here  and not worry about room and board or any of the other things. But, as  you said, we have the unique history of having my grandfather   s two  brothers, Arthur and James Homer (Homer is what we called him), to be  the first students actually to enroll and to graduate. I don   t think there  was any choice whether or not I wanted to go somewhere else. It was  going to be Oklahoma State for me.  Wasn   t much question about that, was there?  No, there wasn   t.  As you talk about being a member of the historic OSU Adams family, did  that influence your decision? Was that important to you, knowing that  you had that tradition in your family?  Yes. I did not personally know my great-uncles, my granddad   s brothers,  but certainly was proud, and the family always talked about Uncle  Arthur and Uncle Homer, and that was probably one of the major  influences, to carry on the tradition of OSU and Oklahoma A M.  You never met either of your great-uncles?  Did not meet either one of them personally.  What was your major at Oklahoma State?  I was in the school of business, but economics was my major. No  particular reason. It was just convenient for me to   I enjoyed the class  work.  Do you remember some of the professors you had?  Well, yes.  Some of their influence in your development?  Absolutely. Matter of fact, I still run into Dr. Steindl occasionally, Frank  Steindl, and Dr.  Robert  Sandmeyer who eventually ended up, I think,  6  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  as the head of the business school, but at the time I was there, he was a  brand new economics professor. And other ones, but those two in  particular, and I think the reason I remember them is because they   re  still around here.  As an econ major, you   d have had to have the intermediate accounting  classes, the beginning classes. Did you have any classes under Dr.   Wilton  Anderson?  I did not have a course under Dr. Anderson, but interestingly, in  Stillwater High School there are so many  children of faculty  that I  went to school with his son. So, I knew of him, but as things turned out,  I did not take a course under Dr. Anderson.  We were alluding to your family earlier. How did being a member of the  Adams family affect your perception of OSU and your OSU experience  in any way?  I think as we said before, it was the school to go to, and it was never a  question as to where I wanted to go. I think the idea of the history and  the historical perspective of carrying on the tradition. Of course, my  sisters had also gone to school here. I was following quite a few  footsteps, not just the original two. Goodness, the family has put quite a  few students before me and a number after me, as well.  You had three sisters, is that correct?  Yes.  Were you the youngest member of the family?  I was the youngest one in the family.  Did all three of your sisters go to Oklahoma State?  Two of my sisters went to OSU, and my other sister married an OSU  student right out of high school. She was probably the smartest of the  bunch, but she never did get to go.  I guess I   ve got to ask you this, too. Did you meet Diane at OSU?  And, of course, I met my wife at OSU.  Is there a story there, Walter, that you can tell us about?  There   s always lots and lots of stories, but I actually knew Diane   s  7  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  brother first. We were fraternity brothers together, and I think that  Danny was either playing a basketball game or a volleyball match,  intramural, and I got to meet Diane at one of those, and we got together  the last year in school together.  Where did Diane grow up?  Diane is from Collinsville, just north of Tulsa.  You were talking about Danny, your fraternity brother. What fraternity  were you in?  Sigma Chi, and Diane was Kappa Alpha Theta. The Greek system is still  strong at OSU. I   m glad that it is. Had many good times.  Could you talk a little bit about your undergraduate experience, some of  the activities you were engaged in, some of the things you did?  Well, I don   t know if I can tell everything or not, but... (Laughter) It was  really a great time, as we had talked about earlier. Nineteen sixty-two  just had a new president for us, Kennedy, a young dynamic person. I  went there with lots of hopes. My social activities pretty much were with  the fraternity. Not many scholastic. I was just a student, to get in and get  out, and that   s it.  You came in the fall of 1962?  Yes.  And you graduated in     In January of    67. I spent an extra six months in.  Can you talk about some of your favorite memories of your  undergraduate experience at Oklahoma State?  Favorite memories. Goodness, I think every one was a good one.  (Laughs) It   s hard for me to think, Jerry, of one better than others except  that, obviously, I knew when I met my wife that that was going to be a  special time with her. The friendships that you make in school as you  progress were always very good. I couldn   t say one was more favorite  than another.  I think you did a good job of picking up on Diane as one of your favorite  memories. That was pretty slick. (Laughter) Looking back at your  experiences at Oklahoma State, is there any event   you mentioned  8  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  President Kennedy. Are there any other events that you remember, not  necessarily of that significance, but events, activities, that were key to  your years on campus?  I can   t really say any specific event. As you progress 1962 through  1967, and I think we talked a little bit about it, Vietnam became more  and more prevalent as we progressed on from just a small presence in     62 until    67-   68, and we were very involved. I think a lot of the  questions about what we were going to do after we graduated from  school were answered by Vietnam. You knew that you were probably  going to get to do a tour and a visit over there one way or another. So,  that   s probably the most significant thing that I remember about it.  Picking up on your comments there, can you talk about after you  graduated from Oklahoma State, about your military career and the rest  of your life after that?  Well, I, of course, spent the first two years in ROTC, as we all did at that  time. After that, I did not continue, so I really had no significant plans  after graduation except that I knew the military was going to be a  significant part of my life. I just didn   t know what part of it. I was  contacted by my Air Force recruiter and invited to come visit with him.  As I said earlier, he invited me to learn how to fly and fly over Vietnam  rather than walk across it, and I took him up on his offer. That started  my career of thirty-seven years in aviation, first in the Air Force and  then with Delta Airlines.  A little bit about your career in the Air Force. The aircraft that you  piloted was     Started out in the C-141, which is a cargo transport plane. We would  probably make three trips a month to Southeast Asia and back. Off and  on, other trips occasionally, but it was mainly to deliver goods over and  bring whatever needed to come back, back. I did that for a year and a  half, and then got to train in the forward air control. O-2A is what it was  called, which is a Cessna 337, just an old push-pull airplane that they put  a couple of rocket pods on, and you help the fighters find the bad guys.  Did that for a year and a half, then came back into 141s after that.  Did you have any hot engagements when you were     No. After all my training, they pulled six of us out and sent us to Korea  to train the Koreans with airborne facts right after Pueblo  1968 attack  on USS Pueblo by North Korea . So, I ended up in Korea for my  forward air control time which was quiet, comparatively.  9  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  And you were in the Air Force for four years?  Five years.  Five years. And when you got out     Timing is everything, and for me, I got out and the airlines had just  begun to hire again as a push was coming along. This was in 1972, and  so Vietnam had started to wind down at that point, and the airlines were  wrapping up. Got hired by Delta Airlines. Went to work in 1973 with  them and then retired in 2003, flying everything from a DC-8, which I  started on, to a Boeing 777. Retired on as a senior captain on a Boeing  777.  Wow. Is that the one called the Dream Liner?  That   s the new one. That   s the 787. It will be in service next year,  probably, and I would   ve loved to have had a chance to fly it, but I   ll  leave it to the younger guys.  Walter, can we go back a little bit and talk about your family history?  We mentioned it earlier, about your great-grandfather, William H.H.  Adams.  Yes.  He and his wife claimed the quarter-section of land located in the  current southwest corner of Stillwater during the land run of 1889. Your  grandfather would   ve been about how old at that time?  Grandfather would   ve been about twenty years old, I think, when they  made the run.  His father was William H.H.  His father was William H.H. Adams. The stories that we heard were that  Grandfather, William Henry Harrison Adams, was a surveyor and came  and surveyed the town site of Stillwater. We lived on Adams Street, so  we always thought, and I believe it   s true, as part of his surveying jobs,  he conveniently made the Adams Street (Laughter) dead end right into  our farm. There   s some history written by the great-uncles, my  granddad   s brothers, what a great adventure it was that they made the  run in a, they call it a prairie schooner, I think it is, which is one of the  big wagons, 120-mile trek, and once they staked the claim, they had to  make three or four runs back and forth. It sounded like, that if you were  a twelve-year-old kid, eighteen- to twenty-year-old kid, you would   ve  10  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  had a wonderful time, going back and forth.  Now, the family came from the Augusta, Kansas area?  That   s correct, yes.  Did you hear any stories about when they fired the gun and they made  the run?  I never did hear that and, actually, I always thought the movie footage  that we saw was   and you   re a history major, you probably know more.  I thought that was more of the Cherokee Strip than it was the one in the  first run of 1889. No, I did not hear that, so I   m not familiar with  anything other than that they made that long journey south to stake their  claim.  Do you recall if there were any friends or family members that made the  run with them?  I do not know the ones that made the run with them. Now, the  interesting thing is that we   re talking about the Adams family, but if you  talk about my mom   s family, both of her parents and grandparents,  actually both of her grandparents, staked claims. And, so, three of my  four great-grandparents were participants in the     So, there was a family element?  Yes, yes. For us, there was the Kautzs, the Kobles, and the Adamses  all   there was a homestead out to the southwest, and another one to the  south, and, of course, the Adams farm that we grew up on.  This brings me to another question I wanted to ask you. Talking about  the family members that were related, all getting claims in the same  area, do you know why they, one, picked Stillwater, the area, and then  how they decided which section they were going to try to claim? Did you  ever hear any stories?  I never did hear a story. I don   t know. Of course, as I looked around, it is  excellent farm land, and I think that   s probably one of the priorities that  they were looking for. Good land that you could farm and plow up, and I  believe that that   s probably what influenced them. I don   t know. Maybe  the proximity to the beginning of the run, since Stillwater was here on  the north end of it. Sometimes, you grab the first spot you can take. I  think my great-granddad, being a surveyor, maybe had a chance to look  and say,    Oh, okay, I think I   d like to take that land there. It   s got water  and good fertile land on it,    but I do not know for sure.  11  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  The reason I   m wondering about it is because some of the boomer  settlements that were in the Stillwater area were people from the Kansas  area, and sometimes some of them had been here or had talked to other  people and had kind of scattered out and knew maybe not specifically,  but generally where they wanted to go to try to find the claim. I didn   t  know if maybe you had heard     I had not heard. I know the history of Captain Payne, but to my  knowledge, it would be very unusual for me to know. I did not know  that there was any communication back and forth. I   m sure there was in  different settlement areas.  Can you go back a little bit and trace the ancestry of the Adams family?  How did they get to Kansas? Was there ancestry here in Oklahoma?  What about the rest of the United States?  I am one of the really fortunate ones. We have a family Bible that has  been passed on from my   I can   t say how many greats, probably three  greats, four greats   grandfather who was born in 1766, and presented  the Bible to his eldest son to remain in the family forever to be presented  to the next eldest in line. As it turned out, some 200 years later, I was the  next eldest in line. So, I received the Bible, and we have a lineage   our  family history that we traced starts in North Carolina, and from North  Carolina they migrated to Tennessee, where my great-grandfather  William Henry Harrison was in the Civil War and actually was captured  and was a prisoner of war. After that time, they migrated to Kansas, and  then by good fortune the Homestead Act allowed them to come to  Oklahoma and claim the land.  Did they purchase their land in Kansas?  I do not know where they lived or whether they had a farm in Kansas or  not.  I   m trying to recall if you told me, but your grandfather, Walter Alonzo,  at the time of the run was about twenty years old?  Yes.  Did he ever share stories with you? Was he still living while you were  alive?  He was living but I was very young. I was six years old or seven when  he passed. I do know that he had a great love of the land. I think that   s  one of the things that we all shared. He started the pecan orchard.  There   s some 300-plus grafted paper shell pecans on the north side of  12  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  the Stillwater Creek here, and within the city limits now, but he grafted  all of those pecans. Took great care of them. Also, as a farmer, he raised  cows. I think one of the things that was interesting is that he took some  of his corn that he had grown to the Chicago World   s Fair. Maybe it was  St. Louis; I   m not sure. Anyway, he won grand champion for his corn.  He was a man of the land, I guess is what you would say. My sister  would say he was very meticulous. He had a way that he wanted things  done, and so he was very systematic.  Tracing your grandfather   s generation, that was William H.H. Adams,  his kids.  Yes.  Of course, we know that James Homer and Arthur both went to OSU  and were in the first graduating class in 1896. Now your grandfather  and the other   s name is     Oscar.  Oscar. They did not go to school, is that correct?  No. My grandfather was twenty, as we said, probably twenty-one by the  time Oklahoma A M was being established. He already had his basic  education, and it was time for him to stay on the farm and work. As I  understood it, he stayed on the farm and helped improve it. And then  Oscar (he would   ve been the third brother of the four) went to New  Mexico and participated in a land run, in a homestead, in New Mexico,  whereas Arthur and James Homer were students at OSU. I think they  moved to Ardmore after graduation and started businesses of their own.  Can you tell me a little bit about your father, Arthur?  Yes. My dad was just one of the good, hardworking folks in Oklahoma.  He worked the farm. As I remember growing up, after my grandfather  had died, his brother (Willie is what we called him), Uncle Bill, had one  eighty  -acre parcel  and my dad had the other eighty. We worked pretty  much just subsistence. We grew most of our food. We had cows,  chickens, a little bit of everything. Depended on the pecan orchard for a  lot of our income. My dad worked at both of the local creameries which  are, of course, now out of business here in Stillwater. Actually, he made  the butter. He was, like I say, just a hardworking guy.  Did he do the collection? Did he go out to the routes, also?  He was in the factory.  13  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Per our earlier conversation, if I remember, Walter, his father had an  illness of some kind, and your father came back to help him. Is that  correct? Your dad, for a while, he didn   t live on the land, and then he  came back?  Yes, yes. Until I was, goodness, five years old or so, they lived in town.  They lived in different houses, different places. I was actually born in a  house on Lewis Street, not at the hospital, but in a house, as quite a few  deliveries were, probably, at that time. Then, my granddad became ill  with cancer. At that time, they moved back to help him and then moved  their house in at Twelfth and Adams, where it still stands (I don   t know  how much longer). But that   s where I grew up.  And where was that home located, the old original house?  The old original house   you have to know Stillwater. Blakeley Street  was the dividing line between the two sections. It stood up on a hill and  it overlooked most all of the farm. Beautiful old two-story house, made  mostly from the lumber and the walnut trees that were native. They  actually went and cut them and harvested them right here, and built the  house with that lumber.  And the address or location would be what?  Oh, goodness, it would be   I don   t know. Twelfth and Blakeley, but  then you have to go about three blocks to the south, up on just a little  small rise there.  Just about three blocks south of there?  Yes, yes, off of Blakeley Street. Now, if you   re in Stillwater now, off of  Twelfth Street, they are beginning to develop that property, and there   s a  beautiful new paved road that goes right through the middle of where  that house would   ve been, as a matter of fact.  You and Diane live on property that was part of the original settlement  of 160 acres. I think you have twenty acres of that, still. Is that right?  That   s correct.  Did you inherit that from your father first-hand?  I feel like it   s an inheritance. When Diane and I were in Dallas, I was  flying for Delta, I think 1978, when our son was just starting to become  ready for kindergarten and first grade. So, we had a little conversation  and decided that it would be much better to bring our son to Stillwater  14  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  rather than go to school in Dallas. We came back, and I visited with my  mom and my sisters, and they agreed to sell me this twenty acres, at a  very reasonable price, I might add. I feel more like it was an inheritance  than a purchase, but I did purchase those twenty acres for my family.  Is it special to you, Walter, to live here on the original homestead?  Every time I drive up the gravel road, I just think of my granddad and  my dad and my family, and think how lucky I am to be able to live here.  It still is a beautiful piece of property. We sit right here within the city  limits of Stillwater, but in a very country setting. We have the best of  both worlds.  You are one of the few in your family, your father, your grandfather, and  yourself, who lived on the property. The rest of them scattered a little  bit. Without a full genealogy, can you tell me about some of the other  branches of the family, briefly?  Everybody has kind of drifted from one place or another, but the nice  thing is we still have the anchor and we   re still the roots of the family.  Almost everybody, from the four brothers that originally homesteaded,  has been here at our house at one time or another. They   re scattered  from mostly Texas and Oklahoma, I would say, is the majority of the  family now.  I understand that you have reunions occasionally, and some of them  here, but about every four or five years, the whole family gets together?  Yes. Every four or five years mainly through my, I call him my cousin  Bob, who is actually a second cousin, I guess, but he is the son of  Homer. Bob kind of gets things going. He says,    Okay, it   s time to get  together again.    We just completed our last family reunion a couple of  months ago. We had probably, oh goodness, forty-some people. That  one was in Dallas.  So, tell me a little bit about the reunions, Walter. What are some of the  things you do and talk about?  We always are, again, instigated by Bob. The first thing we get to do is  introduce ourselves and our family and tell what   s been going on in our  lives for the past five or six years. That usually takes up about half a day,  and then the rest of the time is just what a reunion should be. It   s sitting  and talking, just like you and I are sitting and talking together, one  person to the next, and finding out what   s been going on, and become  familiar again with things and events that have happened. And, of  course, new grandkids and new accomplishments and new graduates and  15  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  whatever else it would be.  In your perspective, in what ways is OSU important to the members of  the Adams family? Is it significant to them?  Oh, yes, it is. I think, as we go right now, we have one member, Travis  Adams, who is going to be a graduate this May. So, as you look back,  there   s almost always somebody that   s in school, has been in school, and  it   s kind of a central theme to us that says,    Well, who   s going where?  Who   s going to do what? Which one is the next?    OSU has always been  a major factor with us, and will be.  Is it a particular source of pride that you had the two brothers in that  first graduating class of    96?  Absolutely, and I think that every student that enrolls knows that they  have a little something to live up to. Okay, the goal is pretty high there.  Your great-great-granddad is   or now it   s great-great-great. There are  four generations.  Is Travis the fourth generation?  Yes.  Are you expecting a fifth generation at any time?  It   ll be a while before the fifth generation goes. I   m sure there   ll be other  OSU families that will be, or already have, five generations.  Not many, but there are some five-generation families.  There will most definitely be. I   ve got two grandsons. I think we   ve  already started a college fund. (Laughter) I can guarantee you that  they   re wearing OSU colors, and they   ve been up there to Gallagher-Iba  and Pickens field.  You   ve got this fund for them, Walter, and they can go anywhere they  want to go, but if it   s OSU, you   ll let them use the money? (Laughter)  That   s right. Exactly, exactly.  Do you have any idea about how many members of the family over the  years, starting with Homer and Arthur, have attended Oklahoma State?  That was one of my projects that I went through when I knew you were  coming. This is not absolutely accurate, but I think the last count was  16  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  around forty-one.  Forty-one.  Forty-one, and out of those, I couldn   t tell you the graduates, but most of  them went on to graduate. The majority of them went on to graduate.  Walter, another question I want to ask along the same lines, are there  some members that stand out in the family that have done something  significant? I know every member has done something significant, but  are there some things that are particularly memorable? Some memories  of the Adams family that you could point to?  Well, it all depends on what you say is significant. I think just getting  out there and having a career is significant. I   m sitting here with my  nephew, my sister   s son, we were visiting and he worked, goodness,  twenty years-plus ago on wind turbines and electrical-generated power.  A great engineer. He was in aviation in the engineering part of it, and I  was in the flying part of it, and yet as I talk to him, he has developed a  flight management system that, as he said, his system was used by the  Lockheed Electra that reenacted Amelia Earhart   s journey around the  world except that if she used his GPS flight management system to get  around, she would absolutely know where she is. So, yes, there   s gobs of  accomplishments. But any beacon   I don   t know if there   s anything that  stands out other than raising a good family and being a good person.  Now, your two kids went to Oklahoma State, is that correct?  Yes, yes they did. My son has been married now over ten years. My  daughter just married, so no grandkids there yet. The grandsons are just  six and three, so they   ve got a long way to go, but the nice thing is both  sets of grandparents   my son married his high school sweetheart, so  both sets of grandparents are right here in Stillwater. So, we get to share.  There   s not many visits that both sets of grandparents aren   t together.  That always includes OSU football games, basketball games. You name  it and they   ll be up here for the games, and the grandkids, like I say, are  getting an early indoctrination.  If you looked back and thought about it, what do you feel is the legacy of  the Adams family, in terms of Oklahoma State University?  My legacy is by being a land-grant school, it was a place that I could go,  get my education, pursue my business, as it happens to be it was aviation  for me, but OSU was accessible to everyone, and that probably was the  most important thing to me. As our families have attended school, it has  paid us back ten times over.  17  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Do you feel a special sense of belonging at Oklahoma State University,  with four generations and forty some-odd individuals that have gone to  Oklahoma State?  Oh, yes, I do, although I don   t know any one of us that really has gone to  school with that in mind. I certainly didn   t tell any of my professors that  my great-uncles were the first students. I think we   re all humbled by the  fact that they were the first students. I think each one of us wants to  accomplish things on our own. That part of it is semi-private.  As a graduate of Oklahoma State University, are you proud of the things  you   re seeing happening on the campus nowadays, the master plans and  the things that are going on?  Just amazed. Yes. Every time I go through the   of course, the Boone  Pickens Stadium is probably the most obvious thing. But as you go on  campus, and this is one of the things that when we moved back we  enjoyed so much, is that there   s so much available to the folks in  Stillwater. You   ve got the Allied Arts programs; OSU always has some  musical program, some program going forward. The construction that   s  going on, the new buildings, new architectural building that   s just  opened. Everything. It does make you proud to see the progress and look  forward to what   s going to happen next.  And the Adams family display at the Alumni Center? It   s pretty  prominent, isn   t it?  Yes, it is. We really had a good time working with you on that. As I  said, my nephew has had significant input into the genealogy of our  family and what it   s got on there. The Alumni Center, of course, is  beautiful.  Well, is there anything we haven   t talked about, Walter, your feelings  about Oklahoma State University or your family? I know you   re one of  the historians, and certainly you have a lot of the historical documents  of the Adams family, as we were looking at here just previous to our  interview. Is there anything we haven   t discussed that you   d like to bring  up?  I think that you   ve done more than a good job of getting everything out  of me that you can. (Laughs) As I say, I   m humbled every time I come  to the house and am able to look out my window and think,    My  goodness. My grandfather and my dad and my great-grandfather  preserved this land that we get to live on, and I hope that eventually  somebody else will get to live on it.    As I go up on campus, I kind of  think the same thing, that without our previous generations that have  18  worked so hard to make the university function and work, I know that  the next generations are going to be that much more appreciative, as  well.  -------  -------
