 Finchum Today is June 13, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the Library  here at Oklahoma State University, and today I am with Bianca Boyd. She is  the Coordinator of Student Support Services in the University   s Division of  Institutional Diversity. Did I get that right?  Boyd Yes, you got it perfect.  Finchum This interview is part of our O-STATE Stories oral history project. So we   ll  be talking a little bit about Bianca   s journey to OSU and why she   s here,  and a little bit into her wellness journey. Thank you for having me today.  Boyd Thank you for having me, it   s so awesome.  Finchum Let   s begin with learning a little bit about you. When and where were you  born?  Boyd Okay, I was born December 19, 1987, in Heidelberg, Germany. So that is, I  guess, my birthplace. (Laughs) My parents were in the military and so I just  happened to come at a very interesting time. I don   t think it was planned that  way, but yeah   and so that   s where I was born, but I consider St. Louis,  Missouri, my home.  Finchum Okay, and which parent was in the military?  Boyd Both, my mother and my father. Yes, in the Army.  Finchum And do you want to talk any about their positions or     Boyd They were both   yeah, I think. My mom is originally from California so she  just really had that, very much like, free spirit. Wanted to go and travel and  my dad was a little different. He was from Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, so kind  5  of a very practical guy. For him the military was just very practical. They  got together and they got married. I am the middle child.  I come from a very, very long line of family that served in the Armed  Forces. My brothers are in the Air Force. That is just kind of what we do. I  am different because I didn   t do that. I think having the opportunity I had  the, you know, the privilege to kind of move around, but I was so young. I  kind of didn   t remember, but I get to see all these amazing pictures of me  being a little person and being in all these different places. That was really,  really cool.  I stayed in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, with my grandmother because my parents  were both in the military and they were both gone. I had the opportunity to  have some   just some amazing countryside living and very simple, simple  living in the end. Eventually move into St. Louis when I was eight, which  was definitely different from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, (laughs) but that was just  really, really good.  Finchum Why St. Louis? What took them there?  Boyd Okay, so my father   that   s where his home is. I guess not his   well, I guess  kind of his home. His mother was living there and so he wanted to be back  with his mom. My mom was like,    Okay, that   s where we   re going to go.     That   s where we kind of ended up.  Finchum Interesting, they are coast to coast and then end up in the middle.  Boyd Yes, in the middle.  Finchum And you   re the middle child?  Boyd I   m the middle child, I am. We have a blended family. I am the only girl  from my mother. I have four brothers, and I am it   Laughs  That is amazing  sometimes and sometimes not so much, because I   m the responsible one, the  more caring one, so that   s very interesting to see how that kind of plays out.  Then I also have two younger sisters from my dad and they   re amazing. One  is going off to college and the other one is a senior in high school. Big  family, to me anyway. I think it   s big.  Finchum Big, so four   so seven of you?  Boyd Yes, so there were like no leftovers in our house, like ever. Just learned the  concept of that when I moved out and I was like,    I cooked and I have  things left over      Laughs  I just always think that   s so interesting.  Finchum Being the only girl you wouldn   t have hand-me-down clothes.  6  Boyd I didn   t, right. Everything would begin with me, new and fresh. There  were   I was like   of course different, because I was the only girl. They  were like,    What do we do with this right here?    My mom was like,    Let me  just handle it.    My mom and I have a really close relationship because it was  just kind of us, and the guys. It was fun and I do think kind of having that  more intimate relationship with my mom was definitely really what kind of  got me into just the whole concept of caring for yourself.  My family, I think because they were involved in the military I think they  were always kind of more active. I think you kind of have to be. I can  remember, oh my gosh, my parents waking up super early to go to their  training base to go train and do PT. I would have to help them train. That  was really interesting to kind of see how that all played out, when they were  active. When they retired it was a little different. Definitely when they were  active it was fun, to do the pull-ups and all those other things.  Finchum Take me through your education, like where did you go to first grade and  then on through high school.  Boyd Gosh, elementary is such a blur because of that transition. The first thing I  can really remember was my elementary school when I went to St. Louis. I  grew up   I have a very interesting, I think, background. So we grew up in  inner-city St. Louis, when we first moved to St. Louis. It was pretty  impoverished. It was high-crime. I think that that was kind of reflected in  the school sometimes. I can remember going to Harrison Elementary. That  was my school   and I think that   s when the transition was totally different.  I went from being in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where I would like openly and  freely walk to school. Sometimes the kids didn   t even have like shoes   I  mean they had shoes. They would carry them with them, but it was just  very, you know, you say kind of on the outskirts in a very small, like again,  countryside. It was different and I can just remember like picking apples and  just gently gliding my hand across the stream as I would walk to school with  my grandmother. To go from there to a more urban place where that was  not   like there were no trees. So I think that was such a shift for me. Then  just the fact that the environment was just   I felt like the students, (though  we were all roughly, what, seven or eight), they were very mature in a lot of  ways that I just wasn   t. Despite that, I think it took a while but I kind of  blended in okay.  There were, you know, a little bit of bumps and hiccups along the way. Just  me feeling like I really kind of didn   t fit in, because I guess I kind of didn   t.  I   m this country girl with two plaids all the way down. Everybody else has  on whatever the latest trend is, and they have their Jordan   s and their  pullovers. We didn   t know anything about that. That   s kind of hard. But  7  again, I think learning for me was a little hard too, just because of the  transitions. Life was kind of tough in elementary for me.  Finchum Did it come in handy having older brothers?  Boyd It did. So my older brothers   my oldest brother was in charge of making  sure that we got to school. Like we rode the school bus, but he made sure  that we were there, he made sure that no one picked on us. That was pretty  good, but I really didn   t have too much   kids never really picked on me. I  think more than anything they thought I was a little different. I talked funny.  I had a real, at that point, a real deep southern accent. (Laughs) I never really  got picked on, but he was there always. Maybe that   s why, because they   re  like,    Oh      at this point my brother is five years older than me so he   s like  closer to his teens. By that time, he was definitely like a country guy,  (laughs) so they did not mess with him. So that could be why I didn   t have  any bullies. (Laughs) So that was fun.  Finchum So from Harrison?  Boyd So from Harrison I went to   oh, what is that   I think it was called Central  Middle School. At that point my family moved from the inner-city to a more  suburban area, which was great because of course in the inner-city I mean it  was very common to hear gun shots. We had bars on our windows. I think  for my family they were like,    This is not what we want for our kids.    As I  got older I entered into middle school. That was really when things started to  transform for me.  Looking back on it, I was always kind of a chunky kid. Man, my  grandmother would make like   she could make anything. You   re waking up  to, everyday not just on weekends, every day to homemade biscuits from  scratch, and she would go out and slaughter her own pig, prepare it. So we  would have like pancakes, and bacon, and eggs, and sausage, and all these  kind of different   just for breakfast.  I can remember going into middle school and wanting to kind of fit in a little  bit more. I was a sensitive child so I read a lot, and I kind of stuck with my  studies. Again, kind of felt like I really didn   t fit, but I was like,    I want to  fit.    Then I think I started to be more intentional about the things that I was  eating from a very, very early age. I think what unintentionally happened  was I started to develop, I would say, unhealthy eating habits. I was really,  really restrictive. I didn   t eat that much, and instead of people being   concerned  they   re like,    Oh  You look great  You should continue doing  what you   re doing.    That kind of   you know that preteen. I see how ladies  look on TV and I want to look like that, and I want to get asked out on the  middle school dance. That was definitely an interesting time for me.  8  Scholastically, I thrived. Again, that   s kind of where I found my comfort. I  was on the student council in middle school and just a number of other  things. I was really into writing and performing, so I did all of those things.  That was fun.  I would say middle school was really where I believe I started having this  kind of inconsistent and unhealthy relationship with food. My thought was  like,    Hey, if I eat this I   ll look skinnier, skinnier is better. Skinnier is better  than being big.    When I look, I guess, at how I was coming into elementary  school, no one really said anything. I was just that smart girl.  Then when I started eating only a handful of Raisin Bran for breakfast and  like a banana for lunch, then everybody was just like,    We don   t know what  you   re doing, but you just need to continue to do it.    That was a little tough,  and I really don   t think my parents knew because again, there was a lot of  us. Sometimes you just kind of get like a little lost in the shuffle. My mom  didn   t notice that I started losing weight, but again she was just like,    I  didn   t know that you were kind of cutting back     I think that that   s where it  kind of started for me.  Finchum Was exercise part of the equation?  Boyd At that point not really, it was just the intake. As I moved into high school it  got   that   s when the exercising came in.  Finchum Were you aiming for a particular size?  Boyd I really wasn   t, just smaller. I knew I just wanted to be smaller. By that time,  I had lost a significant amount of weight. I was so   like I got to the point  exiting middle school, entering high school where my teachers were like,     Okay, what   s really going on because when you   re at lunch you don   t  really eat.    And then in high school they   re like,    Are you doing drugs?  What   s going on?    I never had the language to say I have an eating disorder.  Also, in terms of, in impoverished communities, and especially with women  of color, you don   t hear that talked about a lot in our circles, because it   s just  kind of not our thing. I could even remember hearing language like,    We  know you don   t. No, you don   t have that.    But I did. That was very, very  interesting. Looking back on it now, now that I   m talking to you, I   m like  now I actually have the language to understand and the process to  understand what was going on at that time. I wanted to fit in, and I wanted  to   I wanted people to like me. It was a lot of acceptance. Then it became  just a matter of control. It shifted.  I think high school   s just hard, (laughs) for anyone. For me I think at that  point was when things with my family started to become not   I think it  9  became challenging. At that point there were some issues with my mom and  my dad. My dad is back in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. He had struggled with  addictions. He was addicted to heroin. That was tough for our family. Then  my mom, I think, just trying to handle it the best that she could began to  depend a lot on alcohol. So I could just see our family just kind of  crumbling. For me, again, I think when we talk about just the relationship  with food it became,    I can   t control anything and I need to control  something. I can control this.    That was a piece of it.  Then another piece was,    I don   t want anyone else to see the madness going  on in my house.    For me, I think all that I did in high school was to  accomplish and to achieve, and to accomplish, and to achieve, because I was  just kind of always that child. Like,    She   s great. She   s going to do this.    I  took advanced placement classes and I was on homecoming court, and prom  court, I was editor and chief of the literary magazine, I would play soccer, I  played tennis, I ran track, I mean just too much. (Laughs) I thought that  was   I was on the yearbook staff. I just did. Any and everything that I could  do, I did. I was getting to school at like six and wasn   t coming home until  like seven. I stayed there forever. I think because of those things, because I  was a high achiever, I was very much involved, again, I don   t think anyone  noticed that I was unhealthy. That I was really, really in an unhealthy place.  I can remember going into my junior year. That was just really tough for me  because things with my family got worse and I could see it. Then it became  this thing that I need an outlet. I   m tired of controlling and restricting, and  controlling, and restriction. Then I would just binge. So I   d have these  moments of like binging and then I would have moments of very rigid and  restrictive food intake and then I would exercise more. Then it would just  kind of go through this cycle. It would go through the cycle, over, and over,  and over, and over. It stayed that way, honestly, almost till I started my  health journey here. It   s been a very long process. That   s kind of what it  looked. Again, I would say my high school year was difficult in a lot of  ways, but I think that those were kind of the biggest things.  I just think it   s   when you have a personality that   s like this you can mask a  lot of stuff and no one will really   even if they see it, even if they know. I  know some people knew, but they   re,    Oh, she   s okay. It   s just a thing.     They won   t confront you on it. Also, I think because we just didn   t have the  language. Again, even though I lived in a more suburban area at the time, it  was still very much like low income, overpopulated schools. You kind of  just got lost in the shuffle, and that   s kind of just the way that it is. We have  school counselors, but they   re testing or they   re with the students who had  disciplinary problems. Because I didn   t have all that   there may have been  some concern here or there, mentioned here or there, but I was like,    Oh,  you know, just trying to get into this dress.       Oh, okay     And I   d just be on  my way.  10  Finchum You were very deliberate it sounds like, too, with your thinking and actions.  Boyd Yes, because it became a mode of    I have to cover up. I have to cover up.     Finchum Girlfriends didn   t     Boyd No, honestly and again I think it   s very interesting how society plays into  that culture, because they would be like,    Girl, you exercise all the time. I  want to be like you  How can I do that? What are you eating? I want to do  that     And especially for women, I think   I   m so glad that it   s changing  now. It   s always been like your power comes in how you look and you   re  afforded more opportunities if you look a certain way. You can get more  dates or you can get attention from guys if you look a certain way.  I guess the mission is to attain that, whatever that is. We don   t know, I don   t  even know what that is. But whatever that is   because our society says you  have to be skinny, or pretty, smart, or faster, you have to do more. It doesn   t  say,    Hey, just be yourself and you are enough.    No. (Laughs) So I think  blending all of that in it continued to create a culture where unhealthy was  normal and healthy was healthy.  Finchum With all that going on, you kept your studies and your grades up?  Boyd I did, I did. Again, I think all of that was just a distraction and a little bit of a  cry for help. Again, I honestly really don   t know how I made it, but I did. I  got good grades, and I got a full tuition scholarship to Missouri State  University in Springfield, Missouri. That   s where I entered in 2006, in fall  of 2006. I will never forget it because I wanted to just leave my family as  quickly as possible. I was like,    Okay four hours is really good. It   s not too  long, it   s a good driving distance.    So I left. (Laughs) Yeah, that was very     that was a hard transition though.  Again, I   m coming from a place where my identity was so stuck in all of  these things, and all of these accomplishments, and all of these superlatives,  and I   m being plopped into a school with twenty other thousand students.  Like,    Who am I? Where do I fit?       I would say I had probably gained,  easily, fifty pounds my freshman year because I was just so sad. I would just  cry,    I just don   t know who I am.    There are tons of students that have many  superlatives and they   re like,    Where do I fit? Where is my fit?    Then again,  that didn   t last long because I kind of went back into my mode of    Okay,  I   m just going to accomplish more.     Then also you come from a big family and even it   s a little chaotic and a  little dysfunctional, that becomes your normal and you settle into that. I  didn   t have any of that. It was just like me. I feel like I   m bringing the  11  counselor out in me, but typically what we tend to do is we tend to create  our environment that resembles our family system. Even when your family  system is a little bit off. We will intentionally place dysfunction in so that  we can continue to operate in roles that we know until some type of  intervention occurs, which I   m so glad I had mine, but not as an  undergraduate. Not as a freshman coming in.  I think I did what I always did. I went back to what I know. I just really  began to try and accomplish more. I began working out really vigorously  and I had a partner, a workout partner, who was my dorm mate. Again, I  think it   s very interesting that when I had lost the weight heading into my  sophomore year, kind of towards the end of my freshman year, no one  questioned whether it was healthy. They were like,    You look great.    I  would be in the dining hall and all I would have for dinner would be like  string beans. That   s it. They   d be like,    Whatever you   re doing, it   s  working     I   m eating string beans. (Laughs) Again, going back to that  restriction, but then eating a lot. Restriction but,    Okay I need an outlet.     Again, just that really unhealthy relationship with food. I think that that was  again a cry for help, a cry for self-understanding, a cry to try and fit in.  Again, I think it goes back to the fact when I am smaller, people come at me  more. They are nicer to me. Like from my exchange with people. It  becomes,    You look so good  You look so pretty     All of these things. As a  young woman   I   m eighteen, I want that. I   m like,    Yeah, that   s great.    At  that time, I was single so that was even better. Even though I still battle with  that a little bit. You know with that came, like, depression, and anxiety, and  all of those things, but even with those things I feel so blessed, and I feel so  thankful that I did amazingly well in college. I was on the dean   s honor roll.  I began to kind of find my niche a little bit. I think I ended up serving as an  executive on the student board of the NAACP and just really trying to be an  advocate and being plugged in to the community.  Kind of entering into my sophomore year I think I kind of planted myself in  that. I founded an organization that was called the Multicultural Student  Recruitment Team, in order to recruit more multicultural students to our  campus and to also develop places where they feel comfortable and they feel  safe. I became the Director of Equity and Diversity in our student  government association. I think I just really   I was a university ambassador,  I was a resident hall assistant. Again, you just pile it on because that   s just  how I work. I   m an all or nothing kind of girl. (Laughs)  Finchum When did you sleep?  Boyd I didn   t  And that   s the thing. And it   d stay like that. Honestly, I would say  it stayed like that for a while. When I entered into my senior year, at that  point I joined Greek life. That adds on a whole other level of social  12  acceptance and especially in a sorority you   they highly encourage you to  look a certain way. I   m not sure those are things that are ever talked about,  but there   s a certain appearance that they would like for you to keep up and  uphold, and things like that. Then I was very public. Fraternity and sorority  life was huge at my, like it is here. That did not help me. (Laughs) It kind of  made matters worse.  Again, I would have these periods where I would gain seventy pounds and  then lose it, and then again I think the most shocking and scary thing for me  is no one ever   like people that knew me from freshman year just never was  like,    Are you okay?    You know? Like at all. I don   t know, again, if it was  just a sense of normalcy that that   s just what happens, but I knew that that  was unhealthy. Again, I didn   t have the words. I didn   t have the means to  really express myself and say    Hey, I   m hurting and this is the way I tend to  take it out on myself. I don   t binge drink, I don   t do drugs, I don   t do any of  those things, but I do this.     I would say the turning point for me was when I entered into graduate  school, and this was two years before coming to OSU. I   m in graduate  school and I can really remember   and I   m still at my alma mater. I   m at  Missouri State University, so I can remember just feeling like I can   t live  like this anymore. I know that this isn   t healthy and I know this isn   t the life  that I want. Things really began to slow down a lot for me. I really began to  try to deal with some of the things. Now I didn   t do it willingly all of the  time.  I think there were situations that really kind of pushed me to that. One was  when I was like in just a real severe depression. My family was a wreck. My  mom is worse, she   s not getting better. At this point my family   s kind of  fragmented and then also again just life stuff. So I   m like twenty-two, just  broke off like one of the most important intimate relationships that I had  with my boyfriend. We were engaged, so that was a whole other thing. Yes,  and so all of that entering into grad school. I was a basket. I was like a  wreck.  At that point I remember going   I really don   t know what happened. I was  just so tired. I was so depressed. I remember I got a knock on my door,  because at that point I was just like,    Oh my gosh. I just want to kind of end  it all. I   m so tired, I   m so tired of this.    This guy came, and I had  remembered seeing him on campus and he was like,    I know you don   t  know me and I know this is totally weird, but I believe that I just needed to  come and knock on your door.    I was like,    This is so weird,    right? He did  not know me at all. When I say not know me, when you   re on campus and  you see people, but like we weren   t like friends or anything like that. He was  just like,    I want to take you somewhere. I want to take you to this   I feel  like you   re hurting and I just want to take you to a place where I think you  13  could get some help.    I was just like   at that point I   m like crying. I   m like,     Who is this guy and how does he know my life?     He ends up taking me to, at that moment in my life, the most random place  ever   to church. I   m sitting in this pew like,    Why am I here? Why did I  meet him here?    I truly believe that was the start of me letting go of  everything. Me letting go of this need to be a good package even though I   m  like breaking apart on the inside.    I have to look better, I have to do more, I  have to this, I have to do that, I have to      despite what my family is, I had  to be the one that achieves and all of these things. That was huge for me.  At that point I   m twenty-three. I   m like, okay, I   m like   it   s like this  spiritual awakening occurred. I get saved. I   m like,    Yes, I can do this  I   m  going to change     Change is hard, and it   s long. I think every single process  is that. At that point, those two years of being in Springfield and being in  graduate school I think was really helpful for me, because though I got  significantly heavier I think instead of trying to like work it really hard I just  settled into it. I was just like, because    I can   t worry about exercising  because I got to worry about my soul.    I went into therapy and just really  tried to work on some things. Became really active in my church and again,  because I never do things halfway, when I   m committed I   m very much  committed. I started doing outreach programs for young women, hosting  Bible studies in my home and on campus. I   m just always so plugged in.  Beginning to do prayer ministry through my church and get trained in all  those amazing things.  Again, I think even with that it came a point, after I   d done that for a year I  was like    I   m noticing a pattern. I do a whole lot and then I burn out. Then I  do a whole lot and then I burn out.    Again, like I think just moving into  more adulthood. At that time I   m about twenty-four, twenty-five. Again, I  mean graduate school was much harder than undergrad, but I did well.  Graduated, clearly. (Laughs) It was difficult. I didn   t do as well as I would  like, but I did fine. I had a 3.5, so I feel like that   s good enough. (Laughs)  It was around that time when you   re supposed to   I was done with graduate  school, I had my masters in Higher Education/Student Affairs. I had an  emphasis on young adult development. I knew I was like,    You know what?  I was always the one in high school who   s always involved, and in college.     I was like,    I should just get paid for it. I should just get paid to do what I   m  already doing.    So I   m trying to find a job in all of these things and at the  same time working through just so much.  I had the opportunity to work in a TRIO program at Missouri State  University. Like I said, my title is Coordinator of TRIO Student Support  Services. TRIO is a national program. Ours happens to be housed here, at  Oklahoma State University, but there are a number of programs throughout  14  the United States. I was at the one at Missouri State. I loved it, I fell in love  with it. When the job was open here I was like,    I   ve never really heard of  Oklahoma. I   ve never really heard of Stillwater. I   m just going to do it.     At that point I   m at a much healthier place, still not physically healthy. At  that point when I said I had settled in, I had really settled in and I was  probably pushing close to 300 pounds at that point. I had a lot of chest  issues. I could remember not being able to walk like a good consistent five  to ten minutes without my leg going numb. I would bend over and try to tie  my shoe, and I would be literally out of breath. Again, while my mental  health got much better, physically, I guess I just didn   t have the energy to do  both. I was like,    Okay, maybe I just need a new scenery and a new place.     At this time, I   m feeling way more grounded and I   m able to deal with  things that I wouldn   t have been able to deal with before, in the past.  I applied and I remember I got a phone call from my now supervisor, Jesus  Raygosa, and he was like,    Hey, you know we saw your resume and are just  calling to give you a phone interview.    I   m like,    Okay, great     I had the  phone interview and he was like,    You know what, we really like you. Just  come to campus and see if you like it and see if you would want to call OSU  your home    or whatever. I was like,    That   s kind of strange,    because jobs  really don   t happen like that. It   s more of a process. I was like, okay. I came  here and I stayed at the Atherton. The Atherton is beautiful, first and  foremost. I had like kind of a higher floor and I looked out and I saw     because when you look out you can see kind of like   just, it   s just green. It  was beautiful flowers and I was like,    This is just so nice.    I was like   and I  just felt a peace about being here. I said,    Okay, I think this is it.     I had other job offers, in Colorado   in Colorado Springs, which was really  nice. Again, I was like,    I   m not sure,    but I settled into Oklahoma. I   m like,     You know what? It   s such a good first job.    I love TRIO. I love the  opportunity to help first generation, low-income students because that was  me. My parents didn   t go to college. No one went to college. I didn   t even  know what that was. So being able to do that for other students, I was like,     Yeah, this is right up my alley.    I was just like,    Okay, I   m going to do it.  I   m going to come here,    and I get here and it   s different. It is different from  St. Louis, (laughs) but I had to find my way and that was a struggle during  the first   I would say the first semester.  But second semester that I had gotten here I was just like,    I should be  healthy.    It was just really random because I was like,    You know what?        I was like,    I have nothing to do here, because I had no friends.    (Laughs)  Like at all. What is helpful is I   m a part of a sorority so you get to kind of  have that, but even still I had no friends. I was just like,    Maybe I should  start, I don   t know, being healthy, I guess.    That   s kind of how it started and  15  then again I tried a little bit during the first semester and it didn   t quite work  as well, but that second semester     So I was here on campus, I want to say that was around 2013, 2014. I had  gotten here then and I remember that January   I said,    Well, I   m not going  to focus so much on my size,    because I   d been there, done that, crashed and  burned. I don   t want to focus too much on the scale because I had been  there, done that, crashed and burned. I said,    You know, I think I   m going to  something a little different.    So I entered into my health journey with a fast.  I did a twenty-one day Daniel Fast because I said,    You know what?    I said,     I really want this to be different. I want this to be life-transforming for me.  I want to be healed, like, through this process. I just don   t want to lose  weight. I want to really have something I can hold on to. I want to adopt a  totally new lifestyle,    because I had been skinny and I wasn   t happy. I had  been big and wasn   t happy. Then super, super-di-duper fit and I wasn   t  happy. I   m like,    It   s not the scale and it   s not the number size. It   s  something different, what is it?     I had begun to pray and then after fasting for the twenty-one days I said,     Okay, I am just going to take it day by day. I   m not going to worry about  some plan, or some       I mean there are so many things. Like you could do  the Atkins Diet, you could do   oh gosh, so many. You could do Weight  Watchers, you can do this, you can do that, and I had tried all those things  and it did not work for me, at all. I still had the issue of the yoyo-dieting and  the binge eating and all of those things.  I think being in this space, because it was new and I felt like I could really  reinvent myself, because no one really knew who I was. Then also being in  an environment where I   m now in charge of helping students grow and  develop. I wanted to make sure I practiced what I preached. Some of the  things we do with our students is called Individual Plan of Action. They  have academic goals, but they may have personal goals. With those personal  goals we really strive to move them from where they   re currently at to  where they want to be. For some students it   s,    I want to be healthy, I want  to spend more time with family, I want to do those things.    We encourage  that. I was like,    I   m going to see if this really works. I   m going to practice  what I preach and I    m going to this for myself.    That was a personal goal,  not to lose any weight per se, but it was really just to continue on with my  healing.  When I first started my health journey here, it was really easy. I would just  go to the Seretean Center, kind of walk on the treadmill. I didn   t really try to  do anything too crazy. I would lift some weights, but that was pretty much  it. I would just kind of go home. Then the eating came after, so I would  strive for just balance. I love French fries. I eat French fries probably like at  least once a week. That   s at least. Probably more like two to three times  16  because I love, love French fries. It   s not something I   m willing to give up. I  began to do that. I began to make sure I   m adopting those things that I love,  because having a small fry is enjoyable to me. I really do, I enjoy it and I  appreciate it. Now, having ten small fries probably isn   t the best. But having  one is really enjoyable. I was very mindful to do those things and to keep  those things that I liked.  I was also mindful to love myself enough to say no more. That was hard.  Even now I still struggle with that a little bit. To love myself enough to be  able to enjoy the things that I like without shame, without guilt, without fear  that    Oh my gosh, I   m going to gain a pound, I   m going get another  cellulite. I   m going to do whatever,    but then to also love myself enough to  say,    You know what? This is enough. One donut is enough. I don   t need  two or three.    That balance is so hard, but it   s that balance that I strive for  and I believe it   s that balance that keeps me grounded. I definitely  incorporate it.  Again, it was very much a spiritual journey because a lot of what I did   like  I quoted a lot of biblical scriptures, just about the power that I do have to  make really good decisions for my life. Again, maybe one day I don   t do so  well and to not sit in that, because sometimes I think we get stuck in our  failures. We get stuck in what we didn   t do, we get stuck in yesterday. I  remember reading something and it talked about how God is not the God of  yesterday. You won   t find his presence there and you won   t find his  presence tomorrow. You will find him in the present because that   s why we  call him I am, because he   s here. He   s right now. I only have power for right  now in this present moment, so I can   t worry about yesterday. I have no  power over it. Yesterday is done and gone. I have no power over the future  because I don   t know what it holds, but today   I have it today. I can really  press in, I can make that choice.  I started to slowly learn that victory wasn   t in the scale, and victory wasn   t  in my pant size, but victory was in every single choice I made. Victory for  me became the fact that I got up at six o   clock and I walked. I walked for  thirty minutes. That was a victory for me. That was so helpful just re-changing  how I thought. Again, it was such a struggle, because that   s just  not me. I   m all or nothing, like I   m in it or that   s it. To find that balance  daily, and it   s a daily thing. I was just like,    Okay.    That first semester, I  guess that first year, second semester of that academic year that was really  my goal. Was to just be mindful and make every day good choices.  At that point people had begun to notice a little bit, unlike the other times  that I had lost weight and became healthy. This one was different. I didn   t  lose it very fast. It took over three years. (Laughs) When I say that, I am  happy when I say that. This is a size that I can maintain and I feel good.  That   s what matters to me most. I think that I   that first semester it was just  17  really about adopting a new lifestyle. I think the biggest thing that I wished  that   and now my friends are like,    How do you do it?    I   m like,    Time. It  takes time.    So much time. Again, it   s like the every single day choice of  just considering yourself and loving yourself and saying,    I am enough to  put the fried chicken down for right now and I am enough to get a kale salad  or fix it in a way that I know I would like.    I think that was the biggest thing  for me.  So moving into the, I guess it would be that 2014, 2015 year. So the second  year that I   m here I became a little more intentional. I was just like,    Okay,  well this is great.    You know what happens when you reach a certain  exercise level. I wanted to explore. At this time, I was probably about  twenty-five or thirty pounds lighter and I felt more comfortable doing  different types of exercises. Before, when I was almost 300 pounds, me just  literally walking up my steps and to my office and walking back was a  workout. That was it. And again, it was being very comfortable in where I  was.  I would see girls, and guys, and kids, and college students, and they would  be sprinting on the treadmill and lifting all of these weights. My journey  really   it really incorporated being okay with where I was, really not trying  to do too much.    This two incline and this three-point-five speed on the  treadmill is enough for me,    and that   s okay. Even then it takes   it took a  lot to overcome that, because I wanted to sprint, because they just look so  healthy, right? It was really interesting to see that shift for me and how I  really battled. Again, it went back to every choice. I   m like,    No. You are  not there. You just need to stay here and coast.    At that time, I had lost a  little bit of weight.    I said,    I want to do something different.     Then I saw there was the Cowboy Challenge. I said,    Oh, okay.    It was  sponsored by the Seretean Wellness Center. I applied and I think the director  was Eric. He contacted me and he was like,    We   d love to have you     I went  and I joined that. That was super fun. Then I was able to see how exercise is,  yes, about moving, but it can also be really fun doing some different things.  I learned totally different workouts and then doing that for a semester really  changed my body structure. It was high-intensity, but again, I definitely kept  it to where it was manageable for me. I got a lot out of that program because  they coupled it with nutrition.  I thought, again, I was doing well because I wasn   t eating a lot, and then not  eating, and then eating a lot. I kept it pretty consistent. The registered  dietician in the Seretean Wellness Center said,    Hey, you know what,  Bianca? I   m surprised you don   t get bored. You eat the same thing every  day.    She was like,    And sometimes towards the end of the night   why  don   t you add some variety? Do some things you really wouldn   t do.    That  helped me so much and then also to see   I would tell her,    I   m trying not to  18  each French fries.    She was like,    Eat French fries. Enjoy it because there is  no really such thing as bad foods and good foods.    Now there is such a thing  as nutrient-dense foods and nutrient-rich foods versus foods that may not  have as much nutrients, but she was like,    That   s okay.    I began to get  educated.  So then again we go back to really not having the words to explain or  describe. A scare deficit that   s really what it was. It made me think. So after  you know, meeting with the dietician and also I think my time in counseling  that   s when I realized that I had an eating disorder, which is why I think I  did decide not to do any exercising and really just process through that. That  was awareness right there. That was the teaching of skill. It made me think  back, I said,    Why didn   t I know this? Why didn   t anyone say this?    Then I  started reading a little more literature about it, and there is little to no  research done with eating disorders among African American women. That  is kind of a nonexistent thing. When there is   when you do interview  women about it it   s like,    That   s just not what we do.    On the media just in  general, I don   t see that. I know this may sound silly, but when you go look  at a Lifetime movie or something like that, I don   t see women that look like  me that say,    Hey, I have an eating disorder. Hey, I have bulimia. Hey, I   m  anorexic.    So those words were absent in my life.  Also things like depression and anxiety. There were no words for those  things, to describe that and I understand why. Because again, in my  environment and my community, there were things more pressing like you  need to work, you need a job, you need food. That   s it. That   s kind of like  what that was for us. I think that, really, having the skills added to my health  journey because again, I was able to then identify language, and words, and  associate my eating patterns with my overall mental health. They   re very  much connected. When I   m happy I tend to eat a certain way, when I   m sad  I tend to eat a certain way. Again, I think that   s huge. I think educating  yourself is really huge. Self-awareness is huge. I think self-compassion is so  huge.  Being with the Cowboy Challenge was very, very helpful for me in terms of,  again, educating me on    Who says that it   s a bad food? Who says that you  can   t enjoy a burger?    If you want a burger and you eat it in moderation  coupled with your healthy lifestyle, like who says that you can   t? Just really  chipping away at those lies and social things that people   that I think we, as  a society, kind of put on ourselves and on others. So after the Cowboy  Challenge I was like,    I can probably do more different things     Again, it  became,    What can I explore?    It was never really about,    Oh, I was like  this and I want to get smaller. I want to get tiny,    but it was just about,    I  want to try new things. I don   t want to be limited by what I feel like I can or  cannot do physically. I want to try it.    I end up doing group training, which  is really fun and we got to learn different things with our group trainer and  19  I   m still in that. That was fun. This was the summer, we went into the  summer of   I would say that 2014/2015 year.  Then we went into the 2015/16, year, which was the last academic term.  That was a really huge time for me, because this is my third year and of  course now, at this time, people are noticing. Like,    You look small      (Laughs) I   m going to tell you, outside of going to the Cowboy Challenge  and when my trainer did pre and post-tests, I never weighed myself. Ever.  That   s not what it   s about. I never measured myself. I never did any of those  things.  I did track my food because, again, that was part of being mindful.  Sometimes I noticed that I   d mindfully eat or I will unmindfully eat or  unmindfully don   t eat. Me tracking it kind of encouraged me to be  responsible. That   s really what it came down to. To be responsible for what  I   m putting in my mouth. Not judging it, not saying,    Ooh girl, you  shouldn   t have had that Snickers.    But saying,    Okay, I had it. That   s okay.     Not to focus on that one thing because sometimes I   let   s say I would have  a Snickers and I would be    Oh my gosh. My health is over     Like literally it  would be kind of that all or nothing thinking, but riding that out would say,     Okay, I had a Snickers bar, but I woke up and I put kale in my omelet,  okay?    (Laughs)    And I had egg whites     Again, and looking at it from the  big picture and not focusing on those failures, what we deem as failures. But  like I   m a whole package. Yeah, I like a Snickers bar every now and again  and that was really awesome   and being okay with that. So I did do that and  that was very helpful for me.  Moving into this year now everybody   s like,    What are you doing? Oh my  gosh  I didn   t even notice that you were getting so fit     I tell them like,    It  has taken me three years to do this and it wasn   t easy,    and there were times  where, man, I kind of fell off and I went back to that restriction and  bingeing, restriction and bingeing, but I knew it. I knew it now. Like I knew  I was in that place and I was like,    I don   t want to stay there.    Instead of my  yoyo-dieting spanning for months, it may only span for a weekend or it may  only span for a week. It still occurs, and that   s okay. Now I am equipped  enough to say    Okay, how am I feeling? Do I feel out of control in an area?  Do I feel a lack of conscious and how do I work through that?    I think that  that is the major difference and I don   t ever think that there   s a point   one  of my friends said,    You   ve arrived  You look great     There was never a  point of arriving. I just think it   s this really big, long journey of health, and  self-acceptance, and healing that I think is just all intertwined.  I decided to run a half-marathon. I   ve never done that before, never thought  I   d be the person to do that because that is hard work, let me tell you. I ran  the Memorial Run. Everybody was like,    Did you?    I really did. It was an  amazing experience  It was hard and I   m not sure if I   ll do another one,  20  (laughs) but I so enjoyed   but again, I think my whole thing is like,    I don   t  want to be limited by what I can do. I always want to explore further  opportunities.    Now, I   m trying to learn how to swim. I think I want to do a  triathlon. I want to run, bike, you know and swim. It   s just always like new  things, but now I know I can just train for this one thing. I don   t have to  train for this and do some other stuff. Again, it   s about just those lifestyle  choices I think is the biggest things   support and help.  Now I have friends that are mindful and when they see me   and especially  when I   m training for something like when I was training for my half-marathon.  Again, about my personality, I research everything. What are the  foods I should eat, how often should I eat them? They were like,    Hey, we  were just noticing that your eating pattern has shifted. Tell me what   s going  on with that.    All of those things were so helpful, and I can   t say that it was  one thing, but I will say that it was a combination of things. It was a  combination of support.  Again, I came to a point where I stopped doing it for other people. I came to  a point where I stopped doing it because I wanted to look like something on  a magazine that I would never look like because I can   t Photoshop every  day. (Laughs) I came to a point where I was like,    Man, I am enough. I just  want to be the best me ever.    If I never lose another pound that is okay. I am  still loved, I am still beautiful, I still have so much to give, and I   m going to  operate in that. I   m going to operate in my strengths. I   m not going to  operate in the fact that    Oh, I can   t get this roll to leave anymore.    I   m not  going to do that. I think that shift came and again, that shift took three years.  It   s   and I think that   s the biggest thing.  Now, as I look back I   m like,    Wow     I think if you would   ve interviewed  me when I first got here this would   ve never came out of my mouth, and  now I think that this whole process and this whole journey has shown me so  much. I think it   s complicated, I think it   s messy, but life is complicated and  messy. You just kind of, again, continue to make that choice, because  victory is in the choice. I tell my friends that all the time, especially the  friends that are trying to get started on their health journey. I   m like,    I  promise you, the victory is in me. You woke up, you put on your tennis  shoes.    That is a victory because I want to lay down. I want to stay asleep.  The fact that I got up, I put on my tennis shoes, and I walked out my door  (even if you just walked for fifteen minutes), that is a victory.  The victory is saying,    You know what? Instead of having five pieces of  chicken, I   m going to have two.    That is a victory and that should be  celebrated. It shouldn   t be minimized, it shouldn   t be,    Oh I can do more.     We live in a culture that says,    Do more. Work more. Exercise more.    No,  those small modifications add up to something so huge, and I think because  we live in a culture of instant gratification it   s like,    If I do this new Atkin   s  21  Diet I can drop thirty pounds in thirty days.    (Laughs) Okay, you could, but  is that long-lasting? Is that healthy? I think that that is, I guess in a nutshell,  my story and my journey. I hope that   I   m telling people things that I wish  other people had told me. I think that   s the biggest thing.  I am mindful. When I see my friends, or my students trying to lose weight  and I   ll see them in the gym and they   re wearing these Saran Wrap suits and  clothes. I   m like,    Okay, let   s talk about this. It   s okay if you feel like you  need to do it,    because some of them train and they compete and I get it, and  I totally understand, but I think creating spaces where we can talk about  these things, and creating spaces where someone says,    Hey, it   s not really  about the number on the scale, but it   s about how you feel.    Again, being  the best that you could be. We only get one body and so I think that   s kind  of what I learned. I   ve beat up my body enough, so I   m trying to love on it a  little bit more. (Laughs) Sorry. Do you have any more questions?  Finchum How does your grandmother     Boyd Right  Oh, I didn   t even think about this. I didn   t even think of my family.  Okay, my family   wow, did not even think about that. The reactions of   so  my family, because they   ve been with me for twenty-eight years now, they  know that I   m just up and down, up and down, up and down. But they have  so commented on   they   re like,    Bianca, this is the longest that you   ve  looked great consistently,    and that has really catapulted them to being like,     You know, I think I   m going to exercise a little bit more. What are you  doing?     And of course, oh gosh, my grandmother is so amazing. She comes   and  again, and I love it. It   s just something so amazing about being in those  really small towns and I get in there and she   s like,    You look like Ms.  Hollywood     She   s just so sweet and then she   s like,    Let me cook you  something to eat     (Laughs) I   m like,    Oh no     By the time I say that, she  already has a pound cake and all these things. She   s whipping up all this and  I   m just looking at her like, trying to be polite and trying to eat as much as I  can. But no, she   s definitely a supporter.  And again, I think   going back to the educational piece. I don   t think it was  ever taught to us what a balanced meal looked like. I think they were just  staple family foods. We   d have meat, and mashed potatoes, and maybe some  peas. No one ever really talked about superfoods like kale, and spinach, and  quinoa. That was absent. I never saw kale in my house, never saw spinach in  my house, never saw any of those superfoods in my house. Then it made me  think,    Wow, where are we lacking?    in my family anyway, and in my  community, because that wasn   t even   I never even knew that as an option.  Finchum Me neither.  22  Boyd Right. But I have seen the transforming effects of eating them daily and  implementing them in daily into my diet. Now I have the opportunity to     like when I go back home my grandma is just so sweet and she   s like,     Okay, what do you have for me today?    You know, coming back in. You  know Arkansas isn   t far from Oklahoma at all. So I   ll bring her avocadoes,  and she   s like,    I love these     Every time I come she   s like,    Get me those  green things.    We   ll have grapes, and I   ll make breakfast, like my kind of  breakfast. She loves it and every time she   s like,    Bring me what you eat.     She still cooks a feast, but for me she   ll be like,    We   re going to bake some  chicken, okay?    And I   m like,    Yes  That   s great      Being able to talk to her about diabetes and all of those things. She   s cut out  like starches and she eats wheat. It   s just getting those small things and to  see how when I stopped being about weight, weight, weight and I started  being about holistic health and then allow the process to occur, how it  transformed like my family so much. I go home now to see my mom and her  diet has completely changed. When I go in it   s stocked with fruits, and fresh  vegetables, and hardly anything is frozen.  She eats better than me, like she purees everything. I   m like,    Oh, Mom I   m  going to go buy applesauce.    She   s like,    No, I got it. I got this.    And she   ll  get an apple out, and she   ll cut the core out, and she like churns her own  applesauce. Like super organic  Totally on a whole other level that I am not  on. I remember we were talking and at first it   d be like,    Bianca   s coming  home, so I know she eats healthier,    and she   s like,    and then when you  would leave there would be stuff leftover. I just started eating them. I like  them and I feel good.    That was cool.  Finchum Did you have home ec in high school?  Boyd I did.  Finchum They didn   t go over nutrition?  Boyd No, not really. We did a lot of sewing and making things, but not necessarily  health. I did have a health class in high school and in college. But at that  point it was just about passing the class. I didn   t care to put two and two  together.  Finchum So these days what do you typically have for breakfast     Boyd Okay, so for breakfast   typically my breakfast looks like   I   ll have a  protein smoothie and it   s vegan based. Because I just prefer a more plant-based  diet now. I have vegan protein and then I   ll add in   I like really thick  and hearty shakes because I typically eat right after my workout. I don   t like  23  having a huge breakfast right after I   ve been jumping up and down and no,  that doesn   t bode well for me. I will put kale, and spinach, and some hemp  protein in it, and almond milk. So that would become my breakfast  smoothie   I mean and a banana. That   s kind of what that looks like.  Shortly after, because that is a smoothie, it is not a meal, it is not a meal  replacement. (Laughs) I don   t care how   I don   t care what the box says, in  two hours I   m hungry. I   ll probably have maybe   well, depending on how  my day is, I will probably have some quinoa with a slice of avocado. I might  do a meat maybe, maybe not. It really depends on where I   m at. That   s  pretty much how my breakfast looks. I have real meals and sometimes I try  to do the egg whites, but since going on this journey I   ve noticed things that  just work well for me and things that don   t. Dairy is not my friend at all. It  just makes me bloated. Okay, no. Also, animal-based products aren   t as     poultry is fine, but just kind of noticing that about me.  Yeah, my breakfast smoothies are a staple. I always have them no matter  what, but then I definitely try to   for me, vegetables are hard. If I can drink  them I will. Anytime, especially when I make smoothies, I   m like,    Let   s do  two cups of whatever kind of green thing I can find.    Because I need  something that   s quick, and that   s really quick. When I   m more intentional I  do try to have a grain like quinoa. I try to have fats, because fats are really  good and good fats are even better. Avocadoes are a huge staple. Nuts are a  huge staple. Sometimes, depending on my stomach, I may have an apple and  almonds with hummus and vegetables. That   s kind of the in-between,  midday, you know, not necessarily breakfast, not necessarily lunch, but I   ll  have that kind of midday.  And so for lunch I have, again, try to get in grains. So I   ll have some type of  grain or some type of vegetable. Maybe it   s just saut  ed bell peppers and  onions and that   s all I can do. Because time is of the essence and if I can cut  two vegetables that is a win for me. I   m cutting that up and I may have that  with tilapia and then I might have another type of vegetable or side with it.  Or like mushrooms because mushrooms are easy. I don   t have to cut it up, I  can just throw it in. I use mushrooms a lot because I   m like,    Oh, great. I   ve  got a vegetable and I don   t have to do much.    So I   ll have bell peppers, and  onions, and mushrooms saut  ed with tilapia. Again, it   s getting that variety  in. Then of course I have to have chocolate. I have chocolate every day. I   ve  done good, and I have dark chocolate. That was hard. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s very hard, yes.  Boyd What has worked for me with the chocolate is I   ll do dark chocolate, but it  has to have something else in it. So I   ll do dark chocolate with cherries  infused in it or dark chocolate with almonds or   it has to have something. I  can   t do just plain dark chocolate. It will sit and sit and sit in that house and  24  collect dust, and I don   t know, do other weird things because I won   t eat it. I  always make room for that. I always make room for my favorites. If you  have like a favorite, favorite thing, I always make room for it. Again, I go  back to French fries. I am probably at Chick-fil-A at least one to two times a  week to get a small fry. It   s typically after work, because I kind of want to  de-stress, and I go in, get my fries, and it   s heaven. It   s heaven in a little  white bag  (Laughs) I love it  I always   I   m very intentional about making  room for that.  Finchum Do you still write everything down?  Boyd You know, no. I do it when I   m feeling a little tired and then I   m wondering,     Am I getting enough vegetables or what am I missing from my diet?    At  one point I was getting tired and I noticed   I said,    Well, man, like I eat so  much during the day that by the time I get home I   m really not that hungry  and then I go to sleep.    Then I have to wake up at about five thirty to go  work out at six and that   s nothing. That means that   s a whole time of  nothing. That   s why I   m so tired. I   m like,    I need to be intentional about  eating something at night,    even if it   s like chicken and pasta. Something.  When I notice significant changes in my mood or my level and again I think  going back to your health journey should bring you into more mindfulness  of who you are. Like I know when something is out of alignment, I know  when something isn   t quite right, I know when I haven   t been getting  enough sleep, I know when I haven   t been drinking enough water because I  feel   my body will tell me. I think that   s the biggest thing about your  journey. You should come to a point where you   re like,    My body   s trying  to tell me something.     I think our bodies are always trying to tell us something. Like,    Hey, you  might want to lay off the sodas. I think I have too much sugar.    For me, that  means my head hurts, I feel a little more fatigued than usual. Yeah, I think  that that   s been the coolest thing ever is that our bodies will tell us when  things aren   t right. It   s a thing of slowing down, and listening, and being  mindful.  Finchum Quiet enough to listen.  Boyd Yes, exactly.  Finchum Who   s your biggest supporter on campus?  Boyd I think it   s   man, I think it   s so many. I think it   s like     Finchum You don   t have to name names, but     25  Boyd Honestly, I think it   s   for me, it spans so many people. I mean here at my  job like my colleagues, they   re amazing. They hired me and they always  make these jokes about like,    You   re literally not the same person you  were.    All of those things. They are great supporters for me, because  they   ve been on it from the beginning and you know they   my supervisor  and my colleague, Justin, they   re so awesome. To have them come in and to  be,    Well, how was your workout? Did you do it?    That   s pretty cool. To  kind of encourage them to kind of get on it. It became kind of a fun game to  see what healthy things I brought today. So they would be like,    So what did  you bring us today?    Because at one point I was experimenting with  everything. I had boxes of seaweed. I had really interesting things. So that  became a little fun thing for us.  That   s here at my job, but in terms of   my friends have been awesome,  awesome supporters. Especially the ones who really know me and the ones  who are really saying,    Okay, like I   m checking in. Where are you at?  Where are you at with your workouts? Where are you at with your eating?     They confront me. They say things like last week I was with a friend and we  were at Nagoya, we   re eating sushi, and I just ordered one sushi and I had  edamame. My friend turned to me and she was like,    Okay, where are you  at? I noticed that you didn   t eat a lot.    It   s not like,    Hey, you did that.    It   s  like,    Okay, I just want to see. I want to check in with you because I know  that you can get busy or       I know sometimes I   m so keen on eating a  certain way for a certain type of race or something like that that I get lost  into other things like am I really getting enough and all these other things.  They totally keep me accountable.  My workout group I think has been awesome. Let me tell you, I have had  personal trainers and I did not go, and I paid for them. (Laughs) It is easy for  me to skip out on my personal training sessions. It is easy for me to skip out  on my running training sessions because it   s by myself. I rarely have ever  missed a group workout session. We have a group text, we encourage each  other, we cry, we pray for each other. That has, I think, in terms of the  consistency in exercising, that has been tremendous. It   s just something  about it. I work out hard when I   m with them versus when I   m by myself,  because when I   m by myself I do ten pushups and I   m done. The warm-up, I  feel like, is the workout.  When I   m with my group it   s just such this level of high-spiritedness and  sisterhood. I get so much from that. When it   s five thirty and I   m like,    I  don   t think I   m going to make it.    They   re like,    Get your butt up, you   re  not doing anything. You   re just sitting in the bed. Come on     I get there and  I   m like five minutes late and I just hop right on in. That is so, so huge.  Because they also have been on this journey with me at least for the last year  or so and that has been so huge. They were there when I crossed the finish  line after doing my first half-marathon, just cheering me on. We   re all  26  crying and tears coming to our eyes. They   re like,    We remember when you  couldn   t run at all,    (laughs) and so now I   m doing this. That has been huge.  I will also say, again my church family has been really big because they  always remind me to bring in the spiritual component of just overall health  and understanding, and knowing that I have to nourish all parts of me.  Then also I would say OSU, and I can   t speak for other campuses. I have  only been to one other campus other than this one. I would say the wealth of  free resources that you get here as a student and then also of course as staff  and faculty is tremendous. Even when there is a cost to it to have a program  for three months where you   re getting personal training in, being able to  speak to a registered dietician   like, I don   t know where you can find it.  That is expensive. Three personal training sessions is three hundred dollars.  To be able to take advantage of programs like that and to have it readily  available is so huge. Again, I think that maybe people would do it if they  had access and if they knew. I never knew there was a right or wrong way to  working out. I never knew any of those things. All of those things were just  so supportive for me.  Finchum Do you think you would   ve gotten here somewhere else?  Boyd I don   t know. I really don   t. I would like to say I hope I would   ve gotten to a  point     Finchum Maybe not as quickly.  Boyd Exactly. I think everything just kind of fell into place. I remember my  colleague saying,    Man, isn   t it so awesome that you came here and you  were       Again, that   s what I was thinking,    I don   t know if I would have  gotten this anywhere else.    At my school it wasn   t like this big push for  wellness. We had it, like we had an amazing recreation center. We had all  the things I think OSU has, but the intentionality of reaching people and just  saying,    Okay, you can do it,    or,    You should do it and sign up and do  these things.    I think the spirit of OSU is definitely one of wellness. I would  say I, for the most part, my students drink water. I can see and everybody  has like their water container. Wellness is such a huge thing here, and it   s  convenient. They stay open so late and they   re open as early as five thirty in  the morning. I don   t know who would want to get here any earlier than that,  because I   ve been here that early and it   s hard. The fact that they stay open,  I mean like all of the conveniences that you   re afforded.  Finchum What   s next on your goal list since you   ve done the half-marathon? Are you  going to do the Boston someday?  Boyd Oh, no. I am thinking about doing the Tulsa 66 half-marathon in November  and then I would like to eventually start training for a triathlon because I  27  would like to bike and swim as well. I haven   t done those things yet. I   m  definitely afraid of swimming, but that   s why I   m going to do it because  why not? I   ve done all these other things. I honestly would love to do the  Memorial Run again, but I think I   m going to do a different race in the  spring, and I   ll probably do the Go Girl Run for women empowerment.  I love the Memorial Run. I   m just going to do a really free plug, if you can  do it, do it. It is amazing, it is awesome. It is a life-changing event and  experience. After running it I said,    I would never do a half-marathon just to  do it. It always has to be connected to some cause.    To see those people out  there saying,    Thank you for running for my child  Like you running, you  signing up for this race means they   re not forgotten.    I was just crying, I   m  like I can barely breathe and I can just see the beautiful posters and the  people coming up to me handing water and saying,    Thank you so much.  For just running. Just for remembering my husband, my daughter, my  significant other.    I was just like   it was so overwhelming.  Finchum How many miles did you run?  Boyd Thirteen-point-one. It was long.  Finchum How long did it take you?  Boyd Two hours and forty minutes.  Finchum At a consistent pace or were you just kind of     Boyd I was doing whatever I could do. Sometimes it was a limp, sometimes it was  a walk, sometimes it was a good steady jog. Sometimes I don   t know how I  got there, I just know that I did. (Laughs) I was like,    I   m here  I   m here      Again, that   s why I want to do a few more. I know there   s a finesse and  there   s a way to do it. My thing was I just need to   at one point I said,    I  may have to have someone roll me. As long as I just keep moving.     Finchum Get two fries that day.  Boyd Oh, you know I did. Yes, I did  I did not work out for a week. I slept. So if  you ever just need a good sleep, you do that. You do that ten-point-one  miles and you sleep like a baby.  Finchum How many are in your group? Workout group?  Boyd Right now, typically there   s been five to six. Yes, I think that   s how many  we have now. We have four this time so we have a smaller group. It   s  been   and the people tend to be consistent. We always tend to change out  one or two other people. Even when some of our members can   t come for  28  whatever reason that they may be more away that semester, the others we  stay in the group. We still have the same group chat and group messaging.  Finchum Switching topics a little bit. You said you were the first in your family to go?  First generation to go?  Boyd Yes.  Finchum Did any of the other ones follow you?  Boyd My little sister, yes. She is going to the University of Pennsylvania. I   m  really proud of her. She is going to be amazing and she   s going to do  amazing things. Yes, she is the next one.  Finchum Are you working on an EdD or PhD, or what?  Boyd At this point I am working on my second master   s degree, in counseling.  Okay, so I never thought that I would do that. I was   because my next step  was I   m like,    Well, maybe I should get my PhD,    but I fell in love with  counseling because of my own journey and two, it   s really what I do here. I  got my master   s degree in education. I don   t really utilize that as much as I  utilize therapeutic techniques. I really love that and I have adopted a new  passion of reducing health disparities among impoverished populations,  because there   s a huge disparity in terms of educating, in terms of access,  and so   and in terms of delivering services. The way that we deliver service  to our rural population might look a little different if we go out to Oklahoma  City and try to promote health there. It   s really understanding the culture  and being able to deliver those services in an appropriate way. That   s kind  of my new goal and I think this is where I   m going to stay.  I   m really excited because I   ve just been awarded a fellowship. So I   m a  fellow for the National Board of Certified Counselors, so that is what I   m  charged with as a fellow. I   m charged with reducing mental health  disparities on my campus. Any pockets of students that may not have had  proper education and training and just experiences. So we   re working on a  way to reduce that here, which I think is really cool, and I feel like all of that  is what I really want to do.  Finchum Your journey has been fascinating.  Boyd Thank you  This has been so awesome, and to talk about it is so therapeutic.  I   m thinking,    Man, I didn   t say that. Oh my gosh.    To see how all of those  things put me where I am today and ultimately what I get to do now through  my fellowship and with the National Board of Certified Counselors.  Finchum And find a way to teach others how to be mindful. That is not an easy thing.  29  Boyd It is not. Let me tell you, I try to do it daily, but there are moments in the day  where I am not. When I am running from one meeting to the next, when I  have things to do I   m like,    What is edible in front of me?    Or sometimes  I   m so busy that I   ll just kind of forget and I   m like,    Okay,    then my body  will give me a signal and I   m like,    Okay, body. We   re going to slow down.  We   re going to stop. It   s going to get done, but it doesn   t have to get done  now. I need to go and take care of myself.    Maybe that   s just some deep  breathing, maybe that   s just some water. Maybe it is I need to actually eat.  That has been   it   s hard. It   s so doable and again, the victory comes in the  choice, which is what I really had to learn.  Finchum Do you have a favorite quote or something that you go to     Boyd I think there are a number of things. I think I do try to stay in a space where  I am always in the present. I will say this thing,    I will never get this  moment again, so I want to sit in it and I want to cherish it.    That is one  thing. I try to use that in all aspects of my life. Granted, this is   it   s easier to  say that. It   s easier to say that,    I   m going to be mindful in this interview. I  may never have this opportunity again. This is so awesome.    I mean, oh my  gosh  It   s different when I   m sitting at my desk and I have to put in  paperwork. I just say,    Oh, I will never have this time again.    I   m like,    Oh  please let me never have this time again.    I think that   s one of the things that  I do. It has made my life richer to be in the present, to be in here and now. I  don   t know when it   s going to be the next time I see you, I hope I get to see  you again soon, but to really sit in that.  I think that comes with my   to really just be appreciative of my food, to be  really appreciative and to understand that one, there might be someone who  doesn   t have this opportunity and two, I have the opportunity to nourish my  body and I have the opportunity to feed myself. So really being thankful and  that   s what the present does for me.  Again, with exercising you know when I feel like,    Oh my gosh. I don   t  want to do this,    but just really being in the moment and really being in the  present.    And you know what? This is where I am. My body   s going to feel  great afterwards, it   s going to be awesome   afterwards.    (Laughs) I think  that that is one of the biggest things that I try to do. Just being in that space.  Also just, I think, repeating the mantra,    I am enough.    If you cut off that  tape right now and   I just made a comment to my colleague, I said,    Justin,  oh my gosh  I almost ate a whole rotisserie chicken yesterday.    I   m like,    It  took all day, but I kind of nibbled on it all day.    Then at the end I was like,     There   s not a lot of rotisserie chicken left     I think just deal the same,    I am  enough.    Hopefully not, but if I gain twenty or thirty pounds,    I   m still  enough.    Right now, where I am,    I am enough.    I say that often. I say, you  30  know,    I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.     Philippians  4:13  So I think I pull from a number of different things.  Finchum No tattoo that says,    I am enough   ?  Boyd No, I   m not a tattooer.  Finchum It seems like OSU was a very good match and good both ways.  Boyd It was, oh gosh.  Finchum Because you   re sharing what you have learned     Boyd It   s been an amazing match for me. It really has. The support here and just  the opportunities here has been just totally amazing. I honestly don   t know if  I would have been able to do what I do and would   ve been able to be in the  space that I am now. Don   t know if I would   ve been able to get the  fellowship. One of the reasons why I was awarded the fellowship is no one  is really doing this in Oklahoma. That   s one of the biggest pulls and draws.  They   re like,    We are so excited we got someone from Oklahoma, because  we   re trying to get people from the fifty states. We   re excited that you were  interested in partnering with us.     Definitely, I think OSU has afforded me so many opportunities and it   s just  been very awesome. I   m just so thankful for everybody that   s came in and  helped, that sent an encouraging email, that   tell me,    Hey, you should  think about trying this  Hey, do you want to do this?    So yeah, it   s been  awesome.  Finchum America   s healthiest campus, that   s what they   re aiming for.  Boyd And they are. I will say that they are. I definitely would say that because it   s  definitely encouraging, it   s an encouraging atmosphere. It   s not one that   s,  you know   they don   t force you, it   s not   it   s definitely holistic. Even in  their approach. Even in the wellness, the Seretean Wellness Center, it   s like  eating, and it   s like yoga, and it   s like sleeping well, it   s like all those  different things. I would encourage anybody if they don   t know where to  start go to the Seretean Wellness. They can talk to Cindy, who sits at the  front desk and she   s really nice, because I ask her all the questions and she   ll  get you plugged in. She   ll get you a place to start.  Finchum We should probably say how much you   ve lost.  Boyd Yes, so I have lost now   oh gosh, I don   t even   at the time I first did the  first interview I had lost a hundred pounds since being here. I came here fall  of 2013 I want to say. I have lost a hundred pounds since then. Probably a  31  little bit over, after the marathon because that really   like yeah. At this  point probably roughly about 115 pounds.  Finchum Almost another person.  Boyd Gosh yeah, that is another person.  Finchum But then in the other sense you   ve found the other person in a lot of ways.  It   s a win-win.  Boyd It is, and so   man, it has been a long journey, but such an amazing journey.  So any new thing that you   re doing just embrace the journey. It   s going to  have bumps, it   s going have bruises, it   s going to have setbacks, but it is so  worth it to just keep that steady pace. That   s all that I ever try to do is keep  that steady pacing, to look for things that excite me and that propels me  forward. That   s why I always want to try new and different things.  I   ve never been much of a rock climber, but I   m going to take some classes  and learn how, to see if I like it. That may not be   like I   ll try things that are  not my thing, like Zumba. (Laughs) I   m just all   jump, dive in, and just  enjoy life. Life is so short and just dive in and be plugged in and be present,  be in the moment. And just again I would say it all goes back to enjoying  every single victory that we have and whether that   s in your health, in your  career, in your relationships, that   s all I wanted to do. It   s just been so  helpful for me.  Finchum I think this will be helpful for others, too.  Boyd I hope so  And it doesn   t matter where you   re from. Clearly, I came from an  impoverished background where we really didn   t know a lot about health,  and about fitness, and it doesn   t matter whether you have an eating disorder  or if you   ve been big all your life. Change can come, change can come.  Finchum I very much appreciate you sharing your journey with us.  Boyd Yes, definitely.  Finchum It   s been a pleasure.  Boyd Thank you so much, this has been awesome.  Finchum And you were awesome.  Boyd Thank you   -------  -------
