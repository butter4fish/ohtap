 Gill. Today is April 25, 2009. I   m visiting with Robin  Ventura on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-State Stories Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Robin, thanks for taking  time to be with us. I know you   re a special honoree at the Posse Auction  today, is that right?  Yes, I am, and happy to be so.  Great. When was the last time you were on campus?  It   s been awhile. A lot of things have changed. I was a little confused  walking around here, but it looks great. It   s probably been seven years,  maybe, six or seven years.  What   d you think of the new Boone Pickens Stadium?  Wow. There are a lot of buildings; that   s probably the biggest and best  one.  Well, I think while we   re on that, one of the questions I want to ask you,  you played in the quote    new    Allie P. Reynolds Stadium.  Yes.  Did they share with you plans for the new baseball stadium?  I just heard about those, that they were going to tear down Allie P. and  move it over to another section they have over there. But, yes, that   ll be  exciting. That   s something that, you know, they need to move up and get  better facilities just to compete in this league.  5  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Help attract Regional Tournaments as well?  Yes, absolutely.  Well, let   s start with your early life a little bit. Can you tell us a little bit  about your family and where you grew up?  I grew up in Santa Maria, California. I have three brothers. I have two  older brothers, Randy and Rick, one younger brother, Ryan. Basically,  just one of those households where we just played sports all the time,  and my dad coached baseball. He loved baseball and coached my older  two brothers, so I was pretty much a tagalong most of the time and  probably cried if I didn   t get to go, but fortunately they let me go. So, I  just played a lot of sports, following them around. Went to Righetti High  School. I played basketball and baseball in high school, and then from  there I came to Oklahoma State.  Were you a pretty good basketball player?  I was alright for our era. I mean, for just a skinny little six-footer, I was  okay, but nothing special.  Did your teams have some success in baseball when you were in high  school?  We did, we did. We had a really good team when I was a sophomore,  and from there it extended. We went to the semi-finals in our division  when I was a sophomore, and then my junior and senior year we had  decent teams. We were pretty good. But I mostly played shortstop in  high school, which out of necessity I was put there. I wasn   t your typical  shortstop, but I played shortstop and pitched a little bit on occasion.  What was your best pitch?  My best pitch? Oh, it wasn   t very good. It was slow, I know that.  (Laughter) It was something slow.  Did you have an out pitch?  I didn   t have an out pitch. My goal was to throw below hitting speed.  That was what I tried to do. (Laughter)  Well, speaking of family, Robin, did you learn some values from your  family growing up that influenced you the rest of your life?  I think so, with my dad, the way he coached and even the way he  6  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  worked. He was a bread salesman and would get up at 3:30 every  morning and go to work, and he   d be home probably around 5 and that   s  when practice started. So, he was a hard worker.  Put in some long days, then.  Yes, he put in some long days. I think seeing that and the way he still  had a passion for baseball when he got home, for us to go and play. And  he liked things to be done a certain way. He didn   t like showoffs and he  didn   t like people that didn   t really enjoy playing. I   ve always enjoyed  playing, probably another reason why I didn   t show a lot of emotion all  the time, but still enjoyed it.  Talking about coming to Oklahoma State, what influenced you to come  to Oklahoma State University?  Well, I mean, they gave me a scholarship, and I had a few opportunities  to walk on at some other schools. University of California-Santa  Barbara, and UCLA and some other California schools I could   ve  walked on, and about that time of making those decisions, Oklahoma  State called and I don   t remember exactly the circumstances, but I know  somebody had signed a pro contract that had a scholarship, so they were  looking for another infielder and I ended up being that guy.  Were you fairly highly recruited with other teams that you recall?  Not really. I mean, I had a chance to walk on at these schools, but I  wasn   t getting a scholarship. And when Tom Holliday called and said,     Why don   t you come back and take a look?    I had taken some  recruiting trips to the other schools, and once I came back here and saw  what was taking place at a game here, I mean, this was back when they  were drawing 3,000 people and Pete Incaviglia hit a home run every  time he went to the plate. They were playing Missouri when I was here,  and they put a thumping to them, but just the energy of going to the  games and seeing what was taking place and getting to watch them on  ESPN. They were on ESPN every year going to the College World  Series, so I was excited. I mean, I was sold from the minute I was here.  That   s great. I want to ask you a couple questions. First of all, for a  California boy, it must   ve been a little bit of a culture shock coming to  Oklahoma.  Oh, yes, absolutely.  (Laughs) Where   s the water?  7  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  I mean, my area I grew up in is a little, it   s a farm town. We   re not in the  L.A. area. We   re in between L.A. and San Francisco. So, there was a  little bit of similarity of being a little country that I was familiar with,  but the first time it turned cold, that was the first time it hit. I still  remember walking out of Bennett Hall, and it was a clear day but it must  have been about twenty degrees, because it hit me like a ton of brick and  put me right back in my   I only had a light jacket, too, being from  California.  You didn   t pack any coats, huh?  No. I didn   t pack too many coats. So, I had a new rule: I either had to get  a bigger jacket, or I wasn   t going to go to class. I had to get a bigger  jacket.  I   m sure Coach Holliday didn   t tell you about the winters, either.  No, they didn   t tell you about that snow.  What was your first impression of Oklahoma State University,  physically, looking at the campus?  Well, it   s beautiful. You come in here, all these brick buildings, and  when I came it was really hot, so it was a good time of year. Everybody  was out walking around, and it   s just a beautiful campus to be able to be  on and walk around and know where you   re going. At that time, we  didn   t   you know, the football stadium was right there, baseball,  basketball. It was a lot of fun to get to know the guys in the other sports,  so it was a pretty close-knit group.  Where did you live?  I was at Bennett Hall for my first year. Beautiful Bennett Hall. They  liked the baseball team to stay there so we could get over to the field in  case it rains so we could tarp the field. So, they wanted us pretty close.  And then my next years, I lived on, I believe it was 123 Husband Street.  And if I was driving around in the right place, I think I   m right across  from Panera Bread right now. (Laughter) It   s directly across the street.  It   s the second house in on Husband.  Aside from baseball for just a minute, what do you remember about  some of your student experience at Oklahoma State? You know, classes,  campus hangouts?  Well, we had a lot of   the early years, I just remember getting to know   people , because I came here not knowing anybody. So, you get to  8  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  know people. I know your son Derrick, and friends of the ones that they  had were pretty nice to the guys that played baseball. You get to know  those guys and get to do different functions with them, but baseball took  up a lot of time. So, most of that stuff in the classroom, that   s where you  got to really see and meet people. Baseball wasn   t   we didn   t have the  ability to get into the Greek system or anything like that, so we were  pretty much isolated onto that field year-round.  What do you remember most about Coach Gary Ward?  Oh, I remember the first day walking out there, it was pretty well  understood that this team was going to make it to Omaha. I remember  there being a lot of people, and the first day is a little fuzzy on how  many people were there, but I know there were a lot of players out on  the field and I was quite nervous, just where I stood. You know, trying  to figure out at that age what was held in store for you, because there  were five people at third base and five more at shortstop and they were  all over the place. Luckily, I just played and didn   t think too much about  it. But he was pretty confident as a coach where we were headed, what  was expected. I still remember that, just day-one of,    You   re going to  work hard, you   re going to do it hard, or you   re going to go home.     What do you feel like was Coach Ward   s greatest attribute as a coach?  He just had an attitude, he was a motivator. He was a good teacher, too. I  mean, he had a way of teaching hitting. But teaching you how to win  games, I think, and just certain games, it didn   t matter what was  happening and what game we were in or how many runs you were  down, he had a way of making everybody feel like we were going to win  this game. You   re going to figure out a way to win this game. And that  was really something that you don   t know if you learn it, but you did  learn it by playing for him.  Do you remember some of his famous dugout rally meetings?  Oh, I don   t know. He had a lot of   his were quick and just to the point,  and I think it was his assuredness that this was going to happen, this was  going to take place.  Pretty intense guy, huh?  Yes, he was very intense and he meant business. I mean, it was well  known that we didn   t shake hands like all the other teams. You know,  the NCAA may shake one hand. He said,    Hey, when you   re in war and  you   re going after somebody, you   re not always going to be wanting to  shake hands.    You could shake one guy   s hand and get back in the  9  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  dugout and be ready to go. But he was intense. As soon as you got on  the field, it was a work area. It wasn   t the field. When you get to the  work area, be ready to work.  Robin, you   ve been on some pretty special OSU teams, and, as I recall,  your teams   was it, let   s see    86 through    88?  Yes.     86,    87,    88 teams, and won three Big Eight Championships, made  three straight appearances in the College World Series     We didn   t make it in    88. Two of them.  Two of them, okay. And lost to Stanford in    87 in the Championship  game?  Yes.  Pretty tough loss, wasn   t it?  That was a tough loss. They say you get over those things and you learn  from them, but when you work that hard and you get that close,  especially since Coach hadn   t won one at that time, it was a tough one.  We had a really good team. We had a great team the next year, too. I  thought we had a chance to do it. We ran into a little bit of a buzz saw  with Wichita State, but    87 was a tough one. We had a really good team  and we just came up short.  What was the atmosphere like at the College World Series? Was it pretty  special?  Yes, that was a time   ESPN was just starting to really cover those  games. I think all the games   before, it was some of the games were  televised, but about    86 on, all the games were televised with ESPN. The  stadium is nothing like it looks now. I mean, it was a minor league  stadium, but it was great for us. You get to go there, there were big  crowds, and it was exciting. Coach Ward dropped us off   I think we  were going to Iowa State, and we stopped in Omaha purposely to get  out, and they opened the gates and walked us in and pointed at the field.     This is where we   re going to be, so just prepare yourself that this is  what you   re working for.    And it was a great place, I mean, it still is. I  get to   I   m lucky enough to do some work for ESPN and cover the  games. And it   s exciting. The kids are still excited when they get there.  They have that same look and it   s fun to see that.  10  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Kind of that deer in the headlights look the first time?  Yes, it   s a deer in the headlights, but then it   s a big grin because, you  know, it   s a lot of fun.  Robin, the two years you were at the College World Series, do you have  some special memories, some special highlights or moments?  Well, the year we made it to the final, we had some great games and just  the people. There was people that had great games to get us on to the  next round. Marv Rockman was saving games and Adam Smith was  making, Jim Ifland, Pat Hope had some great games as a pitcher. I mean,  there   s more. I don   t remember personal things, but it   s like, in my head,  I see flashes of people and what they look like and what they did. Those  were just fun times. I mean, there   s really nothing else going on for a  nineteen-year old kid. That was your world at the time.  Going back to some of the season games, in regular season games  during the year, were there some special series or games that stand out  in your mind?  Well, usually, the OU series was always a big one. I, again, you get  flashes of them, but we   d play at the old    89ers stadium for one of them.  Whether we played down there or up here, one of the games was always  at the Triple A park, which would have about 10,000 people, so those  were always exciting, fun. But it was just the atmosphere around the  games. A lot of the wrestlers would sit above the other dugout, so the  atmosphere around our games was fun. They were fun to play in; they  were fun to come to. The other athletes supporting other sports was  always fun.  Was    87 the year of the Streak?  Yes.  We refer to it as the Streak, but that was when you had the 58-game  hitting streak?  Yes,    87.  Can you share some of how you felt during that time, some of the  highlights?  Well, I didn   t originally think too much about it. I think the first time I  even thought about it might have been at thirty. I   m not quite sure on the  numbers of what game it was, but I do remember being at Kansas. We  11  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  were playing against Kansas, and I hadn   t gotten a hit going into my last  at-bat and I was on deck and I didn   t think really too much about it.  Everybody said,    You got to get a hit, you got to swing the bat, you  can   t walk.    I didn   t really think about it, and someone said,    You got  like a thirty-something game hitting streak.    Like, oh, okay, right,  whatever. So, I do remember it being a full count and my last at-bat and  somebody saying,    You have to swing; you have to swing the bat.    I  ended up getting a hit, and then after that it started getting a little more  press, which was good for our team. I mean, we had a good team, and it  was fun that we all got a little recognition because of that.  As I recall, there were some comparisons made to Joe DiMaggio     Yes, that   s a little farfetched.  ..saying you were both California boys and     Yes. That was a little farfetched. They tried to make that comparison but  obviously, Joe   s was a little more difficult than mine was. (Laughter) A  little higher level.  Let   s see, you finished your collegiate career at OSU with some pretty  amazing statistics. .428 batting average, .792 slugging percentage, 302  RBIs you saw in three seasons. That   s pretty spectacular. Also, you were  All-American, I think, three years that you played, winner of the Golden  Spikes Award, and the Dick Howser Trophy, the Best Collegiate Player  in    88, your last season. You were out there with five guys playing third  baseman. Did you have any   I mean, obviously not this good, but did  you have any expectations that you   d have that kind of career?  No. No, I mean, honestly I remember just getting to play for the first  time. We went to Las Vegas for a tournament, and we were kind of  sputtering as a team and I remember Coach asking,    Are your parents  going to be here?       Yes, they   re coming over from California.    We had  a weird lineup that day. I think he was just shaking it up, and I happened  to have the best two weeks I   ve ever had in my life, and that   s from any  point, from or beyond. It was just I couldn   t get out. It was just one of  those things that happened for me and he had come probably two weeks  later and said,    Freshmen don   t play all the time, so don   t expect to play  a whole lot.    I was happy because I at least got to play, but after that  point he just kept sticking me in there and I stopped thinking about it. I  was just excited to play. I do remember, it hit me a little odd that I had  called home to talk to my parents and my brother got on the phone, and I  was in a pretty good streak and he said,    Well, how   d it go today?        Well, we got a double-header. I hit two home runs and about eight  RBIs.    He goes,    You know, you told me that three days ago.    I said,  12  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill     No, but it happened again today.    (Laughter) And he goes,    Do you  realize what you   re doing?    I said,    No, not really. I don   t think I want  to, either.    I think the more you think about it, it probably would   ve  affected me, but just to be able to put it out of your mind and play, it was  probably more Coach Ward   s philosophy of    Just play. Live in the  moment and play right then.     It sounds like to me you actually surprised yourself a little bit.  Oh, yes.  Because your high school career wouldn   t have, perhaps, projected you  to have been that good that quickly?  No, I mean   yes, I was a good high school player, but we were in an  area that wasn   t heavily recruited because we were too far away from  L.A. or San Francisco. So, we didn   t get a whole lot of scouts coming  into our area. And not a lot of people played from there, so I didn   t have  any expectations that I was coming in here, like anything was given to  me. So, I was pretty happy to get a uniform, pretty much.  (Laughs) Well, in that era, too, you mentioned some names earlier. You  played with some special players.  I did.  I think Monty Farris, Pete Incaviglia, several of them. Can you, perhaps,  share some of your thoughts on some of the guys you played with?  Yes, Pete was a year before me. I came in after, really, the greatest  offensive player. I don   t know about the pitchers, but for a hitter, he   s  the greatest set of numbers of any player that ever played. And to come  in here, I didn   t expect anything, but I knew there was a lot of good  players because it was a good program. You know, my first year, we had  Rob Walton, who   s now a coach at Oral Roberts. He was one of our  pitchers. Joe Giordanella, Jeff Bronkey ended up playing in the big  leagues, and Jim Barragan was our first baseman, Sergio Espinal, just  really good players, but had a lot of fun and played hard.  Was Monty on that team with you?  Monty was there, yes. Monty and I played our freshman year. We were  freshmen, left side of the infield, which     Did Monty play a little bit of pro ball?  13  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Oh, yes, Monty played. He was drafted by Texas. He played there for a  few years and then was with the Marlins for a few years. I   m trying to  think of who else we had.  Three or four guys on the team played major league ball.  Yes, and then the next couple of years we had Jeromy Burnitz was my  junior year. We had Marv Rockman was a great reliever. Now, they   re  closers but he was the guy that we depended a lot on because we scored  some runs, we had to have somebody to stop them. So, he did great. Jim  Ifland, another guy from   we had a lot of guys from California. I don   t  know how they did it, but we had quite a few guys from California. So,  we had some special players. Had Burnitz coming here and Brad  Beanblossom had a great career here. I   m trying to think who else we  had.  I wanted to ask you, also, you played on the    88 Olympic team, and I  think, as I recall, you hit like a .409 average.  I don   t know. I   m going to take your word for it.  Okay, I was looking in the record book.  That sounds good enough for me. (Laughter)  .409 is good. Where were the games played?  Seoul, Korea.  And were there some key memories or moments, on and off the field, in  the Olympics?  Yes, I think we had a great team. I mean, I think the    84 team was a lot  of names that went on to have great pro careers, and they were labeled as  the best amateur team ever. Our team was a little different. I mean, we  had some names that people would know later, but at the time we were  kind of a ragtag bunch that just played hard. And Mark Marquess was  our head coach.  Stanford coach?  Yes, he coaches at Stanford, still.  Well, you guys won pretty handy didn   t you, most of those games?  I mean, it was a long summer. They call it a tour, but you basically  14  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  play   I think we were together for nine months and played. There were  a couple different tournaments, one in Japan, actually two in Japan, one  in Italy, the World Championships. But we would tour around, play  Triple A teams, Double A teams, and players that people know. Jim  Abbott was our number one starter, Andy Benes, Ben McDonald,  Charles Nagy, Tino Martinez was our first baseman, Tom Goodwin was  our center fielder, Ed Sprague and I split third base and DH, Mickey  Morandini and Dave Silvestri were our short stop, second baseman. It  was just a really good team. I mean, it was, all the way around, a really  good team. We played Japan, and Hideo Nomo was the pitcher for   he  was young at that time, but I guess we all were. (Laughter) Tino  Martinez hit two home runs in the gold medal game. And that was just  something special to be able to   at that time, baseball never even  crossed my mind that I would even get a chance to be in the Olympics or  to be able to win a gold medal.  Robin, was it special to play for your country?  Oh, absolutely. I think everybody on that team took that to heart. It was  personal, and we just had a good bonding team that understood what it  meant to play for the United States and represent your country. But, I  mean, we played hard, that team. I don   t ever remember a game that  everybody didn   t come off giving absolutely their best.  Well, I   ve got to ask you this: Where do you keep your gold medal?  I have it at home in a little case. My kids don   t really notice it that much.  Every once in a while they   ll look at it and,    That   s really a gold  medal?    I   m just Dad. (Laughter) So, believe me, there   s a lot of,     That   s really a gold medal?    I   m like,    Yes.     Well, in 2006, I believe was the year, you were a member of the first  class inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame. Do you recall  some of the other members that were inducted with you?  Skip Bertman was a coach. There was Bob Horner, Dave Winfield, Will  Clark. I   m trying to think. One, two, three, four   That   s pretty good.  No, there was a lot of   Ron Fraser was coach, Bobby Winkles was  well-known. He started the Arizona State program, so again, just one of  those things where I   d sit up there and scratch my head. You just look  around and see who   s up there. Bob Horner you   ve heard forever, and  just at that time, Pete, I think we both probably would   ve been in it at the  same time, but he was still playing so he wasn   t eligible. But he   s since  been inducted. But just mind-boggling, it just makes me laugh.  Who presented you?  15  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  At that time, they didn   t do     They didn   t have presenters?  No, they didn   t present. They had a guy and you went up and did a little  talk but, you know, it was special to just sit there and think of all the  people. I mean, there   s a lot of kids that have played college baseball  and coached people. Cliff Gustafson was in that group, too. So, it   s  special. I mean, people act like,    Well, it   s not the Baseball Hall of  Fame.    Hey, you know what? I   m pretty happy with that.  Absolutely. Well, kind of shifting gears to your major league career,  citing some statistics, you were drafted tenth by the Chicago White Sox  in    88, played nine full seasons, and came up September, but a full nine  seasons, I recall. Three with New York Mets, two seasons with New York  Yankees, and then ended with L.A. for two years, is that right?  Right.  I know that injuries later in your career kind of slowed you down and  hampered your career, probably shortened it.  It is what it is.  Yes, but you have some pretty special statistics. I   m reading through  here, in your sixteen-year career, you played two All-Star games, won  six Gold Glove awards, hit eighteen Grand Slams. I could go on and on.  I   m going to take your word for it.  So, I guess I just want to ask you, can you give me your thoughts on your  major league career?  Is there  anything you remember about it as  special?  Can you  share some highlights with me?  I just think every day you get to a point   I think people sometimes look  at professional athletes that they feel entitled and I really never felt  entitled. I just felt like I was lucky to be able to do it. Even just driving  into the ball park was just amazing, that I actually have this opportunity  to play professional baseball, which was always a dream as a kid. I never  thought it was ever going to happen. Just like even coming to Oklahoma  State, I would   ve never thought I   d be able to play at a big university  and then actually get to play for the White Sox. But it was fun. It was the  time of my life. I married and all our kids were born in Chicago, and  even going to play for the Mets was fun. I got to play in     Yankee Stadium for a couple years?  16  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Yes, I got to play for the Yankees for a couple of years. I played in the  Subway Series where the Yankees played the Mets, and the Yankees  were in the World Series.  So, you played in the World Series with them that year?  With the Mets, yes, in 2000. I just feel lucky to be able to have. I think  some people expect,    Well, it wasn   t the greatest career ever.    It was  pretty good for me. I mean, I wasn   t very fast. I wasn   t very strong, so I  had to make do with what I have, and I played hard. I think I was lucky.  I grew up   my last year I played for the Dodgers, and I grew up a huge  Dodger fan in California and I honestly, every day, driving to the ball  park couldn   t believe it. The one thing I wanted to do as a kid was to  play for the Dodgers. I was playing as a backup. I wasn   t even playing  every day and it was still the best time I ever had.  I know the aluminum bats, first thing, but other than that what are some  major differences between college ball and pro ball that you recall?  Well, I think, the one thing you   ll realize is there   s not a whole lot of  bunting around in professional baseball and most of it, for one, guys  don   t like to do it because you   re getting judged on what your numbers  are. So, you know, people want to have numbers. In college, a coach is  in charge of what   s going to take place. Even though it is in the pros,  everybody still has numbers they want to achieve. One thing you   ll  notice about college baseball is it   s very unselfish and they   ll move guys  up, bunt them around. And that   s really the part of the game that   s lost  when it goes to professional. Not everybody knows how to bunt, not  everybody wants to get a guy over, because it   s giving yourself up for  the next guy to get a RBI and that   s hard to find a team in professional  baseball that will do that, even though the ones that win are the ones that  do that. They do those little things to win, and you   ll find teams like the  Minnesota Twins, even though their payroll is not very high, they   re one  of the teams that they   ve always done it since I can, since I got into the  league and even now. They will move guys over, they will do the small  things to win a game, and they do it right. In college, that   s really where  it starts out. It   s a very unselfish   you know, as Coach Ward always  said,    You   re in charge of your own swing and keeping it honed and  productive,    but he   s the one that makes the decisions on how it   s going  to be used. So, it   s a very unselfish game in college and I just still enjoy  watching it.  Again, I want to give you one more opportunity, with all the highlights,  there   s some walk-off homers you had different times. Are there special  highlight moments that stand out in your mind in your career?  17  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Well, there was a few. I think I had a playoff game with the Mets that  was fifteen innings that ended on a home run and I   just the  circumstances that present itself. Everybody ran out of the dugout and  they didn   t see the ball go over the fence. I got stopped at second base so  I was really only credited with a single, but     Home run single?  Yes, it   s a home run single. So, that   s always a   anytime I   m in New  York, that one   s usually brought up.  Wasn   t that a playoff game?  Yes, it was a playoff game with the Braves in    99. So, there   s some   I  think every team, there were some fun things that just, they   re like  snapshots in your brain that come up every once in awhile.  Where are you living now?  I live in Arroyo Grande, California.  That   s close to your hometown?  It   s about twenty miles, yes, it   s about fifteen, twenty miles from where I  grew up. My parents still live in my same hometown. Brothers live  around me. So, a lot of family, a lot of nieces and nephews, and it   s a lot  of fun.  And you have your family now     Yes, I have four children. Rachel   s sixteen, Madison is fifteen, Grace is  thirteen, and Jack is ten. And it   s busy.  Is Jack an athlete now?  Yes, he enjoys everything, and I don   t pencil him in or just pigeonhole  him into one sport. I mean, I enjoyed playing everything growing up,  and I want him to, if he enjoys sports that much, I want him to play  everything.  What about the girls?  My oldest one   s about six foot, so she   s a volleyball player, plays a little  basketball. The second one plays a little basketball. Third one might be a  soccer player; you never know. She likes soccer. It   s fun to be able to  coach. I   ve coached their teams in the past since I   ve been done. It   s  18  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  been fun. This is my second year in doing little league, so it   s still fun.  Full circle there. Started off little league, now you   re back to little  league.  Yes, absolutely.  Do you stay in touch with some former players? Do you guys  communicate any at all?  Yes, every once in awhile. I did a radio show with Jim Traber the other  day and I got a lot of text messages from     Sports Animal?  Yes, did The Sports Animal and all of a sudden my phone lit up.  Everybody with the new texting and everybody does that. I actually live  very close to Tom Keffury who went to school here and pitched. And so  him and I, I see him weekly if not daily. He has a daughter, and my  second daughter and his oldest daughter, actually, have gone to school  together since first grade. So, we have our own little Oklahoma State  bond there. Then Troy Osborn who wrestled here probably a year before  I got here, he actually moved into my area; just a weird coincidence. So,  his kids go to school with mine. So, it   s nice to have a little orange in the  area.  You need to start an Alumni Chapter. (Laughter)  Yes, exactly. Exactly.  Do you guys have any thoughts for a reunion? You know, the 1959  NCAA Championship team was here last week.  Yes I saw that, I saw that.  We interviewed twelve of those guys, by the way. Joel Horlen was one of  them interviewed.  Was he?  And those guys were excited. It was like kids with a hand in the cookie  jar. They had a great time. Have you guys had any thoughts of a  reunion?  No, I don   t think so. I mean, tonight they told me there   s a few people  that I played with, I   m interested to see who they   re going to be. But it  19  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  would be nice. I mean, it was a neat time. College is just a neat time in  your life. It was the first time for me, I was on my own. You   re getting  to know new people, and figuring out what you like and don   t like about  people, this, that. There were some great bonds that were formed just  from playing baseball, being here, being by yourself. I   d love to see  some guys I played with.  Well, have you kept up with OSU baseball over the years?  I have. For a while there, I mean when Tom was coaching   well, Coach  Ward was still here, and then Tom, and now since Frank   s taken over,  I   ve now gotten a little more into it because of doing the ESPN work.  I   m looking forward to them making a good run, getting a Regional or  Super Regional, see what happens.  They won in the ninth inning last night and they led Baylor seventh  inning last week, so maybe they   re coming back.  Yes, I know they were up there pretty high and then they dropped out.  But this year they   ve got a pretty young team that they   re trying to figure  out still. I   d rather them be good at the end than good at the beginning  and fade. I think at the end of the year when you go on a run, that   s  when your rankings really start going up. So, hopefully they can get on a  nice little run, here, for the rest of the way.  Well, what do you think about the current baseball program and Coach  Anderson?  I think he   s done a fine job. It   s a different environment than when I  played here, and it   s a little tougher I think. His facility, obviously they  have plans to build a new stadium, which will help. I think everything  the University is doing is going to help all the programs with, obviously,  their athletic facilities getting better. But there   s a lot of other schools  that have done that before us and that   s really what   s booming them  ahead. He   s a good coach and I think, eventually, given those same set  of circumstances, he   s going to have it back up as a top program.  Well, Robin, your time at OSU, as we were talking about earlier, was a  special era in OSU baseball, and you   re still fondly remembered by  many of our OSU alumni and fans. Do you still feel a special bond with  Oklahoma State University, and does OSU bring back some special  memories for you?  Yes. Oh, absolutely. That was one of the things of playing in  professional baseball is you could be at a stadium somewhere and you   d  just see a speck of orange on, or out of the whole crowd you could just  20  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  see one or two people in some orange and say nice things and yell  something out, and that   s always there. I think being in this state, and I  actually played for a lot of teams that were like this just by coincidence,  but we   re kind of the underdog. There   s something that you rally behind  and have a bond of being that underdog. I   ve gone to Oklahoma State;  you kind of feel like you   re the underdog a little bit and you have that  attitude. I played for the White Sox which, in Chicago, is the underdog. I  played for the Mets, which is another underdog. You get that enough  and there is a bond that is always there because of that.  What is it about OSU that   s special, do you think, that you yourself and  other alumni are so loyal to the university?  Again, I think it   s that feeling like you have to stick together to be the  underdog and, you know, it   s not always going to be roses, but you stick  together and eventually it   s going to be. It   s well on its way but I think  you, from people that have seen and for me, especially now coming back  here and seeing what has grown here, what is being built is   it makes  you swell up a little bit.  I know you   re humble and you wouldn   t say that, but you   re very special  to Oklahoma State University. How do you hope OSU people and fans  will remember Robin Ventura?  I don   t know. I mean, I think people have always been encouraging and  nice to me. It was a different time. I think, at that time, to have a  program that was like ours was a source of pride for the University. I  think Coach Ward had built that, but the players got the benefit of it. But  I think that   s really where it came from is it was just a source of pride.  We had a winning tradition; I think I benefited from that. I don   t know  exactly how, just that I enjoyed being here. I enjoyed everything about  it.  Hard-nosed player?  I don   t even know if I was hard-nosed. I mean, we were good. We had a  lot of hard-nosed guys, but I played hard. I don   t know if it looked like I  was hard-nosed, but we just enjoyed putting on our uniform and having  Oklahoma State on the front. We totally enjoyed and embraced that.  Can you share with us some of the things that you   re doing now, in  addition to your little league coaching?  Yes. I do some ESPN work for TV; I do color at the end of the playoffs.  When the playoffs start, I do a Regional, Super Regional, and then I   ll  be doing two weeks in Omaha. Looking forward to doing an Oklahoma  21  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  Gill  Ventura  State game one of these years. But it   s fun to be able to do that. I enjoy  doing the college games. Coaches are great, the kids are great, just the  excitement that that end of the year brings up. It still gets you inside and  takes you back, and makes you feel young to be able to be around it. So,  I enjoy doing it. I still do some work at the White Sox and the Dodgers  every once in awhile if somebody   s sick or they can   t make a trip for  radio or TV. They   ll give me a call and I just fill in. It   s fun to be able to  fill in, especially the White Sox. All the guys that I played with are  coaches and front office people, so it   s fun. Now I get to see  OSU  alum  Josh Fields, so that   s always good.  Well, Robin, gosh, first of all I want to say thank you for taking time to  visit with us and be here. Thank you for coming back to your alma mater  and helping out with the Posse function tonight.  I enjoy being here. Yes, this is going to be a lot of fun.  Is there anything else you   d like to mention? Anything we left out or  didn   t cover?  No, you got it.  Alright. Well, thanks Robin, appreciate it.  Okay.  -------  -------
