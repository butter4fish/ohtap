 Gill. Today is April 13, 2010. I   m visiting with Dr. Lee  Manzer on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project which is  part of the Oklahoma Oral Research Program. Lee, thank you for taking  time away from your teaching and classroom assignments to be with us  today.  Thanks for asking.  Lee, as I thought about it, you are OSU. You have three degrees from  Oklahoma State University.  I do.  Including a doctorate in marketing through certain OSU faculty dating  back to the 1970s. You   ve won nearly every teaching award offered by  the Spears School of Business. You   ve coordinated outreach and  extension programs through the college. You have spoken to alumni  groups across the state and this region. You   ve worked the official score  of the game day crew and OSU basketball for how many years?  I   ve done that about twenty-some-odd years and also have been the  official scorer for a length of time.  And we could go on. So my first question is, why do you love OSU so  much and why have you been so engaged with constituents of the  university for all these years?  My wife and I were raised in Oklahoma. I was raised in the Osage,  which is up northeast of Tulsa   a small town. In fact, people like to call  the Osage the Great Osage. My wife was raised in Seminole. So we were  educated here. I came to school here. Actually, I went to school a couple  5  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  of years and dropped out of school by choice and went back to  Washington D.C. and started matriculation in Washington D.C. for a  couple of years and came back and got the degree in chemistry. Stayed  and got my master   s basically in finance. Then, went to work for the  Dow Chemical Company and we traveled all over the north and the east  and the south.  But I always wanted to teach so I thought it would be nice to teach  people who were interested in what you had to say and I thought that  was college students. To do that you have to have a terminal degree,  typically. So I applied a right  number  of places and actually got called  back to OSU to get a recommendation, and they had just started the PhD  program. A guy named Wayne Meinhart, who was the head of  Administrative Services and who was here for a long period of time,  asked me if would like to come to school here, so he made me a deal,  financially. I had children, so I was an instructor when I came back. This  was in January of 1970, so I finished the degree and went to Memphis  State, now the University of Memphis, in    73 and came back in    75. So,  an answer to your question, we have a long history of Oklahoma and  with OSU. I   ve been on faculty thirty-five years and have taught as a  graduate student three and a half years and went to school here eight and  a half years. My wife and all my children  have gone here .  Sandra and I are pretty flexible. We could have lived any place. We had  opportunities to do all kinds of things, but we wanted to come to  Oklahoma. We loved Oklahoma. Oklahoma in many ways is a very poor  state. There   s no doubt about it. I mean we have some petroleum and  some agriculture, but it   s a very poor state, but it   s not poor in people.  Almost anybody that I know, the vast  number  of people that come here  will comment on the fact of how great the people are. They   re just great  people. We had this natural love and our folks are here. My folks are  here and my wife   s folks are here, but we love this state and want it to  do well. I guess it   s because of our history and our background. In fact,  what   s interesting about it is our three children, all grown children, all  live in Oklahoma with all our grandchildren, so it   s our home.  You were talking about your family; can you share a little bit about  where you grew up? You said in the Osage.  Yes.  A little bit about your family life?  Background? When was I born, my mother was forty-three years old and  my dad was forty-nine years old. My dad was born in Missouri and he  came down to Oklahoma. My mother was born in Oklahoma Territory.  6  Gill  Manzer  She was born in 1898. In fact, her birth certificate says Oklahoma  Territory. Kind of neat.  Interesting, yes.  My dad lived until he was ninety. My mother lived until she was ninety-eight  and always had lived in a  house  and those kinds of things. My  folks raised three children in the Great Depression. They got married in  1914 and then had three children and so they raised three of the  children   there   s four of us: two sisters and a brother. They raised three  children during the Great Depression. They went to California during the  migration, the Okie migration kind of thing. I was born in California  while they were migrant workers. For six years of my life, they were  migrant workers and I was with them.  My folks were not formally educated people. My dad had four years of  formal education and my mother had 180 days, she told me. But they  were very bright people and could read and write and these kinds of  things. What happened was they joined the LDS  Latter-Day Saints   Church, the Mormon Church, and that changed their life. I don   t know if  you know much about that, but that has to do with family and education  and that kind of thing.  They realized that when I turned six I couldn   t go to school as a migrant  worker, and so they came back to Oklahoma to Hominy, actually in  Tecumseh, for a while and had a farm for a while and couldn   t make a  go of it. Then went out back to California in the fourth grade, and that   s  what I remember. I picked cotton. I picked prunes. I picked almonds.  I   ve cut grapes and cherries. To be honest with you, that   s one of the  reasons it bothers me when I teach school here and I see young people  with this great opportunity and they   re kind of messing it up. It bothers  me because I understand, coming from my background.  Anyway, we moved back to Hominy, Oklahoma which was part of the  Osage and bought a laundry, wringer washers. I don   t know if people  remember wringer washers. We lived in the back of the laundry, and my  siblings were all married and gone and those kind of things at that time.  In fact, when I was in born, I had eight nieces and nephews by the time I  was born. There   s eighteen years difference between me and the next  youngest. I was basically raised by myself. I had loving parents, and so  that   s where I was raised. We lived in the back of the laundry. In fact,  my bed was out by the cash register. Then, they bought an old one-room  house. I had really good parents, but very humble circumstances. I was  blessed with a good mind. I was very good in math and science. It was  nothing I did; I just had it. That   s why I came over here and majored in  chemistry and minored in mathematics, is because of that. So, that   s my  7  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  background until I came off to school.  I didn   t know where I was going to school. I was a basketball player.  Bryndon, my son, was a basketball player. Well, I was a basketball  player and in those days, maybe in 1959 it wasn   t a big deal. You   re  familiar with those days back then. You   re not quite as old as I am. I had  some offers at small schools, Austin College in Texas, some junior  colleges. Nobody ever thought about it. I just went off because I was a  good student. Came over here and majored and that   s how I got here.  Just happened to be close and never even thought about it. So that   s kind  of my early history and wonderful background. Loving parents. I can   t  complain one bit about my background or my parents or anything.  Great. Did you graduate from Hominy High School?  Yes, graduated from Hominy High School in 1959.  One thing I wanted to tag onto some of your comments on how you grew  up, did the principles and values that you learned growing up  stick with  you ? Can you share those and how they   ve impacted your life?  There   s no doubt about it whatsoever that yes, those values are instilled  in me, honesty and those kinds of things. My folks, even though we  were what you call economically deprived today, we didn   t know we  were economically deprived. I mean they were extremely honest and   there are  all kinds of stories regarding that, and they just had good  values. They worked hard. I believe in working hard. Even today, right  now, I   m old enough to retire from the university, but I come up on  Saturday mornings. I come up early and I still travel and those kinds of  things. I believe in getting a dollar   s work for a dollar   s pay.  You obviously learned hard work.  I learned hard work and I know how to do it. It doesn   t bother me.  We   ve tried to instill that in our family. I think a lot of people that came  on the faculty in my generation have that background, not the same kind  of background, but they have the same   when I came into this business  of education, a lot of people  are  first-generation type of college people,  so they all had that kind of thing. But I believe in it, and everybody says  they believe in it, but I really try to do it, I think. Try to. Tried to instill  that in my children, at least.  Lee, were there any other activities other than basketball that you  participated in in the community and the school?  Well, sports and stuff like that. It was  a  small school. I graduated in  8  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  1959, and it was 59 of us that graduated. So, 59 in    59. (Laughter) But I  was a good student, so I participated in those things. I participated in  plays and acting and things of that nature. Sounds bad, but it   s true.  Almost every play that we ever had, I played the lead in those kinds of  things, but I was blessed with the ability to do those kinds of things, I  think. But you know how it is;  in  small schools you had those  opportunities to do those kinds of things.  Lee, what influenced you to enroll at Oklahoma State?  It was almost just a fluke. I was thinking about playing basketball  someplace and decided not to do it. So, in July after I graduated, I had a  friend that was over here in school that had graduated from Hominy, and  so I just drove over. He brought me over and I just enrolled. Those days  you didn   t even have to have the ACT. You didn   t have to have  anything, just a degree from high school and decent grades, which I did.  I was salutatorian in our school and just came over.  What year was that?  It was    59.  What were your first impressions of Oklahoma State as a student in the  Stillwater community?  I was really fortunate. Most students when they come, they don   t get  involved in the community. But I was fortunate; I did get involved in the  community. I met, and it was primarily through church, but I met some  people who were active across campus. I was very active in church.  Guys like Jay Murray, who you may know, the Murray family came the  first time   they came in May of    59, and I came in July of    59. People  like that that were involved in the community. I participated in activities  like cleaning the city. I just thought it was a wonderful place. It was  quiet. It had about 12,000 students when I came. In fact, they had just  built the library. It hadn   t been there too long, and people were  complaining that they wasted money by making it too large. (Laughter)  The Classroom Building was fairly new. I wasn   t in the College of  Business at that time. I was in Arts and Sciences over on the other side,  which in those days they called those the Chem- Physics buildings. It  was wonderful. Gosh, I can   t complain at all. I got a scholarship that  paid my tuition. Of course, in those days tuition was six dollars a credit  hour and (Laughter) books were six dollars apiece and there were no  fees. In fact, you may recall Allied Arts. They brought big-name  entertainment to Gallagher and you didn   t even have to pay. You just  went to Kingston Trio, the Carpenters, Smothers Brothers, Bob Hope   a  9  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  couple of times. It was just a wonderful time.  So, you had a scholarship that basically paid your tuition. Did you hold  part time jobs?  No, I didn   t. I had saved some money to come. So I did that. And then  my folks, even though, like I said they were humble. They sent me  100  a month. That   s what I lived off of,  100 a month, and that paid your  room and board and bought your gasoline. It was different. Of course,  minimum wage was a buck and a half or a buck and a quarter, but I  cannot complain about my life. I can   t complain about OSU. When we  came it was just a great place to be. People were friendly. The  community accepted me and I accepted the community. It was great.  Why chemistry? What attracted you to major in chemistry?  I had a natural aptitude for math and for the sciences. Nothing I did, just  an aptitude for it. When I was in high school I had a science teacher  whose name was R. C. Cox, and this is a true story of how he influenced  me. He kept talking about when he taught at Yale, a long time when he  taught at Yale, and when I was in school I went,    Man, this guy knows  something.    And then late in my senior year I found out what he was  talking about was Yale, Oklahoma. (Laughter) It wasn   t Yale  University. It was Yale, Oklahoma, (Laughter) which is just down the  road here. But he influenced me. He influenced me greatly. And I don   t  know, just seemed like the thing to do.  Lee, do you remember some professors here that influenced you?  In chemistry, for sure. One of them is still here teaching. K. D.  Kenneth  D.  Berlin. I don   t know if you know Dr. Berlin, but I see him  periodically. He was a fantastic instructor in organic chemistry, and Dr.   Paul  Devlin. It was tough stuff, but I liked it very much and it was  really interesting. I went two years and then, like I said, I dropped out of  school and went on a church mission and decided I didn   t want to major  in chemistry anymore. When I came back, I wanted to interact with  people. I didn   t think chemists interacted with people. They do, but I  didn   t know. But I was doing really well in it, so I went ahead and got  the degree, and that   s how I got over to business was I heard about the  MBA degree. After I graduated in    65 with a chemistry degree, I went  across campus to get the MBA.  Lee, as an undergraduate, were you involved in any student  organizations or activities?  Not really. I don   t think they emphasized it like they do today. I was in a  10  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  fraternity, but it was a small fraternity and it was more like a bunch of  farm boys type of thing. It was a good experience and I learned a lot  there. I learned a lot about manners and things of that nature. I was in the  American Chemical Society, but I   d just go to meetings.  What fraternity were you in?  Phi Kappa Tau, which is still a small fraternity. It wasn   t like a fraternity  so much as a bunch of guys just living together. Things were different in  those days. No one had a car. I don   t ever remember females having  cars. That was just the way it was. Guys   I bet not one out of three had  cars. I had a car, but it was an old car that was a junker car, but nobody  had things like they do today, I don   t think. So, we were all kind of  about the same, but  it was  very enjoyable.  Lee, are there any highlights or special memories you have of your  undergraduate experience as a student or being active on campus?  Just general. I played intramural sports. I haven   t thought of this in  years, but they used to have All University Basketball. I made one of  five All University basketball players, which I thought was kind of  strange because the tourney I was in was very small and I don   t recall us  being very good, but I got a little deal, that    Top Five Player.     What position did you play?  Probably shooter or something. (Laughter)  Whatever part of the court you   re on.  Whatever part of the court I was on I was going to shoot that ball.  (Laughter)  You explained a little bit about your transition into your master   s  program out of chemistry and you went into the MBA program.  Yes.  How did that work out for you?  That was when I first became aware of this College of Business  Administration. What happened was the College of Business  Administration used to   and I   ll kind of come back to this a little bit. If  you had a marketing degree, you   d get an MS in marketing, a master   s in  marketing, master   s in accounting, master   s in management, master   s in  finance. In the very late    50s and early    60s, the MBA degree   master   s  11  Gill  in business administration, which business administration is a little  broader. Someone is going to have a broad background, and it was  designed for people who had a technical degree. That was the idea, that  you could have a technical degree and come over and get this business to  add on top of that, and then you could go out and solve all of these  problems. I heard about this and had been on a mission, and I liked  interacting with people, so I was accepted and came across to get that. I  would say this was in 1965 when I came across  it . The MBA program  in the School of Business, I believe, the first graduate was in 1961 and  they had like two or three graduates. By the time I got there when we  graduated, there was thirty-five or forty of us in that graduating class.  All of them except one, by the way, were male. One female. Talk about  things have changed, but there was one female. She went to work for the  Daily Oklahoman as their marketing researcher, and she   s still there.  I came over, and this sounds bad, but it   s the way engineers and  technical people think. When I was in school, in those days, it wasn   t  exactly this way, but over on this side of the campus is where all the  engineers and the physicists and the chemists were. Over on this  campus, it   s where all the business people were   sociology, English, the  soft sciences as opposed to the hard sciences. We that were over here in  the hard sciences knew that we were over there and the rest of them  were over here. And the reason we thought that, in fact, people still think  this today, is we were smart because we could handle this. We could  handle differential equations. We could handle this kind of thing, and  these people could not handle it. That   s why we were here and they were  there.  When I came over to get the MBA, the first business course I took was a  junior intermediate level macro economics  course. I didn   t even take  the basic course. I jumped right in, and it was just fascinating. I didn   t  realize that people studied the balance of payments, that they studied the  gold standard, that they studied transaction or motivation. I discovered  that what we thought over there was incorrect. It   s just that this over  here was different. It didn   t mean that we were any smarter or any better  or anything. It was just different, in some ways more difficult because it  was like nailing Jell-O to the wall sometimes. You know, here   s an  answer and it was just fascinating to me. I read some of this  management stuff and what not. I was reading this for the first time in  my life, not just to make a grade, but to really learn something. It was  just amazing. The transition was quite easy for me, and in those days  you had to take thirty-three undergraduate course hours, and then you  would take thirty-three graduate hours, and I did that in a year and two  summers and then graduated in the summer of    66.  So, you went in the industry after that?  12  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Yes.  Is that where you worked with     When I came back to school after my junior year, I got married to  Sandra. And so I went my senior year and we got married in    64 and  went to graduate school. She worked on campus at Wes Wyatt. Do you  remember Wes Wyatt Insurance? That   s what she worked for.  Mr. Insurance?  Mr. Insurance. That   s who she worked for. I got a little assistantship,  and we graduated in    66 and went to work for Dow Chemical, which is  the second largest chemical company in the world. Their headquarters  were in Midland, Michigan, which was two hours away from Detroit.  I   ll tell you, the time I was in the interview, they kept talking about  being in Midland, and I was thinking,    I   d like the Permian Basin of  West Texas,    and ended up north of Detroit. (Laughter) That   s how  stupid I was. But we went up there and I worked as a chemist for a  while. I was fortunate. They hired me and said I could work in various  areas, and if I didn   t like it then just to let them know and they would  transfer me to something else, which is a pretty good deal. Worked as a  chemist. I didn   t like  being a  chemist. Worked in research. I didn   t like  that, so I went into sales, industrial sales. We sold very technical  products to the pulp and paper industry. We solved people   s problems,  and we lived in Cleveland, Ohio, where our first child was born. We  moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where I worked in the carpet  industry, and Bud Seretean, big supporter of OSU, I was in his carpet  mills and      Are you with  Cornett?  Cornett. Sure am. Dow had a facility there and we provided latex, and  one of the customers was Cornett, and I had been at that mill and it   d be  him when this was there. Then we moved to New Jersey across Cherry  Hill, Morristown, across from Philadelphia. This is when I was in  industrial sales and a great, great experience. Just wonderful experience.  Great company. Had a child, and my first child was born in Cleveland. I  can   t complain one bit, but I always wanted to teach, as I said earlier,  and that   s when I had to talk my wife into it. Her life was pretty good;  she didn   t want to go back to poverty. But, anyway, we came back to  OSU in January 1970 as an instructor, through Wayne Meinhart because  I made more money. We lived in a little old house down kind of by  Hillcrest Baptist Church down  on  Washington Street (now destroyed  for the proposed athlete village) for three and a half years. Had another  child, had a boy, Bryndon, and then worked on my doctorate during that  13  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  time for three and a half years.  So you finished and was it Memphis State that you went to for a couple  of years as an assistant professor?  Yes. We left in 1974 and I finished my dissertation there that next year.  Then, in 1975 we were there and weren   t looking for a job or anything  and got two job offers. Got a job offer from Texas A M and got a job  offer from OSU. My folks were here   my folks were quite elderly at  that time. So then we came back in July of 1975. And that   s how we got  there. Been here ever since, thirty-five years.  Can I put a stake a little bit in the ground here? You were a student in  the    60s and teaching in the early    70s in graduate school. What do you  remember about the College of Business Administration at that time, the  facilities, salaries, academic programs, course offerings? What do you  remember about it, and where was it at that time?  When I came over in 1965, that was, like I said earlier, my first real  interaction with the School of Business. The School of Business was in  Morrill Hall which is now where English is. They were building the new  business building which was to the west of Morrill Hall across the street  from the Classroom Building. But all of the classes that I took were in  Morrill Hall. I believe, if I   m not mistaken, that building opened up in  1966, the building that we   re in now, so that would be forty-four years  ago. But mostly in the graduate program, I don   t know about the  undergraduate program, the graduate program was almost all male. It  was quantitative in nature. In fact, my MBA is really in finance because  I thought that   s what you would do if you had a technical degree. The  staff was small, the faculty. The departments   like, the marketing  department had three people in it, and management had three or four  people in it.  Who were some of the key professors and administrators at that time?  Do you remember?  Now, I was only there a year,    65 and    66, but Wayne Meinhart was  there, and Dick Poole was there and  John D.  Jack Wagle was there,  who is now deceased. I didn   t interact with the econ people. From the  finance standpoint, there was hardly anybody that was there at that time.  Of course, that   s been forty-some-odd years ago. It was small. But even  being small, the MBA program was a pretty good size. The MBA  program was probably 100 to 120. I don   t know about the  undergraduate.  How were the academic programs different? What were they offering?  14  Manzer  They still had some business education courses at the time.  When I came back on faculty   I left in    73 and came back in    75, and  that   s when I really got involved with everything, in    75. In those days,  downstairs where you have the computer lab, these personal computers,  that was typewriters. They taught typing. They taught shorthand.  Business education was taught in the College of Business at that time,  and the faculty, there was probably four or five people that were  involved in this kind of thing. When Sandmeyer became dean   I don   t  know exactly when he became dean, probably    78,    79. Bob Sandmeyer,  who was dean for longer and a great dean, by the way, he made a lot of  changes and one of the changes, to be quite honest with you, he wanted  to delete business education. He really thought what he wanted to do  was take it and put it into education because it was business education.  I   m not sure what they did with it, but he basically said,    We   re not  going to do that anymore.    At that time, main frame computers were  there, and here come personal computers, and that   s when it all changed.  The people that were into disciplines either left or went into  communications or something of that nature. But that   s one change that  took place right about that time.  The other thing when Sandmeyer became dean was that he emphasized  economic development, which is a big deal today. They had this center  for economic development. He was an economist by training, and he  emphasized that, and it is held to be a big deal today.  In those days, the faculty was small. It was larger than what I thought it  was in    65. This was    75. When I say small, I say fifty, sixty maybe?  You have to remember that the School of Business has economics in it.  See, a lot of schools of business do not have economics. Economics is  not a business. It is not a business discipline. Economics is a social  science like sociology, psychology. In many schools, economics is  taught in arts and sciences or liberal arts or things of that nature. In fact,  even at OSU you can get a degree in economics through business or you  can get it through arts and sciences. Now, the faculty is the same  basically, but the curriculum is a little different. Econ, traditionally, for  years was the largest department. So when you add that in there    By  the way it is very good to have it there because they are trained  differently, they view life different, which is kind of fun. So when you  put them in there, we probably had about sixty or so.  We had a lot of, I don   t know how to say this without sounding bad, a  lot of characters. People with idiosyncrasies. It was neat. You had these  people that were just kind of neat. You had Glenn Laughlin. I don   t  know if you remember Glenn Laughlin. He   s a business law professor,  just hard as nails. Fred Black, who wore the same clothes every day.  15  Gill  Manzer  (Laughter) We had all kinds of them and everybody got along really  well, and it was a lot of collegiality. It was fun. And about that time  more women started being on faculty. Although it is still not a lot,  there   s a heck of a lot more than there used to be.  You talked about coming back in    75 as an assistant professor, and then  you moved through the ranks from associate to full professor to  department head, Coordinator of Business Extension, and Director of  Graduate Studies. A lot of different hats. Can you reflect on your career  at OSU and share some experiences and responsibilities over the years?  The school has changed and so responsibilities kind of change or the  emphasis kind of changes. When I came back in    75, in our building, it  is a four-story building. The top floor was where sociology was.  Sociology in 1966 had signed an agreement somehow. There wasn   t  enough faculty to fill the building, business faculty, so the sociology  department was on the fourth floor. Their department head was there.  They had a little stat lab that was there and those kinds of things. When I  came back in    75, the faculty was starting to grow and theoretically  sociology was supposed to depart in 1976. So, there were four of us that  were up on the sociology floor. I had offices up there, myself, and a  management professor, Dick Leftwich  who  is a very famous  economist, and business law professor Hal Ellis. You may know Hal  Ellis who came the same time I did. It was wonderful being up there  with the sociologists. I mean, they were just different. And you got to  know these people and it was great. I used to tell the students,    Where   s  your office?       Well, you   ll find me on the fourth floor. You   ll know it   s  me. I   ll be the one with the shirt on.    Kidding. (Laughter) But I   ve been  fortunate to associate with people across campus.  When I was a graduate student, I should have mentioned this, I worked  in the summers. In those days, when you worked on your PhD, they cut  you loose. They didn   t give you any money. They didn   t let you teach or  anything. I worked in the summers as a soil chemist in the agronomy  department over in agriculture. I analyzed soils all summer long, and I  umpired softball games at night, by the way, slow pitch softball games  out at the airport where they have those fields. The first two fields they  had, there were three of us that were umpires, and I was one of the first  three umpires in the city league in softball. A dollar a game. (Laughter)  But anyway in sociology, the school was drawing significantly to more  faculty. Obviously, in two years some of the faculty was still there when  I came back, and I found it very difficult to call them by their first name.  Dick Leftwich I could never call Dick, or Wayne Meinhart, I could  never call him Wayne. I   d just either call him nothing for twenty-eight  years because I just respected him so much, that   s what I got used to.  16  But when I came back, some of the things that had taken place is, one,  females start flocking to the School of Business. Right now my classes,  over half of them are female. Accounting in particular. It has just  broadened the scope of what we do. The School of Business grew  significantly in size, and one of the reasons was it was popular, but  females started coming into it. At one time, the School of Business had  over something like 5,300 students. That   s a lot of students. And now,  today, I   m not sure exactly, maybe like 4,000, but it got down to less  than 3,000 at one time. That   s been one big change.  Another change is that the faculty got up to about 120 and then  decreased during the oil crash and got down to ninety-some-odd and  now it   s back up to 105 or so. It   s a little different. The atmosphere  within the School of Business is a little different. We don   t have as  many characters, I don   t think. Maybe we do and I just don   t know, but I  don   t think so. I think we   re more uniform. People are more career  oriented, publisher oriented. That part has really increased. You always  had to publish, but the requirements now for publishing to get promotion  and tenure are much more significant.  The curriculum is more difficult in terms of what you do. I was the  second graduate in the PhD program in marketing. The first graduate  PhD in marketing was in 1972. I graduated in 1974, the second one. It  went on for a long time to be one graduate here and one there. Now  we   re graduating three or four. Those people, their education is so much  better than what my education was. It   s just amazing, especially in terms  of computers, in terms of staff, which is a large part of it anymore. So,  that   s when things take place, and I think some of the departments have  just made so many strides.  You were talking about Andy Anderson. I mean, he took accounting to  be one of the top five undergraduate accounting programs in the nation.  There was no doubt about it whatsoever. Andy, in my opinion, was  primarily responsible for that. He hired some good people. I learned a  long time ago that if you have somebody with real vision and leadership  and they   re enthusiastic and they   re fair, you can take people a long  way. Andy is a good example of it, but the department of marketing, I  think out of any major, it is one of the top thirty or forty and there are  600 of these in the nation. Accounting is still very strong. The other  departments are strong. Now they have different departments, like  entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship has done more in one year than any  other department I have ever seen. A lot of it had to do with Mitch  Malone coining up all that money. The guy that is in charge of that, he   s  a doer. So, those changes have taken place.  Student-wise, I   ve had over 23,000 undergraduate students. I don   t know  17  Gill  Manzer  anybody in the history   maybe there is somebody, I don   t know, in the  history of the university that has had more students than me where I  have been the sole responsibility for them. I know they used to have  large sections and then go out and have graduate students have study  sessions with them, but I   m personally responsible for   I don   t think  anybody has that anymore. So, I had tremendous interaction with  students. People always ask me,    Are students any different than they  were some time ago?    and I said,    Well, in many ways they   re just the  same.    They   re wonderful to be around, but there are some differences.  Let me ask you. I noticed on your resume you   ve won numerous teaching  and evaluative awards, and I   m not saying that to promote, but you  have, over the years. What is it about teaching students that you enjoy so  much?  I basically have taught the same courses for   I started teaching in 1977,  so I guess that would be forty years counting over in Memphis. I   ve had  people ask me,    Doesn   t it get boring to you?    and I say,    No.    They  say,    Why not?    and I say,    Because it is new to them.    That   s the thing,  and I   ve been really lucky. If you do something and people reasonably  enjoy it and they give you that positive feedback and when you see  somebody that has succeeded and all this kind of stuff, it   s just neat to be  around them. I even find the students that are a pain, there are some  students that are a pain that, are fun to be around.  Somebody asked me one time,    When you retire, are you going to go to  Florida or Arizona or someplace like that?    and I said,    Why would I go  where there   s old people?    I   m not doing that. I   m staying right here.  How I got to be a college professor, I have no idea. I didn   t even know  there were college professors, but it   s neat. You are around them, and  most of them, not all of them, think you   re halfway neat, and you don   t  have to pay their tuition. I mean, it doesn   t get any better than that.  (Laughter) And you get a lot of feedback. I found something about  students. I   ve always said this about my philosophy of teaching. I  believe, and I truly believe this, that we that teach here, and others too,  we have a moral obligation and I mean a moral obligation to do the best  we can to provide the best material that we can, updated material, and to  motivate them the best we possibly can, within reason, without giving  away the store, without making it easy for them. And so I   ve never  worked a day in my life. For forty years I   ve never had a day where I  thought I had to go to work. This is why I   m still teaching today. I mean,  I   m still teaching tomorrow and going into the classroom. I   m going to  say the same thing that I said last year, but it will just be new to them.  This will sound funny, but just by accident I discovered the way to do it,  to make it interesting, to make it interesting for me and for them. And  18  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  what you do is you teach through stories. That   s the key. That   s why,  without sounding bad, I   ve often thought,    Why did I win these teaching  awards?    There   s all kinds of great teachers right on this campus. I  mean, we   ve got them in our building right now. They   re as good as I  ever thought about being and better. I thought,    How in the world did  that work?    One, the subject I have is very easy to teach. Second, I teach  by examples and stories. In fact, I   ve even created a course, a one-hour  graduate course: storytelling as a management technique. How you use  these stories to change people   s attitudes and views and if you think  about it, the great communicators, many of them   Lincoln was a  storyteller. Reagan, you may not agree with his politics at all, but he   s  called a great communicator. Why is that? He was what they call    a rock  on tour.    He was a teller of anecdotes and studied his technique and  what not, and that   s what he did. A lot of it is going in and telling  stories, that type of thing. That   s all I do.  You talked about some of the students that you worked with over the  years. You   ve had to form some special relationships.  Yes.  Are there some students that you particularly remember and are there  some stories you could share?  I   ve had a lot of students. I   ve been really fortunate. I can   t remember,   but  six or eight of the students that I have advised won the Outstanding  Graduate of the university over the years. Remember when they used to  do that? It was  from  the Alumni Association. They would give one  male and one female Outstanding Graduate. Now they quit doing that. I  can   t remember exactly how many, but I am not exaggerating. I know it  is six, maybe eight of my students that I advised. It wasn   t anything I  did. It was the fact that the students were drawn. Those types of students  were drawn to this particular discipline or whatever the case may be. But  I   ve just had some really   I hate to mention some individually   but  I   ve had some great students.  Are there names that have gone on and have really done well that pop  up in your mind?  Andrew Altendorf, I was his advisor. He has done extremely well in  Tulsa. A good supporter. Sends all his kids   in fact, the Altendorfs are  from Okarche or something. They send kids here by the hundreds, and  he has continued to do that and is very successful. Gina-Lynne Smith,  who was Miss OSU, Miss Oklahoma, and in many ways the best student  I   ve ever had, is very successful. It   s a motel chain; she   s number two in  that particular kind of thing. I have a student that is president of the  19  Gill  Manzer  company in Rungardners, who is a president of a company in  Chattanooga, Tennessee. When you have 23,000 you   re going to have  some.  But I   ll tell you a change that took place. I just didn   t agree with this one  at all. It used to be the faculty that advised students. When I first came  here, I had about thirty. I knew them well and knew everything. Then it  got to be that thirty was no longer thirty. It was seventy or eighty. A lot  of faculty didn   t like that. They thought it took away from their research  and what not. So, here about, I don   t know how many years ago, seven  or eight years ago, the college made a decision to hire staff to do all of  the advising and the  faculty doesn   t  do it. I no longer have close  relationships in that way because I   m not teaching capstone courses. So,  recruiters used to call and I would say,    I   ve got three or four that fit  what you do.    Now they call and I say,    I don   t know.    That   s one of the  things that is kind of bad, but that   s just me. Now everybody else, most  of them thought,    No, this is good because I don   t have to do this.     Lee, another thing that jumps out in your career as I look over it is your  years as Coordinator of Business Extension. Throughout your career,  you   ve reached out beyond the university campus. You worked with  business communities, state and local governments. Can you talk about  the college outreach programs and your participation in these  activities?  That   s one of the biggest changes that has occurred. OSU is a land-grant  institution, and so we take that land grant thing and where that really is  in agriculture. They have their own separate business; agriculture  extension has their own budget and those kinds of things. Well, the other  colleges also had part of this idea, this outreach, but the School of  Business really didn   t do much. It was more like Economic  Development would do a few things.  How I got back to OSU is Bob Hamm, who I   m sure you probably  know. Bob became Director of Extension and Bob was very good at  vision type of things. Now, he wasn   t very good at detail, but he had as  his assistant Jim Hromas, who is extremely good at detail. How I got  back to OSU is that Bob Hamm wanted me to come back and work in  outreach and to expand what they did. He thought that I could do that.  When I came back here, I had a split appointment. I had a tenure track  position in marketing, but also half the time in extension in outreach.  That   s how I got involved in it. I did that for a couple of years and then I  went straight into the department.  But then I started doing these outreach programs, making presentations,  started with banks, on service. I got to where I liked it, and so I would go  20  Gill  Manzer  all over the state talking to Rotary Clubs and talking to alumni groups,  you know when you were there and did all these kinds of things. I was  doing this to gain experience and so I   ve done this for thirty years and it  has just expanded. That office is now called The Center for Executive  and Professional Development. I never was the director of it. What I did,  I directed some of the programs within that office. Dr. Weathers, Julie  Weathers, is just fantastic, and so I   ve just been involved in it forever. I  make fifty to sixty presentations a year someplace. I just got back from  Las Vegas making a presentation. Next week, I   ll go to Denver. I   ve  made presentations to people trying to make a living. One hundred  thousand, easy   harder to count. I   ve done it and just been really  fortunate to find kind of a niche, something I could do and people are  interested in it.  You talked about something that   s grown, and I   ll tell you something  else that made a lot of money. Because what happens is, you have to run  that office and reach your own budget. But in the overage, a third went  to that office and a third to the college and a third went to the  department. So there was a way of supplementing the budgets that the  college and the department got. I   m not sure how much it generated.  Millions. Right now the big deal is online. That   s the deal. I have two  online courses right now, and that   s the deal right now. Whether you like  it or not, whether you think that is good education or not, that   s the deal.  Tagging on our comments of the benefits of those relationships, as I  visited with Dick Poole and Bob Sandmeyer and others, they talked  about relationships coming back in terms of endowments and gifts to the  university. I mean, not that that   s why you do it, but some of the spin-off  benefits of that. They talked about developing relationships where they  could place some of the students back to those companies. What was  your experience? Did it work that way?  Well, not so much. What happened, from the standpoint I did and most  of the people are doing that thing, two things happened. One is that  you   re generating some cash for the departments and those kinds of  things, and you   re building relationships where I   ve had people call and  ask about students and things of that nature. But for years, see, the  college   for example, Sandmeyer. He was a dean, and Lumpkin and  Trennepohl and all these people. They didn   t want departments to  generate any of the cash. They didn   t want endowments. They wanted it  done at the college level. The only department that really does that to a  large extent is accounting. Accounting can do it mainly because Andy  Anderson. Mainly he just did it. The other thing is they have a defined  market. Somebody that majors in marketing might be in sales. Retailing  might be in HR, so you don   t have a defined market. Their idea was that  the college should be the ones that direct this, so from a standpoint of  21  Gill  Manzer  Gill  going out and suddenly somebody wants to endow something because I  was there, that   s just not going to happen.  Now, what has happened is I would find somebody and come back and  say,    Listen, here   s somebody that you might be interested in. We just  got rid of some graduates. Jim Dawson, vice president of Explorer, I  know him now,    and what not and something like that. I never found  that to be the case, but it did generate a lot of cash.  Lee, you talked about your alumni work, and perhaps more than any  other university professor that I know, and I   ve been associated nearly  forty years with the university, you   ve always found time to work with  alumni, participated in hundreds of alumni chapter events in Oklahoma  and across the state, in Texas and other areas. Why have you committed  so much of your time and resources to alumni relations? Why has that  been so important to you?  When I was with Dow, I really truly believed that Dow   s products were  great. I truly believe that it was a great company, so it wasn   t any  problem for me to do whatsoever. When I joined the fraternity, I thought  the fraternity was great for me, but to be honest with you, I never knew  if it would be great for somebody else. I always knew Dow   s product  would be great for people, so I wasn   t a very good rusher or anything of  that nature. I mean, I enjoyed it. It was great for me. I believe in OSU.  Our family went here. My wife went here. I have three degrees here. Our  daughter graduated from here. Her husband has two degrees, his  undergraduate and master   s in mechanical engineering. He   s the vice  president over at John Zink, done extremely well. Our son went to  school here. He played basketball here. He works for OSU right now on  TV and ESPN and these kinds of things. Our other daughter has her  degree here. She has a marketing degree and a master   s in health care  administration.  Other than our religion, our relationship with our lord and our family,  OSU is our life. I mean, you can identify with this, I think. It   s our life.  We believe in it. We want it to be successful. That   s one of the reasons  that we are here in Oklahoma is we want Oklahoma to be successful,  and if we can do something to help it, great. And if we can help the  university be successful, great. I learned a long time ago, wherever your  priorities are, you can do it. And people say,    I don   t have time to work  out.    You know what I believe? I don   t believe that. They don   t make  time to work out. If it were a priority, I guarantee it, if they get ill, guess  what they will do? They   ll work out. Right? They   ll find that time. Well,  you find that time for OSU. I mean, a major part of our life.  How important, from your perspective as a faculty member which is  22  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  different from most faculty members, is alumni relations?  With faculty?  To the faculty and to the university and the college?  Here   s what I think, and this is what made me think that the college  made a big mistake. This is my opinion about keeping faculty from  advising. You think back on it, your college days. You don   t remember  what you learned in humanities, but you may remember the instructor,  and you particularly remember the instructor if you had some out-of-class  interaction with that instructor. That   s what you do. You think back  to those particular kinds of things. How are you going to do that unless  faculty are willing to do that? Now you can do it at a master   s level and  you can do it at a PhD level because you   re working one on one and  doing these kinds of things, but the undergraduate level, how are they  going to that? They   ve got to have   we did some focus groups on what  made a good instructor with students. It was really interesting. They all  said the same things that you and I would say, entertaining or whatever  the case may be. But what was really interesting was the relationship  that they had outside. If the instructors made themselves available to the  student, it was those things that cemented a bond. So, I think as these  people think. They   re thinking about some instructor they had when they  give back, not all of them, but Joe Jadlow from our department and Joe  Fowler, they have an endowed scholarship in their name and it was some  guy who  named it  because it was the two people that he remembered  when he was here at OSU. That happens all of the time. And Bob  Hamm. It happens all the time, but how are you going to do that unless  you have an opportunity to   I have four or five hundred students this  semester. Are you going to know four or five hundred students? No.  And students become alumni, so you   ve got those relationships?  No, it   s interesting. Bryndon, our son, became a financial planner. He  does this stuff for ESPN and he   s on TV and all this stuff, but his real  job is to be a financial planner. When he first started out, those guys  starve to death, you know, so they   re always looking for somebody. He  came to me one time and he says,    Dad, you know a lot of people.    And  I said,    No, Bryndon, a lot of people know me.    In other words, when  I   m in a class of four hundred, I don   t really know them, but they know  me. I just think it   s little things that you do. I don   t know why we   d be  unkind to students, and I   m not talking about giving them the score. My  grades in my classes are the lowest in our department and some of the  lowest in the School of Business, and that includes courses you think  might be harder than marketing. I   m talking about accounting or  whatever the case may be. They   re just lower. I believe in holding  23  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  standards and doing it, but you can still develop relationships if you   re  fair and they think you   re working hard. That   s my philosophy anyway,  but it   s critical.  I think you indicated earlier in our conversation that you might have had  some opportunities to go other places in your career. What   s kept you at  OSU all these years? You probably touched on some of that earlier.  Well, one, we have a lot of people from prestigious universities come  here on faculty, at least in our department, in our school too, but I think  our department. And their goal is to come and stay awhile and go off to  someplace that is a bigger deal. Most of them come and stay. A good  example is John Mohr. John Mohr could be at a lot of schools. He   s a  nationally known scholar. He   s an eclectic guy. He knows all kinds of  things. He won the number one researcher in the university. I   m not sure  what that thing is, the School of Business, he won that. Nobody in the  School of Business wins that. I mean, that   s over in sciences or  agriculture. They   re not going to win it in the School of Business. Well,  he did, so he   s just that quality of a guy. He came here with the idea of  staying a few years, but it is so collegial, the culture is so good within  our department that they just stay. That   s one reason. I was on faculty at  Memphis State. Great experience, learned a lot, but it did not have that  collegiality, that unity that we have here.  The other reason, to be quite honest with you, my folks and Sandra   s  folks were elderly and they were eighty miles and sixty miles away.  Catering to our families is a gigantic big deal to us. My dad passed away  and my mother   s over there. I go over there and see her, quite easily,  twice a month. I call her every day. That kind of thing. A lot of it had to  do with personal.  Lee, throughout your forty-plus-year career at OSU, you   ve had an  opportunity to really understand and really get a feel of the ethos, if you  will, of the College of Business Administration. What do you think has  been its core values and principles over the years? We   ve looked at  some things that are changing, but looking across the last three decades,  what have been the values and strengths?  I think the real strength has been the culture within it has been an all-inclusive  type of thing. You take somebody like me, and you mentioned  awhile ago, my career path has been different than most of the people in  the school. Where I have been successful has not been in publishing. I  had to publish and continue to do those things to get promoted to  professor and those things, but my real emphasis has been outside. Been  fortunate to do that in teaching, and not just teaching but teaching at a  certain level. I think that that is   at one time, that was valued more than  24  Gill  Manzer  it is valued now. At all times, publishing was always the number one  thing, and anybody that gets in this business must understand that, and I  understood that. I   ve never given much credence to somebody that gets  in and has never been teaching and wonder why they don   t get  promoted. Well, everybody knows the rules of the game. If you don   t  like the rules of the game, then why are you in the game? So, I   ve  always understood that. I   m for that, by the way. But I think, as I said, I  don   t think that someone like myself   I was a department head and  promoted. I don   t think somebody like myself that took this career path  where you   re outside doing things with the community and those kinds  of things could reach the level that I was fortunate to reach. It has  changed. It is much more emphasis on the research, and so what happens  when you do that is, in my opinion, there   s not as much collegiality.  There   s more people putting their nose into the grindstone, shutting their  door working at it, instead of leaving the door open, those kinds of  things. That is a very positive thing.  Our department, for example, next spring, late spring of 2011 is going to  hold an AMA doctoral consortium here. This is normally held at Big  Ten schools, private schools, Harvard, whatever the case may be. OSU  is going to do this. Well, how do we get that? One, we   re willing to pony  up some money, but the AMA is going to   the American Marketing  Association is what the AMA is. How do we get it here, because of the  quality of the faculty in terms of research? We   d have never gotten that  ten or twenty years ago, whatever the case may be, but you pay a price  for doing that. You don   t have as much diversity in your faculty as you  had before. But, having said that, it depends on what your goals are, and  that   s our goal. So, I   m all in favor, but I think you lose something on  that.  In your opinion, what are some of the keys to continuing success in the  college moving forward, and you probably have a good feel for the  landscape going forward. What areas do we need to focus on going into  the future?  I don   t think there   s any doubt the area that   s going to be focused on  here in the near future and that is entrepreneurship. There   s no doubt  about that whatsoever. As I said earlier, it   s just taking off. It   s done  amazing things. They   re going to have a doctoral program. It took years  for us to get the regents to even consider a doctoral program. They are  going to do it like that. They have a master   s program. They did it like  that. They have faculty, good faculty. I think that   ll be an area. There   s  no doubt about that. Already they are drawing majors at a very high clip,  and, by the way, those majors come from other departments within the  school. So, there   s an income. I think that will be emphasized.  Accounting is always emphasized because of the tradition of it, but the  25  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  School of Business, to me, always seems to me, given our resources we  do really well. I mean, we really do. We   ve got some really fine faculty,  but I think those areas are going to be emphasized. And we   ve got a new  dean coming,  Dr. Lawrence A. Crosby . He   ll be here next month, and  he   s been on faculty at Arizona State for the last x number of years. He   s  been in private practice consulting on branding which is a big deal right  now. I   m sure he   ll be emphasizing that. I think he   ll be emphasizing  outreach. I think he will emphasize those kinds of things. He appears to  be a really sharp fellow.  Speaking of different models and new things, from the perspective of the  Spears School of Business, how successful has the relationship between   it and  OSU-Tulsa been?  It   s been great.  You think that model has been working for the college?  Yes and no. When we went over to Tulsa, it was the University Center at  Tulsa, and it was a consortium of some schools, which we were one. I  went over and taught in the first class that OSU offered over there in the  spring of 1983. We offered three classes and one of them was marketing  management and the MBA course, and I went over and taught it in the  building down on Houston. It was a state building. So, from the  beginning, the School of Business had a big presence. The MBA  program was a big deal to take over there. In fact, a guy named Kirk  Downey and myself designed the program that went over there, and we  had to change it because all of a sudden we   re not here. We   re over  there. We had to make it more amenable to part-time and those kinds of  things.  So, from the beginning, we wanted to do this and had a good  relationship, and then when Gary Trennepohl became president over  there, of course, he was dean here and resources were in there. So, from  that standpoint, and the interaction between the Tulsa faculty and the  Stillwater faculty, at least in our department, it   s always seamless. You  wouldn   t even know the difference. I think that   s basically the way it is  in all faculty that are over there. The idea was that they wanted to make  it a seamless type of thing, and I think they   ve been pretty good at doing  that. The hindrance, because of the regents and what not, is the lack of  being able to offer all of the programs that we would like to offer there  and we only have certain kinds of programs that we can offer there. For  example, we can   t offer an accounting degree and those kinds of things.  If we had that, maybe that would change things. Maybe it would grow  faster, I   m not really sure.  26  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Was this a mandate that Langston University has to teach?  It   s not just Langston. It   s OU, and there are a variety of things over it,  but we needed to be over there. When I first came to school here, what  was over there? TU  University of Tulsa  was over there, and then ORU   Oral Roberts University  came. Well, then came Tulsa Community  College. What do you have there now? You   ve got those and you   ve got  Claremore, and Northeastern is there. University of Phoenix is there.  Oklahoma Wesleyan is there. St. Gregory   s is there. OCU  Oklahoma  Christian University  is there. They   re all there. And so what you need  to do is go where the market is, and that   s why we needed to be there.  And, of course, now we   ve got this online thing, so we   ll see what that   s  doing. That online, by the way, is cannibalizing some of our classes, I   m  sure, across campus. In other words, I have an 8:30 class that I teach. It  usually has eighty to eighty-five students in it. Now that we offer that  online, it   s got forty students in it. Now, where are those students going?  They   re going online. Whether that   s good or bad, I don   t know, but  that   s what is taking place. So, how will that affect Tulsa? I don   t know,  but we have a good relationship. The vice president over there is Raja  Basu, who has magnificent faculty members. I don   t know about this  new guy or what will take place on that, but I go over there and teach.  Used to teach once a year over there. Now I teach about once every two  years. Teach at night. Different building, different students  Lee, you   ve served under several deans, about seven or eight deans, as I  recall, but are there some deans that stand out in your mind? Can you  share what you remember about them, what they brought to the  program? I know that   s a pretty broad question, but are there some  things that stand out in your mind?  The first dean that I served under as a faculty member was Virgil Miller.  He was there for two years, and Bob Hamm and Virgil Miller were the  ones that figured out a way to get me back here. If it wasn   t for Bob  Hamm and Virgil Miller, I wouldn   t be here at OSU, but they did it by  hook and crook. There are always ways to do things. And then I was on  the search committee for the next dean and that was Bob Sandmeyer.  Now Bob Sandmeyer was on faculty. He was an econ professor, and he  was dean for like sixteen years or something.  Was Dick right in front of him? Sandmeyer?  No, Virgil Miller was in front of him.  Miller, Poole, Sandmeyer   was that the sequence?  27  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  I think it was Poole, Miller. But Sandmeyer was great, and this is my  opinion. Bob was, in some way, kind of autocratic, but he was autocratic  in doing good things. Now, most of the time he was dean, there was a  good economic base. He took some chances and did some things and  turned out to be great. I liked him very, very much, and I   d say 90  percent of them liked him. Not everybody is going to like him all the  time, but he was received. Of all the deans we   ve had, he is by the far  the one that had the most power here on campus. For whatever reason,  he had power on campus, and on this campus, if you really think about  it, which has got the power of campus in terms of the dean. It   s not  going to be the College of Business dean   well it   s going to be Karl  Reid  former Dean of the College of Engineering , for one. I mean, he   s  been here since the beginning of time  and  in agriculture. Because they  have more external constituencies that provide influence. I   m not  complaining. That   s just the way it is.  But Sandmeyer had power on campus. He raised a lot of money and did  a lot of good things, and after Sandmeyer was Gary Trennepohl who was  a finance guy from Texas A M and based in Tulsa. He was a dean and  just a little different. He was a little more finance oriented. He knew the  budget, that kind of guy. But he did a good job, and then after him came  Lumpkin. Lumpkin was controversial. He was there four or five years.  He was kind of autocratic, and I don   t think Lumpkin was a popular  dean. He was good to me and tried to do some things and then we got  Sarah, who is very popular by the way. Our current dean, Sarah  Freedman, is an extremely popular dean. Very personable. Works very  well with the faculty and those kinds of things. We   ve got this new guy  coming in who I just met. He   s going to be different than all of them, I  think, but they   ve moved down the road. Sandmeyer particularly, I  think, moved it really down the road a lot.  Do you have any good Bob Sandmeyer stories? Surely you   ve got to  have something you can share.  Oh, gosh. I always worked late, and so when I left, I   d leave at 6:00 p.m.  I   d go down to the dean   s office and there   d be Bob. He   d be reading  something. I   d sit down for a few minutes. He   s always reading  something about how we   re going to make progress. He read a lot of  things about administration of schools of business and always had  something. When I became department head and we sat around this  table, and there   s old Bob Sandmeyer. He   d been dean for a while. I sat  next to Ron Moomaw. I don   t know if you remember Ron Moomaw.  He   s a great guy, but an economist trained different. Just kind of like one  of these typical, what you think a college professor would be. He and  Larkin Warner (Laughter)   you remember Larkin Warner? Larkin, to  me, was just what a college professor should be. Anyway, we   re sitting  28  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  there. First, we met every two weeks, and when you went to sit down,  you always sat down in the same spot. You know how that is, when you  have assigned seats? Well, mine was next to Ron. So, Sandmeyer is up  there doing all that stuff. Of course, he   s reading all this stuff and talking  about all this stuff, and I   m taking notes and everything, looking over  here and Ron is not taking one note. And I   m taking all these notes. Next  meeting, we have the meeting. I   m taking all these notes, and Ron   s not  taking any notes at all. After the meeting I said,    Hey, Ron, you ever  take any notes on what Sandmeyer says?    and he says,    Ah, if it   s  important he   ll mention it three times. If he mentions it once or twice,  it   s not worth taking a note.    (Laughter) And so I said,    You got it.     Did your note taking go down?  Yes. I didn   t take any more notes because Ron said if it   s really a big  deal he   ll mention it three times. But he always had something that he  was thinking about.    We   ve got to do this,    and    We   ve got to do that.     Bob was sort of   I   m trying to think of a different word than  intimidation, but an intimidating kind of person.  He   s very intimidating. He would be up there and all of a sudden he  would just tell you   but the thing is about faculty, faculty is hard to  intimidate. Once you   ve got that tenure, you see, there   s not much they  can do to you really. You   re almost like an independent contractor,  almost, and so it   s hard to intimidate them. Now, Bob could because of  the force of his personality.  But econ used to have a department head by the name of Rufus Waters  and Rufus was eventually forced out and what not, but the story is told.  Ansel Sharp, I don   t know if you remember Ansel Sharp, great guy, old  economics professor. Rufus was in the meeting and was talking about by  a certain date they wanted to submit some grant proposals. Well, grant  proposals are pretty difficult to do, but we wanted to submit a grant  proposal by May 15, and he got through, and Ansel says,    Well, Rufus,  what if I don   t want to submit a grant proposal?    (Laughs) Rufus says     Well, I guess that   s your choice.       That   s right. That   s my choice.     And so that   s kind of what you   re dealing with faculty.  But Bob, he can be intimidating. I was talking to a colleague the other  day and was talking about this new dean, and he reminded me. He was  talking about the new dean wanted to change things because all new  deans want to put their thumb print on something. I mean, Burns comes  in and he wants to put his thumb print on it. Obama comes in   whoever.  The new pharaoh. It   s their right to do that. So, I was talking to  somebody about the new dean, and I said,    Boy, I hope he doesn   t try to  29  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  change me.    And this guy said,    Well, at your stage in your career, he   s  not going to change you.    It reminded me of something my colleague,  Don Hanson said, and I said,    Well, that   s right, but I don   t want  anybody trying to change me.    (Laughter)  Don   t try to change you. (Laughter)  Don   t try because I   m not going to change. But, that   s kind of how  faculty are. It   s a great job, and the reason you do this is because   what  happens is you get some yes men and women, but you don   t get a lot of  them, or you shouldn   t get a lot of them as long as you   re at a certain  stage. But you want to be a team player. You asked why I do it. I want to  be a team player because I love OSU. I love the department. I don   t want  to see it   right now, whenever this dean comes out, I don   t want to  change if he says    Lee, would you do this, this and this?    I think about  it, and if that   ll help the college, then guess what? I   ll do it.  We   ve talked about some of the deans. What about some of the faculty?  You touched on two or three of them in our conversation, but over the  years, are there faculty members you recall that are special to the  college?  Oh, geez. Some of those old econ   Richard Leftwich was just amazing.  He looked like a college professor. He was famous because he wrote a  very famous intermediate microeconomics book. It was used all over the  place. I don   t know how much money he made off that. I know he had a  plane and did those kinds of things, but he was scary. As a student, I  remember having him for a macro or micro graduate course. And the  first day he gets in class   I mean, he   s just scary, but talk about a great  teacher. He got into the first day of class and he says, (I   ll never forget  it) he says,    Now, my office hours are such and such, so if you have  trouble or need to come by, you are more than welcome to come by.     And then he pauses and he says,    But I want to warn you, I can smell a  brown noser a mile away.    Well, that meant nobody was going to come  in (Laughs) because he didn   t want anybody coming in. I never went in  to see him, but he was great. We   ve had some good ones. He had a good  impact.  Larkin Warner in econ, he had tremendous impact. He told me a funny  story of a student one time. I   ll never forget it. He was teaching  macroeconomics, undergraduate, and it was like the ninth week of  school, and a young lady comes into his office and says,    Dr. Warner,  I   m in your class. I have a problem.    And he says,    Well, what   s that?     And she says,    Well, I have the wrong text book.    This is nine weeks  into the class. She had the micro book and the course was macro. And so  Larkin says,    Did you notice anything when I was lecturing, you know,  30  Gill  Manzer  that was a little different?    And she said,    I just thought you were  lecturing at a higher level.    (Laughs) Larkin Warner.  We   ve had some great ones. We had a guy   this is one of my favorite  stories to tell. It tells you the mindset of people. I won   t give you his  name, but we had a faculty member in marketing pass away (this was  when I was first here) while he was on faculty. Now, this was when  sociology was in the building, so office space was at a real premium. So,  we go to the funeral. Three or four of us in department went. We come  out of the funeral, get in the car, everybody is kind of quiet. And  somebody said,    Well, Jack was sure a good man.    Somebody else said,     Yes, he sure was.    All of a sudden it got quiet and somebody said,    I  wonder who   s going to get his office?    So much for Jack. (Laughter)  I   ve always said that when I leave, people are going to say,    Who   s  going to get Manzer   s office and that furniture they left in there?     But there   s been a lot of grievance. Wayne Meinhart had passed away.  Dick Poole took Wayne Meinhart when he was in his late twenties and  made   there used to be marketing, management, finance departments.  And they were very small: three, four a piece. Poole, this was in the  early    60s, maybe mid-   60s, took Meinhart, who was a relatively new  PhD and made him department head of a department called  Administrative Sciences. That was marketing, management, and finance  together. They had some synergy, and Wayne was department head, I  don   t know, twenty-some-odd years and he was responsible, to a large  degree, in building the college because of who he hired. He hired some  really big-name people, and some of them have left now and some of  them are still big-, really big-name people. He had a knack for doing  that. Wayne died unexpectedly while he was on faculty. He had a heart  attack I don   t know how many years ago, a number of years ago.  We talked about Wilton Anderson, Andy, earlier.  Wilton was gigantic. Wilton   I don   t know, maybe somebody said this.  I   m not sure he had an accounting degree. He certainly didn   t have a  doctorate in accounting. He had an education degree. I don   t know if  you knew that or not, but he believed that OSU had the greatest  department in the world. When he would hire people, in the faculty  meeting when you would introduce them, you know,    We   ve got a new  faculty member,    he would always get up and say,    This is our newest  star.    And everybody was going (nods) because he said the same thing  about everybody. But what   s funny about it is he believed it, the  Pygmalion effect. Then he got involved in the associations and  established relationships, and he   s the one that built that. He was  fantastic. He built relationships with people at other colleges. For  example, when they had the PhD program. The PhD program in  31  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  marketing, management, finance and accounting all came about the  same time. This was bout 1972, and he had built relationships. For  example, Fred Skousen at BYU, who does not have a PhD program in  accounting, but they have great students. You don   t know how many  students that Fred Skousen sent down here, great students, to go in our  PhD program. He did that kind of thing with all kinds of schools.  I had heard lately that he actually farmed out students. He taught all of  the survey classes, which would normally not be a department head.  He would teach some of them.  He would select his stars.  Select his stars, yes.  They   d finish their bachelor   s and then he would market them out, and  they   d start doing their master   s and then get their doctorate and come  back on faculty. Is that true?  That   s true.  What a sheer genius. I mean, they had OSU background, you weren   t  going to beat other people in salary or nice facilities, but because of  their love, like yourself, the love for Oklahoma State University, they   d  come back.  See, if you can get people that have their doctorate someplace else,  that   s different. They   d hired somebody like me that didn   t have a  doctorate here. When I came back on faculty and I went   this is just me.  I was concerned about security and stuff like that. Given my  background, I was concerned about it, so I thought,    You know what I  think I   m going to do while I   m faculty here? I think I   m going to take  some accounting courses and get a CPA while I   m on faculty in  marketing. That   d give me security like nobody   s business.    So, I go and  talk to Andy. I go in and sit down. I said,    Dr. Anderson, I   ve got this  idea. I   m going to take these accounting courses.    And he looked at me  like this, and he got up and walked around my side of the desk and lifted  me up and said,    That   s the dumbest idea I   ve ever heard.    Shooed me  right out of the office, and he was right. It was the dumbest idea because  he knew that I would be successful while I was doing it. Why in the  world was I thinking about that? So, you know, he helped others. He  helped me. I would have done it. He said,    That   s the dumbest idea I   ve  ever heard.    (Laughter) But there   s a lot of them like that, and some of  them are there today. As I said, John Mullins is one of them and he   s  done a lot of things. Gary Simpson in finance is very active in the  32  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  business community with the Banker   s Association. He   s been here for  years, those kinds of people. There are just tons of them. We   re very  blessed.  Lee, how do you feel about the proposed facilities for the College of  Business of Administration?  Everybody in our building wants something like that. My personal  opinion, I don   t know. I   m happy where we are, but, again, that   s my  background. But, they do need some extra space for where you have  classes where you can do case work and things of that nature. I think if  we had a building, then it would help recruiting students. Kind of like  the athletics. You build it, type of thing. I think in doing that and raising  that kind of money   see, I don   t think you   re going to get any money  from the state for the School of Business. That   s not true with other  buildings around here if you think about it. I think the administration in  the past just thought,    The School of Business can just raise the money,     because of who we are in the School of Business. Maybe and maybe not,  but I   m all for it.  Where  my career is   that   s for the young guys to  figure out.  Picking up on that, how important is the Branding Success campaign at  the university? How do you feel about that?  Here   s what I think about this. One of the problems with OSU   and this  is just my personal opinion. I   ve been around forever. I may be wrong,  and you might disagree with this. One of the problems with OSU has  been we have never, in my opinion, taken advantage of our strengths.  We have never consistently had a program to do that. We have  piecemealed it. We   ve got this college, you got this style over here,  we   ve got this college over here, you   ve got this college over here. For  years we didn   t even have a color, whatever the correct color was.  Remember that? We didn   t even have a color. We didn   t have a logo.  We didn   t have any of these things. You cannot brand an organization.  You cannot get an identity unless you have some sort of consistency.  That   s the major thing. Whatever it is, you have to have consistency.  The other thing we have (now this is just me) is we   ve got to quit  thinking about other institutions. We   ve got to think about our  institution, what we are capable of doing. This probably sounds bad, but  I think of the faculty we have here, there   s probably not very many that  knows across campus as well as I do. Now, I don   t know if that   s true,  but, I mean, my colleagues, most of them, some of them do. But they  don   t know anybody in Ag. They don   t know anybody over in HES.  They don   t know anybody in engineering. I do and have worked with  them, and we have so many great wonderful people here. We just need  33  Gill  Manzer  the right vision and the right way to do it. We   ve never taken advantage  of it. Some of our competitors have done that. They   re much better at it  than we are, in my opinion. I think this idea of this branding thing is  correct, but you   ve got to do certain things. You   ve got to put cash into  it. I think this new dean who that   s his thing will really be of value in  doing this. I think it   s good, but talk is cheap, right?  It   s hard to say,    A billion.    It   s hard to make a campaign into a billion  dollars.  Listen, are you familiar with Pike   s Place Fish Market in Seattle?  They   re world famous. People from around the world come to see them.  Now this is fish mongers. They   re selling fish. They started out a  number of years ago and had this idea to become world famous. A fish  market. Came from one of their young employees, and so the manager  of it said,    Well, why not? Why don   t we try to do this?    And guess  what? They did it. You can do certain things. My major area of     expertise    is service. I   d increase the level of service, and I   m talking  about service provider, service receiver. I   m not talking about service  industries. I   m talking about this thing here, and I   ve worked a lot with  convenience store employees. One time when Phillips   I made fifty-five,  four-hour presentations to Phillips convenience stores in ten cities,  four hours at a time, sometimes three a day, fifty-five of them, to try to  encourage them to provide better service. Well, is there anybody less  motivated to provide good service than a convenience store employee?  They   re part-time employees; they   re young. Whatever the case may be,  and you say,    You can do this.     Tulsa, Oklahoma, has done it. There   s a company in Tulsa that has done  it, and you know who that is? 7-11. 7-11 has done this. They   re a  convenience store. Did you know that Conoco   they were by  themselves. Conoco got a refinery up in Ponca City. You would not find  Conoco stations in the Tulsa area. Very few, maybe one or two, I don   t  know, under their sign. Now, their gasoline went in there under non-brand  names. Why do you think that they weren   t there, 7-11? Had the  price advantage. Had all kinds of things, plus they had this deal of great  loyalty because of the service.  So, don   t tell me that you can   t. Whatever it is, a billion, whatever it is,  don   t tell me you can   t do it, because I believe you can do it, but it   s not  just raising the money. If they   re talking about really branding it, it   s  like Coca-Cola. Do you know what the brand equity of Coca-Cola is?  The name Coca-Cola, do you know what it   s worth? Sixty-three billion  dollars, just the name Coca-Cola. That   s called branding. You say Coca-  Cola, people know that. It   s the number one brand in the world. It   s  estimated to be worth  63 billion.  34  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  You   ve got Stan Clark over here, while we   re talking about branding.  The story is told that, what was that, thirty-five years ago they started  over here? He and Steve File. And they hired   I can   t remember exactly  the story, but he hired a cousin or something to draw this Eskimo Joe   s  dog, Buffy. Paid thirty-five dollars, I think, for that. What do you think  it   s worth today? Branding. That brand name is everywhere. It   s worth  millions. That   s what branding is. And, so, what you want to do is say  branding at OSU   boom. It comes to mind what it is. This is the image  that we have. This is what we have, and it   s not just raising a billion  dollars. They think, I guess, a billion dollars will help do that, but that   s  what this new dean does. It   s not just raising the money, although you  have to raise it. It   s the branding of it. Anyway, I   m all in favor of it. I  think it   s good.  How do you feel about President Hargis and his leadership and his  vision for the university? He   s one of your alums.  Yes, he   s an accounting major, and he   s got an academic appointment  over in legal studies. That is where his academic appointment is, not in  accounting, but in that one. What has he been here? Two years? I don   t  know. I do know this, he has tremendous skills. I think when I   m out in  public and what not, the image he projects is very, very positive. The  people that know him   now, not everybody knows him, but the people  that know him are very positive about him. I think the faculty is still  reserved about him. A lot of that has to do with the vet medicine thing  and some of the other things that have taken place. Running a university  is different than running a corporation. It doesn   t mean you couldn   t  have a business model and what not, but you   ve got all these  independent contractors out here. You   re in a business and somebody  does something, you   ve got more hammer on them. You don   t have as  much hammer on them.    Well, Rufus, what if I don   t want to submit  a       (Laughter)    because I   m not doing it.    I really don   t know him.  I   ve met him. The boy   s got a lot of skills, and I think he   s got some  good ideas, and this branding thing, I think, is a great idea, and I wish  him the best, and if we can help him, then we   ll be glad to do it.  Lee, do you mind sharing how important your religious faith has been in  your life and in your relationships and how that   s really influenced  those?  I indicated that in 1934 in Oklahoma here, my folks joined the LDS  Church, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, calling those  Mormons, and my mother took to that like a duck to water. I mean, it  was important to her. When we moved back to Hominy, when I was ten  years old we had little bitty branches about   maybe in an area there  might be thirty members. They   re not going to have a lot of members,  35  Gill  Manzer  and I   d say fifteen of them are my relatives. That kind of deal. We met  in store fronts and whatever. This church has no paid ministry. Nobody  is paid, but you have to have somebody run the organization. So, people  are called to do that, and they do that and the members participate.  I started giving talks in church when I was twelve years old, and so I  was steeped in that. I went on a mission when I was twenty years old.  Went back to Washington D.C. Folks paid for it. You don   t get paid. I  came back and married a young lady, and we raised our three children in  the church and have been very, very active. I   ve held all kinds of  positions. The head of the congregation is called the bishop. I was  bishop for five years. I   ve been other kinds of things. From an  organization stand point, we   ve raised our children through that. It  emphasizes, as all Christian religions do, the relationship with Jesus  Christ which I certainly   I believe this. Christ said,    If you love me,  keep my commandments,    and that   s what I try to do. That   s what I try  and do, and that   s what they taught in the scripture, and that   s what we  try and do. That   s what we try and do with our children. We   ve been  blessed that our children, as they have their own families and what not,  that they   ve raised them with the same value set. It   s extremely  important to my wife and I. In fact, it   s the most important thing. Other  than our family   our family is the most important. But we believe that  the family is the integral part of the church, but we   re very active in ours  during the week. Like I told you, it   s a priority type of thing. It   s been  great for us.  You   ve achieved success in your professional career, a lot of success.  You   ve received a number of awards and recognitions, as we talked  about earlier, from teaching over the years. Are there some special  career milestones, highlights, special memories you have that are  especially meaningful to you?  I   ve had a number of students, after   you know, when you have 23,000  students, you   re going to get feedback after they   ve gone, and I get  regularly something from somebody that  I had  ten years ago, fifteen  years ago, twenty years ago. I got one the other day from a fellow that  was meeting the other day with Hargis in Phoenix, and I don   t know  what they   re doing but meeting with him. My name came up, so he sent  me an e-mail and said,    I should have told you this a long time ago.     You know how that is. Then, he told me all this stuff I did for him,  which is interesting because I didn   t do any of that stuff. (Laughs)  People say I did this and I didn   t do that. There   s no way that I would  have done what he said. I always e-mail back and say,    I really  appreciate that, but I think you   ve overestimated what I   ve done, but  thanks.    But those kinds of things are very, very rewarding types of  things. But I think all instructors get those kinds of things.  36  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  The biggest thrill I get anymore is just going to class and looking out  there and people are paying attention. I have good attendance in class. I  would say, for the most part, they pay attention. Most part, they come to  class, not everybody. Just when you   re up there and all of a sudden you  see somebody, and it   s kind of like    Aha  That   s what you meant.    The  storytelling. I   ll tell you something. I tell this one story. It takes a long  time to tell it, but I use it in class, and I use it in my seminars and what  not. I   ve had people spot me on the street and say,    Are you Lee  Manzer?    and I say,    Yes.       I   ll never forget the story you told. It has  affected our lives.    And I   ve had that probably a hundred times, stuff  like that. It   s all worth it, right? It is like when your kids finally say     When they turn out right.  Yes, and you did okay, and you never know if a kid   s going to do all  right until they have their own kids. But I don   t know. I   ve just been  lucky. You were blessed to be able to play football, right? And so I   m  blessed to be able to do this. It wasn   t anything I did. I practiced, and  you practiced and got better at football, but just blessed to have it. Like  our kids. Our kids are great. Sandra and I talk about it all of the time. We  think they just kind of came that way. (Laughs) We didn   t do anything.  They just kind of came that way.  Are there other special highlights for you at OSU, not necessarily  teaching, but special memories you   ve had over the years that you have?  I guess when I got the doctorate was gigantic because the whole family  was here, and that was big because we had made a big sacrifice. My  wife particularly had made a big sacrifice. Then to have all three of our  children graduate from here, that was a big thing. I think the first real big  teaching award I won was big. It came as a big surprise, and I didn   t  even know I was nominated, and they called me up and said,    Hey, you  won this.    It was   you remember the Alumni or the Blue Key thing?  The Alumni Association Outstanding Teaching Award? From the  university?  I won that, and then they kind of did away with that, but anyway they  had a thing called the Amoco  Foundation  Award for a while. I don   t  know if you remember that. Somebody called me one day, and I said,     Well, what is it?       Come on, you need to have your picture taken.     And I said,    Well, what it is?    Said,    Well, it   s this deal.       Uhh.    So, I  got this haircut. That was a big deal because that was when it first  dawned on me that maybe I could do those kinds of things. Those and  we   ve always been active in athletics. I really appreciated it when they  asked me to work at the basketball games because that   s always been  37  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  fun. And, of course, Bryndon played ball here and that was particularly  fun.  Were you the scorekeeper?  Yes. Score at the games, and that   s kind of a highlight. But I think from  OSU is all the kids and grandkids are close and one of the reasons they  come home is for the athletic events at OSU. And that   s kind of special.  We don   t have to go anywhere. You know how that is. But that   s a  highlight even today. Even my brother-in-law, father-in-law and mother-in-  law, everybody, we all get along real well.  One other thing I would like to say is that my colleagues, even though  I   ve taken this career path kind of this way which is nontraditional, they  have been so supportive of what I   ve done. That   s a big highlight is that  I   ve never had anybody criticize me. They   re supportive. They  understand what I do. That   s what they want me to do, and they   re not  thinking,    You   re not an academician.    And that   s big. That makes life  easy.  Let me close with a couple of questions. One is   and I know these may  be a little embarrassing, but think about it. If you have a legacy, what do  you think that legacy is?  I was coming back from Enid the other day, and I drove down through  Waukomis, came over on 51, and I passed by a country cemetery. For  the first time ever I kind of looked over at the country cemetery, and I  thought,    Wait a minute, that   s going to be me.    It was kind of this  realization that I   m not going to live forever.  May die sometime.  I may die sometime and I am going to be in the cold ground. I got to  thinking about how I want to be remembered. Everybody wants to be     well, I don   t know about everybody, but I   d like to be remembered as a  good husband and a great father. Sandra and I have been married for  forty-five years. I   m sure there   s plenty, but I don   t know anybody that  has a better marriage than Sandra and I. We get along extremely well.  We   ve got our health, got enough money. The kids come home and they  don   t ask for money. Life is good. I   d like to be remembered as that.  I   d like to be remembered as someone who said if they   re going to do  something that they would do it. To me, that has to do a lot with  integrity, or if you   re not going to do it then let them know why you  can   t do it. That   s really important to me. My folks were that way, and  that   s the way I am. So, I   d like to be known as a person at the  38  university. I guess that was really your question. I guess I   d like to be   remembered  as somebody that really cared about the students, and I  really care. And, Jerry, I   m on a part. I mean, in class I   m sarcastic. I   m  there. I   m on a part, but I   d like to be remembered as somebody who  cares about students because I do.  Here   s something I do in class, if someone   we try to make it fun, but  I   m on a part, and if somebody gives a bad answer in class early in the  semester I   ll say to them,    You know what? With an answer like that,  you might as well get ready to say    What size, Madam?    because you   re  going to be selling shoes.    And they understand I   m not talking about  them. I   m talking about getting their act together. If you want to sell  shoes, that   s okay. There   s nothing wrong with that. So, I   ll do this in  the early part of the semester, and a number of times I   ll say,    You   re  going to be selling shoes.    After awhile, when somebody gives a bad  answer, I mean, just an asinine answer, I   ll look at them kind of like this,  and I   ll go to the class like this, and they   ll say,    What size, Madam?     (Laughs) Everybody   now 98 percent of the students don   t mind  because they know that I am not saying that they are going to be a  failure. I   m just saying. But I would like to be known as somebody that  cared about the students, was encouraging and tried to do it, but was not  somebody that gave away the store. I don   t know. Something like that, I  guess, a good colleague.  I like people. I   ll tell you what, though. I   ll tell you this and I tell the  students this. I went into Hastings one time. A number of years ago I  went into Hastings to rent a movie. I don   t rent movies. I can   t  remember the last movie I ever saw, but I was in there for some reason.  This was back when they had tapes. I didn   t find one, so I went over to  get this movie that I really like. I   ve since purchased it. It was Michael  Caine   s   I think it was his first movie. It was called Zulu. It was about  the Battle of Rorke   s Drift in Natal in 1879 during the Zulu uprising. It   s  a famous battle, and it   s really a classic kind of a cult deal. I really like  it. Nobody rents this movie. It   s got dust on it. So, I get up in line and  there   s a student checking us out. There   s students all around in line, and  so I   m in there by myself, and the guy says,    This will be ninety-nine  cents.    And I said in a loud voice so everyone could hear me in ear shot,     Ninety-nine cents?    He said,    Yes, sir.    And I said,    You   re charging  me ninety-nine cents?    and he said,    Well, that   s the price.    And of  course all the students are going   you know how you   d be. (Laughter) I  said,    I can   t believe you   re charging me ninety-nine cents for this  classic movie. I demand to pay more.    (Laughter)  And so I tell the students this, and that gives them something to talk  about. They go and say,    This old guy, geezer and what not,    and I said,     But here   s what   s interesting. Here   s a lesson to learn from that.    You  39  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  Gill  Manzer  see, I don   t mind if they think I   m a doddering old fool because, you see,  I know that I am not a doddering old fool. I may be old, but I   m not  doddering nor a fool. And once you understand your capabilities and  once you understand you have confidence in yourself, then you can  reach whatever potential that you want. And I said,    That   s what we   re  going to do in this class. When I say,    You   re selling shoes,    I   m not  saying you   re selling shoes. What I   m saying is that you have this  potential and what you need to do is understand that, and what you do  because others won   t affect you.    That kind of thing. I   d like to be  known as somebody that cares about students like that.  What did we miss? Anything about the college that you   d like to talk  about? Anything I failed to ask or bring up?  No, you did say something like,    What about OSU are some great  things,    or something like that. I   ll tell you. I should have mentioned  this. When I came back from that church mission, first day of class, I  went to class, and when I went to the Student Union and it was packed  in between classes. They used to play bridge in there. I don   t know if  you remember when they used to play bridge  I played bridge on the fifth floor of the Union.  Yes. Well, they were playing on the first floor. Where I used to play was  the first floor. But, anyway, I got in there and this place is packed, and  there was no place to sit. There were some people I kind of knew, and I  got a chair and they were sitting there. I sat down, and I sat down right  next to Sandra. She had just transferred from East Central to here, and  we became friends and then later we married. And that is the most  significant thing that has ever happened at OSU.  Serendipity.  Yes, it was right there. Like I said, we   ve been married these forty-five  years. I don   t have any complaints whatsoever. We   ve had very little  trouble, but that   s the greatest thing that has ever happened to me at  OSU, right there.  I appreciate it.  Yes.  -------  -------
