 Gill. Today is October 27, 2008. I   m visiting with Dr.  Michael Lorenz, Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at  Oklahoma State University, in his office on the OSU campus. Dr.  Lorenz, you have a long and distinguished history with OSU and the  College of Veterinary Medicine, as an OSU undergraduate student,  member of the Class of 1969 of the College of Veterinary Medicine,  Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine since 2001 and Head of the  Center for Veterinary Health Sciences. You have a little bit of history  there. So maybe we could back up and break some of that down. Can  you tell us a little bit about your family life and where you grew up?  I was born in Okeene, Oklahoma. My dad was a farmer. I   m a fourth-generation  Okie. My great-grandfather homesteaded in Blaine County  and so, interestingly, that farm is still in the Lorenz family. I have a  cousin that still farms it. I was actually raised north of Enid, went to high  school at Kremlin High School and graduated from there in 1963. I came  to Oklahoma State in 1963 to get into veterinary school as quickly as  possible   didn   t have a lot of resources, and so the quicker the better.  Was there a certain individual or circumstance that directed you  towards Oklahoma State University?  Well actually in high school I really wanted to be a physician, but it  didn   t feel like I had the resources to make that work, and so a good  friend of the family was a veterinarian. He wasn   t an Oklahoma State  graduate. He was an Iowa State graduate   happened to be a classmate  of the Dean of the Veterinary School at that time, Glen Holm. So  anyway this veterinarian had practiced in Enid for a long time and  encouraged me to become a vet and so that   s the direction I went.  Let me start with your undergraduate experience. What do you  remember about your undergraduate experience? Leadership activities,  6  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  opportunities for involvement   what are some of the things you were in?  Well, unlike a lot of undergraduate students here, I actually went home  almost every weekend to work, and if it hadn   t been for some  scholarship money in the College of Agriculture and working every  weekend, I wouldn   t have had the money to stay in school. So I wasn   t  involved that much in activities on the OSU campus   go to school five  days a week, 3:00 on Friday go home, work a weekend and come back  to school Monday morning.  Your undergraduate curriculum, what do you remember about some of  your courses, some of your professors that you had?  Yeah, well I graduated with a class of 26 from Kremlin High School,  and one of my classmates, Dan Zaloudek, people know him as a good  OSU alum. Dan came over to school in engineering, and I was in pre-veterinary  medicine. I think the most outstanding personality I ran into  was a woman that taught English composition. I believe her name was  Muriel Humphreys, and she really made you write. By mid-semester the  first semester I was here I was in this course, and by the midpoint of that  semester, two-thirds of the kids had dropped out. Most of them were  pre-med, pre-dentistry, pre-pharmacy, and so I hung in there and she  gave me a good lecture one afternoon on her philosophy of teaching, and  I think that lady got me more organized to college life than anybody  else. I had a lot of good instructors in my undergraduate career. I had  some that weren   t so great, but I had some that were pretty good.  Let   s see, you came into the College of Arts and Sciences?  No, I was in Agriculture.  Agriculture.  Agriculture.  Okay. I was going to say, Bob Kamm was the Dean of Arts and Sciences  at the time.  Bob Kamm actually became President of Oklahoma State while I was  here.  You   re pretty modest about your involvement, but what about your  recognition by the OSU Alumni Association as one of the Top Ten  Graduating Seniors and as the Outstanding Male Graduating Student  from Oklahoma State University in 1967?  7  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  That was kind of interesting. I got into veterinary school in 1965. That  was back in the days when you could do your pre-veterinary program in  two years, and I was nearly a straight    A    student in my undergraduate  work and pretty much a straight    A    student in vet school, also.  Scholarship was obviously a part of it, and while I was in vet school I  was active in a lot of organizations and active in the student association   of the  American Veterinary Medical Association. Maybe the  competition wasn   t so great that year, Jerry. I don   t know, but it was  quite an honor, and I know the people in vet school were very thrilled  that one of theirs had won it.  Do you have some favorite memories of your undergraduate experience?  Oh, I think my favorite experiences were all centered around OSU  athletics actually   Homecoming. I loved going to the wrestling  matches, stood in line forever for basketball tickets. I got married after  my first year here, and I recall going to Big Eight basketball with my  wife, who was pregnant, and I remember sitting through like four  overtime games with Kansas State or University of Kansas. Heck of a  deal. And we had this guy that played defensive back for Oklahoma  State   what was his name? Gill, I think. (Laughs) But I had a great  time, and I really became a devout OSU wrestling fan, and I still am.  Well, kind of a trivia quiz here, but who   s your favorite wrestler? There  were some outstanding ones in that era.  Oh, probably Yojiro Uetake and Joe James. Loved to watch Joe James  warm-up, and I liked the fact that he pinned old   what was it? Quarter  or McQuarters  Ed McQuarters  or whatever his name was from OU     one of their football players that thought he could wrestle. Well, Joe put  him on his back in about 30 seconds.  I remember the 190-pound match where Joe James would be warming  up and pulling off his jersey and right in the match you   d hear this     ooh    and    aah      it was Joe James on the sideline taking his warm-up  top off. (Laughs)  Yeah, Fred Fozzard was another one of my favorites. Fred had that left  arm that was affected from polio, I believe. He would bait those  wrestlers with that left arm. They   d grab that weak arm and the next  thing you knew he had them on their back. Yeah, and of course, Coach   Myron  Roderick, it was interesting to watch him and he   d go down  there and go through every move with them. I just wish today that the  college kids would come back to college wrestling. When we all watch  the Cowboys wrestle now, it   s really men of my age that are the primary  people that are there   and it   s just like it doesn   t have the appeal to the  8  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  college students like it once had. But we would stand out for two days to  get tickets to see the OU dual here.  And the odd/even IDs.  Yeah, odd/even IDs. Yeah. I remember the food over in Bennett Hall   I  lived in Bennett Hall the first year I was here. I had six different  roommates in one year. (Laughs) The food was pretty good, you know.  I   d go down there and particularly, try to get in when the athletes   the  athletes lived over in West Bennett. I   d try to go down there and eat  about the same time they did because they always got good food.  Well, alluding to your College of Veterinary Medicine experience, how  many students were in your entering class?  There were 48 in my entering class in 1965. We ended up graduating 40.  Some students did not make it academically. We had two students, I  think, that dropped to the class behind us. Interestingly, I think the  professors in the vet school thought we were one of the dumbest classes  they had graduated. They always held the Class of 1968 up as being a  much stronger class. There were like 50, I think, in the Class of 1968.  They   re going to be on campus this weekend with their reunion, but  there   s been members of the Class of 1969 that did pretty well, I think.  (Laughs)  What was the toughest class you had in the college?  I think early on probably the toughest class was biochemistry, and it was  taught by people from campus. In fact, one of the old professors, a  young professor at that time, that helped teach it is still here, and I get to  see him from time to time. But we had a man by the name of Duane  Peterson who taught anatomy who also helped us through biochemistry.  I found most of the coursework here exciting, and when you   re excited  about something I think learning is pretty easy.  Did you have a favorite professor?  I did. There is not just one, there were three or four. We had some really,  really good professors. Duane Peterson, who actually gave the first  lecture in the veterinary school when this place opened in 1948, and his  sidekick, Jonathan Friend, they taught anatomy. They were just  outstanding. I really enjoyed the heck out of Jim Breazile. Jim   s still on  our faculty, teaching physiology. He was really, really, really a gifted  teacher. And then there were some others, too, but those are the ones  that really stand out. Ralph Buckner, who taught us in the clinics, he was  really a fine fellow and a good teacher.  He  really cared about us  9  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  learning and that   s what I found so important. They wanted you to learn.  They wanted you to be successful.  Who was your dean at that time?  Well let   s see. Glen Holm was the dean when I started veterinary school.  He was an Iowa State graduate   graduated from Iowa State in 1936. He  was a really, really good administrator   very, very strict. You knew if  you ever got called up to see Dean Holm you were in trouble.  I   ll just tell you an amusing story. The first semester I   m in veterinary  school down in anatomy, they administered the Minnesota Multiphasic  Personality test. And if you   ve ever taken that test, you know there   s  some really bizarre questions on that test. Being an old farm boy sitting  there looking at this and, you know      Do I love my sister?         Do I kiss  my sister?    And I   m thinking,    Holy cow,    you know,    This is the  dumbest thing.    So I just randomly started going down through there  marking answers. And, I don   t know, some time went by and Dr.  Peterson in anatomy came up to me one day and he said,    Mr. Lorenz,     he said,    you need to go see Dean Holm. He needs to see you about your  exam results.    (Laughs) And so I got up   shaking   and go see Dean  Holm. He said,    Mr. Lorenz, you   re either a pervert or you   re just a wise  ass,    and he said,    I think it   s the latter.    So the way they handled that  (laughs) they made me take that exam again in front of all my  classmates. (Laughs) I guess I passed it because they let me graduate.  Well speaking of graduating, now you sort of let us know this, Mike. You  received the Dean Clarence H. McElroy Award as outstanding member  of the senior class. What can you tell us about that award and what it  meant to you?  Well, Clarence McElroy was the founding dean of the veterinary school  as we know it today. The veterinary college   there was an attempt to  start a veterinary college back in the early 1900s, and the person that  attempted to do that was Lowery Lewis. I remind everybody watching  this that the football field at one time was named for Dr. Lewis (Laughs)  and to us veterinarians, it   s still Lewis Field   but that   s okay. Dr. Lewis  wasn   t successful, but one of his prot  g  s was Clarence McElroy. Then  after the war there were a lot of returning veterans that wanted to go to  veterinary school. There was a cluster of veterinary colleges that started  about 1948-1949   University of Missouri started then, Oklahoma State,  University of Georgia   just to name three that started about that time,  and Clarence McElroy put it together. It was put together on a  shoestring. All the finances were not in place to make this thing work.  He was a shrewd guy, and he hired some really outstanding faculty     Duane Peterson, Jonathan Friend, and there were other individuals here.  10  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  The person that   s chosen as the outstanding member of that senior class,  the way that   s chosen is by vote of the faculty and the person   s  classmates, and so that makes it, I think, extra special. We now have the  Dean Mac Club and there   s several faculty members here that have been  honored with that award, and we take it pretty serious. When we bring a  new person in at our awards banquet, all the Dean Mac Club come  onstage and welcome that new person into the club.  Great. Now let   s see, you got that award despite the fact that you had  one    B    on your transcript.  I had one    B    on my transcript.  Do you want to share your story with us about that?  Well, that   s an interesting story. We had an individual here that was  teaching us a course in poultry pathology, and that individual wanted to  know how we liked the course. He had the habit of telling long-winded  personal stories and class was generally about the life growing up in  Iowa and how it was on the farm and a lot of practice philosophy. We  weren   t learning very much about chicken diseases, and if I   d have  known how much I   d be using chicken diseases I wouldn   t have cared  very much how much he taught us, but (laughs) still I thought you ought  to get a bang for your buck. So he asked a group of us one day how we  liked his course. And I volunteered that perhaps he could spend more  time talking about poultry diseases and less time about his personal life  and apparently he didn   t like that very well because he gave me a    B.     Now, I found out that I had the highest average in the class and he gave  six    A   s    so the question is how do you get a    B    grade when you have  the highest average in the class. And it was Dr. Peterson, one of my  mentors here in the veterinary school, that found out and he went to see  Dean Holm and Dean Holm   now this is the second time I   ve gone to  see the dean. Once because I   m a pervert and now because maybe I   ve  been wronged by a faculty member. Dean Holm explained to me that in  everybody   s life a little rain falls and I just need to get out an umbrella.  (Laughs) I felt like he said,    Well, bend over and use some Vaseline.     But anyway what I learned from all of that was that if I turned out to be  a teacher I would not treat a student that way regardless of how much I  liked or disliked them. What they earned in class is what they get. So I  did learn some good lessons from it, but that   s how I got the    B    grade.  Shifting to some highlights or special memories of your time in the  college that you especially     Well I loved it here. I really had a positive influence here, and there  11  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  were people like Roger Panciera, who   s a retired faculty member now.  He was one of my heroes, and they inspired me to go on to academia. I  was headed to practice. I was going back to Garfield County and I was  going to be a food animal practitioner. In the early spring   like  January   of 1969, I was at a meeting over in Tulsa and I was introduced  to two of the founding fathers of modern small animal medicine, Robert  Kirk from Cornell and Jake Mosier from Kansas State. And people in  veterinary medicine recognize those names as being two of the real  giants. Dr. Kirk suggested to me that I might do an internship, and I had  never heard of what an internship was. So coming back to Stillwater,  I   m thinking,    Boy, that would be neat  to  go to Cornell and do this  thing called an internship.    Started talking to faculty here and had a lot  of faculty that got on board and energized that and told me I needed to  stay in academia. So I trucked off from here to Cornell and it was a great  thing I did it. My wife and I say the two best things we ever did was  when we went to Cornell and when we decided to leave. (Laughs)  Winters are a little cold there?  Winters are cold and they had this habit of exploiting the young people.  You know, they felt like you were there to service the glory of old  Cornell, and while you   re starving to death that   s kind of hard to put up  with. But I tell you what, I had a lot of faculty that were strong believers  in what I could do and they actually molded me to be a good teacher,  motivated me to be a good teacher and to put that as number one.  What was the Dean Harry W. Orr Award that you received?  Yeah, I think that   s given to a second-year student that has the highest  academic average. It   s given in the fall of their third year, I believe.  Harry Orr, second dean of the veterinary school, from what   I didn   t  know him personally, as obviously I didn   t know Clarence McElroy. But  the thing that I learned about these two men, particularly Clarence  McElroy, is they had a strong sense of social justice and there was no  games played. I mean, Clarence McElroy negotiated so that the women  in Texas could go to veterinary school. They were forbidden to go to vet  school at Texas A M because they didn   t take women and so Clarence  McElroy negotiated an agreement between the Board of Regents of  Oklahoma and the Board of Regents of Texas. So Texas women came to  Oklahoma State (then Oklahoma A M) and we   re going back into the  early 1950s now, so a man of his era to have that sensitivity for gender  issues and there were some other things that I can   t put on film, but you  know, this man believed in doing the right thing and that   s always been  a motivation to me.  Was he Dean of Students, Dean of Men several years at a university  12  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  before he became dean of the college?  Yeah, I think so. Yes, I believe he was.  Turning from OSU for awhile, you went to Cornell?  I went to Cornell. I did an internship and a residency there in small  animal.  Could you share your career after you got back to OSU?  Yeah, I was there at Cornell for three years and then we left in 1972 and  I joined the faculty at the University of Georgia. Georgia was in the  midst of a total rebuilding of their veterinary college. It was not a very  highly-rated veterinary college at that point in time, and the president at  the University of Georgia  Fredrick C. Davison  was a Georgia graduate,  a veterinarian. So he was moving very quickly to try and change the  whole university, and so I was there from 1972 until 1988. I went  through all the academic ranks, served as their associate dean for  academic affairs. In 1985, I was asked to be the dean here at Oklahoma  State at that time, and I eventually had to turn that position down  because of family reasons.  And then in 1988 I went to Kansas State as the Dean of Veterinary  Medicine. I was dean there from 1988 until 1994. I returned to the  faculty and back to clinics. I loved clinical work, and I loved being with  the students and the trainees in clinics. So I went back to the clinics and  then Dr. Joe Alexander, who   d been a good friend of mine for a long  time, he came to Cornell ,about the time I was leaving, for his training  program. We   d been friends for a long time, and I   ll have to tell you in a  moment a little story about him going to a football game at Kansas State.  I might as well tell that story now.  Go ahead.  This was back when Barry Sanders was playing for Oklahoma State, and  I invited Joe to come to Manhattan and go to a Kansas State football  game and of course K-State was pretty god awful at that time. It was  prior to Bill Snyder coming. And so it was one of those really nice fall  afternoons and, by gosh, K-State gets out in front of Oklahoma State 28-  0. Oklahoma State can   t do anything the first half. They   re fumbling.  They   re kicking. They   re just awful, and so at halftime the score is 35-7  in favor of Kansas State. I believe that   s the score   anyway they were  way ahead. And so Alexander   s about ready to truck it back down here  to Stillwater, and some lady sitting behind him patted him on the  shoulder and said,    Now, now, now. We   ll still lose it    Joe turned to me  13  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  and said,    Is that the mindset of the fans up here?    and I said,    Wait,  they might still lose it.    The score ended up 55 or 58-35 Oklahoma  State. Barry ran wild the second half, and the woman kept telling Joe,    I  told you so. I told you so.    (Laughs)  So anyway I   d really decided, Jerry, that I was going to spend the rest of  my life doing clinical work, and the Associate Dean for Academic  Affairs position opened here and Dr. Alexander asked me to apply and at  first I said no. I did not see myself going back to administration. So  some of the alums down here, particularly classmates, they called me  and they didn   t shame me, but they basically said, you know,    What  kind of an alum are you? You owe it to go down and take a look.    So we  did. We drove down and I interviewed for the position and going back to  Manhattan, we got up to the Blackwell interchange and stopped at a  Braum   s and I told Velda, I said,    We   re going back to Stillwater.     The thing that sold me at that time was the cohesiveness of the faculty  here, something that I didn   t really sense at Kansas State. There   s a lot  of bickering and turfing and that kind of stuff going on at K-State and  here they were a smaller faculty but they seemed to be pulling together.  They knew where they wanted to go. They knew how they wanted to  teach. They knew what their curriculum wanted to be, and they had just  decided on a new curriculum. They needed somebody with experience to  come in and implement it. In August of 1997, on a Saturday, we married  our youngest daughter. On Sunday we had a reception. Sunday night I   m  in Stillwater and I start my job that Monday, and Wednesday Velda   s  down here in a truck with all of our belongings   and so we made a  quick exit from Manhattan to Stillwater. Gosh, have I enjoyed it since  I   ve been back.  And you came as Associate Dean for Research?  For Academic Affairs     Academic Affairs.  Which was a job I held at Georgia and that   s the job of dealing with the  students, dealing with curriculum, dealing with admissions   thought I  had the perfect job and then 2001 came around. (Laughs)  Which you then become interim Dean     Yeah, in 2001 Dr. Alexander decided to become the Interim Vice  President for Research and I was asked to be the Interim Dean. Dr.  Halligan came to see me, paid me a personal visit, and twisted my arm  pretty hard because I really had some reluctance about getting into the  14  Gill  Lorenz  deanship again. And so I decided to do it and I was the interim dean for  three years and then the administration on campus became stable, they  had a search and then I became the real dean in 2004, but I count those  three years, so I suspect I   ve done this now for seven years, going on  eight.  You mentioned a little bit about the cohesiveness of the faculty, but of  course, in addition to the appeal of being your alma mater, were there  other factors that weighed in your decision? Because you did step down  from a deanship to associate dean.  Well, I   d been a dean, but I was back on faculty. I   d already stepped  down from the deanship at K-State, okay. I was back on the faculty for  three years and   oh, I think there was this draw for me to be reunited  with people in Oklahoma. I love people in Kansas. It took awhile   it  takes awhile for people in Kansas to really get to know you and accept  you. I was at Georgia for 16 years and my two older kids graduated from  high school in Athens. My youngest daughter graduated from high  school in Manhattan, Kansas. But growing up as an Okie   and I use that  term a lot, and I don   t find it derogatory. Okies are facetious. We love to  twist it just a little bit, make fun of it just a little bit. People in Kansas  took everything you said literally, even when you were being facetious.  Down here people know it. You know, they know when you   re full of  BS and so I   ve enjoyed that.  And what I found out has been that I   m the first dean that   s a graduate of  this college. We   ve had other interim deans for short periods of time that  were Oklahoma State graduates, but no dean has really been a graduate  of the college. That has played really, really well with the alums. While I  think it puts some additional pressure on me, it   s also been a real help,  and I   ve gone out and I   ve embraced those alumni in a way that I don   t  think any dean in the past has embraced them and they   ve been really,  really receptive to that. When you come to the end of the day and you  say, what   s really good about any college? It   s your faculty, it   s your  students and it   s your alumni. You can talk about great deans and  whatever, but if you go back and really look at great deans, the really  good ones are the ones that understand the strength of seeing the alumni,  the faculty and the students. And you surround yourself with really,  really strong people that have that same vision, and so our alums have  responded really, really well.  I   m also known as a very straight shooter from the standpoint of I won   t  twist it, try to tell you as straight as I can. The alums think there   s been a  lot of positive things that have happened in the veterinary school in the  last seven years   not to say there weren   t positive things before, I would  never say that. But I think what we   ve accomplished here is a great  15  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  warmth and openness and when they have issues, they know they get  addressed. They   re thrilled with the response they   re getting out of our  hospital and out of our diagnostic lab. We   ve gone from having a  reputation of being unresponsive and uncaring to being warm, friendly,  communicating and,    Man, I   d send you another case. You   re really  doing a good job.    And that translates into people then that are willing to  say,    It   s annual fund time. Maybe I   ll write you a check or I   ll send you  a student or here   s this very wealthy donor I will send to you.    And  those are the reasons that you really want to be out there embracing your  alumni; plus I   m one of them.  Speaking of being one of them, is it special to you, Mike, to be     Absolutely.     where you got your initial training?  It   s the most special thing I   ve ever done. I don   t think I would have  ever considered being Dean again anywhere else, and believe me I   ve  had several opportunities to leave Oklahoma State since I   ve been  here   been here 11 years, and this is where I   m going to finish. It   s just  that special relationship that I have with our students, I have with our  faculty, and I know I have with all of our alumni, and there   s just a  synergism there. It works here, and finally it   s a place where when I talk  about orange and the Cowboys, it   s real, you know. And at Kansas State  I   m talking about purple and white and Wildcats and whatever, and I  probably believed in it while I was there, but it   s not like being here.  And I like the way that this veterinary school gets things done. We are  not the richest. In fact, we   re probably on the other end, but don   t tell us  no. If you tell us no, it   ll happen. We   ll figure out how to do it, and I just  love that   not to say we couldn   t do with a lot more resources, but it   s  that pioneer spirit and    we can get this job done.    I have faculty come  here from Georgia. I   ve had a faculty member this morning   I was on  the faculty with him at the University of Georgia. He   s visiting and their  comment is,    We don   t see how you guys get it done with the size of  your faculty    and whatever, and my response is,    We just know how to  out-work you.    (Laughs)  When you got here, what were some initial challenges that you faced?  I think that the biggest challenge that I faced when I got here was our  graduates didn   t like us real well, and that was unusual. It was. The  Cornell graduates liked Cornell because they believed in the fact that  Cornell was the best in the world. Whether that was true or not, those  Cornell graduates believed it. Georgia did not have the camaraderie that  16  Cornell had. There were some issues there with alums and recent  graduates and how they respected the school. Where I really saw  graduates respect the school was at K-State, and let me tell you, that was  campus-wide. It wasn   t just in the vet school. Man, they believed in that.  They were Wildcats to the core. K-State   50 percent of that class was  out-of-state, and they turned those kids into this loyal    we   re going to  support this veterinary school.     I came to Oklahoma State and what I found was students that were  disgruntled. They had a    you owe me    attitude, and I   m thinking,    Gee  whiz, this is not what we   ve got to have.    So the way I attacked that was  making sure that the student body knew that the faculty was in charge of  this, and this associate dean was going to back them up. But at the same  time if the students had legitimate concerns, they were going to be  addressed. They wouldn   t be swept under the rug, we would address  them, but I was not going to go down and be hard on a faculty member  because they gave a hard test.  I remember a young man in the third year class, who was well known for  being very, very outspoken, and he walked into my office one day and  said,    Dr. Lorenz, here   s another example of what I   m talking about,     and he throws down an exam that had been given in small animal  orthopedic surgery by a faculty member named Mark Rochat. I picked  up that exam and I pretended like I was looking at it and I leafed through  it. I laid it down and I said,    You know what I   m going to do?    I said,     I   m going to pick up the telephone and I   m going to call Dr. Rochat,     and this student broke out in a great big grin, and I said,    You know  what I   m going to tell him? I   m going to tell him, thank you very much  for upholding the high academic standards of this veterinary school.     And that was the last time he came into my office.  Now this may seem high-handed, but students, if they respect you,   they  will work really, really hard, and you don   t have to give them  anything, and there   s a difference between giving it and respect because  you   re trying to make them a really, really good doctor. That   s what I  went to work on, turning that around to where the students understand  what we   re doing, know that you care about them but you   re not going  to tolerate a whole bunch of shenanigans and we   re going to have high  standards. Now we went to work on improving our national board  performance. That culminated in the Class of 2003 having some of the  highest scores this college has ever seen   100 percent pass the first time  they take it. They set the national average, and we   ve done pretty well  since then on our boards, and so we   ve turned it around. We   ve got  students today that want to get engaged in legislative activities. They  want to get engaged with alumni activities. They   re coming to their class  reunions. We see them at alumni receptions, and so I think the difference  17  Gill  Lorenz  is engaging them positively and being honest with them.  The other thing that has helped me here is I have stayed engaged in the  classroom. I refuse to quit teaching. When they tell me I   m too old, I   m  too outdated or whatever, then I   ll quit   but I was in a classroom at  noon today. Ninety students in there taking an elective. They don   t have  to take that class. Now one class is 75 to 80 students, so we   ve got a lot  of second year and third year students in that class, and that   s helped me.  It gives me an identity with the students. You know, they see Mike  Lorenz, real faculty member, in the classroom, this man will go to the  wall for them, but at the same time if they   re not doing what they   re  supposed to do, he can be just as tough with them as well. So I think  having that rapport with the students, being in class with them, has been  a real asset.  When you came here, what was your early vision for the college? I know  that   s not how it works sometimes, but where did you see the college  going, particularly as you moved into the role of      Well, when I moved into the dean   s role, at that time what I was doing  was trying to protect the college because that was a time when the  budgets went south and everybody was retrenching. But as I looked at  the veterinary college from outside, my concern was that Oklahoma  State   s veterinary school was a place where young people went, young  people got good training, young people would go to faculty, they  wouldn   t stay there very long. And so my mission was, how do we solve  that? What were some of the ways we could make that work so that  people came here and said,    Gosh, I want to spend 10-15 years here,     and at the same time you want young people to join your faculty to  develop a resume so that they   re competitive to go somewhere else. I  mean, that   s good, too. But it just looked to me like there was too much  turnover and particularly in the Department of Clinical Sciences   and  then get the curriculum rolling.  The veterinary school at that time was making some moves to  reestablish their research program. That was being done through an  endowed chairs program. My predecessor, Joe Alexander, had been  quite successful in doing endowed chairs and professorships. When I  took over in 2001, there were 12 that were in place at that point in time.  There are now 16, so we   ve added four. I believe in a budgeting process  that   s totally transparent. I   m not a dean that likes to control the gold,  therefore I can control the people through the budget. We have deployed  all of the resources, and the units like that   they like that   and we have  great communication with them. So at that point it was to just stay  solvent. As we moved along, we   ve moved along in two areas  simultaneously, and one is to continually build our research program but  18  Gill  Lorenz  at the same time make sure that we are not shortchanging the teaching  program and the work that we do at our hospital in our diagnostic lab.  And so we tried some things out here that the main campus has not been  willing to try. For instance, we did some things that provided huge  incentives to research faculty. Since we provided those incentives, we   ve  had no research faculty leave, and my strategy was we had to become  more businesslike. You know, the days of the state of Oklahoma  handing us the resources we need are gone. In fact, if things continue the  way they continue, you may be dealing with fewer resources, certainly  as a percentage of your budget. So I had to convince people that they  could go out and help themselves. You know, there was an attitude in  the clinics,    Well until the state brings us more money, we   re not going  to do this,    And my response to them was,    If you see more cases, you  generate more revenue. That   s healthy for our students over here  because they   re seeing more cases.    Now there   s a practice plan. You  get revenue because of that additional salary.  I believe in looking at all of your operations and saying if a business can  do that better, let the private industry have it. We have a national  laboratory working in the center of our teaching hospital and the clinical  path ology  lab.  When  we were running it, we weren   t making any  money. In fact, we were losing money. Nobody wanted to run it   da ta  da ta da. Put it out   national lab said,    We   ll bid on that thing.    So  today it operates in the center of our teaching hospital   Antech Labs, on  Farm Road. We get samples in here from all over the United States.  We   ve enriched our teaching because of it. We   ve decreased our costs in  our college by over  250,000 because of it, and there   s revenue going  into the teaching hospital. So I want to look for additional things that we  might do that are like that. We   re looking at ways of changing our  enrollment, maybe increasing our enrollment to get more revenue into  the college. So you   ve got to be very entrepreneurial and you   ve got to  be able to say I   m going to take a risk and do this or do that.  You   ve already covered some of these, but what achievements and  innovations in the college during your tenure as dean gives you the most  professional satisfaction and personal pride, including teaching,  research, service to the profession, etc.?  Well, I think we   ve gone along three ways. One is making sure that the  teachers know how highly valued they are and putting some additional  resources with the good teachers so that teaching can use innovative  technology, make sure our classrooms are equipped. We   ve done some  things with distance education where we   ve actually imported  coursework live from sites away from Stillwater to provide elective  courses for our veterinary students. I think we   re one of the leaders in  19  Gill  Lorenz  veterinary colleges in doing that. I really am pleased with the progress  we   ve made in the hospital, equipment that we   ve been able to get into  our hospital. A lot of this is through private fundraising. Some of it has  come through revenue, but if it wasn   t for private gifts we would be  hurting for equipment. Getting all of the imaging, the radiology system  digitalized, getting an advanced CT unit in here   so making sure that   s  happened. Getting the addition to the diagnostic lab which was sorely  needed and then in research it   s been this    Let   s don   t lose sight of our  focus here. Let   s not try to spread ourselves out too thin. Let   s get these  areas of emphasis and let   s stay with it.     And one that I   m going to really feel proud about when it   s finished is  that one of the strengths here for a long time has been parasitology,  veterinary parasitology. It   s an area that other veterinary schools have  said,    They   ve got all the stuff out there. We don   t need to teach very  much about parasitology.    But that   s a huge issue in Oklahoma and  we   ve had the strength, we   ve got Wendell Krull. Everett Besch, who  founded the veterinary school down at LSU   he was a faculty member  here teaching it   Sidney Ewing, Katherine Kocan, just to name a few of  some of those early folks. What we   re doing is we   re raising money  privately through industry to establish the National Center for Veterinary  Parasitology here, and so the whole purpose of this is nationally and  internationally when people say,    Veterinary parasitology   where do I  go train? Where would I send this sample?    They   ll say,    That   s  Oklahoma State. That   s easy. There   s where the national center is.     We   ve been out trying to raise a million dollars and we   ve raised about   700,000 so far to get that center going   and so there   s a strength we   ve  had, we   ve maintained it. We made sure we kept plenty of faculty in  parasitology. Pathology   s another area, and so what   you know, I   ve  looked at our history, our strengths, and said,    Okay, if you hire the right  kind of people, they can motivate this.    Well, we made one really good  hire in parasitology. We brought one of the best teachers from the  University of Georgia  Susan Little , and she came here. She   s in a chair  and she   s leading this charge and we   re not going to be like Cornell or  Georgia, but boy most things we choose to pursue we   re very, very  strong.  How would you describe the college experience for students today?  What is special about OSU that you encourage students to come to the  OSU College of Veterinary Medicine?  Well, I think the greatest thing I see on this campus, something that I  saw when I was a student here but really enjoy it now that I   m back,  (I   m out here on this west 40 acres so I don   t get over to campus as  much.) when I walk on campus, there   s this genuine sense of  20  Gill  Lorenz  friendliness. What I tell people is when you walk on the OSU campus  and somebody says,    Hi, how are you?    They really mean it   and I  don   t care whether you   re a faculty member or student, students talking  to faculty members or whatever, you know we stop for our students  when they   re in a crosswalk   generally we do   people are impressed.     So what do you do with your students in a crosswalk?       Well, we run  over them.    (Laughter) I said,    Well, they   re the ones that are paying  your way here. Come on.    And so there   s a lot of things for students to  do here. It   s a very safe environment for people to send their  youngsters   and if you want to find out what our students and our  faculty think, go to our website and we   ve got little video excerpts out  there talking about   these are primarily faculty that got their degrees  here from this veterinary school and went to Oklahoma State, telling  them about the experience. Now we   ve got some that didn   t, and they  bought into this OSU business as well, but if I had a crisis here this  afternoon, I could walk down the hall or pick up the phone and I would  have the faculty and the administration lined up ready to go. I mean  that   s just how cohesive it works here. People say,    Well don   t you ever  have people that are disgruntled?    Well sure we do, but our bottom line  is we   re too small to fight. It takes too much time. (Laughs)  And the campus is beautiful. That   s the other thing.  You know, my wife is now reading a book by Angie Debo   it   s her  description about Oklahoma and the early days of Oklahoma, and she  makes a statement in there that what characterizes an Okie is his  constant searching for affirmation. You know what I mean? And I find  myself when there   s faculty coming here to interview and from out of  state, I   ll say to them,    Is this your first trip to Oklahoma?    And they   ll  say,    Yes.       Well, what were you expecting? Did you think cars didn   t  have rubber tires? And did you think it was all about Steinbeck and The  Grapes of Wrath?    And they   re extremely complimentary. The first  impressions here in Stillwater and of this university are really, really a  plus. They find the campus beautiful. We like to put them up over in the  Student Union in the Atherton. Well they think that   s      Wow, you guys  have got that.    And then I like to take them over to the Athletic Hall of  Fame and point out to them,    You didn   t think we were very good at  athletics. Walk around in here for awhile and it   ll change your tune.     Thirty-three national championships in wrestling helps us, right?  In your opinion, how is the profession changing and what is the College  of Veterinary Medicine doing to address the needs and opportunities  created by that change?  That   s a very insightful question. There have been huge changes. One  has been the feminization of the profession. You know, veterinary  21  Gill  Lorenz  classes now are 70-80 percent women in most veterinary schools, and  last year the number of women veterinarians now outnumber the number  of men veterinarians in this country. So women are going to become the  leaders of the profession. They   re going to be the practice owners, and I  think the profession has struggled with that a bit. We should have paid  attention to Clarence McElroy back in the 1950s when he said,    This is a  non-issue    and I think by and large veterinary medicine has braced it  fairly well, but you know it brings up the issues of raising children  during school, being pregnant during school, how do you deal with it? I  think we   ve got a pretty good handle on that.  The second part about veterinary medicine that   s been a change has been  the rapid rise of small animal medicine and the rapid rise of  specialization within small animal medicine. If you look at TV today,  veterinarians are characterized as being somebody   s dog or cat doctor,  and a lot of Americans do not know the very rich heritage from which  veterinary medicine came and a lot of the careers that a veterinarian, a  new graduate, is suited for: public health government work, large animal  work, whatever. Now this gender shift along with this tremendous draw  for small animal specialization has created some issues that are of great  worry to me and I think a great worry to the profession. One, there is a  shortage of young people that want to go back to rural communities and  practice. There   s a multitude of reasons why that   s happened, okay, and  in a moment I   ll tell you what our strategies have been. Two, there   s  such a draw for the specialized practices, the private practices. We   re  having one devil of a time hiring faculty in our small animal hospitals  and even sometimes in equine, and they   re making a lot more money,  they have better hours, etc. and so that   s been an issue. So those are the  big ones. At a time when the federal government   everybody says  we   ve got to have more veterinarians, the number thrown out over the  next five years, a deficiency of 15,000 veterinarians in the United States,  realizing we   re only graduating about 2,300-2,500 veterinarians every  year.  Is bioterrorism a part of that issue?  Bioterrorism is a part of that, homeland security, USDA, and  veterinarians have this unique comparative medicine education. Well, let  me tell you how we think you address this, and we don   t think you  address this by, at least for us, doing anything real novel with how you  train a veterinarian. We think the best trained veterinarian to enter a  variety of careers is the way we   ve been training them for a number of  years, and that is we train primary care veterinarians here and they   re  very good. And the reason they   re good is they get a lot of hands-on  animal experience and we don   t try to cover them up with all of the  referral cases and tertiary care things that they   re probably not going to  22  Gill  Lorenz  do without a lot more education. What we want them to do is feel really  comfortable and really confident in being a primary care doctor. That   s  what rural America needs. That   s what a small animal practice needs. If  they   re going to go into some of these other careers, it   s going to take  additional education.  We offer a research experience for our students. Those that want to go  into research, they have a research track that they enter during the  summer. We have an NIH  National Institutes of Health  program that  they can go in and actually start a Ph.D. program while they   re  veterinarians, but the vast majority of the students coming here want to  be    practitioners    for a period of time. Encouraging more of our students  to look at internships and residency and clinical training, even if they  don   t come back to academia they   ll make three, four, five times the  amount of money they will make as just going into a practice as an  associate veterinarian. So I want the public to know a lot more about  what veterinarians do other than what they see on Animal Planet.  And the other big issue has been the human-animal bond. We   ve  watched dogs and cats become surrogate kids, and that   s good for the  profession. People have discretionary money. They   ll spend a lot of  money on their dogs and cats. That has really energized the  specialization over here in small animal. But when you   re out in rural  Oklahoma, it   s a little different scenario. So I think our kids are really  well prepared and I guess what I enjoy the most is listening to  practitioners from other veterinary schools practicing in other states that  say,    You know, Dean Lorenz, I   d hire an Oklahoma State graduate  before I   d hire one from my own vet school.       Why would you do that?        Well, they know what to do when they come out of vet school.        Good.    Enough said.  Just tagging on to some of the conversations we had, what do you see as  the challenge or the two or three things in the next five or ten years out  there on the horizon in your profession that the college here is going to  need to address?  I think for colleges of veterinary medicine the issue is seeing the funding  base change from state support to state assistance. When I came here in  1997, state was probably funding 45 to 50 percent of this budget. It   s  now funding less than 30 percent of our operating budget. So figuring  out how to get those resources to keep your program going and how can  you be innovative? How do you decrease costs within your program?  That   s a huge challenge. And the faculty issue   hiring faculty, retaining  faculty   this is a huge issue for veterinary schools throughout the  United States and Canada. Again, there   s so many opportunities out  there for these highly-trained people   private practice, industry,  23  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  government work, things like that that pay salaries higher than what we  are. So we struggle here to be competitive with private practice. We are  quite competitive salary-wise. In fact, we lead this whole campus.  Yeah, I forgot about mentioning this. I think one of the things I   m really  going to look back on was while I was dean, we made all the effort to  bring ourselves to the national average for salaries, for faculty, as  assistant, associate and full professors, and we got there. We lead this  entire OSU system in where we rank compared to our peers in salary,  and we made some decisions that were instrumental. When times were  tough and we needed to keep faculty, we cannibalized some faculty  positions and took that money and raised the salary of faculty, and it has  paid off quite well from the standpoint of how we compete with other  veterinary schools. When the campus looks at their salary base and they  look at veterinary medicine,    Well, you don   t have any issues out there.     Well, yeah, we do because we   re competing over here to this private  side. Yeah.  Looking back, Mike, and you   ve still got a few years left, what do you  think will be your legacy as Dean of the College of Veterinary  Medicine?  Well, as you look back on that, I don   t know. I would like to think it   s  the style of administration I brought in here. It   s a style that I really  believe in and, you know, steward leadership I guess, being able to carry  on a role like the other faculty. I think the openness of the way we  operate, no surprises. I think people feel a part of that. I think that   s an  important part. You know, folks know this isn   t a game about Mike  Lorenz padding his resume because Mike Lorenz isn   t going anywhere.  It   s like Boone Pickens said last night,    I   ve made enough money for  myself    (Laughs) when they asked him about the Pickens Plan      You   re still working on your first billion.  Yeah, I   m still working on my first billion. That   s the hardest. So what  I   m really striving to do right now is I want to leave that teaching  hospital in better shape than it   s ever been facility-wise, equipment-wise.  We need an addition to that teaching hospital. It   s called an academic  center. We   re trying to raise money privately and with the state. We   re  trying to get a critical care unit built for equine. That   s a  3 million piece  of change. We   ve raised about  1.3 million   got a million from the  Gaylord Foundation, the first gift they ever gave to Stillwater   and you  see the state of Oklahoma   s vet school just happens to be in Stillwater.  Don   t get me wrong, we bleed orange out here, too. And so those are  important. And it   s so important to our faculty and clinical faculty, and  then we have a research addition that needs to be built in order for us to  24  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  continue to expand our research operation, so I hope it   ll just be a whole  bunch of things. But I think people will say,    I just liked working with  him. He was a good guy. Honest, didn   t keep all the money in the dean   s  office.    (Laughs)  Mike, is there anything that we haven   t covered that we need to discuss  for the College of Veterinary Medicine?  No, just having come back and worked with it and don   t get me wrong, I  had a great experience at Cornell and we loved our experience at  Georgia and there were lots of good things that happened at K-State, but  for me personally, the last 11 years, this has been the best for me, and  again I think it goes back to this grit and fight and    we   re going to figure  out how to do it    attitude that we have here. I just love these students  and the majority of them are going to go out and going to be fine,  upright citizens and they   re going to be great representatives of this  university, and I think there   s many of them in each class that are going  to be leaders in the profession. Yup, a good place. In fact, I think it   s  probably better than the state deserves given the small budget that they  give us. (Laughs)  This is campaign season and there is your political announcement.  Thank you, Mike. Appreciate it.  You   re welcome. Thanks for doing this.  Back to a couple of questions. We talked about earlier  about how you   enjoy this position of Dean and all the challenges and    opportunities     you had, you have to have a lot of passion for them. Would you share a  little bit of your passion about Oklahoma State?  Well, I think anybody that   s around me very long realizes that,    He   s the  orange-est dean on campus.    Has a great passion for the place, not only  just the athletic part of it but the whole thing that embodies this  university and it comes across to people. One of the things I did early on  was I   ve taken to wearing orange socks.  I was going to ask you about that. Of course I   ve got to ask you, I notice  you didn   t have your orange tie on today. (Laughs) You already  apologized for that, so that   s okay, but     If I   d have remembered we were doing this, I certainly wouldn   t have on  this, but it   s got dogs on it so that   s okay. But I normally have on  something that   s orange every day. In fact, my sport coat over there has  got Pistol Pete on it. That   s the other thing. Look around my office.  Look at all this Pistol Pete stuff.  25  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  I ought to pan around right now. Let   s hear the story about the orange  socks though.  Okay, the story about the orange socks. Well, I started wearing them and  people started calling some attention to them. I wore them every Friday  and I wore them at all athletic events, and so I hit on this idea that the  veterinary school needed something that would just sort of bind the  alumni together. So I decided that we would develop this Loyal and True  Order of Orange Socks, and so it   s   I wrote a little script and randomly  we chose folks to be inducted into the Loyal and True Order of the  Orange Socks.  Can I back up, Mike? Where did you get the orange socks? I mean,  that   s a little different.  Where did I get them?  No, where   d you get the idea of orange socks?  Well my wife knew that I had this passion for orange, and she   d been up  at Chris     University Spirit  one day and she   d brought me home this  pair of orange socks that   s got the OSU logo all over them. I started  wearing them and people started making attention to it. So then I get this  idea   ahhh, this could be good. Alumni want to know if I   ve got them  on,    Where   s your orange socks, Dr. Lorenz?       Hey, Mike, where   s  your orange socks?    So I wrote this little script and basically, the script  is written so that Pistol Pete Frank Eaton is the person who   s involved in  this and he speaks out of heaven to describe who will be the next  inductees into this and it   s a neat little ceremony. We do it at alumni  receptions. We do it sometimes here in the college, and the two criteria  are: You have to be an alum of the vet school   that   s one criteria   or  you   ve been willing to give your last drop of blood for the veterinary  college   and so we have about 20 people in it now.  And Vet Cetra, our college newsletter, will have a story about the orange  socks in it this time. But when I go to alumni receptions, that   s what  they want. They want to know who   s going to be, and people are coming  up,    Hey, Dean Lorenz, do I qualify? When can I be in this thing?    So  you don   t overdo it. You want them to continually want to do this, and  they   ll come to these receptions   they   ll have those orange socks on and  they   ll show them and   there   s a little piece of it that says,    This stands  for Orange Socks United.    (Laughter) Hokey but you know sometimes  things like that, that work, so I   ll probably be known for orange socks  when I quit.  Well, but really, there is a message obviously about what you   re saying  26  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  and going back to a previous part of our conversations about engaging  alumni was I think one of your challenges and one of your goals as part  of your ongoing vision. Can you talk a little bit more about alumni  relations and some things you   ve done to engage and involve alumni of  the college to get their resources, also?  When I came in 1997, this rancor between the practitioners and the  alums in the veterinary school was going full blast and development  people had gone out to with the idea that we   re just going to go around  and call on people and get them to donate money. Well, they got their  heads cut off, okay, and so when I got here in 1997, the development  officer was Mary Curl and she also worked with John Cathey and they  told me about what was happening. Since I was an alum, what could I  add? I said,    Well, let   s go hold town hall meetings.    And when you go  on veterinarians    turf, you don   t let them totally run the program but  you   ve got to be willing to listen.  Well we started doing town hall meetings, and veterinarians are like  elephants   they never forget a bad experience. You can do 10 things  right, but they   ll always bring up that one bad thing. So we went out, and  they had problems with admissions and they had problems with referrals  and they had problems with this faculty member and so we sat and we  listened. We didn   t judge, and I knew it would talk itself out, but the fact  that you   re willing to go and listen to it. Driving back they said,    How  do you sit there and listen to all that?    I said,    Look. I   m a clinician. I  am used to listening to veterinarians ream me. I   m used to clients calling  me a liar and everything else. I mean it just comes with the territory.     And so slowly what happened is town hall meetings became positive  because now you   re out and you   re talking about what you   re doing.  About how many a year were you making, Mike?  Four or five. We   re not doing very many right now. We need to get back  to doing them. We do about a couple per year now. The veterinarians  say,    Don   t do them anymore, Mike Lorenz, because you   re  communicating with us.    We   ve opened up the communications. We do  a weekly e-mail newsletter. It   s called Net Vet Weekly. It goes out to the  Oklahoma Veterinary Medical Association list serve. That thing is a  weekly dialogue about what   s happening in the veterinary school. So we  turned it around from rancor to acceptance and listening and knowing  that if they called, it wasn   t put on the shelf. I have a rule here   if  there   s anything I   m really staunch about, the time to talk to somebody  that   s unhappy is now, not three days from now, because three days  from now they   re just madder because you didn   t talk to them. People  have bought into this and so if we have a problem with the teaching  hospital, I don   t worry about it. Mark Neer, our teaching hospital  27  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  director, he handles it just like that and that   s different than the way we  used to do it where, you know, oh maybe we   d deal with it, maybe we  would,    We couldn   t have done that wrong   da-ta-da-ta-da.    So that, I  think, with our practitioners and with our alumni, and this transparency  that they see.  Now what we   ve done is, we don   t mind asking them. I was told that our  alumni had no money and wouldn   t give us money. That   s what I was  told when I came here, and I thought, well veterinarians are not very  wealthy. I understand that, but the biggest donor that this vet school ever  received was from a guy by the name of Sitlington, one of our alums  brought him to this university. Deans didn   t find him. Presidents didn   t  find him. It was a veterinarian that graduated from here that brought a  Walter Sitlington to the university, and the rest is history. Unfortunately  that alumnus never was given the credit for finding the person. Well, he  has been now, but we have an alum that   s just signed two  5 million  deferred gifts with us   lives in California, one of our alums. This is not  about just raising money from them, but our alumni know because they  were students here, they know where the strengths are. They know  where the deficiencies are. They understand the importance of  scholarship. They understand the importance of equipment, and I   m  hearing from them everywhere,    How can I help?     Do you gauge them in terms of curriculum advisement, practice  advisement and things like that?  We have a Dean   s Development Associate group that   s got several of  our alumni on it. I did have a committee that worked with the veterinary  school through the Oklahoma Veterinary Medical Association. That  committee doesn   t meet anymore. They said,    We don   t need to. We  know what   s going on.    My advice to them is,    Yeah, but if Lorenz isn   t  your Dean in a couple of years and you get a ringer, you know, how are  you going to respond?    I sit on the Oklahoma Veterinary Medicine  Executive Board, and so every time they meet, here   s this dialogue from  the veterinary school. I just think we   ve opened it up to where we   ve  done a much better job. Well, one strategy was we   re a secret nobody  knows about. We are going to market this place better. The university   s  done a better job at that, okay. So we   re doing that better and constantly  extolling what your alumni have done. You   ve just got to keep doing  that, and whether they   re in a small animal practice in Tulsa or a rural  practice in Vinita, they all have something very, very, very positive to  bring to the table and if you want them to support you, you   ve got to  listen to them and actually have the passion for what they   re doing.  You know, that   s what I   ve noticed. When you bring them back for  special recognition, for class reunions, it seems like yourself as Dean  28  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  Gill  Lorenz  and college administrators and faculty are engaged and involved in  those activities with them.  We make it a point. We   re going to be doing our fall conference this  weekend and, bad back and all, Mike Lorenz will be there to make as  many of those class reunions. It   s not to give them a pledge card. It   s  just to walk in and say,    I   m proud that I   m one of you.    And that plays  well and you see folks, I think that   s one of Burns Hargis    strengths right  now is that he   s an alum. They   re going to accept him far more than  they   re going to accept somebody from the outside, and you just hope  you   ve got somebody good from the inside doing stuff like that and  hopefully I   ve been good for the college.  Mike, do you have anything else?  No.  Okay we   ve got it. I appreciate it very much. Thank you.  You bet.  -------  -------
