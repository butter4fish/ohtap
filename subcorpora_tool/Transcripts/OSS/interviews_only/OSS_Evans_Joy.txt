 Sherman with the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Today we are visiting with Joy Evans in her home in  Stillwater, Oklahoma. We   re going to discuss her Ethiopian experiences.  This interview is being conducted as part of the O-STATE Stories  Project. First off, I   d like to thank you for allowing me into your home  and allowing me this opportunity to interview you.  You   re quite welcome.  Let us begin by having you discuss where you grew up, and that type of  biographical information.  I grew up in three different states. I was born in Arkansas in my  grandparents    home. My mother was born in the back bedroom. I was  born in the front bedroom. It was one of the hottest days of the year and  my mother   s Uncle Ott, her mother   s brother, had brought in an oil well  in Texas, I believe. Everybody that came got to hear Uncle Ott   s story  about the oil well, and she was pretty bored with that by the time  I was  born . I don   t know whether that brought on my birth or not, but that  was the chain of events. My father was a minister and school teacher.  My mother was a school teacher. We moved to Kansas when I was in  the sixth grade. We moved to Oklahoma when I was starting the tenth  grade at Enid, and I graduated from Enid High School. I got my  bachelor   s degree there at Phillip   s University. Met and married my  husband in Enid.  What did your father do? What was his occupation?  He was educated. Well, my grandfather, his father, was a Methodist  minister, and there were eleven children. My father was the next to  oldest child, the oldest son of eleven children. At the end of the eighth  grade, he dropped out of school and went to work to help his father  5  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  support the family, because at that time, money was so tight that at one  point my grandfather had ten cents in his pocket, and that was all the  money that the family of thirteen had.  When my father was nineteen, he went back to school, graduated from  high school at twenty-one and went to a university where he got his  bachelor   s degree. Now, he wanted to be a minister, but the Methodist  Church at that time did not have enough churches to support all the  young ministers that they had. Certainly a different situation now. So  they encouraged young men to find a different occupation. So, he was  certified as a school teacher. I happen to have his testing scores, his  papers, among my collection of things.  My mother was born in Prescott, Arkansas. Her father was a blacksmith.  Mr. King was his partner, and he did the woodworking while my  grandfather did the metal work. My grandfather was an excellent  carpenter. We have some things that he made. His shop was located  right next to his brother   s photography shop.  I lived with my grandparents the winter I was five years old, because my  father had had a ruptured appendix back before penicillin. He had very  nearly died, and my mother had to leave  and go to their teaching  location . When they finally let him out of the hospital, she left him with  her parents and left me there. When he got well enough, he joined her  where they were teaching. There was no childcare facility there. I was a  preschooler, and so I spent that winter with my grandparents. My parents  would come see me, and a couple of times my grandmother put me on  the bus, complete with a tag pinned on me with my name and destination  and my shoebox lunch, and parked me right behind the bus driver, and I  went to see my parents.  What did your father teach?  I remember specifically science; he was also a basketball coach. His  boys lost the state championship in basketball, and that would have been  the year that I was in the fourth grade, which had to be in the mid-forties.  Before the end of World War II.  Like    43,    44?  Yes, about in there. My mother   s girls won the state championship. My  mother taught fourth grade, and she was the girls basketball coach.  And this was up in Kansas?  This was in Arkansas. At that time they were at Fountain Lake,  6  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Arkansas, which is about five miles outside of Hot Springs. Fountain  Lake School District.  So Central Arkansas?  Yes.  How did he come into Oklahoma then?  My father decided to go back to school. We had been living in Atwood,  Kansas, and my mother was going to go back to school. He had  developed high blood pressure, and she was going to go back to school  because at the time she got her education, when it was time for her  sister, the one next to her, to go to high school, they still had to pay to go  to school. It was somewhat debatable as to whether or not she would get  to go to school, if Grandfather could afford to pay for her high school  education. But he did do that. She was seven years older than my  mother.  When my mother graduated from high school, she kept a kindergarten  for a year or so to raise money for college tuition. She went to  Henderson State Teacher   s College. Henderson is a  Methodist   University in Arkansas. I know that in the biochemistry department,  Billy Hudson was one of the professors there, he got some of his training  at Henderson. We also know another person, Paul Bass, who was  affiliated with Henderson, and so I know it   s still going. It   s the old  university in Arkansas. Public education has not always been free.  We   re in another transition period.  So your father wanted to go back to school?  My father and mother both went to go back to school.  And that   s how they came into Oklahoma?  My father   s health failed (that was about 1950) and they continued to  live in Enid until 1975, when my mother had a stroke and we had to  bring them to us when we were living in Texas. So they were there  in  Enid  twenty-five years.  So they wanted to further their education at Phillips?  Yes. My mother got her bachelor   s degree there. We just sort of  automatically think that teachers had degrees, and think of it as always,  but that was not the case. In fact, when they had a certain number of  hours, they were eligible to teach. When she went back to school in  7  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  1950, she did not have a bachelor   s degree, but she completed her  bachelor   s degree and taught in Enid. She taught English in the Enid  school system.  And your father taught in the Enid school system, too?  No. He worked for Coldiron, which was a retail business.  Discuss a little bit what it was like to grow up in the late forties and  early fifties.  Ministers and school teachers moved around a lot. This is not a complete  history, but starting with Fountain Lake, which I had mentioned that  they were teaching there, my father went back into the ministry and we  moved to Piggott, Arkansas. We were there my fifth grade year. It   s now  a manufacturing town. That was during World War II, and a lot of things  were rationed, including shoes. There was a small business there that  made sandals. I was really hard on shoes. I wore out my shoes and used  up all my shoe stamps, and so I wore a lot of their sandals. Later, that  became a shoe manufacturing company, and that is one of the major  businesses there in Piggott, Arkansas.  From Piggott, we moved to Hiawatha, Kansas, and my father was the  minister of the First Christian Church there. I attended sixth, seventh and  eighth grades there. We moved to Atwood, Kansas, where my father was  the minister of the First Christian Church there, and I attended my ninth  and tenth grade years. Then they went back to school at Phillips  University. My mother got her bachelor   s degree, and I graduated from  Enid High School.  How big was Enid High School at the time?  It had about a thousand students at that time, and there were three high  schools in Enid at that time. There was Enid High School. There was the  Catholic high school that I was not even aware of until a tea for senior  girls. I became aware of the Catholic school when the Catholic young  ladies, accompanied by one of the sisters, attended the senior girls    tea.  There was also a black school there. That was during segregation.  I have always enjoyed art and have always been creative. I had done  well in the art program at Enid High School. Katherine Bales was the art  instructor, and she supervised the art program for the City of Enid. I  competed for a scholarship my junior year. Had I been eligible to start  college, I could have had the scholarship then, but I was just a junior. So  the next year, I competed again. I had a summer scholarship, I believe,  to K ansas -State. It   s been a long time ago. I   d have to look these things  8  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  up. I did have a scholarship for my freshman year in college at Phillips  University.  Was Vance Air Force Base there at the time?  Oh, yes. Vance has been there forever. And by the way, Vance Air Force  Base is named after the brother of Bill Vance, and the Vances were in  the program in Ethiopia, went the same year to Ethiopia that we did. But  it was Bill Vance   s older brother that Vance Air Force Base was named  after.  So the town back then was influenced by the base and its on-goings?  Well, I was not very aware of it during my high school years, but I  became aware of it while I was in college, because some of the young  men  from the air base  who were taking courses at the university dated  girls at the university.  So Enid back then, was it an ag town, or what was the type of  commerce?  I think Enid has always been an ag town. The big things were wheat, and  back then Pillsbury Mills was a big thing there, and Union Equity  Elevators were big grain storage centers. E.W. Puckett was, I believe,  president of the co-op there, and he was the one who designed the  hexagonal elevators. He was a staunch Baptist, and through Phillips  University he hired my father and my mother (I was the tag along) to  conduct worship services before each construction crew went on their   twelve hour  shift. So we went out at about 5:30 in the morning, and at  about 5:30 in the afternoon to conduct a worship service for those men  before they went on their shift. That was the first time, and I was still in  high school. Then they built another unit my freshman year in college,  and that was where I met my husband. He was working on the night  shift, he and his brother, and they attended worship services. That   s  where I met him.  I was going to ask how you met Conrad.  He had graduated. He had an interesting educational career, because a  lot of it was through the military, but he changed his major to Ag and  got his bachelor   s degree here at, then, Oklahoma A M. He and his  brother and his dad, and I believe that it actually was a three way thing.  His dad took them into an agricultural farming business. The family had  been in the community forever, and they were in very good standing.  The banker was a friend, and they had purchased a lot of farm  equipment on the strength of their good name. So he was farming in the  9  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  day time, and working on construction at night to pay for that farm  equipment.  And you went to Phillips University. What degree were you pursuing?  An Art Education degree.  Art Education? And your scholarship paid for that?  My scholarship was a one-year scholarship. Phillips University was a  church school, and consequently, they didn   t have the kind of  scholarships that are available now. I could live at home and go to  school, and financially I could not have gone to school under other  conditions. So I got my bachelor   s degree in three and a half years. My  husband and I were married between my junior and senior years in  college. My senior year was one semester long. I, at that time, was  working for Champlin Refining Company as a draftsman. We had  signed our teaching contracts. We lived at Hennessey. My husband had  taught there for a year. We signed teaching contracts for the fall, and we  had actually moved from our apartment into a house. We never even got  the bed set up, and we signed a contract to go to Ethiopia, contingent  upon release by Hennessey, and they did release us. After we   d been in  Ethiopia one year, they wanted Conrad to come back and teach at  Hennessey again. Our tours were two years, and then according to the  contract, we had to be outside the country for a while, but we wound up  spending twelve years in Ethiopia.  That   s a while there. Describe for us Phillips University, because  Phillips University is no longer in existence. Now it   s folded in the  Phillips Seminary, which is now in Tulsa. Who was it for? Who ran it?  How big were the classes? That type of thing.  Phillips University had a population about equal to Enid High School.  Enid High School had a thousand students. So did Phillips University.  So it was not a large campus. It was basically a church school. The  Marshall Building housed the Bible College. They would be considered  a liberal arts college. They had some exceptionally good programs. They  had an excellent music program, and a tri-state band festival was held in  Enid every year. They had a really superior geology study, and an  excellent pre-med. John Randolph was head of the art department there.  The art department was quite good.  Their education program was  excellent for teacher training.   At that time, Tulsa University had, probably, the best art program in the  state, but again that was a private university and expensive. But, they  had an excellent program. In ranking, I don   t know how you would have  10  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  ranked Phillips as far as an art program, because they were so much  smaller than OU  University of Oklahoma , TU  Tulsa University , or  then Oklahoma A M. TU had the best art program in the state.  But Phillips had a good reputation?  Phillips had an excellent reputation, and their education program, the  teachers that came out of Phillips University were probably ranked the  best in the state. Once they started doing testing, Phillips University   s  teacher training students, I think, ranked highest in the state. It was a  very good small school, and it had the benefit being a small school. You  knew everybody, everybody knew you. You could be involved. I think  there was only one club on the whole campus that I was not involved  with at some point in my three and a half years in college. I was in the  honor society my first two years of college. I was in the literary society.  They did not have sororities and fraternities, but they had social service  clubs, which was their version of sororities and fraternities. I was  involved with the international students quite a lot, and that was always  very interesting.  When we lived at Hiawatha, Kansas, Peter Solomon from India came  from Phillips University, stayed with us while he talked about missions  programs to our congregation, and that   s how I became introduced to  Phillips University. As far as I was concerned, I was always going to go  to Phillips University. That was just what I was going to do.  How did you pay for school the rest of your time there?  I worked. My freshman year in college cost my parents under twenty-five  dollars. Of course, I lived at home, and I ate my meals at home, but  as far as financial outlay of additional funds, they didn   t have that  responsibility. I did pay for my tuition through work.  And you were set to become an art teacher, but then all of a sudden, this  Ethiopia opportunity came up. How did that come up?  Conrad had had classes with Hugh Rouk. And you may have met Hazel  Rouk.  No, I have not.  Hugh passed away a number of years ago, and Hazel, the last I knew,  was still living here in Stillwater, but she is elderly now and rather hard  of hearing. So I don   t know if she would be interested in doing this sort  of thing or not. Anyway, Conrad told me, I think we were already  married at that time and living at Hennessey, that Hugh was in the States  11  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  and he was going to have an evening program. Conrad and his brothers  and his dad all went over to listen to Hugh   s program. Actually, Conrad  had told me about the program in Ethiopia before we were ever married,  and I just laughed about it. I said,    You know, my mother wouldn   t let  me get that far from home.    I was an only child.  At any rate, Conrad and his brothers and his dad went to hear Hugh talk.  Hugh was actually back in the States recruiting people to work in the  program in Ethiopia, and he was interested in Conrad, and Conrad   s  brother Duane. They did send us papers. Duane had gotten his papers  earlier, and we did not fill our papers out. Conrad got a phone call one  night asking him if we could be  in Stillwater  by I think maybe 9:00 the  next morning with our completed papers, and he hustled around and  found the papers, and we completed them and went over to an interview  with  William S.    Bill     Abbott. That   s how we wound up in Ethiopia.  What was your reaction to hearing that news?  About Ethiopia? Well, you have to realize that I grew up in the church,  talking about missions, listening to missionaries, listening to people talk  about the country that they had originated from. I was an avid reader,  and I had read a lot of books about other countries. I was a very avid  reader, and as soon as I could read, I read about lots of different things. I  am still an avid reader.  I can see the stack right there.  Yes, that   s just a portion. (Laughter) At any rate, most of the people in  the Ethiopia project were young people, and I know I certainly didn   t  know what to expect. I had been told what the population would be in  the area where we were going to be, or in the capital, and so therefore I  said,    Oh, they   ve got this much population. They   re going to be like a  town of that population in the states.    Well, of course, that   s not   necessarily true , but I was young and inexperienced, and that was the  best evaluation I could make. Young people are not fearful of new  things, and I had grown up moving around and making new  acquaintances. There had been a lot of international students at Phillips  University, and they had been my friends. I don   t think I had fears. Life  is a big adventure.  And you were ready for this one, that   s for sure.  Yes.  Did your mother have that reaction that you talked about earlier?  12  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  No, not really. I think her regrets were after we had children that the  grandchildren were not closer so that she could see them more often.  How was it arranged for you? You talked about Mr. Abbott and Mr.  Rouk arranging for you to go over there, like the paperwork. Did you  have to take an orientation process? I   m trying to get the story for  between,    Yes, I accept this opportunity to go,    and physically landing  in Ethiopia. Can you take me through that process?  There was a manual that they provided us with, and it had information  concerning acceptable dress, acceptable behavior. We realized that in  another country, there would be different food restrictions. There was an  orientation, yes, but it was not elaborate. We did not need to learn a  separate language because at that time they were teaching English,  starting with third grade, and there were so many different linguistic  dialects spoken in Ethiopia that our students from the north of the  country conversed with students from other areas in English. And the  local people who we were encouraged to help take care of our homes  wanted to learn English, so language was not too much of a problem.  What kind of materials did you take over there? Besides clothing, did  you take beds?  Well, let   s talk about food, because that   s kind of interesting. Mrs.  Laport was one of the cooks. Conrad gets along with people well. The  cooks at the school lunchroom loved him, and they used to just feed him  tremendous amounts of food. He finally had to quit eating in the school  lunchroom because he was gaining weight. (Laughs) They were feeding  him so much. Mrs. Laport helped us make out a grocery order. At that  time, people ordered groceries through a company called Leggets, and  groceries were shipped. Mrs. Laport had a large family, and so when she  helped us make out our grocery order, there was so much food on that  that Conrad and I looked at it and were just absolutely amazed. We went  through and changed everything, because we were only two people. She  had this large family of children and young boys in athletics, and her  quantities of food that she would have purchased didn   t fit our family  very well.  We all had vegetable gardens that were close to our house. We could  buy from the school, from their school gardens, because they raised  produce to feed the students. The students were required to do a certain  amount of labor. And so they worked in the vegetable gardens and we  could buy meat that was butchered. Now, we had kerosene refrigerators,  and that was a problem. Electricity was a problem. We bought canned  milk. It was whole milk, dried, powdered. The brand was Klim, which is  K-L-I-M. Milk spelled backwards. It was a product of the Netherlands.  13  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  We had to boil and filter our water and you mixed, according to the  formula on the can, with your boiled and filtered water. You used the  kerosene refrigerator, because we only had electricity from, I think it  was, 6:00-8:00 in the morning, so that the governor could listen to the  news. And then we had it from 12:00 to 1:00 so that he could hear the  news again, and then the electricity didn   t come on until 6:00 in the  evening.  Now, the generators came over in the 1890s and were only two phase.  So, the electricity didn   t produce enough electricity for the whole town.  We were on the relief phase and our electricity went off, and everybody  else turned their lights on. So, hence, kerosene refrigerators. We visited  with other families and learned to play bridge.   What did you bring with you?   We flew first class, and back in those days, you had a lot more luggage.  We just returned from a trip where we were flying. We had one suitcase  apiece, and one carryon, and we paid twenty dollars per bag. So things  were different. We were on first class air travel. In my carryon, I had a  Presto pressure pan. I had pliers, and a flashlight, and sheets, blankets  and towels     I think you went over the weight with that in there    (Laughs)  As a matter of fact, I don   t think we did, because we were just two. We  hadn   t been married that long, so we didn   t have that much stuff. We  sold our furniture and the things that we had. See, we had just had an  apartment. We hadn   t had a whole house. So we took a lot of things that  we would need.  Yes. Like hand tools, and     Yes.  How long was the flight?  Well, we flew overnight.  Conrad told me that you stopped at various locations.  We did. We flew from New York to Shannon, Ireland, overnight, and  then we had breakfast from Shannon to I think our next stop was Rome.  And from Rome, then we went to Cairo, and from Cairo we probably  stopped in Khartoum, but we didn   t stay there. Then on into Addis  Ababa.  14  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  And you saw some of the sights in Rome, right?  Yes.  And you played tourist for a little bit?  Yes, three days, I think. We stayed at the Metropole and saw as much as  possible.  Yes, in three days.  And I really like Rome. We almost always spent some time in Rome.  And he said that you also went to the pyramids?  Yes, outside of Cairo. I have pictures. I have a photograph of us taken on  camels with the pyramids in the background. That was in 1958. With  Conrad on his camel was our fourteen month old son, Brian. That was  kind of interesting, because the people who led the camels would talk  with you, and you found out that their camel was named Oklahoma  because they had asked you where you were from.    Oh, we   re from  Oklahoma.       Oh  My camel is named Oklahoma     (Laughter) I   m sure  it was named Nebraska or whatever, but at any rate, it was very  interesting.  How did your son travel?  Our children, because they were born into it, Brian flew for the first time  when he was three days old. I was on a flight from Addis Ababa to  Jimma when he was three days old, when I brought him home from the  hospital. So, they always did, and they did fine.   So in the beginning,  you land in Addis, and you have some time in  Addis, right?  They wanted us to go to the embassy, because they wanted us to have an  orientation at the embassy. What I remember was that they said don   t eat  the salad, and be careful about strawberries. Everybody boiled water and  filtered water, and washed leafy greens and things like that with Clorox  water. The only thing that did not arrive in our grocery order was our  Clorox. So we didn   t have Clorox to wash our vegetables in, and we  probably had less intestinal disturbance than anybody else.  Clorox probably did more harm than good.  15  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  (Laughs) Well, it surely did make lettuce taste funny.  What was Addis like at that time? How big of a city? Were there  vehicles? Were there large open markets? That type of thing.  When the Italian occupation ended, the emperor realized that his country  had a long way to catch up, and he did not ask the Italians to leave.  Foreigners could not own land. They still can   t. Some foreigners did  marry Ethiopians, and therefore their wives could own land. Now, I  think companies can have a long term lease. That kind of depends on  how stable the government is, and I think that   s pretty well true across  the world. It depends on government stability.  We had left Oklahoma when it was so hot. This was before everybody  had air conditioning. We would be so sweaty from our cars that we  would have to stand outside and let our clothing dry before we could go  into the buildings for interviews. We arrived in Addis Ababa in the  middle of the rainy season, and it was cold. There were blankets on our  beds. In a city that   s not completely paved, you had pretty muddy  streets, and while there were normal vehicles a lot of them were Italian,  a lot of Italian trucks     Like Fiats?  Yes.  A 1955 Fiat , Millecento is a certain sized  Italian  truck. And  there were mule drawn  cabs , the equivalent to a taxi. You   ve seen  pedal cabs? It could be mule drawn, but have a small interior to keep  you dry. Through the years, eventually Addis changed enough that there  were areas where the mule drawn vehicles were not allowed to travel.  But back then, shake your liver loose. There were no shock absorbers on  those things. (Laughs) The streets were not smooth. Some of the streets  were brick paved, some of them were asphalt, I would assume. We only  spent a short period of time there.  Was it like two weeks?  Oh no, more like two or three days. We met some families there and  they entertained us. What was really interesting, breakfast in our hotel  looked like bacon and eggs, but it was actually anchovies on top of the  eggs. That was a new acquaintance, anchovies. We thought we were  having sliced peaches for dessert and it was papaya. That was a new  experience. Neither my husband nor I have been extremely conservative  in our foods. It   s exciting to eat the food of other countries. At that time,  the waiters in the hotels wore white coats, black ties, white gloves, towel  over the arm. Very nice. I love Italian bread.  16  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  So what year did you arrive there?  1956.  Where were you assigned first?  Jimma.  And how long were you in Jimma?  Eight years. We were eight years in Jimma, four years in Alemaya. And,  of course, our government was pushing to be done with this project in  Ethiopia, so they could put more emphasis in other areas. There was a  U.S. military base in Eritrea, Kagnew. We did buy shares in the  commissary, and when we were in Addis, or we could order groceries.  That was really interesting, because the grocery orders for the ten  families were combined. When a shipment of groceries came in, all this  food had to be sorted, and never did we ever get all that we ordered. It  had to be prorated, and then prorated by the number of people in the  family, the size of your order. That was kind of interesting. We bought  local eggs. We shopped in the local market for limes and potatoes and  whatever.  Did you trade, or did you   ?  No, we went shopping.  What currency did you use?  We used Ethiopian currency. A birr was a dollar, and the equivalent of  forty cents, U.S. A schilling was fifty cents. A duty was a nickel.  Centime was a penny. Hulet duty was two nickels, or ten cents.  Didn   t Selassie base his currency on the U.S. dollar basically?  In fact, the Ethiopian money was printed in the United States for a long,  long time. We were not there too many years before silver currency was  taken off the market. The local people did not like to use the paper  money, because they didn   t have a very good storage system for it.  Among our missionary friends, they would get coins and pay their  workers with coins, because coins didn   t burn. Coins were not eaten by  bugs or rodents.  It didn   t blow away. So you first went to Jimma. How did you first get to  Jimma from Addis?  17  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  We flew. Transworld Airlines was the parent company of Ethiopian  Airlines. Most of their planes were DC-3s, which were probably army  surplus, and the pilots were trained in the United States.  Lemuel  Lem  Tew was one of the  Ethiopian Airlines  pilots that was best known, and  there   s been a book written about him,  Fly Sheba: Ethiopia as I  Remember It .  He flew for them from 1953 to 1974.  Paul Brown was  one of the pilots that we knew that flew into Jimma. Conrad knows all of  those people, I didn   t, and he flew a lot of places that I did not. It was  about an hour   s flying time from Jimma to Addis. Jimma had a grass  airport when we first moved there, and people would have to shoo the  gazelles off of the runway so the planes could land. A plane flew in in  the morning and flew back to Addis in the afternoon, after it dropped  people off at Jimma and went to a couple of other places. People from  the school would go to the airport and meet folks. The school had a  certain amount of vehicles, which one could rent on weekends for trips  out in the country if you decided you wanted to go on a picnic or  something.  What was your first living arrangement like?  The Jimma school compound had been a Catholic mission. When people  first moved there, it was pretty run down I think, but the Italians built  well. We had solid masonry walls. We had cement tile floors. We had  tile roofs or tin roofs, depending on whether or not they   d been replaced.  We had water because the school had wells, and they also had water  towers. Water was the big problem, always. There was a stream that ran  through the lower garden that they pumped water during the dry season.  The town generated electricity through the water in those streams during  the rainy season. During the dry season, they generated electricity  burning charcoal. We lived in a duplex. The Turners lived on the other  end. We had two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen, a living room. For  two people, that   s plenty of room. We were still living in that house  when our second son was born.  How long did you live in that house?  They moved us to a larger house when our second son was born in    58.  So if we went in    56, I would say in    59 we moved to the larger house.  In roughly about 1960 when we moved to the Jimma Experiment  Station, which was still a part of the Jimma school. It was just that it was  away from the main compound.  Did you own the house?  The school did. Well, the government owns everything, but it was the  school   s.  18  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  It was run by the school. So you didn   t have to pay rent?  No.  That was part of your package of living and working there.  And it was furnished.  Did you have servants or a cook or a cleaner or that type of thing?  Everybody had household employees, and a gardener. A gardener started  the charcoal fires to heat the hot water. See, we had our charcoal hot  water heater back in the early days, and you had to build a charcoal fire  in the charcoal hot water heater. You knew it was ready when the water  came out the spout that was up above the roof, and it was like a perky  coffee pot. It came down on the roof, and it sounded like rain or hail on  the roof. Later, when we moved out to the experiment station, we had an  electric hot water heater. That   s when we had electricity all day long.  Did you have indoor plumbing?  Yes. Now, when we first went and lived in the buildings that had been  built by the Jesuits when that was a school, the water closet was a little  metal thing at the top. It had a chain and a handle and gravity flow. One  night, I went into the bathroom. This was after we had two children.  There were the toes of my red tennis shoes sticking up out of the water  in the stool. Our toddler had carried the shoes in there and put them in  the bathroom in the stool. (Laughs) So we had indoor plumbing.  Could you take me through a typical day? What kind of activities would  you do, since your husband was teaching or doing research? What  would you do during the day?  When we first went there, I taught the American children four days a  week, in the afternoons, art, and gave private lessons on Friday. I liked  to cook. I am a very good cook. I fix gourmet food. I do Ethiopian food  very well. We didn   t have a cook. I did the cooking. I sewed. Well, my  father gave me a sewing machine for Christmas when I was seven years  old. It was a little Singer that was about so big. It had a hand crank, and  it sewed with the chain stitch. I made doll clothes.   In the states  then the way that school programs were set up, the  seventh and eighth grade girls had one semester of P.E. and one  semester of sewing in the seventh grade, and one semester of P.E. and  one semester of cooking in the eighth grade. So I had a semester of  19  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  sewing in the seventh grade. I, being an art person, during the years we  were in Ethiopia when I had household help to do the floors and wash  the dishes and sweep and dust, then I could do the things I wanted to do.  Conrad bought me a White electric sewing machine before we went to  Ethiopia and I sewed.  I liked flowers and I messed with my garden. We had an outdoor person  who made the fires and tended the garden. I liked to mess with the  flowers, and I planted a garden. We did a lot of entertaining. The men  hauled in termite mounds from the countryside and crushed them and  then     Termite mounds?  Yes. They come up out of the ground. They build these out of the mud.  You   ve seen dirt dobber nests? The way the dirt dobber brings stuff and  builds things, and it   s stuck together with the saliva of the insect.  Termites do this too, only they are vertical and they are hard like  cement. They crushed them, and they had made a roller, and they rolled  those  tennis  courts. We didn   t have lights on our courts, so we couldn   t  play after dark, but we got pretty good at tennis. So we played tennis, we  went camping on the weekends, we invited our friends over for meals,  we went over to their house for meals. When our lights went off, we  went over to the neighbors and played cards.  Bridge?  Yes, learned to play bridge. Still not a good bridge player, haven   t  played since I   ve been back to the States. You can   t have four children  and keep a house and work and go to school and play bridge. So bridge  went by the wayside.  You grew vegetables as well in the garden?  Yes.  What kind of vegetables did you grow?  Green beans did not grow. It was too wet, and they would mold in the  rainy season. There were great dry season vegetables. Cucumbers,  tomatoes, onions. You could grow potatoes if you wanted to, but you  could also buy those in the market. You could buy limes and papaya,  and I had some marvelous lima bean vines that grew up the papaya trees.  When we lived out on the Jimma Experiment Station, we had this  fantastic strawberry bed that produced enough strawberries for us and  people of the mission and the families on campus. I had made so much  20  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  strawberry jam and we   d eaten so many fresh strawberries we just got  really tired of them. We don   t have strawberries like that now.  What was your social circle like? Who was in it? Who did you become  friends with?  Well, there were ten families. Like any other situation, there were some  that you were closer to than others. You tended to spend more time with  people you were close to, but we all had Thanksgiving dinner together,  the whole bunch of us. Jimma was marvelous for that. All of us had  children, and so we were all family people, and we were all together as  families. There was a cinema. There were three cinemas in the country.  There was one at Jimma, one at Dire Dawa, and then there were a couple  of them, finally, in Addis. The men had dormitory check duty, and we  also took the students to the movies on the weekends. We would walk  downtown as a group and go to the movie, and then walk back up the  hill as a group. So we went to the movies on weekends when there was a  movie.  Were they American films?  They were English films, because almost all the people could speak   English . Now, not everybody went to the movies, you understand. That  wasn   t something that the local people did. Mostly because of expense, I  would think. Merchants from the market would go. The Italian families  would go. When I say Italian, that   s almost a generic term meaning the  other foreigners, other than the Americans.  I heard Jimma was not just Italians, not just Americans, but other  foreign nationalities. I hear it   s really cosmopolitan, and you could go  get French cuisine, that type of thing. Maybe share with us your  experience of interaction with other foreign nationals.  There were not too many, other than shopping. Now, Conrad had a lot of  contact, but I took care of my children, I did our cooking, and I did my  sewing. We also went to the governor   s wife   s maybe twice a month,  maybe once a month. We had tea in the afternoon, and she would  arrange something for entertainment. We might knit or sew or  something, because we didn   t have electricity. Conrad bought me a new  Necchi treadle sewing machine, and the governor   s wife bought my  electric White. She had a baby just shortly after we came there, and I  had made a little infant garment for her baby. So when our first child  was born, she gave us a silver service of a knife, fork, spoon, feeding  spoon, egg cup, and napkin ring.  Do you still have that set?  21  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  I don   t now, my oldest son does. There   s one piece that   s missing. The  feeding spoon went I don   t know where. Things did tend to go  sometimes. So we would go to the governor   s wife, and she might have  an Indian lady show us how to make chapattis and stuff them. I  remember a mixture of onion and mint and potatoes that were stuffed in  the chapattis like we would make a burrito here. That was very good,  very tasty. Sometimes we just visited.  The staff, meaning the husbands and wives, had coffee together at 10:00  in the morning. At Jimma, we took turns having coffee at the various  people   s homes, but after we moved out to the experiment station, that  wouldn   t work. So I would bring a baked goodie to serve with the  coffee. The afternoon, there might be someone that you were closer  friends with. You might go over and have a Coke with. Now, Coke  syrup came in gallon cans, and we could make fizzy water. You screwed  the carbon thing on, looked like a little metal bomb thing about so big.  You screwed that on, and then it carbonated the water and you squirted  it     You mixed the water with the syrup?  Yes, you might go have a Coke at someone   s house. Now later, and I  can   t tell you exactly what year, but I know it was before 1964, because  after we lived out on the Jimma compound, we had bottled Cokes. When  they got the standard of water and stuff up to Coca Cola   s standard, they  could bottle in-country. I actually have some bottles that have Amharic  Coca Cola. So, basically we played bridge, we visited, we went on  picnics. We made our entertainment a lot.  Well, and you also kept busy because you had all four of your sons.  Being pregnant over there, were you concerned with the medical  facilities?  I   ve been real healthy. I   m going to be seventy-six this July. Up until  just the last year or two, I   ve been exceptionally healthy. So, I was not  overly concerned about my health. Actually, our son Brian was the first  child that was born to our group, in-country. There had been pregnancies  before, but people had gone outside of Ethiopia to have the child. So it  was kind of exciting to people for us to have Brian. He was born at  the  Seventh Day Adventist Hospital in Addis Ababa . (Our facilities at  home were better than at the hospital at that time. I did have some  checkups in Addis at the Seventh Day Adventist Filwoha Hospital there.  I did not have big problems.) Craig was born at home. Brian, I had at the  Filwoha Hospital in Addis, the Seventh Day Adventist hospital. Filwoha  was the name, I believe, of some springs. It was also the Prince   s  22  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Zewditu Memorial Hospital. You   ve read War and Peace, maybe, and  you know that everybody has multiple names. They did. Things had  multiple names.  Now at the Seventh Day Adventist, maybe Conrad told me this story or  someone else, but you asked for meat   ?  You don   t have meat. You have a meat substitute. They made gluten by  kneading flour for an extremely long time, and it develops the gluten.  Then you wash it, and that washes the starch out, and you have this  brown stuff that they sliced. They would put tomatoes and onions and  peppers on, and make it like Swiss steak. It was absolutely delicious.  When they had that, that was just marvelous. Otherwise, because Coptic  Christians and Muslims have special handling, and Jewish people and  others, and then there are the infidels that will eat anything. So, it was  easier for them to manage meat substitute meals.  We had two children by that time, and I had hepatitis. They flew me to  Addis to the hospital, and I was in the hospital nineteen days. I was in  bed a total of thirty-nine, forty days. But anyway, I was there during my  birthday, and they actually baked me an angel food cake for my birthday  because the emperor and I celebrated our birthdays at the same time. The  Emperor   s birthday was on the 23rd of July. My birthday was on the 24th,  but the celebrations always went past midnight, so I included my  celebration with the emperor   s. And that   s another of my little jokes.  I remember when I was in the hospital, I was thrilled over oatmeal  cookies. I couldn   t keep anything down. I couldn   t even keep tea or  water down. I was really, really sick. I   m sure they were making special  things for me to try to get me to eat. Nobody tries to get me to eat now.  (Laughs) But that was a long time ago. Anyway, they took very good  care of me.  What do you remember about your children growing up there?  Oh, that   s really marvelous. My mother felt so bad,    Oh, think what the  children are missing.    Well, what the children were missing was that  Grandma was missing the children. But, our children, first of all they  learned to associate with other children of other nationalities. They  accepted each other, and when the day comes that adults can accept each  other like children do, then we   ll have fewer problems. Our children  spoke a smattering of everything. Our English friend had a kindergarten  and there were Italian, Greek, Israeli, American, what have you, children  there. They were all together, and it was wonderful.  We were good friends with the family that ran the hotel. He was Italian  23  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  and she was Greek-Amhara, and the little boy and Brian went to the  same kindergarten. Their daddy was also an engineer and construction  person and inventor. The Italians could do so many things. He built the  most wonderful ice cream maker from scratch. We could go to the hotel  on Sunday nights, which was another one of our entertainments, to go  eat out at the hotel on Sunday nights en masse, all of us. He had this  huge thing, and it had a bicycle gear, chain and it had paddles like an old  fashioned butter churn. They made gelato that was just oh, so good, and  a fabulous spaghetti sauce and cutoletta, cutlet. It was such a treat to go  to the hotel for supper on Sunday night.  Anyway,  Ugo   s  daddy asked the boys how they talked to each other.  Ugo said,    We speak English.    His daddy showed him a hard roll and  said,    What   s this?    He said,    Dabo.    Dabo was an Amharic term for  bread. So, here was this child that was Italian, Greek, Amhara mix.  Looks like you and me. Here   s our child, who is Scotch-Irish, English,  Welsh, Dutch, German, French, American Indian, what have you,  American Heinz 57. And they   re talking together in English, Greek-  Italian, Amharic.    Dabo.     That   s awesome.  It really was. It was wonderful. I remember one time, Brian said to me  about his little friend,    Mama, how come he   s black and I   m white?    I  gave him a marvelous answer. It wasn   t a valid answer, but it solved the  problem. I said,    He   s not black, he   s brown. And you   re not white,  you   re pink.    And that was the end of it. (Laughs)  There you go. What are your children   s names, and when were they  born?  Brian was born in May 17, 1957. Craig was born January 24, 1959. Kent  was born October 12, 1961, and Shawn was born January 15, 1964. That  picture that I showed you was taken in the summer when we came back  in July. Actually, they had on sweaters, so it had to be early fall.  What impact  do you think  Ethiopia had on their lives?  Our second son, Craig, was the horticulture specialist for Cleveland  County, and they published a statement. This was an interview when he  first went to work there. He made the comment that the importance of  black and white was not an issue. They were our brothers. That covers it.  And did they see the servants as part of the family, or did they see them  as separate?  24  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  We had all boys, and usually the person who stayed with the children at  night was someone who worked for us. Abdullah was like seventeen  when Brian was twelve. So really, it was kids together, but in his culture,  seventeen was a man, and who knows how many years he   d been  working. We also had a student, because we lived out on the experiment  station, away from the others. It needed to be someone who could drive  if there was an emergency. So we have his beloved friend now, and he   s  probably older than I am. Right now, I believe he   s in the States. His  second family is here in the States, but his business is still in Ethiopia.  So he spends about three months of the year in the States, and the rest of  the year he spends in Ethiopia conducting their business. He   ll probably  do that  for a while . They don   t have a retirement plan like we have.  Now, speaking of families and friends, we just got an email from a  friend who had been in Houston to celebrate the graduation of their  youngest son from medical school. The oldest son, Yonis, is with a big  publishing firm in New York City. The daughter is an OB/GYN doctor,  and she is married to a doctor, and they have three sons. Enabi just  graduated from medical school. We attended Yodut   s high school  graduation, and we attended her wedding.  These are friends from   ?  Another Ethiopian family here in the States. Some of these people are  more dear to us than our own family is.  Yes, because they were there for your formative years, to say the least.  My formative years. We went to Ethiopia two weeks after my twenty-second  birthday, and we came back when I was thirty-four years old. So  my young adult years were spent in Ethiopia.  And shaped by those experiences?  Very much so.  What was Jimma like? How big of a town was it?  Jimma was to have been the new Rome. Oh, it was gorgeous, gorgeous  country. Anything will grow there. I had thirty-six varieties of hybrid tea  roses that I had paid seventy-five cents apiece for, and had flown in from  Kenya. In my front yard, I had bottle brush trees that I had started from  cuttings. Across the top of our house were bougainvilleas. I had fourteen  stalks of bananas ripening on my own trees. You had to take them down,  and they ripened in the dark closet, but they   re ready to be ripened. I had  a nafil tree in the front yard that. It   s either Italian or Greek, probably  25  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Greek, and it produces a fruit that you can make the equivalent of apple  jelly. It   s the flavor.  This was the coffee experiment station. Just outside our fence were all  these coffee trees in bloom. The perfume was like jasmine. We had our  large Danish hound/German shepherd cross dog. Her name was Mita. It  translates in German as    Pearl.    She took off across the field and she was  chasing a leopard. Brian had his own machete. Now he was preschool  age, but he had a little machete. He would go down in the field with the  workers and cut the corn stalks. When it came time for me to go into the  compound for coffee, I would honk the car from the road. The workers  would hold him up in the field above the corn so that I could see him,  and he would come and he would go in with me.  All our children learned to drink coffee as toddlers because they would  toddle around the coffee tables and drink the dregs of coffee out of the  coffee cups that had been left on the tables. And the kids chewed coffee  beans. They thought that was just marvelous. They   d go pick the coffee  cherries off the tree. They   re red when they are ready to use, and they  have a sweet pulp around the seeds. Sometimes they had worms in the  pulp. After they found out there were worms in there, they quit doing  that. (Laughs)  Worms are protein   Well, that   s true, and we found that out once upon a time, but that   s not  really on the menu for dinner tonight.  So, Jimma, how big was it size wise?  It was, I believe, the third largest city in Ethiopia. It had some beautiful  areas there. As a treat to myself, I used to go drive up the avenue in front  of, it must have been the governor   s home, but it had these huge big  trees that grew together. Beautiful.  And you said you celebrated Thanksgiving. I assume you celebrated  Christmas?  We celebrated Christmas twice. We celebrated December 25th, and the  mission had a special Christmas program that our children participated  in. We would give them gifts of flour and sugar and Crisco prior to  Christmas, so they could make goodies like they were used to at home.  We had a community, our ten families, together for Christmas dinner. It  was a big thing to be able to find a turkey, so we could have turkey on  Christmas. Ethiopian Christmas came the sixth of January, and the  students celebrated that. We did, too.  26  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  We celebrated Ramadan. Ramadan was a difficult time because of the  restrictions placed on the workers. It   s really hard on them to be without  water during the day and not even to be able to swallow your own saliva.  Our friends who worked at the government hospital, the German doctor  that delivered our second child said that since the people had been  deprived of cooking during this time and the feasting that came at the  end that, some people actually did die from overeating. The change in  the large amounts of food and change in diet, some people actually did  die.  Did you celebrate Eid, the Muslim holiday?  I   m aware of it now, but I was not then.  Meskel was the discovery of  the True Cross by Queen Helena in the fourth century celebrated on  September 27. Meskel daisies bloom in profusion at that time in  Ethiopia.  Timkat were Coptic Christian holidays, and that was the  baptism. The priest would pray to the church, and when they carry the  Arc of the Covenant, that was actually the box that could have contained  the tablets of the Ten Commandments. Anyway, there were holy things  from their church that they paraded with. There was public baptism.  Because of the school, the people associated with the school were  honored guests, and we were the dignitaries that sat in the chairs for the  celebrations.  Did you actually attend any worship services or Mass at the coptic  church?  Weddings were the only things that people might have attended. I  happened not to have attended. I did attend a Greek wedding when we  lived in Dire Dawa. At Jimma, we went to the mission on Sunday  morning, and the people at the SIM  Sudan Interior Mission  there were  Reform Mennonite. That was another one of the lovely things. We all  went to church together with the exception of one particular group of  people who didn   t do that. That was their choice. That was a personal  choice. The lovely thing was, we worshipped together. We didn   t know  what church anybody went to. I still don   t know what church some of  these people went to. It didn   t matter at all.  Alright, we   ve been skirting around this, but you   re a cook. What were  your favorite Ethiopian dishes you prepared? What were your favorite  foods that you enjoyed? What about your husband and children?  They eat all the Ethiopian food. The only thing they don   t like is, there is  a diced kidney liver mixture that they don   t care for. It can be lightly  cooked, or it can be served raw, and they don   t like that. I would like to  27  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  be able to show you a cookbook. I can show you the old copies. The new  one that has my name in it, in the acknowledgements he thanks me, I  can   t find that. I took it up to the university as a reference. I think I  brought it home. I can   t find it.  It   s by Daniel Mesfin and is called  Exotic Ethiopian Cooking.   I can make beef wat, doro wat, which is chicken with eggs, and is very  highly seasoned and spiced. My original recipe called for a pound of  butter, a quart of chopped onions, two heaping tablespoons of red pepper  and local spices. I make lentil wat, I can make kik wat, which is yellow  split peas. I can make vegetable alicha. I love gomen, which is their, like  spinach, but it   s actually collard greens. There   s aib  Ethiopian cottage  cheese . It   s a very light cottage cheese mixed with yogurt. They can  make that dry. They   ve mixed butter with it when they do that. I make a  vegetable wat that has turmeric in it. Their spice is kibe, and it   s not a  hot spice, but it has hot green peppers in it. It also has strips of bell  pepper, it has cabbage, and potatoes, and carrots. They make ones that  have green beans, fresh green beans. Oh, it   s good. There is a restaurant  in Oklahoma City, the Queen of Sheba, and we go there. They   re no  longer serving lunch, except on Saturdays. So you have to plan an  evening trip.  I   ve heard that it   s pretty good.  It is. And it   s expensive to eat Ethiopian food, because there is so much  preparation. Mincing and chopping and     But it   s worth it?  Of course. I have some wonderful basketry there. If you go to an  Ethiopian restaurant in Washington, D.C., like the Blue Nile, they will  have the basket table, and those cost a thousand five hundred dollars for  one. They just don   t make them much anymore. I have basketry that is  museum quality. They don   t make it anymore.  Do you still prepare those dishes?  Yes.  How often do you     And Shaun can, too  In fact, he   s going to New York City for about a  week in early June and his friends said,    You can stay with us, but you  have to fix Ethiopian food.    He can do the whole thing, and he does it  here at home for us sometimes, if I will make the injera (that   s the  Ethiopian bread). I   m really not all that good at it because I don   t do it  28  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  often enough. But it   s fun.  Did your husband   s assignment change so that you were sent from  Jimma to Alemaya?  Interesting story. I started to tell you about that, that our government was  interested in closing that program, because they wanted to put their  emphasis in another area of the world. The first person that they actually  had trained that they felt that they could put in charge of the department  other than an administrator was Ato Temisgin. Temisgin was an orphan  who had been raised by, I believe, the Yugoslavian person who was in  the country to instruct them in arms manufacturing. They had told us  that we were to be moved to Debre Zeyit, which was the experiment  station outside of Addis. Temisgin said,    I   ll quit. I won   t replace him,  I   ll quit.    So they decided they   d keep us. They wouldn   t let us go.  Temisgin was absolutely not going to do that.    You can   t move him.    So  we didn   t. Then,  the program  moved us to  the college at  Alemaya.   Temisgin then replaced Conrad as head of the Physical Plant and  Services at Jimma.   What were your impressions of Alemaya?  Of course, it was the epitome of the program, but it was not as relaxed. It  was larger. All the families, maybe their backgrounds were different,  their social entertainment was different.  The American families?  Yes. Not all of them were from Oklahoma. At one point in time, most of  the people were from Oklahoma. Jimma was a really unique place in that  everybody was so very compatible, and we did everything as families. It  was a bit different back at Alemaya. I enjoyed it, but     Did it take some time to get used to?  I have said that I grew up moving around and experiencing different  things. In my life, I had never lived as long any place as we lived at  Jimma. And that was home. It just didn   t have my parents there. It didn   t  have Conrad   s parents there.  What did you think about the landscape? I heard Alemaya was just so  beautiful because it was up in the mountains. There was the lake right  next to it.  It was different than Jimma. Jimma had so much more rainfall and was  more tropical than Alemaya. Alemaya was beautiful because they  29  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  created beauty. Now, everything didn   t grow as profusely in the  countryside as it did on the campus, but that was a showplace, and it was  beautiful. It was lovely to live there.  And it sort of had to be, because that was the Emperor   s land right  there. That was his showcase.  Yes. And all the homes were new. Everything was built there. That was  not the original location that they had planned, but it was the area of the  Emperor   s birthplace. They moved the people off the hillside and  everything was built. I   m pretty sure our people would have been hard  put to all have homes of that quality. Had we been planked down and  told to have a home, we couldn   t have had the large homes that we had.  One reason we had large homes was we entertained people that came to  visit. We didn   t call up the hotel and say,    Hey, we need so many  suites.    The new Holiday Inn is where we will be having our October 9th  and 10th gathering, and they have reserved ten rooms for us.  Was there any political trouble that you were aware of during your time  there?  They had an attempted coup while we were at Jimma. I was in Addis to  go to the dentist when that occurred. It happened in the late  afternoon/evening and into the next day. I flew back to Jimma the  morning of that, and so I was back in our area. We lived on the  experiment station. They wanted us to come into the compound, the  school compound. We did not because to move a household with four  little kids, that   d be a major undertaking. We didn   t feel endangered, and  I don   t think we were. I was downtown, and I was at the Mesfin Hotel.  My friends ran the hotel.  This is the Greek and Italian hotel?  Yes. One person made a move toward me, and another Ethiopian  reached out  and took his arm , and that   s the only thing. He just took a  step in my direction, that   s all. We probably were safer than we are in  this room right now when we were there because we were protected by  two governments.  Once when Shaun was little and people were going to come over for a  party at our house. We got everything ready, and we were just relaxing,  just talking. Our kitchen door opened onto the driveway, and we were  just there talking. We realized we didn   t know where Shaun was, and  Shaun was real little, like two, three. He was four and a half when we  came back to the States, so I know the oldest he could   ve been was four.  We couldn   t find him. We made a circuit of all the houses and nobody  30  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  could find him. The students turned out, and they were combing the  hillside and couldn   t find him. Because of the wildlife that moved  through the campus at dark, that was serious. It turned out he was next  door. He had just walked down the hill, gone in the house, gone back to  the kid   s bedroom, was sitting on the floor by the side of the bed looking  at comic books. It scared the daylights out of me.  Most people do not realize what OSU did for that country, and I  appreciate your insight with that. How did you maintain contact with  relatives back home?  First of all, we had APO, so we could write letters. We wrote airmail  letters. I hated writing letters. I wrote every Sunday afternoon.  Eventually, once we got a typewriter, I made carbon copies. (Laughs) I  wrote in real detail, but one thing I did not do, if there was something  going on that was a real problem or if someone was really sick, I never  sent that information, because there wasn   t anything they could do  anyway. We were the ones who had to deal with it, and we did. We were  real fortunate. There were some families that did have some very  unfortunate things, but we were fortunate.  How did you record your stay? Did you take photographs? Did you  write in a journal? You said you sent out letters. What did you do to  capture your experience?  My mother saved every letter that we ever wrote. Lloyd Douglass was  writing up a history of the program, and my mother had them in a  grocery sack, and I just gave him the grocery sack. What he liked about  my letters was it was a lot about family life, about all the birthday  celebrations, who came over to dinner, who we went to dinner with, and  what picnics we went on. We   ve got lots of pictures.  Shaun was four and a half when we came back to the States. He says he  does not remember anything about Ethiopia except what he has heard us  talk about, and the pictures that he   d seen. His first recollection is when  we were at Amboseli  National Park . We were around the fire pit, and  Kilimanjaro was in the background. He was just too young when we  came home. You were talking about adjustment. Some of the adjustment  was hard because that was the only life they knew, with the exception of  the short periods of time we were on home leave.  Were you able to see the entire country of Ethiopia? Did you travel  throughout the country?  I didn   t. Conrad saw more of it than I did. As a gift, I had sold some  paintings, and I gave him the money to go to the Gambella. He wouldn   t  31  go without all of us. So there are things that we didn   t see, but since he  went back and had this forestry program that he was overseeing for the  World Bank from    90 through    95, there are things that he saw that I did  not. Also, he saw the countryside because after we had two children, I  couldn   t carry two children and keep up. He couldn   t carry a child and a  gun and hunt. So, there were some years there that I did not go out  because I was at home with the children. Now, I don   t consider that a  deprivation at all. I was quite comfortable. I had my home, my books,  my sewing machine, my children.  When he went, Brian was not yet walking, so Brian was maybe eight  months old. He went to Kagnew and Asmara to bring some buses.   Conrad  and Frank Kubicek went to get some buses that were army  surplus that we wanted for the school to transport the students. With the  child, I flew. He flew up with me. We just happened to arrive when there  was a big strike going on. We got off the plane at the airport, and lo and  behold, there wasn   t a thing moving. They finally got a vehicle. They  took us to the consulate. Someone had just machine gunned in the streets  and the bullets had stopped in the file cabinet. The lady was filing and  the bullets stopped in the files. So they stuck their heads out the bottom  of the door and said,    Go to your hotel, and don   t go out.     So here we were with this baby, and we had not brought food because  everything was available in Asmara. Conrad went out and he found a bar  that was open. Now bars there are not like bars here. They had their pull  down metal door opened up so much, and he went under. He found some  cookies, and he found some French baby formula that he bought and  brought back, and we took care of Brian. Down in the hotel kitchen, I  found a few heads of garlic and some dried bread. There just wasn   t  anything.  Well, over the next few days, we went out to Kagnew and enjoyed all  the amenities there. Brian sat on the table with a milkshake glass  between his legs, and here is this eight month old slurping up milkshake,  drank almost all of it. They gave him his shots. The young U.S. military  were well trained and respectful of women. There weren   t that many of  us, and I was young at that time and not seventy-six years old. They  were very nice, very polite. Brian got his series of infant shots while we  were there. Then Conrad drove back, I flew back.  The only interesting thing was the day before we were to leave, I had  taken Brian for a walk in the baby stroller, and we had been to the  airline   s office and confirmed that we were going to fly out the next day.  I had come back to the hotel, and we were in the room. I heard feet  pounding up the stairs. The door flew open.    Thank god you   re alive      Someone had bombed the airline office, and it blew out the wall between  32  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  the airline office and the shop next door. A couple people were killed  and we had just been there.  When was this?  Brian was born in    57. He was eight months old. He was born in May. It  had to be in January or February  of 1958 .  What about within the region? Did you travel outside of Ethiopia? You  mentioned Kilimanjaro.  That particular trip, that was our last trip home, so that had to be around     68. The Douglass    were there, and their son David was nineteen or  twenty years old and he came back, he was going to travel with us. We  were going to go through the game parks. He met his parents in Israel.  He flew with us so he could go through the game parks. That was really  neat. We saw Ngorongoro Crater  Park in Tanzania  and Amboseli   Game Park in Kenya . We rented a Land Rover and drove.  When we got to Israel, we rented a vehicle again and we drove out to  Jericho. Now, that was a year after the Seven Days War, and there were  still tanks and things parked on the side of the road. And while we  bought some melons and some grapes and things, in the market we were  the only foreigners there. I attributed it to the fact that it was after lunch  and people were home taking a nap. Two weeks after we got back, by  that time we were in Stillwater, an American school teacher on a tour  bus was blown to kingdom come when she got off the bus and stepped  on a landmine there by the side of the road. While we were parked there  having our grapes and melons, here came the vehicles back, loaded with  military, and we were out with our little kids.  People were so nice to us. Generally speaking, we never, ever had  problems. For one thing, we were traveling just like everybody else, we  had our kids. We had been doing this all the children   s lives. So they  were well behaved, they knew what they were doing. We knew what we  were doing, and we just wanted to be normal. We were not fancy  tourists. We were just seeing things, and it was wonderful.  So you had to return to the States every two years, or at least leave  Ethiopia?  Yes. The last tour we extended and went three years, and then we came  back for one year. So when we should   ve come home in    66, we came  home in    67. Then the program was terminated in    68. So we did do a bit  of a jumble there.  33  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  How much time would you spend in the States when you were on leave?  We had to be out of the country, I   ll say three months. There   s a specific  number of days, and I don   t remember exactly, but I   ll say three months  every two years.  And what would you do during that time? You would come back to  Oklahoma, but would you also vacation within the States? Take your  kids to see stuff?  Just family. The longest we ever traveled at one stretch was twenty-one  days. Twenty-one days of travel with six people, you   re tired. Now there  was one time that we flew direct and flew into Tulsa. Conrad   s sister  lived there, and we visited with her family, and we did all our shopping.  Craig wore corrective shoes. You tried to make purchases ahead to fit  sizes and, you know, it was neat to get to shop and see the real stuff  rather than search through the catalog of JC Penney. We probably  should   ve had shares in Sears. They should   ve just given them to us,  because we did a lot of business with them. But anyway, that was hard  too, flying all that one way. We were really tired when we got here. And  then we tried to jump right in and do everything. That was not good for a  person. Not good planning.  Was there anything that you missed? Like when you got off the plane,  what was the first thing you did? Was there anything like you had to go  get barbeque, or you had to go get an ice cream cone?  Things I missed, because you mentioned that first. The first year at  Christmas time, the weather was wrong    bright and sunny . I missed  the seasonal weather more than anything else. By the second Christmas  we had a child, and we had our family Christmas, and we had made  some adjustment. So I missed the seasons because for years, I had  worked as a special gift wrapper, or doing store clerk, or working at  Christmas. There was all the Christmas music and the weather was just  not right. I missed Christmas.  The one thing that I really looked forward to in the way of food was a  Braum   s burger. At that time, I don   t know that it was a Braum   s, but the  in Enid they had the Boston Fountain, which was in the very downtown,  the heart of Enid, but they also had a burger place. Boy, did I miss  hamburgers, because we baked our own bread, and a home baked  hamburger bun is not correct. We had to make our own hamburger, and  that meant that you had to take the meat and take all that stuff out, then  you had to grind it, and it wasn   t the same. Boy, I missed a hamburger. I  really did miss a hamburger.  34  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  It was really interesting about the children. They didn   t like the milk  when we got here because they   d been raised on powdered milk, and  milk from the carton didn   t taste right. And bologna. (Laughs) We   re  still missing bologna.  You returned in    68. What were the major readjustments that you and  your family had to partake in?  Well first of all, the excitement of doing something different, and there   s  the matter of attitude, too. You can talk to yourself and make yourself  miserable, or you can talk to yourself and make yourself pretty happy.  Now, I had never really kept house, my own house, for the six of us. Not  only did I do that, but I taught a couple hours a day, and then I took  some classes. And, I was keeping house for the six of us. Conrad was  going to school. He was on full sabbatical for six months we were back.  But he was going to school, setting up our lifestyle, finding a job,  because he was going to have to support us all, and we wanted to buy a  house, find a house. That was a bunch, but it was exciting. We don   t  think of it as hardship. A whole lot of things depend on how you think.  Was it hard for the children to adjust?  Yes.  What do you think was the most difficult for them?  Schooling was different. My children had never experienced going to  public school. They had never experienced the money system, the  purchasing of things. I don   t think they really realized    I did give them  money and encouraged them to buy themselves a piece of bread. Brian  thought it was so nice that all these merchants gave us all these things.  And you see all the packages came from Sears, wrapped up like  presents. It was a lot different. All of us were no longer the elite people.  You said you went back to school then?  I took some courses. I was an overflow teacher at C. E. Donart High  School. That   s the high school here  in Stillwater . I taught two art  classes in the day, and I think that   s all. I think there were just two the  first year. I taught half-time at the middle school the next year, and I  taught eighth grade biology and seventh grade art. I taught two classes of  biology and one of art, and I also was a homeroom teacher. Teachers  have to renew their teaching credentials, takes so many hours to keep  yourself certified. First of all, I was going to get a master   s in  Educational Psychology, and Conrad said I would get too involved in  things, that it would be too hard on me emotionally to do that kind of  35  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  work. He probably was right. Anyway, I wound up getting a master   s in  Industrial Arts Education, because we hit the doldrums of the financial  programs. Education goes through that in Oklahoma.  I think it   s going through it right now.  Yes, it   s hard on people. Anyway, they did not get their advanced degree  program in art they were expecting. I had taken something like nineteen  hours already that was going to be involved in that degree, and it didn   t  materialize. John Tate had taken a couple of us students, I was the  second one. Isolete De Almeida was the first. If we would take certain  courses, we could complete a degree in Industrial Arts Education. Now,  I could never teach industrial arts. That would let me fulfill the  requirements of a higher degree. After all, I had taken all these hours.  You   ve got to use them for something.  It wasn   t my fault, it wasn   t their fault, either. It was just the way things  worked out because the economy, and that program didn   t materialize.  But, I needed to be able to get more than a bachelor   s degree salary. So   Dr. Tate  was very understanding, very cooperative. There   s a couch in  there that was my major project.  So, you taught until you retired?  No. They hit the financial doldrums again, and reduction-in-force (RIF).  That   s when they first instigated reduction-in-force in public schools,  and they cut programs. I had taught at Morrison for seven years.  Oh, Morrison?  Yes. They cut their art program. They were going to cut their band  program. They just spent fifty thousand dollars on brand new band  uniforms, so they decided,    Well, maybe when we have a band teacher  half-time.    They cut out their home economics program. They cut one  elementary coaching position, but re-hired that person before the school  year was over. Athletics is a very important staple.  So, what did you do?  You do what you can do. I worked at the university. Back when we first  came back from Ethiopia, I was Dr. Koeppe   s secretary in the  biochemistry department for something like three years. I worked a year  in the registrar   s office. In 1990, I worked a year in the registrar   s office,  I think. Then some place in there, I worked for Architectural  Engineering Services for several years, and then I went back to them and  36  Sherman  Evans  I was the records person. I was the contact person. When they bid a new  project, on the buildings, I was the contact person between the  contractors that wanted to bid on a project. I would see to it that all the  blueprints and all change orders  were made correctly , all the plans  went out. I also put all their stuff into a program in the computer. I got a  file system set up so that people could refer to it and find the plans that  related to different parts of the building. Don Allen was my supervisor.  Al Tyson was head of the department at that time, and then he retired,  and Jeff Stewart, who is now, I believe, head of Physical Plant  and  Services .  You   re the one who facilitates the reunions for those who went over to  Ethiopia. How did you come into that role? How did the reunions  develop?  A few times when we were on home leave, the International Programs,  which was then under Bill Abbott, would have a big Ethiopia Day. It  ended in a big dinner. They finally decided to recognize the women one  year. So we were given certificates, like a diploma, for having spent the  years that we were in Ethiopia and worked for the program. They had  recognized the men the previous year. After the program closed down,  those of us who were in Ethiopia wanted to stay in contact. There were  several people. The ones still living that worked on setting that up were  Clyde Kindell, who you visited with yesterday, and Conrad. Bob Hill  has passed away. Frank Kubicek passed away. Thomas Siegenthaler  passed away. There were other people, but they   re gone. There   s two  still living.  They decided to become a 501(c)(3) organization, and that developed  into the Oklahoma Ethiopian Society (OES). Eulela Kubicek was  secretary back then. We used to meet together every once in a while, and  when they decided to become the 501(c)(3) and writing it all up, since  now OSU was then parent of this program as Oklahoma A M, there  were certain conditions and rules and regulations that they drew up. One  of them was it was going to happen here in Stillwater. One time the  Siegenthalers very kindly took over and set it up in Oklahoma City.  That   s the only every two-year meeting that we   ve had outside  Stillwater. When Eulela decided that she had served as secretary for  enough years that she wanted someone else to do it, it fell in my lot. I  don   t remember exactly how that came about, but it did. The fact that we  live here makes it easy.  From time to time, different people have been president. It   s like the  Queen of England. We have titular positions. John Warren has been our  president for a number of years. Tom Siegenthaler was our vice  president and was until he died, and then we installed Grace, his wife, to  37  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Evans  take over as vice president. Bob Hill was the newsletter person. Bob did  a really good job. Unfortunately, he was killed. His wife took over as  long as her health would allow. I took over as newsletter person, and  then at some point in time I decided we were going to have to have some  younger people in there. Those people are still working. They   ve got  families, they   ve got jobs.  We asked Tara Hobbs-Lisko if she would be the newsletter manager. So,  for ten years we   ve been trying to close this thing out. Two years ago,  we voted to close it, and I said,    Look, I   m going to die someday.  Somebody   s got to take this over     Tara didn   t want to, but we said,     Hey, we   ll support you. Anything you do is wonderful. We   ll support  you all the way.    So, she agreed. She loves to work on the computer,  and she finds all kinds of interesting things. She has sent stuff out. Well,  as people were leaving the room, having voted to close it out, they said,     When   s our next meeting?    (Laughter) After a while, Darrell Watts     What year was the Society founded? I   m testing you now.  I don   t know. (Laughs) Conrad does. If he stops and thinks about it, he  can figure it out.  Do you have an archive of all the newsletters? Are you the archive?  I have stuff in the computer. I have boxes of stuff. When Jeff Moseley  was the secretary, he did a really good job, and there   s stuff out in the  barn in boxes that needs to go somewhere. Conrad worked with the OSU  Library, and it   s been going to happen, and it just never has. There   s  stuff under the bed. There   s stuff in the barn. There   s stuff in the  computer.  I   m going to kick that marble and try to get it going again. How   s that?  I can print off everything that   s in the computer. You can have all that.  A lot of stuff, I   ve made copies for    Any time somebody at the School  of International Studies wants something, they   ll ask and I   ll print it out,  or dig it out or find it or something. For a number of years, it happened  that, back then, Best Western was being managed by the parent of some  of my school kids, and that was a real help  to have people stay there .  Everything was under one roof, and people didn   t have to drive at night.  It was really handy. We thought we might be able to get that set up for  this year, and we were underway when I got ready to sign a contract, lo  and behold, they   d changed personnel. I met the manager, but the sales  manager  at Holiday Inn  happens to have worked at our church during  Wednesday night fellowship meals, and that has been very helpful.  That   s where we   re going to wind up being this year.  38  Sherman  Evans  Sherman  Overall, how do you feel about your Ethiopian experience?  It   s a really wonderful thing to have a job where you feel like you   re  doing something for someone and it   s being appreciated. You can see  that good is coming from the efforts. So many of our former students are  now in positions of leadership, either in their country or around the  world. Like the friends with three children, two that are medical doctors  and one that   s in New York City in computer communications. It was an  Ethiopian who developed the satellite interchange, not necessarily  former student of ours. It was a wrong concept, darkest Africa. It may  just have been not known.  All people have potential, and the immigrant population that has come to  this country, and I   m a product of it and Conrad is a product of it, I don   t  know your genealogy, but I   m sure you are, too. We all are. The  American Indians came from someplace else. We are made from the  experiences of others that have come together. It was an experience that  changed our lives, and it was a very good experience. Now, that doesn   t  mean everyday was sunshine and sweet music. Everything has its  problems from time to time. Sometimes problems can be severe, but  everything has its problems. But it was a wonderful experience.  Well, again, I   m going to thank you for your time and allowing me to  visit with you today. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope this reunion  coming up in October is well-received, and hopefully I can stumble by.  -------  -------
