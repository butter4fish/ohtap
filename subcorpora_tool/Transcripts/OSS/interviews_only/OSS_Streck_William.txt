 Little Thunder This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Saturday, September 16, 2017. I   m interviewing Bill Streck for the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Bill, you graduated from OSU, went on to University of Missouri and University of Rochester to complete medical training and serve as a professor of clinical medicine, then worked as CEO of an academic medical center. You   ve been involved with healthcare policy councils for many years, but our interview is going to focus on your undergraduate experiences here and your involvement with the Friday Afternoon Tea and Glee Society. Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Streck I was born in Parsons, Kansas, and moved to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, when I was eight. I consider myself an Oklahoman, in truth, and my family, all of us grew up in Oklahoma City. I still have two sisters in that city, so that I would always call home.  Little Thunder What did your parents do for a living?  Streck My father was in the building and construction trade, initially as a sales representative for many years. Then at the latter stages of his career, he was the president of a building supply company. My mother was a church secretary for most of her career. I have three siblings, (I   m the oldest) a brother and then two sisters, and we are all Oklahomans. I would say that   s the one thing that we will always claim.  Little Thunder What was it like growing up in Oklahoma City, although you have a lot of memories of Parsons, too, I imagine?  Streck Limited memories of Parsons. Oklahoma City was   . As much as young people have memories, they were happy memories of a great family. We were very involved with the church at that time. The minority group that we were, being Catholics in Oklahoma in that period in time, the family was 5  very oriented around Christ the King Parish in the northern part of Oklahoma City. Really, that always was sort of the lodestone of the family life and church life.  Little Thunder Any school experiences that indicated the road you would eventually take in your life, in terms of career?  Streck The one interesting, in a way, thing was that I went to a private, Catholic boys    school. It was sort of a pre-seminary, clearly premature at that age, but it was a very life-influencing experience for me because it was an extremely liberal education in terms of philosophy, social philosophy. Church theology at that time, as opposed to now, it was the    liberal gospel   . Social justice was a large part of my high school education, so I felt that was significant. My parents were Kennedy Democrats, so that was a transition phase. They had always been Democrats, but as we got into the Vietnam War and all the things that then started abutting with the college experience, it was hard on a lot of families. It was hard for my dad. He was always a wonderful man and loyal to everyone and a rock of integrity, but it was hard for him to experience his sons   . Both my brother and I had difficulty being supportive of the war, so that transition, which we worked through eventually, it was hard.  Little Thunder How old were you at that time?  Streck That would   ve been when I was a freshman, probably a freshman in college.  Little Thunder You were already   .  Streck Yeah.  Little Thunder How did you end up at OSU?  Streck Inadvertently. I actually went to college at Rockhurst College in Kansas City,  Missouri , which is a Jesuit college. I had a very successful first semester, save for the fact that the prefect in our dorm found beer bottles in my roommate and my room. We, the two of us, in my mind, obviously in retrospect, were made sacrificial lambs to a discipline they could not enforce, and I was actually forced to withdraw. Then I came to Oklahoma State because I had more acquaintances here, more friends, and Frank McFarland, Dr. McFarland, was the  student affairs  dean at that time. It took a special hearing with him to get me into Oklahoma State University. He was very generous because the admissions office had admitted me until they learned of my indiscretion, and then they had withdrawn the forms. I had to come back the next day and talk to the dean. The irony in that, not lost on me, was that three years later I was working with Dr. McFarland on 6  one of the college committees on something on discipline or something like that. There was a little irony in the whole thing. (Laughter)  Little Thunder There is. Now, I want to get this straight. The school that you   d come from, though, were you on a seminary path?  Streck No, no. I had left. I just was going to college.  Little Thunder You were just going to school there.  Streck Right.  Little Thunder When you were admitted, had you decided what you were going to major on, or did you discover that?  Streck I always felt an allure toward medicine. I was pre-med and had hopes, but I never felt that there was any guarantee that I could get into medical school. I remember at that time, Johnson was president, and there was talk of socialized medicine. It appealed to me. I thought doctors get paid a fixed amount, you take care of people, you organize things. Even then, it had a very na  ve and uneducated allure, but I majored in psychology and minored in English, the psychology so I would have a career, and the English because I loved it. Then I took   all my other courses were in philosophy. There was a professor named Gerald Clements, who was a great philosophy professor.  I took every course I could with him. My premise was that I would take the minimal amount of math and science to get into medical school so that I could be educated when I got there, if I got there. Physics and some of the courses here, I found excruciating. I got through that stuff and then got admitted to medical school right about the time there was a lot of consternation about draft lottery numbers. I was deferred because I had gotten into medical school. I don   t remember exactly, but I think my lottery number would have put me in the reachable group at that time. There   s a lot of luck for many of us during those years.  Little Thunder Right, especially feeling the way you did about the war.  Streck Yes. I had ambivalence about the war, but I think, to be honest, the main thing is I didn   t want to go. That was it. Both at the Newman Center and (I   ve since learned) at the Wesley Center here, there were a lot of people who had a lot of concerns. I was exposed to them on the campus, and there was a certain resonance with the discomfort.  Little Thunder Going back to Dr. Clements quickly, what did you like about his classes?  7  Streck The emphasis in his philosophy was the philosophy of language,  Ludwig  Wittgenstein and some of these philosophers who really focused on language as a way of communication. I found that fascinating. I always have been fascinated by language, communication and language and philosophy. I say that   s a chair. How do you know it   s a chair? It was a way of thinking, and he was just great. He was great at it. I   ve since seen in our little alumni thing that he died a few years ago, but I will always be grateful to him for expanding the way I thought about language and philosophy and words. They were great experiences.  Little Thunder What were some of your other favorite classes?  Streck There was an English professor, and before I came for this interview, I tried to catch someone because I   m sure she would know his name. I forgot his name, but he was very idiosyncratic. He only had classes at seven thirty in the morning because he only wanted students who wanted to take his course.     I took as many courses with him. He was very demanding. He was very demanding. He was a great guy, and I   m embarrassed that for this interview I didn   t bother to try to track down his name. He was a very, very demanding guy, unusually so, I would say. The seven-thirty timeframe was clearly illustrative of his approach.  Little Thunder Right, that   s a great strategy. How about social activities, on or off campus?  Streck That is really a vague part of my memory of OSU. It truly is.  Little Thunder You were a serious student.  Streck I was a student; I think I was serious. A lot of stuff centered, at least in the first few years, around the social programs at the Newman Center, the Catholic center. Brought in Cesar Chavez and the Berrigans  Philip and Daniel , there was a very activist component there. I was comfortable with that and a lot of the people there. I was an independent. I was not in a fraternity. I wouldn   t say I was immensely popular in any circles. (Laughs) I met a number of wonderful people, and I had friends, but it was a pretty relaxed enterprise. I think it was probably my junior year that I became more active in the politics, and then that created another circle of colleagues. That   s where Ken and I, Ken Dahms and I, connected. Then I guess it must have been my senior year that I ran for the student senate purposefully.  I was involved in the politics before that in the background, understanding the parties. There   s nothing more intense than something unimportant like a college political party. (Laughter) There was a lot of back and forth and things, and our party wanted to win. There were political differences on the campus before things really started flaring. Then my senior year, I would say, was mostly spent in those activities and then working with the student 8  senate. Margaret Brooks and all the dilemmas there, the speakers policies, that became a consuming thing on that side. On the other side, it was just   I had a lot of nice friends. We did things together, but it was not memorable other than it was college, and it was good to be in college.  Little Thunder Were you involved with The Drummer at all?  Streck I was not involved with The Drummer, other than being a reader. I knew who Ron Stevens was, and I knew some of the people. I would never claim to be at the epicenter of that creative endeavor and a lot of the creative things that were going on on campus. I was more linear, I would say. I was studying for medical school. The senate was the transition to actually step in and become more activist.  Little Thunder Right, because you   d run for that office with what in mind? What kind of changes did you want to see?  Streck There was just increasing discomfort about the campus. It was banning the ACLU from using the campus.  Little Thunder This came before the OSU campus speakers policy?  Streck Yeah, that was one of the triggers.  Little Thunder Can you talk about that a little bit?  Streck The director of the Student Union took it upon himself to ban the ACLU from using the facilities. It wasn   t even a speech. It was just for a meeting, and so that rankled people.  Little Thunder Because you guys paid your fees to   .  Streck Yeah, we didn   t think of it in that sophisticated a term. It seemed odd. It slowly built, where   . In my viewpoint, there were true thinkers and leaders, of which I would not number myself, created The Drummer, followed some of these things through. Then some of us, like myself, joined, and we had politically organizing instincts, how to extend this and the coalition built around, really, the principles. It was not a coalition built on lifetime friendships or a fraternity or independent. It was a coalition of people about ideas. That   s what made it rather interesting.  Little Thunder That struck you as wrong, and so you were uncomfortable with that. How about the OSU campus speakers policy when they refused   .  Streck That ignited things. The ACLU thing in my memory (and others may have more precise thoughts) was like,    What? Wait a minute. We don   t 9  understand this.    The campus didn   t blow up. Early on in Dr.  Robert  Kamm   s tenure   and he was a new president about then. I think he only came in at    67,    66 or    67. He banned Thomas Altizer, the    God is dead    minister. I think he was an ordained minister. That ban took place, and so that got people riled. Then it was a progressive series of   .  Little Thunder Because there was a student committee that chose the speakers.  Streck Right, yeah.  Little Thunder You weren   t involved with that     Streck No.  Little Thunder    but you were in the senate.  Streck In truth, (somebody talked about this last night) this was an issue that might have died, but again it appeared that President Kamm wanted to make a point. Every time there was an opportunity to let something slide, it seemed like the opposite tack was taken. Altizer was banned, and  Timothy  Leary was banned. Then somewhere in there, the black student group wanted to invite Adam Clayton Powell. They announced it, and it was announced the next day he couldn   t come. There was a series of things that built. That   s when Ken and I, in the spring of    68 (yes, because it was during the campaign) we spent several months (probably started in February, I think) and compiled a book of all events and all the newspaper articles, pro and con, in Oklahoma and on the campus.  It   s really a history of the speaker policy, writ through newspapers, letters to the editor, not through any academic effort, I will say, and we put that together. I was just looking at it; it still holds together. We wrote a little introductory section saying,    Okay, this is about this section. This is about the Leary event. This is about the Powell event.    We sent it to John Kenneth Galbraith, who at that time was a very distinguished economist from Harvard. We were unaware that they had been working for a year to get him in the Great Speakers program. We wrote and said,    We just don   t think   .     Little Thunder Who had been working, the committee     Streck The committee. Dr.  Daniel  Kroll, I think it was, and the Great  Issues  Committee. We wrote and said,    We would like for you to not come to support this policy,    and this was two months    of work. Then we sent it off, pledging our sacred honor to each other as we signed. I read   .  Little Thunder In protest   .  10  Streck In protest of this, and saying to him,    You know, we   re putting our careers at stake.    We didn   t realize we maybe were. We knew it was intense. So we sent it, and then we didn   t hear. Then we got a telegram saying that he would certainly have to come because he could not essentially give up the opportunity to watch, in person, this sort of idiotic thinking. It was a very sarcastic telegram, so we thought,    Okay, we   ll take that.    Two weeks later, he sent another telegram, saying he had considered it more and he just could not come at that time because it would seem to support the program, but that he would come any time in the future for free.  Little Thunder What a great response.  Streck That was a brilliant response. That telegram is in the Archives here; David  Peters  has that. Then a number of things happened that were not typical for college seniors hoping to graduate. Ken and I had to come back to campus, and a couple of professors   I think Dr. Richard Cummins, he was an engineering professor. He was the head of the AAUP, the American Association of University Professors, which was a somewhat liberal wing on the campus. I think they were also   he or somehow the ACLU was involved. I contacted him, and he had Ken and I come to the campus immediately. It was on spring break, and we met him in his office. He said,    We   re going over to the president   s office right now. You have to tell him it   s you, you have to tell him why, and we   re going to go in and tell him because nobody knows who it is,    etcetera.  Little Thunder The president had found out about it how?  Streck Through the newspaper, like everyone else. Big headlines, it was a big deal because there had been a lot   .  Little Thunder The letters had been shared with the newspaper?  Streck His telegram was shared. I don   t know how it got out, actually, but they were quoting it extensively in the newspaper. Then we went in and told Dr. Kamm, who was very displeased, but we explained why we did it. He expressed profound disappointment and thought it was a bad thing to do, but we didn   t. Then we left. I was reviewing this again recently. Then Ken and I put out a press statement the next day. (Laughs) I didn   t remember that, so somebody must have guided us through all this. We put out a press statement under our name, explaining why we had done it. The controversy simmered on for a while, but it moved more internally. Here it became internal, and I think there was a sense that the president wanted some students expelled, none specified. Ken and I always assumed we were on that list. We would have been expelled; others would have been told not to return the next year. There was some mad mixture of that, and it did not occur. The dean named Frank McFarland, the guy who let me in, literally, 11  was also the last bastion of my staying in, in my retelling of the story because he would not take action on these things.  Again, as the story goes, he was concerned about his long-term career, so he moved from the administrative side to the   . He accepted a tenured position in education here. There was that sense about the place at that time. This seems relentlessly critical of Dr. Kamm, and we really disagreed with him, but he had his reasons, and he had his pressures, too. The regents were very supportive of him. If you go through this collection that Ken and I put together, most newspapers in the state were very supportive of him. Having now spent thirty years as a CEO and in politics, I understand how hard it can be to deal with the various constituencies. In this instance, I did think and I continue to think it was the wrong path. It was one that Oklahoma State had to get behind it, which it did eventually, but not until the next year when someone followed us and sued (Laughs) and won on the speaker policy. That   s the way that worked out.  Little Thunder A student sued?  Streck Yes, I don   t know the details of that story. The following year, someone, I think a student, or it may have been an attorney, (I should know this) was inspired by the work of the FATAGS  Friday Afternoon Tea and Glee Society  group and everything that had gone into this. There was a lawsuit filed that eventually got the speaker policy, this regressive policy that had been articulated, could not be supported. That happened after I left. I didn   t know that happened until I came back for this reunion.  Little Thunder Wow. You mentioned Margaret Brooks. What about her goal and your interactions with her?  Streck Margaret was a professor. She was the advisor to the student senate. That was her main role, and she wrote very thoughtful articles.  Little Thunder And director of the honors program.  Streck The director of the honors program. She also wrote a five-page series for The Drummer on academic freedom and thought and all of this. I think Margaret Brooks, as far as we knew, she was a bit of a gadfly to the administration because she articulated these points that were constantly not necessarily of their purview. The precipitant came when they would not allow her to be the advisor to the student senate.  Little Thunder As a result of the Galbraith incident?  Streck No, no, this was before.  12  Little Thunder This was before.  Streck This was before, so it was just another example of how to really pour gasoline on a fire, in a way. There were concerns about the speaker policy. There were concerns about things, but then basically she became a martyr to the cause. She did. I think that her career was truncated because of all this, too. She was everyone   s heroine, appropriately so. She was a real rock of integrity. Someone commented; I think Ken. Ken commented in a letter or in a text that he wrote for our little reunion, which I   m attending now and why I   m here for this interview, that the one thing he regrets is that all of us failed to appreciate the risk and the dangers the faculty went through in support of our na  ve idealism.  I think all of us in retrospect, each of us having been tested from minor to major ways because there are a lot of academics here, understand there was a lot at stake. For me, personally, I was always worried about Dr. McFarland because I never knew what happened to him until the last few years. I learned from my colleagues that he had a fairly happy ending in the college of education, because I knew when I left, I left in trouble, and I left knowing that he was in trouble. That had not played out by the time I graduated, and by then I was just another self-interested college graduate. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Do you have any memories of the particular speakers that were invited and turned down, I guess,  Abbie  Hoffman or  Jerry  Rubin?  Streck Hoffman and Rubin, that was the next year. Hoffman was the next year. No, I never heard any of the speakers. None could ever get here. (Laughter)  Little Thunder You could go to the Newman Center and hear Cesar Chavez.  Streck And the Berrigans, but you couldn   t go to Oklahoma State University and hear some of these people.  Little Thunder Your attendance of the Berrigan speaker event, was that really   . You were already feeling ambivalent, but did that sort of cement your views?  Streck I don   t remember it being   . I think the Berrigans came, and that was about it. The free speech issue here was distinct from the war issue, so there were not six thousand people on the campus protesting the Vietnam War.  Little Thunder Were there any?  Streck Yeah, there were protests, and there were comments. The free speech issue was the galvanizing issue,    67 and    68. Vietnam was a tortuous issue for everyone, and there was some crossover. The group that is meeting this 13  weekend after fifty years of careers, more or less following their beliefs that were expressed then, that was mainly the free speech issue.  Little Thunder Do you have an opinion about Governor  Dewey  Bartlett   s role when this broke, all this was going on?  Streck It was only in reviewing some of the newspaper articles in preparation for this that I read about all the missteps he made, right along with President Kamm. It was their belief, (I got it firm) particularly in this era of free speech now where we have the opposite, they were doing what they thought they should do. When Altizer came, for instance, he was banned here and spoke at OU the same weekend. George Cross was the president of OU at that time. Bartlett praised Kamm and didn   t mention Cross. That was the more politically expedient stance, in addition to which, he may have believed this as more than a political venture.  Then the state senate took up a resolution to write a firm speaker policy that was very restrictive. Someone, I think the attorney general, told them that they couldn   t do that. It was unconstitutional. It seems simpler in retrospect. They were tense times, and people were on edge. There were the assassinations; there was a violence in the country. It wasn   t like these were tea and glee discussions, really. They had implications for families everywhere. Everything had a ripple, and it was an uncomfortable time for the country.  Little Thunder Right, there were all these currents we were getting caught up in. Do you remember any of the black student protests?  Streck I remember them. I remember some of the leaders; some of them are here. Some of the stories I wasn   t even aware of when some of them went on. After the protests, the black basketball players were dropped from the team because they were    late   . There were events going on quite distinct from anything I knew about. Quite honestly   .  Little Thunder Did that get coverage in The Drummer, do you know?  Streck I don   t know. I don   t think that was a big   I looked at The Drummers today. I don   t remember that being   . I don   t remember what year that was. I would not want to be seen as, in any way, thinking I was a key part of any of this. I was just a part of it, circling in at times, swirling out at times, circling in, swirling out. I think the Galbraith event moved Ken and I to a prominence probably not warranted. Ken had been very much a leader in other ways around campus, but the Galbraith event was a very catalyzing event for us, in terms of the whole process.  Little Thunder What did you after leaving OSU? What was your first step? 14  Streck My first step was to try to pass biophysics in medical school, and I failed. (Laughter)  Little Thunder At University of Missouri?  Streck University of Missouri, I failed my first biophysics exam. That was my first big move after leaving college. It took me a while to recover from that. I went to my professor, who was a crazy man. It had been a very crazy exam, I must say, in retrospect. He said,    I still think you have a chance to make it.    (Laughter) I was like,    That was not the encouragement I was looking for.    In any case, I went to medical school, and it was a great choice for me. I   ve loved medicine. It   s an extraordinary privilege to be a physician. I   ve never, ever, ever regretted the opportunity to be a physician. I finished medical school, and then quite serendipitously became aware of the University of Rochester Medical School because two of the deans of Missouri were from Rochester. Made this little traverse, starting at Atlanta and going up the coast, and down through the Adirondacks. First time ever I had really done any of that as a little Oklahoma boy.  Little Thunder Traveled that part of the country.  Streck I remember coming down from Vermont through the Adirondacks, which was New York, thinking,    This is New York.    Rochester was one of the very top programs at that time, really a superb program, and I was fortunate enough to get in. I applied. My wife, I had met Karen, my wife, shortly before I flunked that biophysics exam. I think that was our introduction. (Laughter) In time, we had married, so by the time I graduated, we had a child, a dog, and a cat that we were going to have to move across country. She had never seen the place. I had secured housing; I had done all this stuff; she had seen nothing. We just got in the car and drove. Rochester was a great experience for both of us. Then from Rochester to Cooperstown, and that   s where we   ve been since. It   s been a wonderful time. Medicine has been spectacular as a field with social justice, economics, finance, philosophy. It   s the confluence of a lot of the values that we were battling about long ago. Maybe not free speech. I don   t think that   s been a big problem in medicine, but social justice, I would say, remains an issue in healthcare. That   s really been a large part of my work.  Little Thunder What skills did you learn at OSU that you think played a role in your career?  Streck I would say I always had some political instincts, but the student senate at Oklahoma State University, where votes mattered in our little world, I learned how to get the votes in the student senate. (Laughter) As a small lab for training in a political career, it was a first step. 15  Little Thunder You   re in a really different environment and climate up there in New York State.  Streck It is quite different. I worry about Oklahoma. I worry about the investment in education in Oklahoma. I know all about Obamacare and the states that took it and the states that didn   t. In my opinion, it was so foolish not to take the Medicaid expansion. The exchanges are debatable; they can be fixed. There   s an inherent cruelty in some of this politics, in my mind. It   s all political. It had nothing to do with looking at people who have these needs. New York   s just the opposite. We have an incredibly expanded Medicaid approach. We pay a lot of taxes to support that, but that   s New York. That   s the way it goes. You want to live there. I could say the same for Oklahoma. We don   t. That   s who we are, but there   s a lot of people left out in the roles here, I think, in terms of healthcare. In New York, that   s not the case. Now, we battle about how much it costs, (I   m not sure what the battle is here) but it   s not about who   s covered. Enough editorializing there. My sisters are here; my sisters are teachers. I   ve watched the dollars reduce for education here. It   s a different state than the one in which I grew up, I would say, I think.  Little Thunder How important is it for you to stay in touch with the   .  Streck FATAG group? It   s not, in a way. I haven   t seen these people in fifty years. One of our comments   .  Little Thunder They   ve had three reunions, I think.  Streck They   ve had three reunions, much smaller reunions than this, from what I understand. As I said, I was a pretty peripheral player in all this. Some of them, I   d say The Drummer group and the immediate   the first circle was The Drummer group, then another circle. Then a larger circle are a number of the rest of us. It was never a group that depended on each other for anything more than getting the work done in these areas and using supplemental participants such as myself. I think one of the questions that has resonated in the group is why everybody came.  Little Thunder Why do you think they came?  Streck I think it was part curiosity and part validation to see what   s happened to these people who felt so strongly then. There   s some curiosity about that. The other part, I would have to say, has been the validation here. These people have done extraordinary things, the ones that have come back who were also at the epicenter of what was going on, international things, diverse things, things in literature. It   s a group that maintained its commitment, and there   s something reaffirming. We heard Fred Harris, the former senator, 16  speak last night to our group. He   s ninety years old. He   s brilliant. His memory, he recalls details of conversations with Lyndon Johnson and the jokes that were part of the conversation. It was a tour de force last night, listening to him.  He was, in a way, one of our mentors and supporters through all of this because he was aware of it and he knew what was going on. I believe he suggested to the legislature that they might reconsider some of their thinking. It   s been a curiosity and an affirmation in seeing people who as young na  ve idealists are now aged idealists with artificial joints and a lot of life lessons behind them. In the group, I feel privileged to be part of the group, but I really feel like I have a very boring r  sum  . It   s very linear. I did my job in healthcare as a CEO and all this, and I   m proud of that work, but it seems unimaginative in this group. (Laughs) I will just say that. They have done some amazing things, truly amazing things, these individuals.  Little Thunder When you come back to campus and see the changes, what are your thoughts?  Streck I ran around the campus today, and it   s impressive. It means somebody   s committing a lot of money to the bricks and mortar of education. It   s the bricks and mortar part that   I think we have to be careful about the bricks and mortar in education, and I don   t mean just at Oklahoma State. It   s like hospitals. We   re putting billions of dollars into bricks and mortar, and the whole system is shifting away to ambulatory care, doing anything to avoid being near a hospital. There are pictures of lecture halls at Stanford. It   s an empty room, and it   s not being facetious. That is the way the lectures are done. It   s all electronic, etcetera. That was one of my thoughts today, that there are, first of all, people who are donating and governments donating, and we   re investing a lot in structure.  It   s a legitimate question, (it may be a na  ve question) but I think a legitimate one is,    Is that the model, the way we   re going to educate in the future, with all these new buildings?    You need performing arts centers. I guess we need engineering schools. I don   t know, just a lot of construction. It   s impressive. It means success, I guess. It   s a sign of success. I   ll put it that way. That means enrollment is good. From what I understand, this is a good university. I don   t know, but those who seem to know think it is. When I was here with Dr. Kamm and all of us, I would not have put Oklahoma State in the top rungs of universities then. I always felt that all you had to do was find the right professors, so I found them. That was my goal, to find the ones that were really the ones that would make your education rich, and Oklahoma State provided that to me.  Little Thunder Thank you for your time today, and thank you for your contributions.  17  Streck There weren   t many. (Laughs) Thank you.  -------  -------
