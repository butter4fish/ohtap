 Gill. Today is May 18, 2010. I   m visiting with Brian  Kent Sampson at the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Kent, you   re very special to  thousands of students and former students here at Oklahoma State  University in your forty-one year career in residential and Student Life.  You have literally touched the lives of thousands of students. Before we  talk about that experience, though, Kent, I   d like to back up and ask you  a little bit about your life before OSU. Can you share a little bit about  your early life, where you grew up, your parents, et cetera?  Yes. I was raised in good old Grady County down there, raised on a  farm ten miles southwest of Chickasha, and actually went to a small  rural school by the name of Pioneer for my first eight grades. My uncle,  as a matter of fact, was my math teacher in that little Pioneer school.  Pioneer had lost its high school, so then I went the additional ten miles  into town to Chickasha where I went ninth through the twelfth grade. So,  I graduated from Chickasha High in    65.  Actually, one interesting thing about my background, Jerry, is, raised in  Chickasha. I was very well acquainted with OU, University of  Oklahoma, because we were so close in geographic proximity. I spent a  lot of time there on the campus in my high school years, and I wasn   t  very acquainted with Stillwater at that time at OSU. I actually, at that  time, as I was finishing high school, was trying to make some decisions  on what to do next, in terms of college. I knew I was going somewhere. I  got a small scholarship offer. I ran track in high school, pretty average  track competitor, by the way, but I ran track, quarter mile and mile relay,  things like that. I got a small scholarship offer to go to Southwestern at  Weatherford. So, that   s where I started in the fall of    65. Did my four  years there. I got my bachelor   s degree at Southwestern. So from  Chickasha to Weatherford, Oklahoma.  5  The only other thing I   d say about upbringing, what brought me here  was my parents. My dad was full Norwegian, Blanchard Sampson, B. G.  Sampson, born in Illinois. His parents had moved them to Grady County  in the early 1900s because they felt that the environment that they were  around in Illinois, about an hour south of Chicago, was a little bit too  liberal to raise a family in. Free-flowing booze, and things like that. So,  my grandfather moved the family and bought the land, a quarter section  there in Grady County.  The other thing I think I   d say about my parents and being raised, my  mother was an educator, school teacher, administrator. Dad was a small-town  farmer, and also drove one of the public school buses for  Chickasha during his later years. Both lived to be ninety-two, full lives. I  was one of five kiddos. One daughter, and four brothers, including two  that are twins, one set of twins.  So anyway, I get to Southwestern, and I should insert this about  Southwestern, probably. Like I said, I was a pretty average track guy, no  fame and fortune there for sure, but I did participate. I always said part  of my reason for not being more successful in track was that my part-time  job at night was working at Ken   s Villa Roma, where we  specialized in pizza, charburgers and steaks. And, you know, they let  you eat and drink there. I always had plenty to consume at Ken   s Villa  Roma, so I   m sure I didn   t keep the weight off as well as I might   ve  because of working at Ken   s. But what really influenced my career was  that at Southwestern I got very involved in undergraduate activities, and  I was selected as the outstanding senior in the graduating class. I was  student body president at Southwestern. I was one of four or five co-founders  of the Oklahoma Intercollegiate Legislature, which still exists  today. After four years, our OSU students send a delegation up to the  State Capitol every fall and spring. We sent about forty-five kids this  year, so I helped form OIL, Oklahoma Intercollegiate Legislature.  My point is, it   s those undergraduate years, though I hadn   t figured it out  then, I knew that I had some ability in working with students and student  issues. I was willing to put the time in to provide leadership and service,  but I didn   t know there was such a thing as a career in that, even though  I knew my Dean of Students, Dr.  W. C.  Burris, who later became  president at Western Oklahoma State  College , and Clint Ponder was  our Dean of Men. He was my track coach, so I knew that there were  these guys that had a role with Student Life, kind of, but I didn   t really  fully know and appreciate that there was a career possible in student  affairs, as we know it.  One other side note, maybe on the humorous side, I   ll mention this. I   ll  6  Gill  Sampson  always remember Dean Ponder called me in the office my, I guess it was  early my senior year. It was a small Greek system, fraternity/sorority  system, and a bunch of us guys had felt like it didn   t have a lot to offer  us, so we formed our own club called the Collegiate Diners and Service  Organization. I just share this as humor on this. We were very  successful, academically, leadership, service, intramurals, so much so  that some of the fraternities were being kind of threatened with  membership because so many guys were interested in our group. In fact  my brother-in-law, who came from Boston, Massachusetts, to be a  quarterback for the football team, was among the members. Anyway, to  make a long story short, Dean Ponder called myself and a couple other  officers in. He said,    Hey boys, I   ve got right over here your r  sum    and your academic record, and I know you   ve done well here, but I want  you to realize you   re damaging our small fraternity system because so  many people are coming to your group. Therefore, I   m going to keep  your records and materials here on my desk and challenge you guys to  either disband or charter nationally with a fraternity to bring to campus  to be a part of the Greek system.     That was my senior year, and of course then I graduate and move on to  start graduate work. And so what finally happened, they ultimately did,  within that next year, affiliate with the national Phi Delta Theta, so they  did become a fraternity, but not because we wanted to at the time, but  because we really were required to. And so I share that, again, as part of  that student life experience that I had in student organizations.  And then, Jerry, I head up here in the fall of    69 after working in the  summer with Southwestern Company, the summer of    69, and come up  here to start a graduate degree in psychology. Though I did take leave of  absence for a semester with Zelma Patchin, on Semester at Sea, was  assistant dean of students on the ship, and I can get to that later if you  want to, what an experience, a full semester on the ocean with 700  students.  Let me back up here and ask you a couple questions, Kent, kind of back  to your early life. Growing up, were there some values and principles  that you learned from your family that influenced you in your success  later in life? Working on a farm or other things, discipline?  Yes, I think working on the farm, where everybody had to pitch in and  do something together   I   ve said this many times to my kids is that  there   s something about being raised in the country on the farm,  particularly in these earlier years, where you have to create your own  fun. You have to be creative. It   s not done for you. It   s not an Xbox or a  computer that you can get wrapped up in. You created your own  experiences and fun and stories, so I think the farm experience was great  7  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  in terms of encouraging creativity. And, of course, my parents, being big  on education. My mother went back and got a bachelor   s degree after  she had five children.  Wow.  And then her master   s degree at OU later, and ultimately was head of the  Head Start program in Chickasha. She taught first grade, and then  became an administrator. So, education was important to my parents, as  it was to my grandparents. My grandfather, who was ninety-six when he  died, actually lived in the old farmhouse that we lived in, that still stands  today. He had an influence because he had allowed a little plot of land  on our farm for a little small country school to be built, called Banner  School that   s no longer there. He was on the school board at Banner  School on our property way back in the early 1900s. So, education came  across as important to my parents, and kind of a work ethic, you know,  that you all pitched in. Whether it was cotton or raising watermelons,  you all pitched in and contributed to the cause. The other thing that  crosses my mind, Jerry, is that though my father could speak Norwegian,  and my grandfather, they were both full Norwegian, all along, the  spoken language was always English. You needed to learn to be a part of  the society that you were a part of.  Did you learn any Norwegian?  I did. My main line is,    Har du ikke respekt for seg selv?    Which means,     Don   t you have any self-respect?    (Laughter)  Did you hear that a lot?  Somewhere along the line I was taught that, and I   ve never forgotten  that.  Kent, being a farm kid, did you participate in 4-H or FFA?  I did. Mine was 4-H, and in eighth grade at Pioneer School, my last year  there, I was president of our local 4-H. I remember I entered the county  fair and won seventy-five cents for something. I always remember the  district supervisor said,    Gosh, you   re 4-H president, and you only win  seventy-five cents    worth of awards at the county fair?    I said,    Eh, I  wasn   t great at it.    But, yes, 4-H was influential for me. I didn   t continue  it on in high school in Chickasha, but I did out there.  What about some of your community and school activities in Chickasha?  I had a chance to be involved. I was class president my junior and senior  8  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  year in Chickasha. I did play sports. I went out for football my  sophomore year, in a year where there weren   t a lot of players on the  team. I played football all three years, and my senior year, I was a  center. Because the guy ahead of me got canned for behavioral issues, I  got to start my senior year the last eight of ten games or something. I  always remember the quote in the Chickasha Daily Express was,    A  Hustling Center Found,    because I wasn   t a great athlete, but I played  football those three years.  I tried to play basketball, and coach Jerry Jobe, who later coached at  Oklahoma Christian  University , a lot of people in the state knew Jerry.  My sophomore year I went out, we had pretty good basketball, and I   ll  always remember this line. Coach Jobe, after seeing me working out and  trying to do my thing, he pulled    By the way, I carried the nickname  into Chickasha of    Pioneer,    so if you talk to anybody at Chickasha  these days who knows me, they say,    Oh, Pioneer Sampson.    I carried  that nickname from Pioneer School. I   ll always remember coach Jobe  saying, pulling me aside as a sophomore. He pulled up a little metal  folding chair, and said,    Pioneer, during this scrimmage, why don   t you  guard that metal chair.    So, that was the message I kind of got then, that  Coach Jobe was feeling maybe I didn   t have too much potential for  basketball. He assigned me to guard the metal folding chair. So, I tried  basketball, didn   t work, played football three years. Was involved in  student government things at the high school.  And ran track, obviously.  And ran track, that   s right. Yes, I did try it. And one thing, Jerry, in the  Annals of Chickasha High, I don   t know if you   ll find it, I went out for  baseball my sophomore year. This is part of why I chose track. We were  playing against Anadarko, and there was an all-state pitcher throwing  against us. I   ll never forget getting up to bat, and I had never realized  what a good curveball was until this guy threw it. I was trying to protect  myself and get out of the way, and of course it curves into a strike. As I  was doing that, the bat hits the ball, and it trickles up the infield. I get a  base hit. I knew I couldn   t hit from then on, so I have the only lifetime  batting average of Chick High of 1,000 because I was one for one. That  scared me to death, and I moved to track. (Laughter)  Talking about after your four years there at Southwestern at  Weatherford, you sold books for Southwestern Company for one  summer?  That summer, right.  Door-to-door, right?  9  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  That   s right.  Did you work with Spencer Hays?  I did.  Can you share just real briefly some of your experiences at  Southwestern? What you benefited from it.  Trained at Nashville, worked in Ohio, northwest Ohio, in the  Toledo/Bowling Green area. Lived in a little town named Ottawa, Ohio,  and that summer I even had a chance to do some volunteer work for a  little local Methodist church with some kids, and then the sales. That  was the summer I got to see Neil Armstrong walk on the moon while I  was working in Ohio that summer. We trained with Southwestern in  Nashville, and then got that assignment, myself and a couple other guys,  and it was about self-discipline. It was about work ethic. It was about  learning to promote or sell a product. What I particularly remember,  even today, and I   m reminding my kids this as they grow up, of their  logo, their motto:    I can, I will, I   m going to,    which is a great reminder  about motivation and how much of what we do is controlled or  influenced by what we think we can do, rather than what somebody told  us we can do or can   t do. So, I had a great summer there. Then I came  here and started grad school, but got a lot of training, got a lot of  support, and it was a great experience for a young guy to have to be a  little more self-sufficient, to believe in something, and to promote  something.  What influenced you? So, in 1969, before that summer at Southwestern,  you graduated, and then you came to Oklahoma State University. What  influenced you to come to OSU? Did you intend to stay at OSU? Were  you also looking at a career here, or what was your decision?  You know, grad school was why I came. My thought then, because my  undergraduate majors   I had a double major in psychology and  sociology at Southwestern, and so I was thinking of grad school in  psych. I was thinking of clinical psych, and about then OSU got their  American Psychological Association accreditation. I had also applied at  the University of Colorado. I was also looking at one school in Europe. I  had four or five other serious things in the mill, but being gone all  summer, I get back in August, and I had to make a decision. Like I  mentioned earlier, I really had had a lot of exposure to OU, but not much  to Stillwater, and specifically OSU, not a lot. But I liked the material I  got from them, and I think I was still trying to decide between OSU and  other schools. I decided,    I like what they   ve suggested, so I   m going to  10  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  go to Stillwater, go to OSU and do my master   s.    Of course, I was still  within two hours of Chickasha and people I knew and my family, so I  came here to study psychology. So, it was the academic focus that  brought me here. At that time, it was not about student affairs or even a  career in that yet.  You hadn   t decided yet about a career in student affairs?  Really hadn   t then. Really was just, I was thinking the PhD in clinical  psych and dealing with people with behavioral issues, serious behavioral  issues. That   s kind of what brought me here.  So, Kent, you were then a working student. Did you accept a position  working with the university, and then working concurrently on your  graduate studies?  That   s right. That was the clincher for me career-wise. As I was getting  my enrollment status taken care of in August of    69, I ran into the old  Single Student Housing office on the second floor of the Student Union.  I was looking into housing options, and somehow that day I was  introduced to Mel Wright, who was an All-American basketball player  here who was then assistant director of housing, who was looking for  grad assistants. He introduced me to Al Lewis, who was the head  resident of what was then Twelve Story. The Willham Complex then  wasn   t named Willham Complex. It was named Willham-Twelve Story.  Great story there, too, by the way, about students, but I can come back to  that later. They needed an assistant head resident in Twelve Story, which  was a men   s residence hall. Willham South was fourteen stories, and it  was women then.  So, Mel, as I was just checking into housing, we got acquainted. He said,     Do you have a job or an assistantship?    I said,    No.    He said,    Would  you be interested?    I said,    Well, maybe,    because I had been a resident  assistant at Southwestern, RA on a floor at Neff Hall. So, he introduced  me to Al Lewis. I met also Lynn Jackson, somebody that you knew, who  was director of Single Student Housing then, and they offered me that  job. So, I started as assistant head resident in Willham-Twelve Story in  fall of    69 while I was working on my academic master   s degree. The  experience I got of being assistant head resident, and then head resident  the following year in Murray Hall for men. Then the following year I  was complex director back at Willham, managed the entire complex. It  was during that period of time I decided, as I looked at my academics  and my experience, I said,    Gosh, people have careers in this. People do  this.    And, Jerry, at the same time I realized where clinical psych was  taking me was psychopathology and personality theory and so forth, was  into a little bit more of a narrow area of dealing with people on the ends  11  Gill  Sampson  Gill  of the behavioral continuum, where sometimes you don   t see a lot of  progress. I knew myself well enough to know I   m probably more  effective with the people in the middle of the continuum, maybe like you  and me who have regular ups and downs like students do, rather than  more extreme. So, a combination of seeing that clinical psych was taking  me more to those extremes, and the experiential thing I was getting in  Single Student Housing, later Residential Life, helped me say this might  be a career, because I was doing this in undergrad at Southwestern, and I  liked that. Now, I   m finding out there   s people who do this for a living,  kind of thing.  Kent, at what time did it change for you, as a graduate assistant  position, when you were first working in Murray Hall? Did you work,  then, full time? Were you employed by the university when you went to  take over the complex?  Good point. I was assistant head resident, half-time,    69-   70, in  Willham. Summer of    70, then I was asked to be full-time hall director  head resident in Murray Hall for men, so    70-   71. Actually, I finished     70-   71, and I had just been promoted to Willham Complex director the  spring of    71, which I served that summer. Pat Murphy, by the way, had  stepped aside as residence hall program coordinator. He had moved to  counseling here. He was followed by a one-year person named Walter  Price, who still lives here in town, a retired colonel, I believe. He had  worked one year as residence hall program coordinator, and I think the  fit wasn   t great for him and students, so he stepped aside. So, the  summer of    71 they said,    How about leaving?    I   d just taken the  Willham job as complex director, so I didn   t even complete four or five  months. They said,    We   d like to offer you the job as program  coordinator for Single Student Housing, which means you   d work with  Student Life, student organizations, student government.    I said yes, and  in August of    71, I moved into that role, which I held for six years.  Interestingly enough, August of    71 is when we hosted NACURH   National Association of College and University Residence Halls , the  National Residence Hall Student Leader conference here, so I moved in  in August    71 as the advisor of that group, and all of a sudden had a  national advisor role, because our students had won the bid and were  hosting all these schools from around the country here in August of    71.  So, half-time for a year, and then full-time for like a year and a half, I  guess you   d say, before I then went into the office or administrative side  of Single Student Housing.  Kent, you worked in Residential Life through 1997 before you moved  into your current position. Is that right?  12  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  That   s right.  Could you kind of summarize, and I know it   s pretty lengthy, which is  why I   m saying    summarize briefly    some of the major responsibilities  during those twenty-some-odd years?  Yes, my duties were these over those years: Program coordinator,  assistant head resident, head resident complex director. Then, in the  administrative office area, program coordinator for six years,    71  through    77, working with our student leaders in RHA  Residence Halls  Association . And of course, RHA has been and still is an influential big  student organization since they represent 5,000-6,000 students. Then  they had as many as 8,000 students they represented. By the way, during  this time, I   m on the third floor of the Student Union, room 354. RHA   s  right next door to me. Then I add the title of Assistant Director of Single  Student Housing for Student Life. I still had the RHA side, but then I  was being asked to do more on the Student Life side in the Residence  Halls collectively. We had twenty-some halls then, I think, so I was  assistant director. Took that role in    77, and later became associate  director during that period of time. And all of that was from    77 really  through    96-   97. Those twenty years, the Student Life part was what I  was responsible for in housing, except in 1985 an important change took  place when single housing, married housing, and maintenance and food  service all merged together. So, from    85 to    97, in addition to the  Student Life side, then I took over half of the campus responsibility for  dining, and also for maintenance and housekeeping. So, I was associate  director for that area, but for those nearly twelve years,    85-   97, I took  on the dining component as well as the managerial, supervisory for  dining and also housekeeping and maintenance.  So, if you would, it gave me more responsibility, broadened my scope,  and I worked with some great people in maintenance and housekeeping  and dining, some real committed people. And this has a little bit to do  with me making the change in    97. I think it also took me a little bit  away from what I thought I was best at, had the most experience at.  Those twenty years, I guess,    77-   85, would   ve been primarily Student  Life, then    85-   97, still Student Life, but now I had broadened that area a  little bit more because of this Department of Residential Life coming  together, and Bob Huss being brought in, all those areas coming  together. So, that had some influence on me, because I could   ve  certainly stayed there. Of course, I   d had a lot of people ask me about  housing director jobs elsewhere, but I   ll always remember when Ron  Beer and Tom Keys created this new position, this new department. Of  all the people I sought out then and asked for advice, I was trying to  decide,    Is this the time? Do I make the shift from Res Life after all  these twenty-some years?    I sought out former President  Robert   13  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Kamm, among others, and asked him his opinion, his advice.  Kent, two things: You mentioned some of the names, but who were some  of the people and personalities in Residential Life, particularly in those  early years, that you worked with? Do you have some favorite stories  about some of them?  Oh, yes. Somewhere in here I need to lead off with Tom Zack Cooper. I  got his e-mail address this year. One of our Foundation officers, found  him on the West Coast. Zack was president of our RHA, but also  president of NACURH in    71 when I came in. There   s a really  interesting historical fact. The National Student Leader Organization,  that group that we hosted here during August of    71, Zack was president,  and Zack led the effort to get it to become incorporated. So, NACURH,  even today in the year 2010, its records and founding official documents  are filed in Oklahoma City with the Secretary of State, because  NACURH incorporated in Stillwater, Oklahoma, in 1971 under the  leadership of Tom Zack Cooper. So, I   ve got to mention Tom as one of  those early pioneers and leaders. Very active, very solid, nationally as  well as here.  Thinking of student leaders and staff members as well, are there others?  Yes. Shaila Aery was Associate Director of Single Student Housing  then, who went on to become a national leader in the state of Maryland  as one of three commissioners for higher education in Maryland. Shaila  was very influential, and, by the way, during the summer she would go  to Las Vegas and deal cards. She was single, never married. Zelma  Patchin was Associate Dean of Students, Dean of Women, very  influential lady on me, and is responsible for Shaila and I getting to take  a leave of absence, and going on Semester at Sea with her. Mel Wright,  in housing then, and Al Lewis had an influence on me then.  Later on, a colleague of mine who still today is in the business, Floyd  Hoelting, was in school with me at the same time, did his doctorate here,  went to Western Illinois, went to Illinois State, took an early retirement  at Illinois State. He has now done twelve years as Director of University  Housing Res Life at University of Texas-Austin. Floyd is sixty-seven  now, I think, and still working down there. He came to our daughter   s  wedding, will come to this daughter   s wedding. So, Floyd and I are  long-time pals, if you would, in the profession. I   ll always remember  Floyd and former vice president Norman Moore, the picture in the  Redskin yearbook of them being    hung in effigy    on the porch of  Murray Hall, because they had announced they were going to have to  close Murray Hall that year due to declining occupancy. Lynn Jackson  was a great guy. Lynn had been in the business world and then had  14  Gill  Sampson  gotten a Student Personnel master   s. So, Lynn was the strong fiscal  person, but, you remember him, he was a quiet guy. Wasn   t noisy, didn   t  want a lot of attention, but very competent and very ethical. Lynn was  Director of Single Student Housing then, and was a good leader for  those times, because it was a time of a lot of change and challenge, and  it was a time of a lot of growth. We   d just opened up all these new high  rise residence halls, Willham, Willham Complex as it became, Kerr and  Drummond, and Scott Parker Wentz, our first vertical efforts in  Residential Life. Lynn was a good guy for the time with his business  head, and because of his stability and his maturity. His wife Francis still  lives today in Nevada. I still stay in touch with her.  Picking up on your comments, Kent, about changes in high rises, in your  opinion, what have been some of the major changes in Residential Life  during your career? And, of course, there are the physical facilities like  we were talking about, but you might think about philosophy, staffing,  student expectations, student experiences, just different changes that you  recall.  One thing I want to mention, Jerry, for this record, is Lewie Sanderson,  former comptroller, financial officer, wonderful guy that served on the  University Healthcare Committee years after he retired. What a bright  guy, financial officer. Louie recounted this story to me about the history  even before I came about us going vertical, building high rises. He said,  and I   ll never forget this,    Well, Kent, you know, what drove us to build  the high rises were two things. One is there was not adequate, or enough,  housing in the city of Stillwater to house this population that we were  having, and number two is the post-war baby boom. All these military  veterans    children and veterans themselves were coming to college. So,  what had happened, the post-war baby boom, as it   s referred to, had all  these children of these veterans coming to campus, and there was no  housing. So, if we were going to grow, the university was going to have  to grow it.     So, what happens in a hurry, in five to eight years, Willham Complex,  with fourteen and twelve stories, housed 1,500 students. Kerr  Drummond housed 1,400 students, double rooms. Wentz Hall, a ten-story  building, housed 567 students. Then Scott and Parker each about  230 students. So, all of a sudden, we went vertical, and of course that  was the most economical, efficient way to get there. So, as Sanderson  reminded me, if we are going to grow as a university and accommodate  housing, because the city wasn   t there, we had to go vertical. I insert that  here because when people say,    Why do you have high rises?    Or,     They   re older, they   re not attractive.    Again, you   ve got to reflect on  the time, and that had a lot to do with OSU   s capability of growing when  higher education was starting to boom, also.  15  Gill  Sampson  That was in the sixties, mid- to late sixties?  Yes. Don   t forget, the seventies were a turbulent, difficult time. The  Vietnam War, among other things, was going on, and it was a time     there are words in our profession, Latin words: in loco parentis,  meaning, in the role replace of the parents. There   s no question higher  education, generally, for the most part, and including OSU and our  Board of Regents, coming into that time were practicing in loco  parentis, and that was the norm of the day, in place of the parents. With  some of the changes in society then, more freedoms, came a gradual  erosion or change from in loco parentis. Also, the age of accountability  of students, which was then eighteen, later became twenty-one, for  example, so students were asked to be more treated like adults, with the  same rights and privileges, freedoms, confidentiality. So, over time, that  came in the seventies and early eighties.  My point is, some of the turmoil in the country, in the Vietnam War, is a  convenient stopping point for this discussion, but it   s not all about  feelings around that war. It was about societal changes, too, and the  notion of in loco parentis in higher education changing. So, part of that  change came about because students said,    Treat us like adults. We want  to be treated  as adults . Don   t go to our parents for our grades. Talk to  us about our grades,    et cetera. I still remember the gatherings of  thousands of students, going, moving about the campus at night with  their chant,    No more hours. No more hours.    And their point was they  were challenging the administration and the Board of Regents to say,     You shouldn   t require women to have hours in residence halls,     whatever those hours were. Maybe it was eleven p.m. on weeknights, or  something.    You shouldn   t. No more hours, no more hours.     Ultimately this gets to the Board of Regents, and, as those who were  around here know, the irony in hearing this, of course, what happened,  they imposed hours on men. (Laughs) So, all of a sudden, men who had  no hours had hours, as did women. But that was the notion of some of  the movements then. I still remember John O   Connor, who   s a lawyer  down in Tulsa, was student body vice president, and even today we   ve  laughed about this. Now he   s a lawyer in Tulsa. He and some guys,  along with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who   s now in the US Supreme Court,  she was a lawyer in this case who decided to challenge this age of  accountability in terms of the alcohol law in this state. John and some  student leaders teamed up with others. One young man who was a  Lambda Chi, who is now deceased, challenged this, and Ginsburg was  the lawyer who picked it up and took that forward. So, challenging the  drinking age, the hours, some societal unrest.  16  Gill  Sampson  Gill  I remember the African American boycott, for a period of time. I always  remember President Kamm had a very difficult dilemma, and it all  happened because some yo-yo on University Avenue made the poor  mistake of shooting with a BB gun an African American female walking  along University Avenue. That was just a catalyst to blow some things  up. So now, all of a sudden, the African American students are  boycotting the campus, and have gone to Lake Carl Blackwell where  groups of student affairs administrators go out and try to visit, and  counselors, Howard Shipp and other people at that time, talking with  them. Former President Kamm was going out there. So, it was a mood  and a time of some angst, and it was a lot more than just the Vietnam  War, though certainly it had its presence and some protests. It was about  some societal changes going on.  How did that impact staffing decisions, program decisions, in  Residential Life? How did that shape change?  Those movements did a few things. First of all, I think it forced the  university and student affairs administration, housing, to kind of re-look  priorities a little bit, and at least dialogue them, though there was some  opposition to that, of course, administration, but to at least take a look. It  also required us to take a look, and in a way that has a consistent theme  today with campus security. You still were people who were responsible  for state property and the environment, so all of a sudden you had to take  a look at staff duty, coverage, policies. I remember during part of the  time of unrest, the fire being set in the Stout Hall lobby, during this time  of unrest. The curtains were put on fire. You know, fortunately people  caught it and took care of it, but you know, somebody committed arson  there. So, it was a time where you kind of took a look at your security,  and you never worried about it quite that much, but all of a sudden, there  were some people in extreme positions who were going to do it one way  or the other. And some of those    the other    caused us to take a look at  some situations.  I remember the OSU police had their little Quonset hut out behind the  current Business building, and somebody dropped a homemade bomb in  front of the OSU police office one night that was a dud. It didn   t go off.  So, there were some radical extremes, like there were in the country,  where people wanted it now, wanted it their way, so it caused us to look  at security, even then, in the early seventies, as we   ve had to look at  security in a different light in the 2000s.  How did changing from the high rise   you went from the traditional  one-, two-, three-story halls to the high-rise halls, twelve, fourteen  stories high. Then in the eighties, the movement started, and in the  nineties especially, moving to apartment-style complexes and units,  17  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  apartment suites, et cetera. How did that change Residential Life? How  did it change the student experience?  That   s a great question, and even these days, Jerry, once a month,  President Hargis asks me to facilitate lunch meetings with he and  students. Even today, he has heard students who live in both  environments make comments pro and con. The point is this: what had  happened, of course, society had evolved enough that there were no  longer siblings sharing bedrooms. Siblings were coming to campus with  their own bedroom, sometimes their own bathroom. An expectation  began to be there.    Well, I need more privacy, or my own space, even  more bedroom        Could you explain, Kent, in a high rise hall, what is the situation there?  Yes, the high-rise halls were double-loaded quarters, normally thirty to  thirty-two rooms per floor, so sixty-four students per floor. Two large  common area bathrooms, a floor lounge, and of course, the elevators.  So, there was a sense of, if you will, required community, whether or not  you wanted it, because you met each other in the elevator, in floor-lounge  meetings, and programs, and the bathrooms. So, that   s what we  came from with the high rises, to the private suites and apartments that  society had begun to get used to.  Can you speak to the fact that you also had floor officers on, like, the  twelfth floor of Kerr, fourteenth floor of Drummond. You had floor  officers, activities, intramural teams.  Intramural teams. That   s right.  So, there was this real sense of community built not only within the  complex, but by floors, wasn   t it?  That   s exactly right. I remember Kerr-Twelve had a guy named Jay  Jones on it, and a guy named Steve Kreidler, who is now the vice  president over Fiscal Affairs at UCO in Edmond. That   s the two  examples, and they had decided,    We   re going to make Kerr-Twelve a  leadership floor,    because these guys were movers and shakers. So, they  had recruited campus leaders to be on Kerr-Twelve, and that   s right,  floors took on an identity. And we, somewhere in that process, started  also what we called special interest housing. The most successful,  longest running, have been engineering floors in Kerr and Drummond. I  think maybe half the floors in Kerr now are engineering. Started maybe  thirty years ago now, so yes, they took on floor identity in everything  from intramurals to student government, and sometimes even academic  along those areas. And then we get into the late eighties, early nineties,  18  Gill  Sampson  and you start these apartment suites. Of course, in Kerr, lots of financial  obligation and debt. One of the things that that of course did, that drove  up the price of housing, so now today in 2010, the most economical  places are Kerr and Drummond. Back then, they were the most  expensive, for sure. What I   ve heard this year in my presidential  luncheons with students, the students who live in those areas, in Kerr  and Drummond, the community areas, like it and talk about community,  and Burns hears that. And just like those who live in the suites and  apartments, they sure like their privacy, but they don   t know as many  people. It   s interesting. He   s paid attention to that. He has heard that,  how it   s changed, and realized that it   s maybe not all for the best in the  sense of community and knowledge, and who   s around you, and what  their priorities are or their influences on you. Or, for example, if you  have an alcohol/drug issue or tendency, it   s sure much easier to get by  with that in a private living area than it was on a floor of sixty guys or  gals. So, it has changed the community sense some.  It   s a little different when you have an RA, resident assistant, on the  floor who also caught some potential behavioral problems, to the benefit  of students, I mean. Then you don   t have that. Again, they   re living up  there, sharing that same space, and it   s a little bit different in an  apartment complex, isn   t it?  It is, and I think we have to not forget, particularly in our world of  student affairs, student development, that   s been my career, is we   re  dealing with primarily a traditional-age college population: eighteen,  nineteen. And, of course, the older students are increasing in numbers  and coming back, but the on-campus population is primarily traditional,  and they   re going through developmental issues and challenges and  changes, for some, first-time experiences. So, you   re dealing with  student development changes, and what you do in the way of creating an  environment is really critical to the influence you have on them. My  friend, Floyd Hoelting, at UT Austin, a long time ago he said,    You  know, what we ought to call RAs are environmental engineers. We   re  putting those undergraduate upperclassmen on the floor, expecting them  to help create, sustain, help to facilitate an environment that helps  students thrive and succeed academically.    I mean, it   s a big task, and of  course, students have to buy into it and be a part of it, which takes time.  So, a lot of interesting changes there, Jerry, that way.  I don   t think I can tell you many times that I ever questioned Jim  Halligan as president. Boy, do I respect and care for Jim. I really value  him. He honored me as outstanding administrator years ago, and boy, I  really value Jim. He   s a great guy, and was a great president. The one  time I differed with him was   and for what it   s worth, he was the  president, not me   but in this whole area of the student development  19  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  community. He felt it was time to do away with those, and get rid of  those. Granted, we had to make upgrades and improvements. We did,  and you could do that in those buildings. I really felt like we were  sacrificing community in the sense of that, and the value of that, most  importantly, to students and student development in going too strongly  as suites and apartments. That   s the one difference I had, yet I also  realize the society we   re around, what we   re facing, the competition. I  realize it was a tough call. I felt like we sacrificed residential community  to a degree with suites and apartments.  Kent, this maybe leads to another question. You touched on some of the  benefits of living in a residence hall. What would you say to students or  to parents who say,    Why should a student live in a residence hall?     Okay, well that   s an easy     You   ve probably got this one down pat.  Yes, it   s an easy one for me. It is. And, of course, the important thing is  this is research. It   s more than what Kent thinks. What we know is that  students that live on campus make higher grades than those who live off  campus. Proven research nationwide as well as here. And secondly,  they   re more apt to graduate in four years if they live on campus.  Thirdly, obviously, they have the opportunity to get better connected and  get involved, because we know that making connections, getting  students to return to sophomore land, has a lot to do, even in the  academic realm, with    Did they get connected? Did they work things out  with their roommate? Did they join a club or organization?    So, we  found, for sure, holding power clearly is really critical. We sometimes  refer to it in Res Life as    First day, first week, first month.    How we  treat them, and how they feel the first day, first week, first month has a  lot to do with if they make it to sophomore land. Do they feel a part of  the environment? Because a lot of kids, even with 22,000 students, come  from an environment, whether a large school or small school, and  increasingly they   re coming from out of state, if they don   t get  connected early    And connection is about campus community.  That community issue you were talking about earlier, we   re talking  about halls versus the complexes, that same issue that you were talking  about: the community. Getting part of a floor, getting part of a  community.  Yes. And that   s one of the reasons Matt Brown, who   s now director of  Res Life, has bought into so strongly these learning communities with  Human Environmental Sciences, College of Business, Engineering even  further, recognizing one of the things that we could do in the suites and  20  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  apartments to help enhance that is tie together students with similar  academic interests. So, that   s how these days we   re trying to do  something to offset that tendency for some to isolate.  How has the OSU residence hall program been viewed nationally over  the years?  That   s a great question. OSU   s residence hall program, a few things I   ll  say about it, it   s the only school in the country that   s won the National  School of the Year Award four times. San Diego State   s won it three.  We   ve hosted the national NACURH conference three times. And here   s  an interesting side light. A guy named Bob Tattershall, who   s now  assistant director of housing at Washington State  University  in  Pullman, been there for maybe twenty years now, Bob was a student,  was a 4.0 philosophy major here, lived in Cordell Hall, and ultimately  became my grad assistant when he worked on his master   s degree. It was  Bob Tattershall who   we were a member of MACURH, which was the  Midwest Affiliate of College and University Residence Halls, the  regional of NACURH, the National. It went all the way from Texas to  Montana. Bob said,    That is too large a chunk of the country. We need  to break that up.    So, it was Bob Tattershall who led a cause with a guy  named Kevin Wyatt, who   s now in Tennessee, and Steve Kreidler, who  works at UCO in Edmond, led a cause and ultimately brought about the  creation of SWACURH, the Southwest Affiliate of College and  University Residence Halls. Bob led the charge to say,    We need to  create a new region. MACURH is too large and encompassing. Texans  can   t travel to Montana always and pay those expenses.    So, that was  created so Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana became SWACURH,  led by OSU   s own Bob Tattershall. Again, a leader on the national front.  One other thing I   d say about awards, recognition, they have a national  clearing house of information, NACURH does, called the National  Information Center, NIC. It   s a three-year term. We   ve had that National  Information Center on this campus at least four times that I   m aware of.  Haven   t had it here in I think the last decade. So, twelve years we   ve  hosted the National Information Center of NACURH here, so a lot of  presence and involvement. This summer I noticed our students are going  to, I believe, the national convention in June this year is at San Diego  State, and we have student leaders, again, going to NACURH from  OSU.  Do we still have a lot of them in the regional and national level from  Oklahoma State that are elected to student leadership positions?  That   s right, yes.  21  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  What about staff, like yourself and others? Oklahoma State through the  years has participated in regional and national, and I want to get to that  a little bit later in our conversation with you personally, but just  generally, has there been a lot of involvement from our staff?  There has, yes. I remember Lynn Jackson. When I first got acquainted  with him, he was the state director for the Southwest Housing Officers  Group. Later, I think it was    81,    82 at Austin, Texas, I was president of  the SWACUHO  Southwest Association of College and University  Housing Officers , the Southwest Housing Officers Group, and I was  state director prior to that. Yes, OSU has hosted the regional housing  officers conference two or three times, and then in ACUHO-I, which is  Association of College and University Housing Officers International,  from    83 to    85 I served on their national executive board as a southern  district representative for the United States. So, some of us have even  served on the National Housing Board. Bob Huss later served in that  same role. Bob Huss, who was director of Res Life, served as a southern  district representative on ACUHO-I, so within the housing associations  as well as the broader student affairs associations, our staff have a  history of being pretty involved.  How is the organizational management structure of Residential Life,  formerly Single Student Housing, now Residential Life? How has it  changed during your tenure?  When I came here, and just think about this, students and moms and  dads see kind of one    payment    for room and board, as they   d call it.  They came here to live, and they want to be fed. But along the way they  want hot water, and they want to be safe, and they want to have a clean  environment. So, when I came here, there were those three departments:  Single Student Housing, food service, and university apartments and  maintenance. It   s a model that had worked, I think, for years. Abe  Hesser was the vice president then of auxiliary services, and he had a  background in this area.  Who was vice president when you came in?  Abe Hesser was vice president. He was for one or two years, then  succeeded by Norman Moore, and then Ron Beer came as VP. Changes  organizationally were   the analogy I guess I want to draw, Mom and  Dad write the check for room and board, but they   re three different  departments, and sometimes you   re competing for that same dollar. As a  matter of fact, I wrote the paper in consultation with several other of our  staff members when Lynn retired in 1984, fall of    84, suggesting that  those be merged together, because there was one director who had  retired, Dick Williams, from married housing maintenance. Lynn now  22  Gill  Sampson  had retired and only left Joe Blair Director of Dining, so I wrote the  position paper in consultation with several other folks about maybe it   s  time with a new model to look at merging those together. And sure  enough, that vice president then, Ron Beer, who had been here five years  then, accepted that and did that.  Then Bob Huss from the University of Georgia was hired in to be the  director for this new system that integrated all those services together,  that one room-and-board dollar, if you would. So, that   s the hugest, most  major change I   ve seen, Jerry, was the merging of those three  components to become what   s now known as Residential Life. That was  the greatest, most significant change in my career, was they all became  one. As they say, the pendulum swings one way and then the other. Now  what   s interesting is in the last two years, that has changed a little bit in  that Residential Life, of course, still exists, but dining was broken back  out of that and a new Director of Dining was hired two years ago, Terry  Baker. So now, Dining and Housing are under two separate departments,  and then Physical Plant now supplies the housekeeping and  maintenance, so it was actually broken out of Res Life, and moved to the  Physical Plant.  You   ve mentioned several names, Kent, but are there some directors of  Residential Life, other leaders in Res Life that stand out in your mind?  During my time and tenure here, the directors of Housing/Res Life were,  of course, Lynn Jackson and then Bob Huss, followed now by Matt  Brown, who is an OSU graduate, by the way. He   s come back from  Northern Kentucky to head us. Ron Beer worked here as vice president  from 1980 to 2000. I can   t believe he   s been out ten years now.  Ron came here from the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and Ron,  interestingly enough, in fact, did programs on this later. Ron Beer and  his colleague David Ambler, who was VP at Kansas University, were  early-year professionals in Kent State, with the Kent State shootings set  in the seventies. So, they had been at a very high-visible campus due to  the campus tragedies of the National Guard shooting on that campus in   1970 . So, Beer comes here a Michigan State graduate after working at  the University of Nebraska at Omaha with good background experience.  So, he   s the guy I would highlight as really student-oriented, really a guy  willing to work with change over time.  As he told me many times before, he said his approach to the student  body president each year was this. He said he would call that person in,  introduce himself, say,    Boy, congratulations on being elected. I   m  really looking forward to working with you,    and he   d always make  them this challenge. He would say to them,    In your role, you   re going  23  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  to be exposed to some situations, information, circumstances that are  many times going to be privileged or confidential, but I   m going to want  to share with you all of those I can as a campus-wide student body  president, and I hope you   ll do the same with me. But if you ever breach  that trust, then that will terminate our relationship and our discussion,  because I want to entrust things to you. I want to have you involved with  an input in decision making at the appropriate time. But for that to  happen, we have to have a mutual trust and rapport.    And I use that  example of Ron always challenging the student body presidents because  he really wanted them to be involved and knowledgeable. He respected  their opinion, but he also realized to do that, he would have to bring  some things to the table sometime that weren   t fully baked, or couldn   t  be brought out yet, perhaps. So, I really respected Ron   s twenty-year  influence here in Student Affairs, and certainly Zelma Patchin as she  retired in the mid-seventies.  She was a legend, too, wasn   t she, Zelma Patchin?  She was. I   m so thrilled this year that the fraternity and sorority system,  that   s also in my area now, decided to honor four people, as they created  a Greek Fraternity/Sorority Hall of Fame. Chuck Watson, who   s a  Sigma Chi, and JoAnne Roderick,  both who are living , were inducted  into the new Greek  Hall of Fame , and two posthumously, Darrell  Troxell and Zelma Patchin. They now have a Greek Life Hall of Fame  that was started this year. It   s so wonderful for Zelma Patchin to be  honored. She really deserved that.  Jerry, I guess there are certainly a lot of people I   ve worked with in  Housing/Student Affairs over the years that I   ve valued. Amjad Ayoubi  was a coordinator for me, and now is Director of Career Services at  Tulane University. Amjad was a young man, born and raised in  Jerusalem, but Palestinian, and came as an international student. He  ultimately got his doctorate and headed Career Services here. He was a  great staff member, a student leader, and had always looked at things  differently, which is why he could kind of challenge us to see how  things could be improved, you know. Amjad is a hard one not to  mention, for sure.  Joe Blair was an interesting personality, wasn   t he?  Joe was, and Joe Blair headed Food Service. In his later years he was  president of NACUFS, the National Association of College and  University Food Service directors, I mean, big-time job.  He was  well  known and respected, and was known for doing great in dining with few  dollars. Yes, I sure had respect for Joe.  24  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Kent, in 1997 you accepted the position of Director of Campus Life and  Associate Director of the Student Union. You are currently still serving  in the same position with maybe some minor responsibility changes. Can  you talk about your job responsibilities and the student organizations  that you work with today?  Yes, and do you want me to start with kind of how the position was  created, or tell about what it   s like today?  Sure, absolutely. Maybe start with when it was created from the  beginning, and then bring it up to date.  Ron Beer and Tom Keys had committed about a million dollars to  renovate the lower level, the basement, of the Student Union, the old  bowling alley and those areas. They wanted to create a better  environment for student life happenings, student organizations, Student  Life. That project had been completed in the spring of    97, the lower  level of the basement of the Student Union, Student Organization  Center. Concurrent with that, Dr. Beer told me this somewhere along the  line. He said,    Students have come to me for two straight years, very  dissatisfied with what was existing, the old Student Life area prior to  that, and have told me,    this is Dr. Beer   s paraphrase,    If you don   t get  that straightened out or make some changes, we   re going to go talk to  the president.    So, Ron Beer said to them, according to how he     Were the offices on the second floor of the Student Union?  That   s a good point. There were some in the basement, and there were  some on the second floor. They were spread out, and they were not a  part of one department. For example, Fraternity/Sorority Affairs then  reported to Tom Keys, Director of the Union, singularly, as an example,  and Student Activities, part of that was in the basement. Not as many  units had been combined as happened in    97-   98. So, Beer had said,     Okay, all I ask of you all is before you go talk to the president give me  a chance to make changes.    So Ron moved forward, created this position  and, frankly, encouraged probably three or four people to move out or  move on, because the dissatisfaction that he sensed that students were  telling him, over some time, did the renovation, created this department  of Campus Life, and even sought me and some of my ideas. I suggested  the name Campus Life to broaden it a little beyond just the old  traditional student activities notion. I gave him some suggestions and  helped him get in touch with some other schools that were doing things.  So, to make a long story short, they created this Director of Campus  Life, Associate Director of the Union, and Tom Keys was very involved  in that. The idea was in that new space to merge and bring together  25  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  several component parts together of Student Life. They listed the  position, advertised it, and had three finalists. They had a guy from  Texas A M, myself, and somebody else for finalists and interviewed us.  Anyway, I got the job. I, with Bob Huss in Res Life and Beer and Keys.  I agreed that I would start in September of    97, half time there and half  time in Res Life, through November of    97, when we were hosting  SWACUHO, the regional student organization leadership conference,  because I was their advisor. I said,    Okay, I   ll do fifty-fifty until  November, and then November    97 make the full shift over.    So, they  offered me the job.  One side note, too, about the hiring, Jerry. Primary was this new Student  Life area. Secondary, they wanted somebody who had some auxiliary  service background. That   s what Residence Life is, you know. You pay  your own way. You don   t get any state or tuition dollars. You generate  everything with room-and-board dollars. The Student Union operates  mostly that same way with auxiliary dollars that you generate.  Essentially, as I was told and as I   ve experienced, 85 percent of my job  was Director of Student Life, 15 percent was the Associate Director of  the Union, doing my auxiliary service background, where could I help  out there with dining or bookstore, or whatever. So, I made that move in  the fall of    97.  Kent, your direct report was Tom Keys, who was the director of the  Student Union?  That   s right.  So, the question I have, is that a typical reporting alignment for Student  or Campus Life? For most universities, would that person report directly  to the Vice President for Student Affairs?  Many times you report directly on many campuses, that   s right. It was  kind of a hybrid position, admittedly, because it was the auxiliary part  that they wished for me, so yes, I would say it was a little bit unique. I   d  say the norm would be more the other way, reporting. Now, today, I  have the joint relationship with Mitch Kilcrease, Director of the Union.  He   s been there for five years, and Lee Bird is Student Affairs Vice  President. The student affairs side with her, the auxiliary   s more so with  him. So, it is a little unique. The other thing I would say about those  early years was it was clear to me that they wanted a lot of vitality and  energy around the student life component, because apparently they   d  been real dissatisfied. So, part of my thought, using the old real estate  principle    Location, Location, Location,    if you get students together,  good things will happen. You don   t have to dictate to them. You don   t  have to require them to do anything. If you get good minds together, I   ve  26  found, good things happen.  Tom Keys said,    Fraternities and sororities clearly have to be a part of  that. They shouldn   t be reporting to me, Student Life.    Volunteer  Center, which was then reporting to Career Services, Joyce  Montgomery, which you could make a case for that, said,    No, that   s a  part of Student Life.    So, Joyce and Volunteer Center moves down,  becomes the Service Learning Volunteer Center.  Then there was an interesting discussion that you would know  something about. Ron Beer put it to me this way, former Vice President  Beer. He said,    For three-plus decades, three committees had studied  how do we best serve international students.    And there continued to be  an Office of International Programs that cultivated contractual programs,  and then there was in Student Affairs, out of the counseling center,  International Students and Scholars helping international students adjust  and do well. As Beer told me, he said,    For over thirty years three  committees have recommended merging those services.    For whatever  reason, it hadn   t been done, so finally a decision was made, according to  Dr. Beer.    We   re going to merge them. Office of International Programs  and International Students and Scholars will come together and be one to  better serve students and to be more economical.    I always remember  this. That had been decided.  Marvin Keener was Provost then. Jim Halligan was President. Beer was  VP of Student Affairs. As he told me, he said they had had serious  discussions, and the decision was we   re going to make this happen. So,  Beer calls me, October or November of    97, and says,    This is going to  happen. I   m trying to decide where to put them.    He said,    There   s a  committee that I   ve formed who   s worked on this, and they think it  should report to me, the vice president.    He said,    I don   t think that   s  best. I want to know what you think about making ISS, International  Students and Scholars, a part of Campus Life.    I said,    Well, Ron, from  the way I see it, I mean, certainly I work with international students in  Res Life.    I said,    I   m not an expert on that, necessarily, but my point  would be, I would think if you get the talented international students we  have with other campus leaders and student organizations, good things  will happen.    Proximity. Location, location, location. So, he said,     Okay, I   ll get back to you.    This is October/November. I didn   t hear  from him on that point until March, so I figured he   d decided to do  something else.  One day we   re in a meeting or something. He says,    Oh, by the way, did  I tell you we   re going to put ISS as a part of Campus Life?    I said,    No,  I hadn   t heard from you on it in three or four months. I just assumed you  were going to do something different.    He said,    No, they   re coming.     27  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  So, those two departments merged in the summer of    98.  I   ll always remember this workshop I helped kind of facilitate because,  honestly, that was not an easy merger. Two competing types of  departments with different priorities, a little bit, even though it was  international in focus, came together, so the International Students and  Scholars, and Tim Huff was asked to be the manager, department head  of that, and has been ever since. So, that was another group who came to  be part of Campus Life. So, Campus Life that I walked into was so much  different than it is today, because you had a little element of student  activities, you had some non-traditional students, you had a few student  organizations, but none of those other areas that I   ve mentioned that  were now amalgamated were made a part of what was this developing  department of Campus Life.  Kent, I forgot to ask you. Were you asked to take that position?  There was a national search for the position, and a guy from a small  college in Iowa, a guy from Texas A M and myself were all  interviewed for it. So I wasn   t guaranteed it or told,    I   m going to move  you to that.    I knew I had a great shot at it because of the input they   d  solicited from me, but, no. There was a search done, interviews, and so  at least I didn   t feel like I had it cinched, necessarily.  What are the major challenges in your position? There   s got to be very  interesting and diverse groups that you work with, student groups  especially. On a day-to-day basis, what are your major challenges?  Wow, every day is so different in that environment. It   s fun. It keeps you  young. It keeps you on your toes. One major challenge has been the  growth. When I came, there were approximately 250-270 student  organizations. Today there   s 458 student organizations, so it   s more than  doubled. So, part of it   s the growth and accommodating that growth of  student   and the beauty of that is it shows we   re responding to more  student needs and interests, because you   ve got the hockey club, and  you   ve got the Spanish club, and you   ve got honoraries and on and on.  So the beauty, because remember an earlier comment, is getting  connected. If students find their way and get connected with peers,  friends, get leadership service opportunities, it has holding power. It   s  about retention, so that   s a great piece, and a great challenge has been  the growth.  With that growth has come also some financial challenges and  responsibilities. There   s a process called Activity Fee Allocation  Process, or AFAP, student activity fees that students pay that help fund  those areas and help fund our area. There   s never enough money to  28  support the student organizations that we   ve got. So, funding, the growth  has been great, and now the challenge of this new Student Union  renovation, which is really going to be great when we come back into  the building in fall of 2011, but in the interim, we   re really even more  crunched, probably, on student organization space.  Student leaders have been great. We   ve had five students on the  committee all three years of planning, so students are right there at the  table. They know what   s happening. They   ve influenced and colored, in  fact, what we   re going to look like as a Student Union facility.  Nevertheless, there   s still some sacrifices being made in the short run for  the longer gain with this great facility that we   re going to occupy on the  second floor when we come back into it. So, those would be a couple.  I think the other thing I   d say, in the thirteen years I   ve been doing this,  it will be fourteen in the fall, I would say just like for me in the  seventies, some institutional changes were going on. There have been  changes in the nineties and 2000s that are more societal than  institutional, I think, meaning students that come to us today and this last  decade are more literate in terms of technology, for certain, but  interestingly enough, compared to those seventies and eighties students,  generally, I   m generalizing here some, certainly the seventies, they   re  more dependent on moms and dads than they were. We hear the quote     helicopter parents    now. It   s not unusual for parents to want to not only  come with students for enrollment, which is good, we encourage that,  but to walk them through enrollment, and kind of tell them what they  think they should enroll in. The students kind of accept that dependency  a little more than twenty-five years ago on Mom and Dad. It is both  good, but it also delays that student   s maturation and development that is  a really important part of the college experience. So, that   s what I mean  by there have been some societal changes there more than institutional.  Earlier there was societal and institutional changes, while the institution  hasn   t necessarily had to greatly change.  Now, one of the things that   s changed is, of course, since 9/11, the  whole campus security thing, and then some of the tragedies on a few  campuses. So now, all of a sudden, while we   ve always had a  preparation and awareness of emergency procedures and dealing with  the tragedies in Student Life sometimes, including student deaths (and  I   ve faced more of those than I   d like to count at this school), more of a  readiness and preparedness for those situations and yet keeping that in  perspective. We are in the middle of the country. We are an environment  that   s very safe, a college campus, you know. It   s a residential campus,  small-town America, large university, great safe campus compared to  most places, like some that I visit where you have to have three or four  levels of security to get into a building on other campuses. Nothing like  29  Gill  Sampson  that, but still, times have changed, so you have to be vigilant about the  environment we   re in.  I even sit on a committee these days called the Behavioral Consultation  Team that meets weekly or as needed in the event there are students or  people in the environment who we think might be a threat to self or  others. There   s a collaborative effort with counseling, police, legal  affairs, our area, to have our radar up for those students and to try to help  them before maybe they leave school, or don   t succeed, or something  like that. So, that is the part of whether it   s been some societal change in  the sense of elements of safety and security that have been heightened.  Are there different organizations that you are the direct advisor to?  Yes. I am the primary organization, the person in my chair is supposed  to advise the Student Government Association, SGA, so the student  body president and vice president. I advise them and the student senate  chair and their weekly meetings, and then I meet with them as a  leadership team weekly, so that   s the primary group I advise. I pinch hit  sometimes for other groups when they lose advisors. For a student  organization to exist, it has to have a constitution and bylaws, has to  have a faculty/staff advisor, has to have interested members and officers.  So, like, for example, right now I   m kind of the interim temporary  advisor for Blue Key, the honorary group, because they lost their advisor  who retired. So I do some interim pinch hitting sometimes for student  groups without trying to take it on for keeps.  SGA, which is the primary global student organization that the  university goes to for input, it   s clear to me, every president that I   ve  worked with, and certainly those that I worked with during my thirteen,  fourteen, years in this position, they want to know what the senate  thinks, what the vote on certain things is, like the tobacco policy, or drop  and add policy, or funding the stadium, Gallagher-Iba renovation and  funding the north stadium, and the student bond issue and extension.  They want to know what students think on those things. So, it   s a great  group to work with, and though sometimes they get a lot of press about  resume padding and they are there for the wrong reason, boy, in my  thirteen years, I   ve worked with some great student body presidents.  From Jennifer Hoffman my first year, to now, finishing up this past year  with Clinton Merritt. No doubt in my mind, the kids that take those  roles, by and large, really sacrifice a lot, give lots of hours for the  betterment of the university, and they   re really dedicated to serving  students, even though the student newspaper and others  sometimes  make them look otherwise . Do they make mistakes? Sure they do. Do  they fumble the ball or not plan enough ahead? Yes, we all have done  that in life, so take out their human tendencies like that we all have, and  30  Gill  Sampson  there   s no doubt in my mind those thirteen or fourteen presidents have  really been dedicated to serving students. It   s a great group to work with.  I   ve enjoyed that.  Do you have a personal philosophy about student development? After all  these years, to Residential Life and now with Student Life and working  with students? Could you share some of that with us?  Yes, I appreciate that question. There are three tenets I think of student  affairs philosophy that are mine that I share with a lot of other people, I  think. First is that learning is an ongoing, kind of a total process, and we  in the out-of-class experience, co-curricular experience as we call it,  have a role in that. They didn   t come here because I   m here or because  of the fraternities or sororities necessarily, or because there   s a Blue  Key. They came here for the academic experience, but along the way  they want to get connected. So that   s where the co-curricular out-of-class  experience is.  So, I go back to learning is a total process. It   s ongoing because,  remember most students    hours spent aren   t in the classroom. They   re  out of class, so learning is a total process, twenty-four hours ongoing.  The environment, number two, influences behavior, so whatever  environment, residence hall community, whatever environment you have  for students influences their behavior and their learning. For example,  long before students get very interested that first week in class, if they  don   t have food and hot and cold running water, the basics, the Maslow  Hierarchy, if you would, if they don   t have the basics, you can forget  about class, because they   re not going to stay with you if they aren   t fed  and don   t have hot running water. So, therefore, the environment  influences behavior. I know that, so learning is a total process.  Environment influences behavior. What we do in that out-of-class  environment, as well as the in-class environment. Then, finally, things  that we can do to enrich that environment enhance the quality of their  educational experience, both in and out of class, particularly since my  job is the out of class. So, those are three tenets I   ve really hung my hat  on: learning is a total process, environment influences behavior, and  then enrichment or enhancer of that environment contributes so much to  learning. Like I mentioned a while ago, living on campus, they do better  academically and they   re more likely to graduate in four years and  things like that. So, those would be three components.  One thing that I would mention, Jerry, for anybody who ever looks at  this tape at any time later, anybody in Student Affairs    In fact, I  showed it to a faculty member just yesterday who came to my office  from the entrepreneurial school, came by, and we were talking about  31  Gill  Sampson  some ideas. There   s a guy named Ernest Boyer who used to be president  of the SUNY system, State University of New York. Ernest Boyer was  hired away by the Carnegie Foundation in New York, and Dr. Boyer in   1990  published the results, so over twenty years ago, in a book called   Campus Life: In Search of Community . He interviewed all the college  presidents in the country he could reach, and all the college student  affairs vice presidents he could reach, several hundred, four, five  hundred, and asked them what they thought campuses    future should  look like, or would be, or should become. So, you know, great minds,  college presidents and vice presidents. He published the results for the  Carnegie Foundation. So, still today I use that because he came up with  six tenets that he found in research after interviewing these people that  are important, he thinks, of what colleges could be.  And it, of course, transcends academic. It   s the whole area. Examples  would be,    Campus should be open, should be just, should be  disciplined and self-governing. It should have traditions and be  celebrative,    things like this. There are six tenets that he identifies, and  anytime I   m talking with anybody about student affairs   and, in fact,  I   m teaching at what they call a STARS College in Austin, Texas, next  month in June. I think I   m the sample oldest living administrator of the  group. We   re talking with young professionals, forty of them selected  from the United States. It   s the third year I   ve done it. First year was in  Orlando, and last year was in Baltimore. This year it   s in Austin, Texas.  There are forty young professionals, and my job is to talk with them  about student affairs and higher education. One of the things I   ll take to  them, again, among my components is the value of the Boyer research  on these six tenets of what constitutes campus community, as found by  interviewing colleges presidents. I mean, it   s as valid today, because  they were looking to the future. It   s as valid today as it was when they  published that twenty years ago, I think.  You talked earlier about some of the student leaders that you worked  with. Speaking generally from your unique perspective, nearly forty-one  years now and over how many thousands of students you   ve worked  with, and I say that respectfully, are there some generalizations you can  make about OSU students?  I tell you what, I always remember a quote I heard former President  Kamm make, and he kind of said this tongue-in-cheek when asked what  it   s like to be president of Oklahoma State University. My paraphrase of  what he said was,    Oh, it   s not difficult at all when you have the type of  students that attend Oklahoma State University, nature of the student  body.    Never forgot that, and I really think there   s a lot of truth to that,  because the students that come here, though we get large-school students  and urban students, we get a lot of small-town America students, and we  32  Gill  get increasing numbers of international and certainly  students from  out  of state . Camp Cowboy, our freshman orientation camp, is now almost  70 percent out-of-state students come to that, because they see some  value in that and a need to learn about the university and traditions and  history as they come in.  I think, Jerry, OSU students still carry some important threads of the  land-grant philosophy. We were founded under the Morrill Land-Grant   College  Act, of course, higher education opportunity for the common  man and common woman, the blue collar school, if you would, and  though some people cringe at that a little bit today, I still think there are  those common threads, for sure, about being a land-grant school about  types of students that come here. Well, we   ve moved well beyond just  agriculture and home economics to six major colleges and an honors  college and, of course, our professional schools, but there   s threads that  weave through generations, I think, of OSU alums and students and  faculty and staff that have been here that bring certain types of students  here. Not to say that they   re ultra conservative, but to say, are they a  little more conservative as a student body than the University of  Oklahoma? Yes. I would say they would be, in my experience, but not  ultra, necessarily. In fact, progressive in many ways. I would say that  about the nature of the campus environment.  I tell you what, eight or nine times out of ten I can tell you a student in  my freshman orientation class that I teach, or a leadership class that I  teach, or that I meet in meetings or organizational gatherings, eight or  nine out of ten times I can tell you if they   re 4-H or FFA kids because of  the confidence and experience that they   ve had that others haven   t  sometimes had, a kind of boldness and an accomplished ability to  communicate. I   m going to go to my Big 12 Dean and Directors meeting  next week at University of Kansas, so there will be Texas A M, there  will be Iowa State, there will be K-State, some other land-grant schools,  and when we talk and visit about our students, I think some of those  schools, not A M quite so much because of its unique history as a male  student school now 50,000 students, I think they   ve lost some of their  sense of community, kind of, because of size, but K-State and Iowa State  I think have some of those similar threads, and they were land-grant  schools. So, yes, I think there   s some unique things about it, and about  the student body and population and some respect for accountability and  responsibility, if you would, to a degree.  Kent, you touched on some of these before, but maybe one more time. In  your opinion, how have Student Services, Student Life, student programs  changed during your career, particularly these last thirteen years or so,  but totally in your career? What have been some major changes?  33  Sampson  We have, and really, I think it   s been maybe a challenge even for our  Board of Regents to have evolved this way, but we have obviously  become much less in loco parentis. The Board today I think still expects  a certain amount of that, really. They still would like for us to be a little  more parental than legally we have found that we can be. We certainly  have a presence of that, still, I think, honestly in loco parentis, much  more so than some schools, but it   s certainly evolved due to the law. So,  we   re less in the place of the parents, if you would, even though I think  our Board sometimes wants us to be a little bit more, frankly. I would  say students of the last decade, for the most part, though they   re still  searching for academic majors and the right choices, they still are  undecided, really. I get my twenty-five freshmen a year, and two-thirds  of them admit they   re undecided. Even though they   ve declared majors,  they   re still not sure. So I think they come here with a focus of    I know I  want to obtain the higher education degree, but I really am not so sure  what I want to do.     So on the one hand, they   re focused on getting a degree and moving on,  but they   re not sure about the roads to get there, always. I think they  struggle with that a little bit. I think this parental involvement has  increased the last half dozen years, where parents are calling the shots  more for students than they did twenty-five years ago, which is kind of  an interesting evolution, and with students respecting that, thinking  that   s helpful rather than not. Of course, many times it is. I   m not  questioning that.  Campus safety and security is a higher priority in many fronts than it  was before 9/11, and other issues on campuses with safety. Jerry, I think,  and this is a real challenge, it depends on the campus you   re on. I think  college athletics has had to face the fact that diversified student bodies  of today no longer come just for athletics, or that athletic programs  aren   t the hub of the university experience like they were twenty-five  years ago or beyond. They   re still important, and they still draw  students, both to their events and to campus and to Homecoming.  There   s a great Homecoming here. But, I think athletics has had to  adjust to not only difficulty in the competition of winning to get students  to buy tickets, but also the fact that the athletics is competing with many  other things that students are interested in, be it a student organization,  be it dance, be it Allied Arts. I think a change is that students today I   ve  seen have to be sold a little bit more on the athletic experience than they  had to twenty years ago. Not to say athletic traditions aren   t important  still, and they are, but my point is fewer students, for the most part, are  as rabid about that as they were twenty, twenty-five years ago.  So, there   s an adjustment for athletics and the athletic director, and I   ve  talked a few times about this. Everything from student ticket sales to  34  Gill  Sampson  what do we do to remind and show students that we care about them,  that we   re interested in them, for ticket sales, but also to fill the seats, to  get them to support the teams, knowing that home crowds make a  difference in sports? So, I think that   s a change, and a lot of it has to do  with the offerings and opportunities that students have today that they  didn   t have two decades ago.  Earlier, you talked about Vice President Beer and your respect  for him  and his  leadership. Can you mention other key administrators,  presidents, vice presidents over the years that have been strong  advocates for and supporters of Student Life programs?  I tell you, you and I both were influenced and touched by Dr. Bob  Kamm. He passed away this last year, of course, and he and Maxine,  who had their open house and invited students out for an annual ice  cream social during the first week of school, former president Kamm  was a students    president, I really felt like. He   d been Dean of Students  at Texas A M and at Drake, so he knew Student Life and the place it  had there, as well as the academic side, which is a great blend. I also had  former President Boger, and I was still in Res Life. The times that I got  him in the student living areas and units, I could tell he could relate to  students, he enjoyed talking to them, he valued that time, so I  appreciated that a lot.  Jim Halligan liked a lot of us. Jim Halligan and Bob Kamm were on the  same side of the street. I mean, Halligan, three-time chemical engineer  from Iowa State, comes to us. He   s president from New Mexico State.  I   m thinking,    What sort of a president will this guy be?    I   d actually  talked to people from New Mexico State. I   d even been out there at  another meeting and talked to some of the people who   d served under  him, and boy were we pleasantly pleased that he was another Kamm-type  of guy, he and Ann, who really put students first and listened to  students and had students in their home all the time. I really appreciated  that.  I certainly give credit to Halligan with Beer for me being in this  position, first, and then also for the opportunity then later, and I  remember you were there. I remember when we had our dedication in     97 down there, and Halligan came there. Halligan, Dr. Campbell, and  maybe Kamm, I think, came for that dedication in    97 when we  dedicated that space, and I remember you were there. I tell you what,  I   ve been blessed. I   ve been fortunate. For the most part, I   ve been  around administrations, including the president and VP of student  affairs, including our own now, Lee Bird, who really are student-oriented,  who have allowed me to operate in a realm with students and  kind of be their advocate for and with them, knowing that they are really  35  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  serious about wanting to know what students think, and that they want  students to weigh in, in whatever mechanisms that we have in place.  Even certainly under current President Hargis. It started back years ago,  I think, with Dr. Schmidly. We now have the annual President   s  Leadership Recognition Ceremony that takes place every April where  we honor outstanding student leaders, outstanding student volunteers  and outstanding faculty/staff advisors. I think with Schmidly, who first  allowed us to put the name    The President   s Leadership Recognition  Ceremony    on that after we started this after Halligan retired, and of  course Burns Hargis has continued that, did this April. Boy, from Res  Life days, but particularly these last thirteen, fourteen years, which have  been more intense with all students, not just residence-hall students, boy,  I   ve had a lot of support in getting to coordinate that luncheon monthly  with the president and with students. It   s great to hear what students tell  him and what he asks them and his dreams for this university. I   m just  pleased and proud to have worked at a place that really seems to value  students and student input so much, because I   ve worked with a lot of  people around the country who, even though if it weren   t for students at  our campuses we couldn   t exist, there are a lot of campus administrators  who sometimes don   t appreciate or understand that. I   ve learned that.  It   d be a great place if it wasn   t for the students. (Laughter) That   s what  some research professionals feel like.  That   s right. Somebody said,    Yes, what a great place. Put me in the  head of a small university without students,    or something like that. I   ve  heard that statement made one time.  Looking forward a little bit, are there some emerging trends that will  impact students in the coming years that you   re seeing? I mean, you  mentioned something at this point about parental involvement, et cetera,  but are there other trends you see happening in Student Life and in  students that we   ll need to change and evolve to meet these?  I don   t like to bring it up, but I think we can   t avoid the fact that higher  education budgets are being more closely scrutinized by the federal  government, by state officials and so forth. I think that   s fair. So, I think  budgets and financial health of the country and the state will continue to  impact some of the things that you do in higher education. When it gets  into my area, for example, I   ve had to cut  45,000 this year in education  general funds, which has cost me essentially five grad assistants out of  fifteen. Fortunately, I had some graduating, so I didn   t have to lose  anybody, but we lost positions. So, I think there   ll be budgetary impact  we   ll continue to have to factor in, but that   s the nature of the economy.  The government rises and falls. I don   t think that   s always going to be  36  with us, but I think we   ve got to manage our resources. There   s been this  notion of higher ed accountability more.    What are you doing with our  dollars, with higher education becoming so expensive?     I was visiting with a girl last week whose father is on the faculty. She  was interested in going to Wake Forest but also saw that it   s, I think she  said,  45,000 a year. She   s here visiting, and she   s just loved what she   s  seen here, and plus she can go here for half or less of that. So, I think the  cost of higher education to the families and the accountability will be  important to all of us. I   m a little worried, Jerry, that you can   t pay for  everybody   s higher education. You can   t grant them all the way through.  I mean, scholarships and loans, sure, that has to be part of the equation,  but I   m a little concerned about US higher education becoming a little  bit more of the haves and the have-nots on the socio-economic realm, a  little concerned about that impact on society.  Just as a political side note, I just can   t help but mention this, I noticed  that the Obama administration is getting ready to appoint a Justice to the  Supreme Court. Nothing against who she is at all, but when they  mention if she   s confirmed, five of the nine justices would be Harvard  educated, Harvard graduates. Nothing wrong with Harvard, either, you  know, but my point is, if you   re not careful in education, if everybody  comes from the same ilk background, all of a sudden you may have  people that   s on the Supreme Court, or your educational environment,   from the same background . Just like if all of our faculty were OSU  graduates, I don   t think that   s healthy for the academic environment in  my example, or for the Supreme Court, for most to be trained at the  same place.  Where am I going with that? I see the need for us to continue to  diversify our faculty because the students coming to us are increasingly  diverse. When you look at what the Hispanic population is in western  Oklahoma now, because of the agrarian businesses out there, hog farms  and so forth, well, some of those students are coming east to higher  education in Oklahoma. It   s going to be a more diverse environment,  and that   s going to require a little bit more of a diverse faculty, I think,  and staff, so I think we have to recognize that. There   s the budgetary  impact. There   s the diversity element. I think we have to be on top of  that. There   s no doubt.  Two of my staff members just got back from two weeks in China, my  ISS group, International Students and Scholars. As we   ve seen in the  world economy, and as you can see in our OSU enrollment, India is first  in international students, and China is now second. It wasn   t ten years  ago that there wasn   t a Chinese student here, under Communist rule.  That whole world has changed. A billion people live there, and as I   ve  37  Gill  Sampson  been reminded, many of those families looking for US higher education  are saving just for the opportunity for their children to be educated in  this country. So, there   s no doubt our international population will grow,  and the greatest influx will be Chinese. If we   re smart, and I think we  are and we   re trying to, we   ll cultivate more, just like we have those  leaders in Thailand who are OSU graduates. We had almost forty  administrators from four Chinese institutions here last year for a week  studying student affairs. We   ve got another group coming the first week  of July this year. They   re even going to come out to Camp Cowboy on a  Saturday. China, you   re going to have to deal with them in the world and  in education. So, are you going to try to figure out ways to recruit and  bring those students here? Of course there   s several of them here now.  Or, are you going to miss that part of the higher ed, if you will, market  place? And India, very similarly, right behind. So, that   s a change.  Staying on the international theme for just a second, Saudi Arabia, about  four years ago, committed to sending 7,000 students a year for five years  to US higher education, and it   s not just for traditional engineering and  math. It   s the whole four-year package. They wanted them to learn  English, literature. They want to learn philosophy, psychology,  sociology. So, the question is, who   s getting those 35,000 students in  higher education in this country? Well, we have Saudis here, and we  have a Saudi student organization that now exists. It started this year.  Given Point Four and Henry Bennett   s impact on this institution, an  international presence, and many faculty that have served even a decade  overseas, I   m proud to say, I think we   re in tune and in touch with  what   s going on worldwide in terms of higher ed in our international  population. So, that   s something that I see shifting a little bit.  Changing directions just a little bit, there   s of couple special student  programs we   ve had at Oklahoma State University for quite a while  now, one of them not quite as long. One is the ALPHA program. It   s  easy to think,    Oh yes, ALPHA happens every year, and we   ve been  doing it since 1972.    But what do you remember about the inception of  the ALPHA program and your participation in it back in those early  years?  I give a lot of credit for ALPHA    72 to beginning it. I was chair of  ALPHA in    73, the second year it existed. I give a lot of credit to Shaila  Aery, who was the Assistant Director of Single Student Housing. She  felt like we could do more as an institution to accept and welcome in  new students, primarily freshmen, and so she actually is kind of the  architect, the author, of getting that program started and moving. And  also the importance of integrating academics. I mean, was there fun?  Were there ice cream socials? Was there a dance? Was there a movie?  Yes, but there were also sessions that faculty members spoke on your  38  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  first experience in a college classroom, or how to get to know your  instructor, things like that. So, I give her a lot of credit with that and the  value of that in getting it started. Frankly, she and the student affairs  folks kind of led the charge, as we should, in the out-of-class experience,  but successfully pulling in the academic and the administrative side as  well. So, yes, I give her credit for starting that.  What was the preceding need for ALPHA, and what were some of the  early goals for it? First, maybe share just real briefly what ALPHA is.  ALPHA is a chance for students to come to campus. School here  traditionally starts on a Monday. ALPHA students would be allowed to  come to campus either on a Wednesday or a Thursday and move into the  residence hall since freshmen are required to live on campus. They   re  going to be living in the residence halls, almost all, so they come to  campus on a Wednesday or Thursday, they move in, they meet their  roommate, they can paint their room, decorate the room, Mom and Dad  can say goodbye and go on, and then they get to meet people on their  floor. It   s the beginning of a campus community. Then they get a chance  to go to an outdoor barbecue, a cookout on Willard lawn was a  traditional thing, and then have an opening session where the president  speaks to them. Then they have these little mini classes, mini sessions.  Some are recreational and fun in nature or student organizations, and  some are more serious on the academic side. So, many courses with a  social component, building those connections, the elements again of a  campus community is what ALPHA was intended to be.  And so there are unmet needs at that time for doing that then, Kent?  I think the feeling was that the institution had good intentions, was doing  some good things, but we were kind of fragmented. We were kind of  competing for those freshmen interests that first week or two, and this  was a way to try to draw those together and coordinate them better, I  think.  The Howdy Dance wasn   t enough, huh?  (Laugher) That   s right. The RHA watermelon feed and Howdy Dance  didn   t quite do it, that   s right.  Who were some of the early leaders and staff participants? You  mentioned Shaila Aery. Are there others that you recall?  Shaila, Bill Porter, who left to become Dean of Students at University of  Georgia. Bill Porter was one of those players. Certainly Norman Moore  as vice president then had to support that, as did Ron Beer when he came  39  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  in.  Gonsoulin?  Yes, Sid Gonsoulin, who now works at  University of  Southern  Mississippi, heads their recreation area and assistant VP. Sid Gonsoulin  played a role in that. Certainly your live-in housing staff members had a  big role because of things that were going on in the living units. Gosh, a  great person, we always needed guys like this, Dan Wesley from the  College of Arts and Sciences. Dr. Wesley, who headed Arts and  Sciences Academic Advising, and is now deceased. A great guy. Dan  was one of those practitioners that best of all knew how to weld the  academic and the Student Life component together, so he was a big  advocate of this on the academic side. Dr. Boggs, I think, Academic  Vice President, was supportive of that with Ron Beer, his colleague, in  saying,    Yes, let   s give this a try. Let   s get the academic side involved.     It was Dr. Boggs and Dr. Beer who also supported this    early alert  system    that came out in the    70s. How could we all go about getting  faculty/staff to somehow trigger a mechanism when they saw a student  that wasn   t making it, and why the retention attrition question. That  came out of some of the thinking and discussion of those people who  were leading ALPHA.  Kent, I recall in the late    60s an expression sometimes used when I went  out in the field and talked to some counselors and school administrators  about Oklahoma State University. Unfortunately, not all the time, but  occasionally it would come up, the term    Flunk-out U    for OSU in the  surge of the sixties, the baby boomer move, that we didn   t have sufficient  tools to assist students and we   d lost a lot of students. Was ALPHA part  of the answer to that? It wasn   t just about student retention to have  better numbers, but really to help students make that transition and  more of them to succeed and be successful.  Right. I think that   s a great point. It was clearly to help them get  mainstreamed into that sense of community, at the same time, finding  what resources existed. Like if Mom and Dad split up, they had a  divorce, and you   re really having trouble with that, there are counseling  staff. A very important one is the Career Resource Information Center   Academic   Career Development Center, formerly the Career Resource  Center , helping students realize and face the fact that they   re honest,  they aren   t sure of academic majors, many times, but we can help you  resolve that and find a career choice or a major that   s compatible with  what  you are interested in . It starts with these two basic questions,  which, it   s so logical that Career Information Resource people ask,     What are you good at?    and    What do you like to do?    Because if you  can figure out how to connect what I   m good at and what I like to do  40  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  with an academic major and college, then I   m going to have career  opportunities that I   m going to be satisfied and fulfilled in. So, what am  I good at? Do I like numbers? Do I like people? Do I like animals? Do I  work indoors or outdoors? What do I like to do? When we connect those  two questions with students, we get them on target earlier for the right  academic major, and then, therefore, opportunities in terms of the job  situation, the job market.  Kent, a follow up on that a little bit is a special program that started a  few years ago, Camp Cowboy.  Yes.  It really is a tremendous enhancement, I think, to ALPHA, and comes  before ALPHA. What   s the story behind the inception of Camp Cowboy?  Great question, Jerry. The first Camp Cowboy was in 1999, so I think  we   ve finished thirteen years now, going to our fourteenth or something  like that. It comes out of, I had a young lady named Misty Montgomery.  It was Misty Ambrose then. She ran for student body president and came  to see me, but she wasn   t elected. She came saying,    I   m a little  concerned about what we   re doing for freshmen or not doing for  freshmen.    I was still in Res Life, so it was    95 or    96. Maybe it was the  year before, maybe    96. And then SGA appointed freshmen, two co-coordinators,  SGA, Student Government Association, to study the issue  of freshmen retention. Misty was a part of that. So the vice president,  Ron Beer, hearing that, and others in administration, said,    Well, maybe  we need to look at this because what we   re finding was that if all of us  large schools are honest, one of our biggest challenges is freshmen  retention, helping a big school seem small. How do you capture them?     Because really, Jerry, what we find is students don   t fail here, leave  school here, because of academics primarily. It   s other stuff. It   s other  personal things sometimes. Sometimes it   s financial, sure, but many  times it   s other things.  So, what happened, Beer said,    How about this.    Did a little homework.  Steve Haseley, on my staff, who coordinates my leadership program, he  took two students and drove to Texas A M and visited Fish Camp,  which had been going for seventy-five years. I took two students and  went to Auburn University and studied Camp War Eagle. We went  through those two camps with two students each, summer of    98, and  came back. Then those students and others sit down and said,    Here   s  what we liked about those programs, here   s what they missed, and we   re  going to put something together.    And from that came Camp Cowboy,  the first one offered in the summer of    99. The first two directors were  two student females, Misty Ambrose, now Misty Ambrose-  41  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Montgomery, who   s a mom and a lawyer in Edmond, and Kyndra  Littrell from Guymon, Oklahoma, who now is in Tulsa. We had a ten  year reunion a few years ago back there, and those two gals among other  directors came back for that. Kyndra and Misty took hold of it and  helped bring it to fruition with myself and Steve Haseley serving as their  advisors since the beginning.  Can you explain Camp Cowboy, the components of it and how it works?  Camp Cowboy is a weekend freshman-immersion camp is what I call it.  So, they come to campus at two o   clock on a Friday, they get assigned to  small groups. Part of the power of anything is student-peer influence in  higher education, in education in colleges. The influence of the student  peer is very important. We have co-counselors, male and female, with  groups of about eight or ten students that form the ten groups that  weekend. So, they start with small group interaction, getting acquainted,  and the buses pick them up at three o   clock, bus them out. They   re  captive. We bus them out and bus them back on Sunday afternoon for  the three o   clock closing ceremony. They can   t leave.  They start on Thursday?  Always begins on Friday and ends on a Sunday. Friday afternoon we  take them to Camp Redlands on the north side of Lake Carl Blackwell,  an old WPA camp from the    20s that we   ve actually had some donors  contribute money to make it air-conditioned. So, we have a big lodge.  We have eighty acres to roam on and so forth. What we do is the Friday  afternoon is getting acquainted, and it   s a spirit night when they learn the  traditions, the alma mater, the fight song. They meet Pistol Pete in a  surprise appearance at a campfire late that night. They meet coaches and  athletes that night, the student leaders. It   s about building spirit and  tradition, and by Friday night, the students already know the fight song  and the alma mater of the university. They have what they call    camp  times    where they help them learn the songs and school spirit, and that   s  after the spirit sessions of Friday night, where they have coaches and  athletes of various sports.  Saturday morning is faculty/staff time. They bring faculty/staff out to  work with them in small groups and also on an administrative panel that  they hear services talked about, and then faculty jump into the small  groups. Then they divide it in two groups on Saturday afternoon, Sunday  morning, the spend half day on the high ropes course. We   ve had a ropes  course out there for forty years, but they   ve got a brand new one now  that   s only two years old that   s approximately twice the height of the  other. I   m going to tell you the high ropes course is probably 125 feet off  the ground, and trained facilitators put them in their harnesses, show  42  them how to do things safely, and up go the freshmen. It   s kind of an  experiential leadership experience for them, so all of the freshmen go  through the high ropes course, either on Saturday afternoon or Sunday  morning.  By the way, Saturday evening has a talent show where the groups  compete against each other. Of course, we bring out faculty and  administrators, not only for small groups, but they have the meal with  us, and every camp is named after an outstanding faculty or staff  member that the students get together and say,    We want to honor him  or her.    There are five camps these days, we   ve settled into five. We do  one for the varsity football team in August, too, a mini-camp, because of  two football coaches, Les Miles and now  Mike  Gundy both have felt  like it   s a way for student athletes to get to know student leaders, you  know, in a microcosm sense. They also come having learned the alma  mater and the fight song, by the way. One camp, because of Jim  Halligan   s commitment, permanently carries the name of Camp  Halligan. Then there are four more faculty/staff members selected each  year by the student directors, all people who have had a big influence on  the university environment. So, it   s always Camp Somebody. Sometimes  it   s been a coach, many times a faculty member, and Camp Halligan,  something else. Of course, you   re being honored this year, Jerry. Camp  Gill will be one of the camps, because that notion is kind of weaving  together the tradition and history of the university.  By the way, both evenings are closed with a campfire at the lakeside.  Friday night it   s an outstanding graduate who comes and talks about his  or her experiences and what the OSU educational experience meant to  them. By the way, that   s when Pistol Pete comes out of the dark, shoots  his gun, takes off his head, which he never does otherwise as he tells  them, and tells him about Frank Eaton and Pistol Pete, and they learn  about who Pistol Pete was. I   ve had two or three guys who have become  Pistol Petes tell me that the night that they were at Camp Cowboy and  saw Pistol Pete come out and take the head off and tell them about Frank  Eaton and Pistol Pete is night they decided they wanted to be Pistol  Petes. Josh Pulver being the most recent one.  Then the second campfire on Saturday night, we build it up and say,     You need to be there for the campfire Saturday night because you   re  going to be really impressed with the speaker that night.    We turn the  table on them and we tell them,    The speaker for tonight is you. The  class of 2017,    or whatever class would be in four years.    You   re the  speaker tonight.    And one by one, not that they have to, they begin to  stand up and talk about what they   re feeling about coming to OSU and  being a freshman and after twenty-four hours with these upper-class  student leaders. Remember, Camp Cowboy   s led by four student  43  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  directors and about thirty-five counselors and wranglers that work the  whole weekend, so the student peer influence is what drives Camp  Cowboy, the energy and talent. You and I, they might like us  temporarily, but they wouldn   t jump and do all the fun things they do if  it weren   t student-led.  So that night, those students on the Saturday night start talking about  what they feel, being a student at OSU, and some really interesting and  neat testimonials come out that night. And, by the way, in terms of data,  I always remember in front of President Halligan, Vice President Keener  and Beer, I always remember being challenged a little bit in    97-   98, by  some academic folks and others saying,    I don   t know that we need  another program that   s going to cost students more to come to OSU, and  it sounds like a big social weekend.    So, all along from the very  beginning, it   s been important that we kept academic and retention  numbers, and to this very day, students that go to Camp Cowboy versus  those that don   t make higher GPAs. I think it   s a .17 on the average  higher, and number two, are more likely to graduate in four years, and  that   s double digit. I think it   s an 11 percent higher rate of graduation in  four years than those who didn   t, and if you go to five- and six-year  rates, it approaches 20 percent. So, retention and GPA have proven  themselves there very strongly.  I appreciate you bringing that out.  We knew we needed to have that, because did it make a difference, or  was it just a social weekend? That   s been very important. And it is  social, but it   s a lot more than that.  Well, Kent, would you feel comfortable talking about your role in the  inception of it and you continuing roll?  I think sometimes the best role for me is to get out of the way because  the students have so many good ideas and energy and thoughts. Just like  our four new directors now are working hard on enrollment. They came  and helped me with Special Olympics last week. They volunteered their  time last week. They are movers and shakers, and they   re academically  successful and acknowledged campus leaders. So, really, my role, I  think, is really a facilitator, helping to get them together, because they  are different people, and they come from different backgrounds, and  they think differently. They aren   t a team when they come together. So,  my role is to facilitate and help them come together as a leadership team  and then to see how important their responsibility is. Everything from  safety, like if there   s a tornado warning, to being sure we get the food  bins out, a lot of the mundane behind-the-scenes things that they realize,     Oh, I didn   t know you had to do all of this to make these camps work,     44  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  to help them see that and then to be behind them. Honestly, of these  other 150 camp staff members who work the five camps, thirty-five or  forty per camp, a lot of those could   ve been directors, but they weren   t  selected. But they   re movers and shakers, so we kind of help reinforce  them.    Hey, you all are special people because of this task and  challenge, and some of these people may challenge you even sometimes,  but remember, you   re the four selected. We   re going to support you in  what you do, and if we differ on it, we   ll pull you aside privately on  that.    We try to help them realize, Jerry, that they are the university, they  represent the university. There   s sort of a standard of behavior and  practice that   s real critical. We don   t just slop into those roles. We don   t  just show up and hope it goes well. We   ve really got to be on top of our  game, so I think I   m facilitator, advisor, is what I do. I kind of try to stay  out of the way. I do enjoy going to them, it   s a lot of fun.  ------- End of May 18, 2010 interview -------  My name is Jerry Gill. Today is May 20, 2010. I   m visiting with Brian  Kent Sampson on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project, which is  part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU  Library. Kent, I appreciate you taking time again to come and do a  follow up interview with us.  Glad to be back with you. It was fun.  There were some things we didn   t get finished up on last time. As we  finished your last interview, we were talking about some special  programs and events and traditions at Oklahoma State University. We   d  just finished talking about Camp Cowboy. There   s one that comes to  mind I want to ask you about that   s maybe more infamous than famous,  but it   s called Streakers Night.  Streakers Night. Yes, sir.  And I   ve heard several versions of it from the student side, but I  understand, Kent, that you participated. Not participated, that   s the  wrong word. You observed. (Laughter) Excuse me.  I was on duty.  Yes, you observed this from an administrative staff perspective.  Yes.  But, seriously, as you were a part of the Student Affairs office at that  45  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  time, as I understand you were requested to be there to observe student  behavior, et cetera. First of all, let me back up and ask you, do you  remember what year the inception of Streakers Night was?  I was thinking about that, Jerry. Approximately    74,    73-   74, maybe    75,  somewhere in there is when it seemed to have run, because I saw some  material I was looking at the other day, in 1980, that shows it had been  running for about six years then. So, if that   s true, about    74-   75,  something like that.  And you said it went through about the end of the decade there?  Yes. Probably slowing down, I think, by probably its seventh year or so,  particularly with some local laws having changed that had an influence  on it, and some town fathers and mothers and authorities felt like it  might be getting too dangerous or out of hand.  First place, where were most activities held?  Streakers Night really occurred on Washington Street, as it is known as  The Strip. So, from Sixth Street on north to University Avenue would   ve  been the streaker   s strip run, if you would. It brought large numbers of  people, of course, mostly students, but others to observe or participate or  be involved in the brouhaha a little bit. It was basically Washington  Street, or called The Strip, that four block run, approximately.  And Kent, you said    several    students. I mean, how would you  estimate? What number would you give?  On two counts I would say the numbers of people that I observed in my  years there, in terms of the audience, the witnesses, I would say were  probably in the thousands, certainly.  Maybe four or five thousand?  Oh, sure.  Or more?  I   d say four or five thousand easily. Yes. I   d say that. Certainly never as  few as a thousand or so. I   d say four or five thousand would be a very  safe estimate, maybe more. Participants, much fewer in number, Jerry.  (Laughter) I   m going to tell you, the best I could recall and had seen and  experienced, I   m going to say, because at different times I had different  assignments or areas, so you didn   t always see everybody who struck  through, but I would say normally, on a good night or a good season,  46  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  you might see as few as twelve to fifteen and maybe twice that, at the  most thirty-five to forty, in my observation or recollection.  Kent, could you sort of paint the picture? Say you   re looking down  Washington Street, known, as you said, as    The Strip,    those four  blocks. I mean, what did it look like? I   ve heard people were on top of  roofs, people were lining  the street . Could you describe the scene?  Yes. You know, the word got out always. Remember, this was the  Thursday night before spring break, so it   s kind of a big    go out and  celebrate a little bit    night for a lot of students, and the word was always  out.    Move your cars from Washington Street. Don   t be parked on  Washington Street that night,    because unfortunately they  cars  could  be damaged or vandalized. So people would move their vehicles, and of  course the innkeepers, the people who had the businesses, were there  and always stayed on site to help protect the business, to be sure there   s  no damage to their property because of the crowds. But as you looked  down the street from University Avenue south towards Sixth Street, yes,  if there were cars there left, and sometimes people were sitting on them,  there were certainly folks sitting on top of some of the roofs. I still  remember seeing guys sitting on top of Willie   s with their legs hanging  off there. Students would climb up and get on top of the buildings and  sit, students and others, and certainly the crowds were so heavy down  that street that they not only, of course, filled the sidewalk, they poured  over into the street. So, you talk about not two lanes of traffic available,  obviously you couldn   t drive, and those were blockaded off, anyway, so  you couldn   t try to drive, but the crowds were so great that they would  spill into the street. So, you literally had a trail left, if you would, for the  streakers or others to come through. There wasn   t a lane of traffic  available.  I guess there was all the drinking and eating establishments along there,  people packed in those restaurants and drinking places.  Yes. And Jerry, then we had on that far south end of Washington, then, a  restaurant, the Sirloin Stockade, and of course well known in this part of  the country was the Sirloin Stockade bull. It was on a trailer and on  wheels, and I   m going to tell you it stood twelve to fifteen feet tall. It  was a plastic, painted, huge thing. I don   t know what the weight was,  and it was on a trailer, so they pulled it around to different locations in  the state and had the bull to help promote activities. Well, you may have  heard, it was sitting down there and some ambitious group one night  decided,    Let   s take the bull down the strip.    So, you look up and here  comes the bull on a trailer, not being pulled by a vehicle, but pulled and  pushed by people, students and others, all the way down from almost  Sixth Street where the Stockade was, clear to University Avenue. Of  47  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  course it    T   s there, and the group decided,    Well, let   s take a left turn  here on University Avenue.    They did, and then right across from the  Sigma Nu house, of course, is Theta Pond, and the bull that night winds  up being in Theta Pond. So, I   ll always remember it floating in the pond  on the trailer, because it was attached to the trailer, and some people  even riding the bull down the street and on the bull in the pond. Pretty  memorable.  Oh my gosh. You talked about the streakers earlier, Kent. You said  anywhere from maybe a dozen to twenty-four, or something in that  neighborhood. How many would be in a group? Two, three, four, or they  did it in small groups?  That   s what I recall that I saw, or you had photos of either or both. They  would be small groups. I don   t think I saw them come through  singularly. I saw them come through in small groups, a group of half a  dozen, and then people would be waiting and applauding, hoping. It  might go twenty, thirty minutes before anybody else would come. Then  all of a sudden another group would break out. It was kind of like peer  pressure.    Nobody else is coming, so I guess we should go,    or  something. (Laughter) So, I remember them in small groups, maybe as  many as ten or twelve at the most that I could recall.  Where did they come from? Did they just appear out of a side street or  something?  It seemed that way. It would seem that they would just come out of  nowhere. I think, of course, some of them had friends that lived right off  the Strip in residences, or they themselves, so if they decided to get bold  enough, there   s enough chanting, I think in some cases they might go  into these apartments either on the east or west side and drop their  clothes right there and decide,    Let   s take a chance. Let   s do it.    I was  advising the Residence Halls Association at that time, and I still  remember an RHA assembly chair who was chanted and encouraged  enough to actually don his clothing and struck. So, we had an RHA  assembly chair that year decide to take a chance and try, and he took a  lot of verbal abuse the following week at his RHA assembly meeting.  And, by the way, Jerry, though that was the event and that was the night,  Thursday before spring break, keep in mind that was kind of a national  fad, to a degree. Not big gatherings like that, but streaking, so we  certainly had, during those years and even after, occasional streakers.  I can remember a banquet in the Student Union ballroom, and somebody  struck through behind the head table. I remember the president of Stout  Hall had his mask on, but he struck through the campus in front of the  library lawn, you know, and bragging about it later. So, you had  48  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  Sampson  Gill  individuals occasionally during those years deciding it would be the  thing to do. It happened beyond the one big night, occasionally.  Well, at streakers night, did you ever see any female streakers?  I did occasionally. I did. Not many, but some, a handful that I could say,  yes, usually encouraged on by the guys.  Oh yes, absolutely. Whistles, applause and cheers.  Yes.  Well, Kent, what did your boss   I mean, he said go out there, but what  were you asked to do? (Laughter) I mean, just take notes? Were you  taking photos or were you just observing? What were you doing?  Good point. There was a police command post on the top of the Student  Union parking garage looking down south to Washington Street, the  Strip, so the command post for the police and student affairs, kind of,  was from there. For the most part, all those of us in student affairs were  kind of on call, and really it was not about cracking knuckles or cracking  heads. It was really about being concerned about injuries to person or to  property, because there had been some businesses damaged, broken  windows, occasionally. There had been some cars damaged that had  been left parked there. I can   t tell you that I   m aware of any student ever  being injured or hurt, but the environment was prepared for that, and a  lot of it of course had to do with the number of people who were there  under the influence of alcohol. I mean, the brazen ones or the louder or  more rowdy ones were sometimes maybe drunk or under the influence.  So, our job as student affairs staff was t
