 Gill. Today is February 26, 2009. I   m visiting with  Orlando Hazley in his home here in Tulsa as part of the O-STATE  Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program.  Orlando, I appreciate you taking time to let us visit with you today.  It   s a pleasure.  Let   s start with the beginning. Can you tell me a little about where you  grew up, a little about your family and your early life?  Okay, sure. I grew up in Enid, Oklahoma. I spent about four years in the  state of Washington where I went to junior high school. I returned to  Enid in 1950. I finished high school at Booker T. Washington High  School in Enid in 1952. After finishing school, I worked the summer for  a construction job and then attended Langston University for a year  where I wasted my mama   s money, so I dropped out of school because I  just didn   t find an interest at that point. I was drafted into the Army in  1954. I served two years in the Army, in and out of Guam in the Pacific,  and loved it. It was a beautiful place. Most soldiers despised it, but it  was a beautiful place to be. I participated in football and track while I  was over in Guam and also at Fort Chaffee. Of course, I didn   t run high  school track. I played football, but I didn   t run high school track. I had  gone out for track, but I didn   t participate.  Orlando, what league did you play, and what schools did you play  against in high school?  We played against Ponca City, Stillwater, Watonga. Who else did we  play? Nowata, Bartlesville, Chickasha, El Reno   I think that was our  conference.  Did you have a pretty good football team?  5  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Yes, we had a pretty good football team. We thought we had until we  went out to a place called Frederick, Oklahoma. We had this hot team,  and we were from the city, and Frederick was a small place and all the  guys there picked cotton. As a matter of fact, we passed by them in the  cotton field, and we all kind of laughed and said,    Look at those guys   Poor fellows.    And we went on to the school. What we didn   t realize  was that about an hour after we   d been there, this truck came in full of  cotton with people, boys all over the top of that. They got out, and those  were the cotton pickers we were laughing at. They went and ate their  dinner and got ready to play football, and they just beat the daylights out  of us.  They ate their dinner and then ate your lunch.  They ate our lunch. (Laughter)  What position did you play? Were you running back?  Yes, I was a running back.  What we call a half back?  Yes. They didn   t have wide receivers and things like that.  Split T, right?  Right, we ran split T and single and double wing.  Going back to growing up in Enid. Where were you before when you  lived that little bit in junior high?  I lived in Seattle.  Are there some experiences there, some values you learned growing up  as a child   experiences that molded you, influenced you later in your  life?  Yes, I think so, because that was the first time I ever attended an  integrated school. I remember so well being in that school, and I never  was a good student, a super student, but once I got there I found out that  there were guys in that class who were sharp. I sat between a guy by the  name of Haley Chin, the guy in front of me was named Chu Men Wong,  and then the guy on this side of me, his name was Morris Pehaw, a  Jewish kid. I found out that after a regular school, they would go to a  school after school. Every day they were always nine miles ahead of the  rest of us, and I was in a class with about thirty-five kids. Now, teachers  6  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  complain about that many kids, but back then that was the average.  Those guys were constantly working, and I was sitting between them,  and that means you go to work, so I did. I went to work and became a  pretty good student. I have never forgotten that. Morris Pehaw went on  in real estate and became a millionaire. I lost track of Chu Men Wong  and Haley Chin, but I   ve never forgotten them.  Who was your strongest influence on you growing up?  My mom and my dad. Yes. My mom was a strong person. A very strong  person. Matter of fact, I have a picture of her over here on the wall. And  my dad was a little guy, but during Prohibition he made quite a living.  He raised hogs, he raised chickens, and he always had a garden. Those  things   I don   t raise hogs or chickens, but I have a garden every year.  I   ve never forgotten how he could get a lot out of a little. He worked for  Santa Fe Railroad, as a watchman for the Santa Fe, and he didn   t make  much money, but doggone it, he got all the miles he could out of that  money.  And probably discipline was very strong in your family?  Oh yes. My daddy loved me dearly, but I was always one step from the  grave. (Laughter) He would hurt you. I think I got three poundings from  my dad. One was for running. Going to school, I thought I could outrun  almost everybody there. Even guys in high school, I   d given them a  good fit. Of course, my dad was no match, and I remember I did  something wrong, and he said,    Come here.    And I was about eight or  nine feet from him. I was only in about second or third grade then, and I  started backing up. He said,    Are you going to run?    And there was no  doubt about it, I was going to run. I turned to run, and he ran over me.  (Laughter)  We know where your speed comes from.  Yes, I found out real quick. All the time he   s pounding me, I   m trying to  figure out how he did it. (Laughs) Oh gosh, I   ve never forgotten that. He  could move. And then my mother used to laugh. She would say,    When  you were a child, some pigs got out, and your dad chased those pigs  down, and you know pigs can move.    But he was very fast.  Did you all live in the country then?  No, we lived in the city.  On the edge of town?  7  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Well, almost the edge of town. At that time, where I lived, you could  raise darn near anything you wanted to. Then after, my daddy built a  new home which was on the edge of town at that time, which was  northwest Enid. He raised hogs, but he never let them touch the ground.  He always raised them off the ground. And he raised what they called  pullets   you know, chickens. He would tell us on Monday, he   d say,     Boys, don   t make any plans for this weekend, because we   re going to  take care of those chickens.    And we would. We   d kill the chickens, and  Daddy would draw them. We   d pick them, and he   d draw them and burn  all the pinfeathers off of them and prepare them for what was the deep  freezer then.  We had a deep freezer, bought from Sears. Never forget our first one. It  looked like a big old white coffin. (Laughter) But it wasn   t tough, you  know. I never missed a meal in my life unless I wanted to. But it was  tough because he would buy a couple of bushels of peaches. That meant  we had to peel them. He would buy a bushel of   my mother canned  before we started the deep-freeze thing. He   d buy a bushel or a bushel  and a half of string beans, and that meant we had to snap them. I have  two brothers and a baby sister. I had an older sister but she passed away.  So we prepared a lot of food ourselves, plus, my dad grew sweet  potatoes. He grew sweet potatoes and all that other stuff. He grew all  that stuff, and we put it up. So like I said, I never missed a meal in my  life. (Laughs)  Getting back to where you were talking earlier about military, so after a  year it was decided that you  were  needed. You got drafted. Uncle Sam  wanted you?  Uncle Sam wanted me; it was the best thing that ever happened to me.  Could you share a little bit about your experiences? I think you  participated in track in the military?  Yes. I went on track in basic training at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. Of  course, I won the 100-yard dash and the 220. Then, I went overseas to  Guam, and they played football and basketball   football, basketball and  track. I participated in football and track. They had the worldwide track  meet in 1955 in Rome, New York, and I qualified from Guam. What  they did was you had your team on Guam. You'd go to sort of a regional  in Okinawa. They would take the winners from that and go to Tokyo.  The people that they gleaned from that group would make up the Far  East Air Force Team, and then you   d come back to wherever the  national or world track meet was going to be, and that year it was in  Rome, New York. The only thing I did, I won the 100-yard dash. And  we won the 440 relay and the mile relay. I wasn   t a part of the mile relay  8  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  at that time. I never had the experience of a quarter mile. (Laughs) I  learned a lot. I watched those guys. I started watching people in their  events.  Orlando, did you have some training and some coaching? Because  obviously you had very little training in high school.  Very little training.  Did you get some training there in the military?  A little, not much. I really didn   t get any formal training until I got to  Oklahoma State University and working with J. W. Mashburn and Eddie  Ray Roberts, who worked with me a great deal on the starts. And of  course,  Coach Ralph  Higgins worked with me on the starts and  relaxing. I never relaxed. When I run, I was all strain, but he taught me  how to relax. I saw a picture of myself one time, and my face was going  up and down, waving. I was relaxed, and it really made a difference, you  know, in what I did.  You were in the Army but assigned to the Air Force.  I was in the Army assigned to the Air Force. It was called SCAWAF   a   special category of the Army with the air force.  It was an engineering  group. I was a clerk typist.  I understand that your connection with OSU was through legendary  OSU coach Ralph Higgins?  Yes.  Can you share the story with him? Was that the same summer as the  Rome games that you ran in?  That   s right. That   s right.  Colorado, was it?  Ran in Colorado with the AAU  Amateur Athletic Union  meet in  Colorado. He had a sprinter with him who was one of the largest  sprinters I had ever seen. He was about 6   1   , weighed about 240 pounds,  and he could run like the wind. His name was Hayes, and he was really a  good sprinter. And my coach introduced me to Higgins.  A military coach?  9  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  My military coach.  He knew Coach Higgins?  He knew Coach Higgins. Everybody knew Coach Higgins. We started  talking, and he said,    Well, where are you from?    I said,    I   m from  Oklahoma.    And he said,    Oklahoma?    I said,    Yes.       Where?    I told  him, and the conversation continued. He said,    Are you interested in a  scholarship?    Well, I had been offered a scholarship on the West Coast  and also the Air Force Academy offered me a scholarship, but I was a  year too old, which was good. (Laughs) Higgins asked if I would  consider coming to OSU. I told him,    Yes, I would consider that.    He  said,    Well, if you really want to come, make sure you look me up in  January when you get out of the service.   (I got out in November.)    Look  me up, and we   ll see what we can do.    And he said,    Are you going  back to Enid after the meet?    I said,    Yes.    And he said,    Do you have a  ride?    I said,    No.    Higgins took me to Enid and let me out at my back  door. (Laughs)  So you got well acquainted on that trip.  Yes, with Higgins. Yes I did, yes I did. I got well acquainted with  Higgins with that trip, and I did exactly what he said. When I got out, I  went over and got myself a   borrowed  150 from a friend of mine there  in Enid and got myself enrolled. Went and saw Coach Higgins, and he  put me on scholarship immediately. Yes, indeed.  So you enrolled in what year?  In January of 1956.  And did you run that spring then with the track team?  No, no. I wasn   t eligible.  So freshman were not eligible in those days?  Freshmen were not eligible in those days, no. So he put me with Eddie  Ray Roberts and J. W. Mashburn, which was quite an experience in  itself. (Laughs)  Now you received a full scholarship? Is that right?  Yes.  Had you ever been on the OSU campus before?  10  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Never.  What was your first impression when you came on campus?  Well, of course, to me then it was large. Thirteen thousand students. Oh  my God, that   s monstrous. That doesn   t even compare to today, but at  that time that was a lot of people. But it was nice. I stayed in Bennett  Hall, had a room in Bennett Hall, and met some fine young men, black  Afro Americans. One of them was a super scholar   two of them were.  Two of them were. One was from right down the street from Stillwater,  and one was from Okmulgee, and they were great. There was another  from Okmulgee. He was brilliant, but he wouldn   t go to class. (Laughs)  But he had a thing going. He would go to class when the tests were  given, and he   d tell the professor,    If I make an A on this test, will you  give me a D?    And they   d say,    Sure, if you make an A on this test, I   ll  give you a D.    And he   d knock it wide open. That   s how brilliant he  was, but he didn   t have any common sense. (Laughs) He astounded me.  My wife and I had one of the   after I got married. I got married the  summer following. The guys would always come to my house. Guys and  gals would come to my house. He saw me studying, and he said,    What  are you studying?    I said,    For my biology test.    And he said,    Go over  some of the questions. What do you have?    I   d go through my notes. He  made a ninety-eight, and I made a ninety-two. (Laughs) Golly. But he  was that kind of person, brilliant.  Orlando, you were the first African American student athlete at  Oklahoma State to earn a  varsity  letter at Oklahoma State, which  makes you pretty famous. You have a place in OSU history. Were you  concerned about being the only black athlete and how you might be  received at OSU? Was that a concern for you?  Not really. I only ran into one student, one of the students on my track  team, that ever questioned why I was there. Why did I choose to come to  Oklahoma State University? He was a pole vaulter, third class, so I  didn   t pay him any attention at all. He didn   t mean anything to me, but I  remember his name. But that was the only problem I had as far as the  student body goes. There was no social life basically there for blacks on  the campus.  Was there much interaction between the black student athletes (the  handful that were there) and the white student athletes?  No, none whatsoever. But I would   the only ones that I really   interacted with  were my teammates. My teammates   I was close to  my teammates.  11  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Track teammates?  Yes, my track teammates. Yes, I was close to them   Eddie Ray Roberts  and a number of others. I stayed around them all the time. And, of  course, I interacted with those guys socially, but that was about it.  What was your relationship with Coach Higgins? Did you have a close  relationship with him?  I had a very close relationship with Coach Higgins   very close  relationship with Coach Higgins. As a matter of fact, Coach used to go  to the Sugar Bowl every year to track meets, and because it was  segregated, he stopped going completely. He used to go to the Border  Olympics in Laredo, Texas. And as a matter of fact, I went down there. I  was allowed to go down, but I could not stay in the hotels with my  friends, with my team. I couldn   t. They put me in a hotel room that was  about   the ceiling was about twenty feet high. They had one light on a  string hanging down. I   ll never forget that. And Higgins, he thought I  was in a good place until he came to visit me, and he said,    Oh, no.    So  we moved across the border to Mexico to Nuevo Laredo, and Eddie Ray  Roberts went with me.  Did your teammates take up for you in these instances?  Oh yes, oh yes. And so Eddie Ray Roberts went to stay with me in  Mexico. Then I   d come across in the morning and go to the track and do  whatever I had to do. But he  Higgins  never went back down there.  Did you have some instances with restaurants?  Oh yes, many times. Many times.  How did the team and you individually handle that?  I remember in Fort Worth going into a restaurant, and I knew I couldn   t  eat in there. I knew that, but the team went so I went right along with  them. I had this tray filled with food, and when I got up there they told  me I couldn   t eat. I just left it there and walked out, so the guys got me a  sandwich later and I ate that. Then, we started stopping at schools along  the way where Higgins knew people. And I remember stopping in  Lampasas, Texas, on our way to Laredo. We stopped in Lampasas and  ate at the cafeteria at the school. Higgins knew those people, so I ate at  the school, but there were many situations like that. When we   d go to the  Texas Relays, I couldn   t stay at the hotels. I   d have to stay in the black  community. But it was an amazing thing. Higgins would give me so  much money to support myself while I was there to pay for all my stuff.  12  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  The lady that was in charge of the hotel would say,    What would you  want to eat?    And I   d lay out what I   d want for breakfast, lunch, or  dinner and she would get it. Once my team found out    (Laughter)  You were actually getting a better deal.  Oh, I was getting a better deal. They wanted to come over there  One of  my favorite people, I can   t find him. His name was Jim Kingsolver. Jim  was a fantastic sprinter. He was a baseball player, on scholarship  baseball. Higgins would recruit people to run dual meets and beat you  (Laughter) with people he would recruit from all the other teams,  disciplines. Jim Kingsolver came over there, and we had a dozen guys  and she  the woman running the hotel  bought shrimp. Oh, it was  fantastic. He said,    Oh man. From now on I   m coming over here with  you.    It was really funny. (Laughs)  What do you remember about Coach Higgins as a coach? Like workouts  and what do you remember about his work ethics and his philosophy on  coaching and running?  He would get you in shape. If you really wanted to run and really wanted  to excel, Higgins was the man to do it. The only thing that was difficult  for me is that I was a sprinter and Higgins would run me on the mile  relay team. When it came time to participate at the national level, like  the AAU, I was always down. I   d excel through the season. But in track  you have a tendency to peak. And once you peak, you have to kind of  slack off to maintain that. And then all of a sudden you start down on the  other side. I would do that every year, every year. I would peak at the  conference meets. Then, I   d start waning a little bit. I always thought if I  could just have been in the sprint area, but I really wasn   t supposed to be  a sprinter, according to all of the stats that were gathered on me. I was  supposed to have been a half miler or a quarter miler. But I only ran that  on the mile relay, and that   s all he trained me for.  That   s how I coached kids. That   s the same way I did it. I was successful  at it. I used his tactics to the T, and it always paid off for me. But  sprinters, I would ask them to only run the mile relay during the state  meet, and it paid off for me. We set the state record that year using those  sprinters like that. I'd say,  I want three quarters out of you. I want one   quarter  to make this team.  You always had to run to make my team,  and you had to challenge my team to make this team. I picked the guy  out, I knew he was weak, and I said,    I want you to challenge him.    And  two more quarters, one in the preliminaries and one in finals. And it  always paid off for me.  Well, Orlando, I know you wouldn   t brag about this, but you were one of  13  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  the all time greats in track at Oklahoma State University. You held  several records for many years, you were the first African American  letterman at Oklahoma State, and you are in the OSU Track Hall of  Fame. Is that a source of pride for you? How do you feel about it?  It is a source of pride for me, because, I mean, there were some pretty  good guys. So sure, just to join those guys is great. I love that. I  remember when I was inducted into that, T. Boone Pickens was there  and I got a chance to meet him. And I didn   t know who he was.  (Laughter) I finally found out who he is, but I didn   t know who he was.  And I think his dad was there, but I   m not sure about that.    This is T.  Boone Pickens.       Who the heck is T. Boone Pickens?    But it was great.  Yes, I take pride in being a part of that.  Your large photo is prominently displayed at Gallagher-Iba Arena in the  north entrance there.  Yes.  Can you share the story you were telling me earlier about the young  ladies who were looking at your picture?  Yes, two young ladies were looking at these guys in the pictures. And I  walked up behind them and said,    Do you know him?    They said,    Oh,  no we don   t know him.    I said,    Well, that   s me.     They said something like,  That was a long time ago.   They said,    That was a long time ago. That   s not you. No, no, no.    Oh  boy, but I take kids over there now. I take my grandkids when I have an  opportunity. I take them over to go through there and see those people  that I   ve known over the years and to let them know I am in there.  Because I had one of my grandsons   I wanted him to go to Oklahoma  State University. And that   s when Les was there, Les Miles  former head  football coach . I   m so sorry he didn   t go. He went to Texas A M, but I  wish he   d gone to Oklahoma State. Now this next one, that   s where he  wants to go, and he   s coming up next year.  To Oklahoma State?  He wants to come to Oklahoma State. I hope he qualifies and gets a  scholarship.  That   s great. Orlando, to what do you attribute your success in track?  As I understand and as we talked about earlier, you didn   t have a lot of  coaching in high school and not very much in the military. What do you  14  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  attribute that to?  I had role models growing up, and I knew who Jesse Owens was. I knew  I could run. I found that out real quick, that that was my baby   I could  run. So I said,  That   s what   s going to get me from point A to point B is  my ability to run.  And that   s exactly the way it turned out. That   s all the  inspiration that I had coming along was that and watching these guys,  hearing about these guys, because I knew I wanted an education, and I  had to have a way of getting it. Fortunately, everything fell in line for  me.  I was visiting with Sam Pegues  who  was a year behind you.  Right.  And he described you as being very disciplined in doing the work that it  took and always being there and being on time and doing the right thing.  Is that a fair description?  Yes, I   m still that way.  Is that right?  Yes.  Do you consider yourself a role model for the guys who followed behind  you?  Yes. Yes, I do. As a matter of fact, a lot of the younger guys would hang  around me, and they would come to me with their problems sometimes.  I will never forget a young man who   s in Dallas now working at one of  the universities. He wasn   t a super track man, but he was a diligent  person. Very bright. He was having trouble out of one of our  teammates   one of our arrogant teammates. I got through, he was  worried, and he said,    What can I do about this?    And I said,    Did he  give you a scholarship?    He said,    Oh no, Coach Higgins gave me a  scholarship.    I said,    Does he send you your allowance every month?     He said,    No.    I said,    Is he responsible for you in any way? Of getting  you into the school?    He said,    No.    I said,    Tell him to go to hell.     (Laughter) He said,    That   s what I   m going to do.    His name was Louie  Mann. I don   t know if you knew Louie or not.  I knew Louie.  You knew Louie? Yeah, Louie Mann. And he said,    That   s what I   m  going to do.    Louie was just as happy as he could be after that. (Laughs)  15  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Well, that first year it was just yourself, or maybe there   s one other guy,  a football player who didn   t stay. But just behind you a year later, about  half a dozen guys came on board.  Yeah.  So by the time you graduated which was what     1960.  How many African American athletes did we have at that time? We   d  gone from just a couple to how many?  We had two on the basketball team. One out of St. Joseph, Missouri.  Berkely, Barkely, Brickley, something like that  Don Blakely . And one  out of Memphis, Tennessee, L.C. Gordon. He was the first black  basketball player. And then there were two football players out of  Wewoka. One of them ended up   one quit, and one coached and taught  in Kansas City, Kansas, and he was good, he was tough. And then, of  course, Sam Pegues, and that was just about it. Well, I have to take that  back. There was a baseball player that came out of Anadarko that was  good. He was very good. I remember him. He turned pro.  Coming back to some of the major meets, you talked about the Texas  Relays ...  Yes. And the Kansas Relays.  ... Kansas Relays and what was the other one?  Drake.  Drake Relays?  Yes.  And then some other duals, but those were the three biggies in addition  to the Big Eight and the NCAA tournaments.  Yes, and we would also run the Modesto Relays in California, the  Coliseum Relays in Los Angeles, the Fresno Relays, and there   s one  other. It   s right there in Los Angeles, a suburb of Los Angeles. We   d run  that one. And sometimes I   d be out there by myself. Coach would bring  the team back and leave me out there to participate in those events.  Is there any significant individual or team performance that you  16  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  remember at those meets?  As far as our team?  Yes, and yourself personally?  In 1958, at the conference meet in Norman, Oklahoma, that was the  highlight I think for me. I got a chance to run on the mile relay team, and  I anchored the mile relay team. Going back to what I had learned in the  military, I saw an old man run the quarter who was smart. I remember  taking on  Kansas State runner  DeLoss Dodds, who is now the athletic  director at the University of Texas. DeLoss Dodds was a superior  quarter miler, but he made a mistake and he let me run my own race, and  that was bad. I kept him outside, and he wouldn   t pass me, and he let me  loaf all the way around the track till I got to the goal post. Then it was  over then. I could make that other 110. He wasn   t a sprinter. That was a  highlight for me in my whole career was using that tactic to beat DeLoss  Dodds. (Laughs)  Did you win any of the Big Eight meets, either your individual events or  team?  The 220. I won the 220 that year. And I thought I won the 100 but I  understand   I looked back on that   I was looking at the information  that I have here. I want you to look at this. This is sort of a history of  Higgins    career. All that information is in here. I found out that I didn   t  win that race. (Laughter)  Sometimes your memory's faulty.  I thought I won that 100, but I didn   t. Dee Givens I think won it, but he  was a good sprinter too from Oklahoma. But that was the highlight for  me was that meet.  What was your best time in the 100-yard dash?  I ran 9.3 at     Pretty close to the world record.  That was the world record at that time. I ran that at Arkansas. It was  wind aided, so I didn   t get credit for it. And what upsets me is that I  slowed up. That day, I think, 9.0 flat would have been easy for me. But I  was so far ahead, I just slowed up. Bad mistake. (Laughter)  I was going to ask you a little about the track surface. At that time, the  17  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  track ran around the football field, Lewis Field, isn   t that right?  Yes, that   s right.  Was it a pretty good running surface?  It was a good surface. We had a good surface at OSU. Cinder track, Red  Dog cinder. It was a good surface. Nothing like the tracks today. But I  learned something. I am glad it was on that Red Dog cinder; I can still  walk. This new track, even though the new shoes are fantastic   they  weigh about as much as this pen. Actually one shoe, it   s a very light  shoe. But the surface is hard, and when I was forty years old, I went to  Wichita to enter a track meet. I   d never been on that track before. It  almost killed me. I mean, it hurt. When I got through I was in terrible  pain.  At age forty? What was the occasion for running?  Well, you can run   it   s an adult thing, and they still run that. Some of  those little boys can run. And so I entered that. That was my last track  meet because it hurt me so bad and I was afraid to try it again. But that  really hurt me. That track was like running on concrete.  In pre-season, did you guys work out in the pit underneath Gallagher  Hall?  Yes sir, yes sir.  Can you share a little bit about that experience?  It was cold. It was damp.  It was dark?  And this boy   s name was Bob Fischel. That   s his name, Bob Fischel.  Higgins recruited him. It was   yeah it was dark. And the baseball  players had a batting net down there. It ran from west to east; downstairs  on the north side, and we   d go down there and practice. But I   ll tell you  what, we got in shape down there. They had banked the track on both  ends.  It was dirt track, as I recall?  Dirt track, dirt track. And we could run down there.  Dust?  18  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  No, they damped it down. It was pretty damp. No dust. They didn   t have  the dust problems.  The football players didn   t have it damped down. It was just dust down  there.  Yes, and the football players didn   t come down there anyway. They  rarely came down there. It   s not like what they have now. It   s beautiful  down there. But we used that, and we got a lot of service out of that. We  were always ready to run. When Higgins took us outside, we were ready.  Moving to the academic side, what was your major?  My major was physical education and science.  You intended to be a coach and teacher?  Yes.  Do you remember some of your classes, maybe some of your professors?  I know it   s a long time ago.  I think I would remember my English teachers and my science teacher  more than any others. I remember my graduate school teachers better  than I do my undergraduate teachers, because in that undergraduate level  I was fighting for survival. I had a lot of difficulty in English and in  algebra. I despised algebra, and didn   t learn algebra until I started  teaching. I went into a classroom, and a guy had a numbers line on his  wall. I asked him,    What is that?    He said,    That   s how I teach. I start  off with my kids with minus numbers and plus numbers.    And it just  opened up for me. I said,    Oh, okay.    I couldn   t imagine a negative  number. That just didn   t stick. But when I saw that I thought,    Okay,  that   s great.    And I   ve been pushing math ever since. I was good in  basic math, but when it came to algebra, it hurt me. I was better in  trigonometry, I don   t know why. It was easier. (Laughs)  Of course, at that time, there were not any black professors that were  your teachers.  No, no, no. Now I carried, all the way through OSU, I carried eighteen  to nineteen hours, and that was a bad mistake. I didn   t realize   my  problem was never with much of the student body. My problem was  with my teachers. The counselor that I was under was also head of the  Science Department. I always felt that he was never a friendly person. I  always felt that he tried to hurt me by giving me that many hours  knowing that that was not a freshman load   eighteen hours. That didn   t  19  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  hit me for a number of years, that I started realizing that that wasn   t  right. He shouldn   t have done that. But I survived. I survived him.  (Laughs)  And you and Velda were married as you said earlier after your first  semester.  Spring. We married that summer; we married that August.  So, the summer of    56.  Yes.  You described where you lived earlier. Sixth Street over where the  hospital is now?  Yes, where the hospital is now, there were apartments all over there. We  met some wonderful friends. As a matter of fact, we are still in contact  with a lot of the people who lived there. There was a tennis player by the  name of Don Cate. And Cate and Cate   s wife were from Germany. She  became good friends with Velda. When we make trips, we travel with  them a great deal. That was a great experience.  Did you and Velda have any favorite hangouts? Places that you went on  campus and off campus?  The Student Union was basically the only place available to us.  Student Union and home?  That and home, that is right.  Were there any group activities in which the black students would do  things together?  No. None, whatsoever.  And you indicated earlier that there really wasn   t a lot of social  interaction between African American students and white students at  that time?  There was not, no. As a matter of fact, on campus one of my teachers     that was another one, too. I went into a square dance class. I loved to  square dance. I learned to square dance as a kid, but he didn   t know that,  and I didn   t tell him. When I went into that class   and I have a lot of  respect for him. He told me that day after class,    I don   t want you to  20  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  come back tomorrow.    He said,    I   m going to have to find you a dance  partner.    And what they did was they got together to find out who would  be willing, what girl would be willing, to be my partner. And this girl  volunteered and that was the end of that. I went back to class, that was  the end of that. As a matter of fact, about ten or fifteen years ago, I was  walking, coming out of a store and she spoke to me. She knew me. I  didn   t know her, but she sure knew me.  D  j   vu experience.  And she said,    I was your dance partner,    and I said,    I   ll be doggone.     She remembered me  (Laughter)  You made an impression. You must have been a pretty good dancer.  I was a good square dancer. I told him,    I know how to square dance  now.     Orlando, you   ve been back to Oklahoma State in your career as a coach  and a teacher. Do you feel as though the OSU experience for African  American students has improved today? Is it different today than it was  in your time?  I   d say of course it is. The thing is, it   s more integrated now. There are  more things to do there now. Students really don   t depend on black  friends or white friends. There is so much freedom there, and it   s so easy  to be there that they have their own thing and that doesn   t bother them.  When I was there, I was there by myself. Then Sam came along and his  girlfriend, who became his wife. And a guy by the name of LeBlanc   Curtis  from Okmulgee and a few others, we would meet at our  apartment for a little. It wasn   t a party, it was just social. It didn   t happen  often, but that was our gathering place was our apartment. But yes,  things are different now, because those kids have their own interests.  They have their fraternities and sororities. My fraternity blew up on the  campus. They made some dumb mistakes and got kicked off. (Laughs)  After all the trouble it was to get them on there, they got kicked off.  That was Alpha Phi Alpha?  Alpha Phi Alpha. But kids are changing now. The values that we had  then, they don   t exist anymore.  Can you tell me a little about your career after you left Oklahoma State  University?  Yes. I started teaching at Moon Junior High School  now Moon  21  Gill  Academy  in Oklahoma City in 1960, and I was hired   first, I did my  practice teaching there. Then, I was hired in the elementary school, but  once they found out my record, the director of personnel in Oklahoma  City said,  We want you someplace else.  So he called in the principal  that I had done my practice teaching with and said,    Look at this.    And  he hired me (Laughs) out from underneath the other principal. I spent  five years there.  But I met a man that I had known in my youth, and also my godfather,  both taught school there. It gave me an experience that I would never  forget because I had never been around my godfather that much,  although I remember him from being a small boy. He went to St. Joseph,  Missouri, to teach and then to Oklahoma City, so I wasn   t around him  very much. So that was quite a privilege.  I got to work with some people that were fantastic, and I learned some  tough lessons about people, because I was quite   what   s the term that I  want to use? I found fault with everything. I was quite critical of kids  and stuff like that. I was terrible. You know, I   ll never forget a kid that  was dirty and had on this old coat all of the time. He wore this coat in  school, and I just hated that. This guy said,    What are you doing after  school?       What do you want to do, Coach?    And he said,    I want you to  go someplace with me.    He took me down south of 4th Street there in  Oklahoma City where the Y used to be. He took me down to a place. He  said,  That boy that you were talking about, he lives back in there.    And  talk about humbling. That hurt me so bad. We went back to school, and  we started a program that any kid who wanted to take a bath during  class, during physical education   they all took physical education. At  that time, I was in physical education. We had towels, we had soap, we  had washing machines, we had all that sort of stuff. If you wanted to  wash your clothes and take a shower, that was fine, and you   d be  surprised at how many boys took advantage of that. That just changed  my life. That was an experience that changed my life.  I had one other. Big kid, six feet tall, seventh grade, and he was always  playing with these little kids. Playing with them, you know, and picking  at them. He was just irritating me to no end. I grabbed him one day, and  I said,    What   s your problem? Why are you always playing with these  little kids? How old are you?    He said,    I   m eleven.    (Laughter) I turned  that boy loose. I said,    Son, you just enjoy yourself. Go right ahead and  play.    (Laughter) He was huge  I   m telling you.    I   m eleven,    he said.  Oh God. I   ve never forgotten that. I became more interested in people  then and kids, and that never changed.  So you were five years at Moon Junior High?  22  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  I was five years at Moon Junior High School and then they hired me  here in Tulsa.  And you spent the rest of your career at teaching and coaching in the  Tulsa system?  In Tulsa, yes. I was at  Booker T.  Washington High School from    66-     77. And then I went   as principal.  Track coach first?  I was track coach, science teacher, then I became dean of boys. And then  I became assistant principal under Smith. Is that right? No, I was dean  under Smith. And when H. J. Green, who was a graduate of OSU,  became principal of Washington he asked me would I become one of his  assistant principals, and I did. I stayed there until    77, then I took  principalship myself at McLean High School in    77. Stayed there until     86 or    87.  So principal at McLean was your last teaching or your last     Last teaching  position , yes.  Now, when you were at Booker T. as science teacher and coach, you  won some state championships in track as I recall.  Yes, I won two state championships. One for the boys  in 1970 , and one  for the girls  in 1974 . That was a quite an experience because I had  some super kids. I still have pictures of them. It was wonderful. But the  girls, I found out, were more competitive than the boys. They were  cutthroats. (Laughter) They were fantastic, and they won. I didn   t really  think we could win that championship, but we did. I enjoyed it. I   m  sorry that I didn   t really stay in coaching a little bit more. I would have  liked that. But it did get more difficult. Kids got where they didn   t want  to work like I wanted them to work, and I couldn   t see getting any good  results out of them doing what they wanted to do, so I went into  administration. I was getting near retirement anyways, and I wanted to  put some cash back that would support me in my old age, so I took  advantage of that.  Dean of students, assistant principal, and then you were principal at  McLean, and before that you were assistant principal at Washington.  Yes. I went to the dropout program after that, then I retired.  Well, are there some significant things that you remember in your  23  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  coaching and teaching career? Of course, obviously the two state  championships, but are there some recognitions and accomplishments  that stand out in your mind?  For whom?  For you, or your teams or your schools at that time? Just professionally,  some highlights in your career?  Well, being associated with the football teams at Washington was a  great thing. I got more out of the kids than I did anything. I really did.  They inspired me. I remember going into Washington High School     and people have never realized this. I went into Washington High  School and the kids there dressed up better than I did. They had dress up  Friday, but to me, they were dressed up every day. I remember a young  lady walked up to me and said,    Mr. Hazley, I   m so happy you took a  job here at Washington High School and you   re on our faculty.    I said,     Thank you very much.    It was two weeks later before I found out she  was a student. I thought she was a teacher. (Laughter) That   s how sharp  they were, and I had to change my wardrobe, because they dressed up  and teachers dressed up. That   s not that way   it   s changed in Tulsa  now. They sort of went back that way, but when teachers started wearing  jeans and the women came in their sloppy jeans and they were two sizes  larger, things sort of went down.  Was that a magnet back in school at that time when you were there?  It became a magnet school while I was there. It was not when I first got  there, but it became a magnet school in    72.  Was that a good thing for the school, that change in policy?  Yes and no. The participation among black students went down a little  bit compared to the things that they were in before. I saw that happen.  The district really changed. We had more drugs because there were kids  who could afford them coming into the school, then the other kids  started dealing with them a lot, using them. Before that it was cheap  wine and cigarettes. (Laughs) But the drugs sort of came in. If the kids  used them prior to that, they didn   t bring them to school. That wasn   t a  problem at the school.  After that we started finding   went into a room one time, and I almost  got drunk myself. The teacher had left that room open, and they knew it,  and they went in there and smoked their pot right in the middle of the  darn school. Experiences like that. But overall I had a fantastic teaching  career. I did. I met some wonderful students. I met some super  24  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  teachers   I mean, top notch. I would go the distance with them, because  they were fantastic, and the students were, too. Ruben Gant, who was a  student at OSU, was one of them. He was hard to coach because he was  always afraid he was going to look bad. (Laughs) He could have been a  discus champion, but he didn   t like turning in that circle. I don   t think he  was a very good dancer. I always picked my field event people by the  way they danced. (Laughter) I found me a good dancer, I said,    Hey, I  can get something out of this one.    I really did, and it worked for me.  Are there some things about your civic, community, and church  activities that you will share with us?  Well, I am a Rotarian. I   ve been with the Rotary Club for about twenty-five  years. I sing with a group of Rotarians called the Rotary Men of  Note. There are thirty-seven to thirty-eight of us in that group, and we  travel throughout this area. Sometimes we go to international  conventions. I   ve been to one, two   I   ve been to three of them, I think.  Portland, Oregon; Banff, Canada; and Mexico City. And my church of  course, I sing in the choir at the church. I   ve been singing almost all my  life. That   s the highlight of my life now is being in those choirs,  participating in Rotary. I don   t do my fraternity. Financial, but I don   t  really participate that much except when they need money. (Laughs) I  participate.  Do you sing in the choir at your church as well?  Yeah, I sing at the choir in my church. Oh yes, yes indeed.  And you have some hobbies now that you have retired as I understand?  Yes.  Woodwork and some things like that?  Woodwork and gourds. (Laughter) I   m into gourds. I wish there was  some way to stop this thing, I   d get you some of them and show them to  you because they   re fascinating. A lady introduced me to gourds. I  immediately saw where I could do something with them, so I started  decorating them and carving them.  What kind of handy work and carpentry work do you do? Woodwork,  what kind of things?  Almost anything. I can sheetrock. I did this room. This was a duplex that  I turned into a single dwelling forty-three years ago. Wood finishing   I  love to finish wood because it   s always a challenge. I like those kinds of  25  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  things.  Is that something you learned in some of your classes in school, or did it  come naturally?  I learned both those things in junior high school and high school. The  manual training at that time was strong and it gave boys   not girls  though, the girls weren   t into that. Well for a time they did put girls in,  but now you won   t find it hardly at all at the high school level or junior  high school level. But I learned how to use tools, hand tools. I loved it. I  fell in love with it. My brother did the same thing, and he   s now a  contractor in Oklahoma City. So I took those things. When people  introduce something to me, I   ll try anything that has some craftsman  skill.  You were talking about some of the gourds that you have. Do you want  to show us your handiwork?  I   ll show you a couple of them. This is one that I make here. You can  see that little fellow. You see that little thing? I put musicians on it and  all that. It's just a fun thing to do. I give them away. I   ve never sold one  and don   t intend to. Of course, you know I   m into music so that   s my  music gourd. And I have one here that I   my wife had some sewing  material, and I used that sewing material to glue on this gourd. And it   s  just a hobby, that   s all it is. It   s a fun thing for me. It keeps me busy and  out of trouble. (Laughs) This one sits on a little stand. I make little  stands out of them. You can stand it up like that. At family reunions I  put them on tables as   here   s something a friend gave me a design for  an Indian flute. And I made a couple of them and poured the metal  around them. It   s quite an experience. It   s quite an experience. It does  play. I have two of them. When I make something, I always try to make  two. This is not round. Although, it appears to be perfectly round, it is  not. I did that by hand and with a block plane, so it is not round, but it  appears to be. It was fun making. That   s some of the things I waste my  time on.  We talked a little bit about some of your community and civic activities.  What about your family, Orlando? Tell us a little bit about your family.  My wife and I have been married for what will be 53 years in August. I  have two children. We did have three. We had one boy born in  Stillwater, but we lost him. I have a daughter, Natasha Conseula, and she  attended OSU. She is now in Orange, Texas. She has three boys and a  girl. The girl finished at the University of Texas. One of the boys will be  finishing at Texas A M in the spring of this year,    08-   09, and then I  have another one at Texas Tech. He   s a wide receiver, also. He   ll be a  26  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  junior next year, then his younger brother, Trey, will be a senior next  year at West Orange Starks in Orange, Texas, but I   m hoping he   ll end  up going to OSU. Then I have another grandson. I have a son, his name  is Orlando Jeffrey Hazley, and he is an electrician. He has a son and two  daughters. His son is a fine musician. He plays viola, and he wants to go  to Oklahoma State University. I   d like for him to play sports, but he  likes the viola. (Laughter) So I don   t know if he   s ever going to play  anything other than the....  Does he live in the Tulsa area?  He lives in Dallas, as a matter of fact   Mesquite. But he loves that  viola, and I have to give him credit, he can play it.  That   s great. Looking back, Orlando, what accomplishments and special  recognitions in your career and your life give you the most satisfaction?  That   s difficult. I would say becoming a good citizen is one of them.  Being able to become a good citizen, have some good kids, having an  opportunity to work with good people. The sports thing to me has  always been a means to an end, never an end to itself. I don   t want to get  into that too much, but to me, that   s something that kids don   t look at  today. They look at sports as the whole ball of wax, and it   s not. It   s  using sports to get some place else, you know, and I used sports to get to  where I wanted to go. Fortunately, even though I thought I was  overburdened with courses, at least I had courses that moved me towards  graduation. I don   t see that happening today with athletes. I see athletes  being kept eligible to play the sport, but that doesn   t mean they   re going  to graduate, and I think the university has made a mistake there. But  that   s not what you asked me. (Laughter)  Being able to do things for the community and for other people. What I  do for the carpentry and all that, I do for free. I don   t charge people for  that. I do it free, and they just buy the materials. I get a kick out of it. It  keeps me younger. I   m sevnty-five years old now, and every day I get is  great, because a lot of the guys I   ve known over the years, they   re not  with us anymore.  Orlando, you were recognized by the OSU Black Alumni Association  recently, two years ago as a trailblazer.  Yes.  They identify one individual a year. It   s pretty special. Do you feel like a  trailblazer? Did you help blaze the trail for some African American  students that followed you at Oklahoma State?  27  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  I guess so. I have never looked to myself as a trailblazer, you know.  People put that on you, but I went there for purpose. It just happened to  be me; it could have been anyone in sports. As a matter of fact the lady  that   I can   t think of her name now, I know her. I worked with her  husband, who was there before me as a black student, Davis.  Nancy Davis?  Oh yes, I know Nancy. And I   ve worked with her husband, who was a  very good English teacher. But I   ve never looked at myself as a  trailblazer and such, although I guess I fall into that category.  Well, you helped mentor a lot, particularly the black student athletes  who were there two, three, four years after you came in and helped them  a little bit in their judgment and their adjustment.  Did I do that? No I didn   t. I didn   t. The way I   when I came out of  college, I was in a survival mode. You know, find a job, go to work, be  successful, be able to raise my kids, things like that, so I really wasn   t  focused on the university. I didn   t focus there until I went into graduate  school, then I started focusing more in that area.  Did you do graduate work at Oklahoma State?  I did graduate work at Oklahoma State and Central State at Edmond, or  whatever they call it now. I did work there, too, and also at the  University of Colorado. But I did a great deal at Oklahoma State  University. That was a great experience. Now that was a fantastic  experience. Some of those teachers that were working in that master   s  degree program and the doctoral degree   although I was not with the  doctoral subject matter so I didn   t have to worry about that   but it was  just great to talk to people with that kind of experience, because you get  to talk more with professors in graduate school than you do in  undergraduate school.  Are there some who stand out in your mind, especially?  I can   t think of their names right now, but there were two that really     Dr. Neff in science, geology.  John Neff?  John Neff. Yes, he stood out. He was good. (Laughs) And he was a  friendly person. You could bond with a person like that. You could talk  to him. There were two other professors, but I cannot think of their  names right now, but they were great. I truly enjoyed them.  28  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Have you maintained contact with some of the people you went to school  with, particularly from the undergraduate years?  Yes. I   m very close with Sam Pegues. I stay in contact with him a great  deal. Some of the other guys I haven   t been able to find. Tom Burch,  who was a great runner, lives right east of us in Arkansas, over near  Rogers, Arkansas. I   m in contact with him all the time, we call each  other. Also, another guy from Enid, Tom Harlan, called me about two  weeks ago. He wants to have a reunion, but getting that together is very  difficult because I   ve lost track of some of the people that I would really  like to see. Kenny Covert is in New Jersey. I know where they are, most  of them. Eddie Ray Roberts is somewhere in Texas raising Appaloosa  horses. (Laughter) That was his favorite horse, and I can see why. But I  don   t know exactly where he is because I would like to see him eye to  eye. I haven   t been able to do it. I don   t know why I can   t find him.  Looking back on your time at OSU, on your career in education, how do  you hope people will remember Orlando Hazley? How do you want to  be remembered?  As being somebody who respected other people, somebody who you  could talk to, somebody who did his best to do his best, because I   ve  truly done that. I   ve tried my best to do all that I could do. I   ve had to  fight some battles along the way, but we all have to fight those battles. I  don   t worry about that anymore. And most of the people who gave me  problems, they   re dead, so I don   t have to worry about that. (Laughter)  Anything that you would do differently? Anything that you wish you   d  done that you didn   t?  Yes. If I were to go back, I think I would stay in the classroom; I  wouldn   t become a principal. I would stay in the classroom. I would  work closely with kids. I didn   t realize when I finished college that I had  a pre-med major. I didn   t know that. I didn   t find that out for twenty  some years, and when they started going through these courses and  everything, I had that. But I would not have become a doctor. (Laughter)  No, that   s sort of binding to me. It makes you some money maybe, but  money isn   t everything.  I noticed when I drove up in the driveway here, your truck has some  OSU Alumni Association stickers on it.  Oh, yes.  I   m proud to see that. Have you stayed connected with the University  over the years?  29  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Oh yes, yes indeed. I have two or three stickers I have never put on.  (Laughter) I put them out in my shop. I have a wood shop out in the  garage. And people who get sick, I tell them I can take care of some of  their problems out in my garage if they give me the opportunity.  (Laughter)  Did you help direct some students to Oklahoma State University in your  coaching and teaching career? Did you help get kids to OSU?  Oh yes, oh yes. Yes, indeed. Ruben Gant was one of them. I was quite  proud of him. I had some others that I wanted to go, but they went other  places. You know how that is. One of my great sprinters went to Kansas  State University. You know, things like that. But they went to school.  That   s the whole ball of wax. They went to school.  You   ve been a pioneer at Oklahoma State University   although you  don   t necessarily see yourself that way   as the first African American  letterman at Oklahoma State University. That   s a pretty special place in  the history of our university. Is there anything about that that makes you  feel good inside because it was a significant accomplishment for you?  Oh, yes, no doubt about that. I feel good about that, although, I didn   t  see it at the time, you know. But sure, looking back at it, I feel good  about that.  Have you stayed connected with the Black Alumni Association? They do  their golf tournament each year.  I   m connected with them, but I haven   t associated with them directly in  quite a while.  Is there anything that we haven   t covered that we should have asked but  we didn   t, or anything that we left out? You had a pretty significant and  varied career, and we want to make sure we capture all of it.  I like to say to students when they go to Oklahoma State University, or  any university but in particular Oklahoma State because that   s my  school, when they go there, that they go there knowing what they want  to do or finding out very quickly what they want to do and move in that  direction. If they   re not going to be a doctor, then they   re not going to be  a doctor, but always make sure that they work towards a goal. And to  athletes, I   ll always tell them to work towards a degree. I don   t care if  they   re super football players; work towards that degree because football  isn   t ever guaranteed. No sport is guaranteed.  I told that to a young man in his freshman year, and I met him, he was  30  Gill  Hazley  Gill  Hazley  Gill  out of Houston. And I said,    What do you plan to do?    and he said,    I   m  a football player, I   m going to be a professional football player.    I said,     Young man, if I were you, I would make sure I would get my degree.    I  saw him about six or seven years later, and he reminded me of that  because he got hurt his junior year but he got his degree. And he was  teaching at Southern University in Houston. He was a heck of a football  player. That didn   t pan out, but he got his degree, and it allowed him to  move on. If he hadn   t gotten that degree, he would have fallen short  somehow. He may have achieved, but he wouldn   t have achieved at the  level that he is now. So I tell kids to get that degree, because in playing a  sport, the university is going to get their pound of flesh, so you better get  yours. (Laughs)  Quid pro quo.  You better get yours.  Anything else?  No.  Thank you. We appreciate it very much.  -------  -------
