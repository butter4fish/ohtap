 Gill. Today is February 26, 2009. I   m interviewing  Sam Combs here at his office in Tulsa. This interview is part of the O-STATE  Stories Project which is part of the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. Sam, thanks for taking time from your schedule to be  with me today.  Thank you for asking me, Jerry.  First of all, why don   t we go back to the beginning. Can you tell me  where you grew up and a little about your family?  Well, it   s interesting. People ask me where I grew up and I say,    Well,  I   m a native Oklahoman.    I was born in Bristow, Oklahoma; didn   t  attend school there though. My dad was a mail carrier earlier in his  career here in Tulsa. We lived in Tulsa for a while, and then he got a  school teaching job in vocational agriculture in Beggs, Oklahoma, and I  started the first grade there. We moved from there in the third grade to  McAlester, Oklahoma; stayed there until I was in the seventh grade. I  liked to tell my friends that I did three to seven in Big Mac. From there  we moved to Stillwater when he went to work for the U.S. Department  of Agriculture in the Soil Conservation Service, so I went through  middle school and high school at Stillwater, which was at that time C. E.  Donart High School. And from there, obviously, from Stillwater, you  need to go to Oklahoma State University.  Or wherever you are, right?  That   s right.  Well, Sam, what values did you learn from your family in your childhood  experiences that molded you and influenced your life?  5  Combs  Gill  Combs  That your word is your bond. Number one is that you keep your word,  say what you do and do what you say. I learned that very early, and that  your name is the best thing you have going for you. It   s the thing that  has the most value. Everything else that you can own and carry with you  is not as important as your good name. And when I think about the  people who were most significant in my life, I think about my parents  and my grandmother, my maternal grandmother. She went by Big Mama  in our family. But my grandmother taught me the value of hard work  and perseverance. She was as tough as they come and grew up in  Louisiana  in the  early part of 1900. Not much of an education but just  a lot of perseverance and hard work.  I learned from my mother what I guess I can best describe as civility.  And I hope I demonstrate and do her honor in that regard. She taught me  the value of saying    thank you    and being appreciative of things that  people do for you. The reality of it is that people don   t have to do  anything for you. They really don   t. From that, I guess my saying would  be    kindness is free,    and if we could take some time to say    thank you     to people, it   s amazing what that will do for you. And finally from my  father, I learned the importance of giving back to the community. That   s  something that all of us should do. It   s part of the cost for the air that we  breathe. And it   s important that we be willing to teach others,  particularly young people, the value of giving back.  Sam, was your dad a role model for you? He was a pretty special guy.  Could you take maybe a minute or two and tell a little bit about your  father and his connections with OSU?  Sure and I shared some insight to him just in those comments. He was an  agriculture major, graduated from Langston University but attended  OSU and took several courses at Oklahoma State University. He worked  as a soil conservationist in the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil  Conservation Service, which the state office was headquartered at  Stillwater. My dad had a love for agriculture and education and young  people, and as a result of that, he started a youth agriculture program for  minority youth called the Retired Educators for Youth Agriculture  Programs. He partnered with some of his contemporaries who were also  vocational ag teachers and heavily involved in the field (agriculturalists  if you will, African Americans) to form this not-for-profit organization,  which is still in existence today. As a matter of fact, I chair the board,  and my wife Rita is the executive director. It   s had a tremendous amount  of success, and it   s part of his legacy. It   s an organization that has been  instrumental in the success of many young people, giving them a  launching pad for a career. He was a lot of fun. He was a guy that had a  quick wit, very bright,  could  do numbers in his head extremely fast,  great domino player too. (Laughter) Doesn   t hurt to be able to count.  6  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  But when I talk about the value of a good name, he left many, many  friends around the state because people understood his passion for those  three things: youth, education, and agriculture. He blanketed the state  with his passion, if you will, and his commitment to seeing things  change in those areas, so people recognize, I believe, an honest broker. I  think in that regard I would describe him as an honest broker, and so as a  result he was able to open a lot of doors. Consequently, when I came  along and I worked with him and actually helped him structure the  REYAP format, and actually I kind of modeled it after the Minority  Engineering Program that I was a part of at Oklahoma State. But I have  benefited greatly from his name and his works because obviously I   ve  got the same name. As I engage people around this state, and I have a  pretty sizable network of my own, but a lot of it has been deepened by  the fact that I will show up and they say,    That   s Sam   s son,    or they  had good relationship experiences with my dad.  And your dad was in some sense a pioneering African American. At the  time, he was county extension agent, perhaps the only one in the state.  Yes he was the first soil conservationist African American in this state in  that office, and he had numerous firsts in the agriculture field. He was a  district conservationist in the late part of his career here in Tulsa, and I  used to tease him about going from production agriculture and being in  the field to going to the garden clubs in Tulsa. I remember he had a  morning show that I can   t remember how early it was. It was five or six   a.m.  this television show, and he used to ask me,    What do you think  of my show?    I said,    Dad, nobody watches it.    (Laughter) But what  was interesting was our former CEO at the company one day comes up  to me in the hallway. His name was J. D. Scott, and old Scotty said,     Hey, Sam, I was up watching this show I watch every morning.    He  said,    That guy   s name is Sam Combs and he looks a lot like you. That   s  got to be your father. Is that your dad?    I said,    Yes,    and I go,    You  really watch that?    And he said,    Yes, I   ve got some pecan trees and I  like getting   can you get him to call me about it?    (Laughter) So much  for that.  Well, the next question I was going to ask you is what influenced you to  enroll at OSU. I think I got the answer to that one. What year did you  enroll, Sam?  Would   ve been 1975.  Nineteen seventy-five.  Yes it was a great year. Lot of fun.  7  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  What were your first impressions of OSU as a student? You   d been  around, you   d lived in Stillwater, but as a student, do you remember  some of your first impressions?  Yes, even though I lived in Stillwater, and I guess I was less intimidated  by the school than some students that would come there, I was taken  back. You hear about the whole notion of 20,000 students descending on  the town. Just the sheer size of it, even for someone that lives here, just  takes you back a little bit. But a great environment, a great environment  for young people.  Did you know you wanted to be an engineer when you enrolled? What  caused you to want to be an engineer? I mean that wasn   t in your family  background.  No. I didn   t have any idea. Matter of fact, I remember two guys coming  to the school. One of them was a guy   actually one guy by the name of  Roosevelt. Mack came to visit with me and spoke to my chemistry  teacher in high school who ended up being an advisor at Oklahoma  State, a guy by the name of Virgil Nichols. And I   m forever indebted to  those two gentlemen because they set me on a path for what   s been a  wonderful career. Mr. Mack talked about this program, the Minority  Engineering Program at Oklahoma State, and it was just getting off. It  had been in existence for maybe one or two years, so it was very early.  He visited with Mr. Nichols, my teacher, and I remember what was  profound and what had an impact on me. I was pretty confident as a  student and I was a good student. I was planning on going in business,  but like a lot of young people, I hadn   t really crystallized what I needed  or wanted to do. I just knew I needed to make decent grades and prepare  myself and I would be going to college somewhere.  They sat down and visited with me, and Mr. Mack Roosevelt said,     Sam, it   s kind of the    four for forty    theorem.       What does that mean?     He said,    Well, you give us four hard years of studying, and we   ll give  you a forty-year career back.    I said,    Well, okay, four/forty sounds like  a good deal. I like a bargain.    I thought,    I could put up with anything  for four years if you give me a long-term...    But the key thing was when  Virgil Nichols sat me down and he said,    Sam, you can do this. You can  do this.    I was a little embarrassed to say that people viewed me as a  good student and knowledgeable. I didn   t know what an engineer did.  What I knew about engineering was they drove trains. And I tell that  now because I don   t want young people to be embarrassed or afraid to  try because, like I say, honestly I didn   t know then, and I thought I was a  pretty well-read student. But his encouragement and telling me point-blank  that he knew and he believed   not only believed, he knew that I  8  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  could do that was the thing that got me over the edge. Never forgot that.  Can you tell me a little bit about the program and your personal  experiences in the Minority Engineering Program and at OSU?  Sure. I think it   s a tremendous formula for success actually. And that   s  why I think, subsequently, the Retired Educators program has been  extremely successful, because the structure of it was you bring students  together and create a sense of community amongst them where they  work together, they live in close proximity to each other, they study  together and have shared experiences. So, they are truly a class within a  class. One thing that may not give you what you want, I   m B-average,  C-minus, C-plus average, whatever, right there average, then they would  retire your debt each semester. So, you had the piece where you had  students coming together, class within a class, collaboration, teamwork,  people looking after each other. You had the summer enrichment  component that allowed them to grow into the college life. Something I  left out was advisors, and tutoring assistance was available. And then  finally you had the financial component. And to me that   s how you  enable success. You   re not giving anybody anything; you   re giving them  a hand up not a hand out. So, I think that   s why we were so successful.  You talked about some of your advisors. Were there some professors,  mentors who were influential in your academic preparation and your  success at OSU?  Oh absolutely, absolutely. I think about Dr. Joe  inaudible , a great head  of the department back then, a very positive man and always  encouraging to me. I think that, to me, involves the key thing for what  adults can do for young people. People don   t care how much you know  until they know how much you care. If we as adults notice them and  encourage them to stay the course then I think that has a profound  impact. And Dr.  inaudible  was good at that. And particularly for  minorities who already have that extra pressure and stress on them of  being somewhat isolated within some of these fields, to have professors  that say,    Hey, you can do this. Stay with it.    That helps. Ken Case     some of the guys may even still be around.  I saw Dr.  John  Nazemetz not too long ago. What was interesting about  that, he   s well known for his handlebar mustache that he had even when  I was in school. But I had worked with my sister on a business that she  has, and we used some of their students in their senior design class to do  a study for us this year. And I went up and met her, met the students for  their presentation day, and there was Dr. Nazemetz who was one of my  instructors when I was in school. Not only that, my son   s a senior in  industrial engineering at Oklahoma State now, so it was kind of a   how  9  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  do I put it? A surreal moment to find yourself with your son and thirty  years-plus passed with one of your old professors sitting there. Then you  want to ask,    How old are you, anyway?    (Laughter) But great guys, Dr.  Estes, Dr. Case. I remember the material science guy. He probably  doesn   t even remember me, but I understand he   s still teaching. Dr.  Price? Pratt? All of those guys had big impact on me.  Were there some academic highlights, honors for you at OSU that you  recall?  Well, I think I was a good student. I don   t think I was a great student. I  think I made the Dean   s Honor Roll several times there, maintained my  scholarship with them, and I was president of the Society of Black  Engineers, Technologists, and Architects, and involved in several other  organizations. I usually try to take a leadership role in things. I always  seemed to, for some reason, find myself in a situation where I felt  compelled to step up. I   ve never regretted that; I think it   s important.  I   ve always prided myself in if there   s an organization that needs some  leadership then I   m going to try to do my best to help out with that.  Did you have some favorite hangouts on campus or off campus?  (Laughs) Well, yes. I liked the Strip just like anybody else. It was a great  place on Friday and Saturday night, and I was there when the first  streaker night occurred, and that was pretty wild, let me tell you. And  I   m not sure. That may have been my senior year of high school. I   d  have to go look at the date, but living there, I found myself down there  anyway. But I   m glad I was there so I can tell the story that I saw that.  Yes, historic story, the streaker night.  Yes. But I loved to go to football games. I spent an inordinate amount of  time at the Colvin Center. I was kind of a gym rat, played a lot of  basketball. That   s one of the great things about going to college, those  types of things are available to you so you can do all of that you want.  Did you do intramural sports?  I did intramural. I played on a team that was sponsored by Farris  Jewelers, and our claim to fame was we won the intramural basketball  championship two or three years in a row. I don   t think anybody   s ever  done that before or since. I think we got the record. I think the other year  we got disqualified. There was a rule that said you could only have one  scholarship athlete and we had some guy that had played a semester, had  been on scholarship for football for a semester, so nobody knew him. He  could   ve been a swimmer for all I knew, but we had a very good team.  10  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Sam, in the time you were there, was there very much social interaction  between the black students and the white students?  I think for the social part, Jerry, we were for the most part still very  segregated as I look back on it. And, you know, we certainly had white  students who were friends and you studied with a few, and international  students that we interacted with in class and studied with. But I think  that was one of the important parts of that program was to make sure  that you didn   t get isolated, that you had a group of students who look  like you to socialize with. But as I look back on it and think about it, we  were quite segregated. People ask,    Did you have a good time?    I had a  great time. And I guess there were about 800 or 900 black students in  school then, and we had enough of a community that we had our own  lifestyle and social things, and so I honestly didn   t ever think about it  that much.  At that point, did you have any less than positive experiences with white  students?  Some of my friends did, but no, I really didn   t. Now, there were things  that were disappointing. You always get concerned sometimes about  professors and grading, but people as far as seriously negative, overtly  negative things, no I didn   t. Keeping in mind I grew up around  Stillwater, so I knew my way around. But I just didn   t.  Sounds like being in the Minority Engineering Program was helpful to  you too in terms of interacting with other students.  It was. It gave you an opportunity to interact with your professors,  having advisors and tutors available   I should   ve used the tutors more,  but I was too proud. (Laughter) But those things, having that support  system from those folks, having the financial backing and having a  community and a network so you always knew you could get access to  study partners and things like that, it makes a huge difference.  Do you feel that the OSU experience for African American students has  improved since you were a student there?  It   s difficult for me to tell. You don   t know how much I wish I could say  yes, but I think in some ways it may have regressed, and I don   t know  why. I think the things that we need to be concerned with are why we  don   t have more black faculty on staff, and not only that, but staff.  Because those are people that, again, provide mentors for the students,  people that look like them, and from a policy standpoint, a better  understanding of these students    experiences. An African American  11  Gill  Combs  student is probably 98 percent like any other student you got there, but  it   s that 2 percent or so that is different. That because of their life  experiences that sometimes just having someone in the court of appeal  that will stand in the gap makes a difference. And I think in that regard,  from a policy and practice standpoint, we can help ourselves there with  some changes, fundamentally.  Can you tell us a little bit about your career since you left Oklahoma  State University? I know you   ve had a highly successful public career,  professional career. Could you share a little bit of your journey there?  I started out, immediately out of college, I went to work for what was  then Southwestern Bell. I went into their management development  program, and it was a very challenging program where they put you in a  role of responsibility. I remember my first job was supervising a crew of  people that were responsible for installation and maintenance on what  they call private branch exchanges, or PBXs. Now we call these large  switching machines for telephones and  they are  primarily used in large  businesses. The interesting thing about it is I had no idea what they did,  (Laughs) but fortunately, my engineering background served me well.  You know, I could read a diagram. They were patient enough with me  and most, heck, all of them were older than I was. I had guys on that first  crew that had more years of service than I   d been alive, so I was  wondering,    What am I doing here?    But we kept the car out of the  ditch.  And, Jerry, that was a test of leadership. There I was, twenty-two years  old, a young, idealistic student right out of college and thrust into a  leadership role. It certainly wasn   t war time or anything but sometimes I  felt like it. It was right in the middle of the oil boom in Oklahoma, so we  had more business than we could keep up with. So, it was just a  tremendous learning experience. Some of it was very difficult and some  of it I would never want to go through again. You   re tested but you learn  how to lead that way. I worked for them for a number of years, and then  as Ma Bell went through divestiture and was broken up into the different  Bell companies, I went with AT T, which was the non-regulated spin-off  from the regulated venture. I worked another couple of years with  them before I moved on.  From there I landed at Oklahoma Natural Gas Company. I had worked  for Oklahoma Natural one summer, and so when I decided to make the  move, that was one of the companies that I sent my resume to. And they  responded. I ended up having lunch with a guy who when I worked there  that summer was a staff engineer or district engineer type. He ended up  being the vice president of operations. The other fellow was a young up-and-  coming executive at the company by the name of Larry Brummet  12  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  who eventually ended up being the CEO of ONEOK. And Larry  Brummet and Jim Garrett, both of those guys, we had lunch and they  said,    Okay, let   s give it a try,    and we agreed that I would come to  work here. It   s been a great relationship. I   ve been here twenty-five  years now. The thing about Oklahoma Natural, who is a legacy company  of ONEOK, it   s just an uncommon type of people and culture within that  company. I was just tremendously blessed to be a part of that, and they  took me under their wing and taught me the way.  And you   re being a little bit modest. I mean, you moved up the ranks to  president as I recall.  President of Oklahoma Natural Gas and then I held a number of  engineering positions along the way and operations for us. I worked in  the industrial marketing area before then, for a while. I sit in a number of  chairs. And that   s something that, again, for young people, the road to  careers is not always straight up. I tell mine often that the only thing that  goes straight up is a rocket, and you know what happens to it at the end  of the deal. So, most of us take circuitous paths. But I went into and  have tried to maintain a spirit of openness, that I wanted to learn, I  wanted to get better. I was willing to take feedback, hear the hard things  from people. Even if people are being critical and even if it   s not  intended to be the best for you, it   s all about who you are and knowing  who you are and being able to take the good and the bad, but more than  anything, learning from your experiences. That was always my thing. Be  open, which caused me to attract good experiences, good and all types of  experiences, and then being willing to extract the positive and learn from  whatever experience and whatever role I was in and then adapt to that  and grow from it.  How many years were you at ONG before you moved to the corporate  office here in Tulsa?  Let   s see. I haven   t thought about it like that. I took this job in February  2005. Prior to that I was president of Oklahoma Natural, so that was for  twenty-one years there.  And what is your current title?  The title is President of ONEOK Distribution Companies, distribution  being the utility segment of ONEOK. And we have, within that,  divisions in Oklahoma which you   re familiar with: Oklahoma Natural  Gas Company, which is the largest gas utility in the state of Oklahoma;  and then ONEOK owns Kansas Gas Service, which is the largest gas  utility in Kansas; and then finally Texas Gas Service, which is the third  largest gas utility in that state. We have over two million customers and  13  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  approximately 3,000 employees at work in this segment of our business.  Revenues last year exceeded  2 billion, approached  3 billion actually.  Asset base is in the  3 billion range, so it   s a sizable operation  with  a  lot of great people whose whole purpose and mission is about delivering  reliable natural gas service to our customers in those three states.  What accomplishments and special recognition in your career have  given you the most satisfaction?  Jerry, I   m not really big on awards and notoriety. I appreciate them and  I   ve got many firsts in my lifetime. I haven   t really even sat down to  think back on those things. I   ve been too busy working. One of the  things I always say to people   and I appreciate one of my co-workers  that maybe picked up on the essence of my personality when they gave  me a couple Christmases ago a table book titled Work. It   s a pictorial  accounting of people across the planet going about their daily work.  Living their lives and doing their work, from working in a rice paddy  field to fisherman in Indonesia to a construction worker in Chicago.  Sometimes the joy and the reward is in the work. I tell people,    Find  something that you enjoy doing, something that you have a passion for,  and go do it. And do it well.    Oftentimes what I see is people are  looking for something that   s not there. They   re working in a job that  they   re not happy with or a role they   re miserable in because maybe the  money   s good and this and that, just all the wrong reasons. So, I   d say  that to you, that sometimes the joy and the satisfaction is in the work  itself in a job well done. And so if we can get there, that   s a big part. The  other thing, I did have a couple of things on the list that I thought were  pretty neat. I made the Black Enterprise magazine   s list of black  corporate executives,  top  seventy-five and that was back in 2005, tops.  And then most recently they updated their list and it   s the top 100. And I  guess     Top 100 most influential businessmen in America.  Yes, in America. Thank you very much. And I think that was   it   s not  anything that I had to have or anything, but it was nice because I   ve  always admired   when I grew up, early in my career or when I was in  school even, I used to get that magazine, and I always knew I wanted to  work in corporate America. I saw people in there who were kind of role  models for me that had been successful, that have pioneered space in  corporate America, had been very successful in making it to the  executive ranks, into the C suite of large companies. Just reading about  their stories was inspirational to me. I never thought I would be in that  position, but it   s certainly something that once they notified me I said,     Hey, that   s pretty neat.    Because of that experience I know that there   s  probably some college student out there that aspires to make it in  14  Gill  Combs  corporate America and they might look at my story.  Have there been some highlights your company has done that you look  back in your career, breakthroughs you had, things you did that were  special to you?  Well, one of the biggest motivators for me is winning as being part of a  team, winning as a team. A lot of people go through life without ever or  very few times in their life getting to feel what it   s like to win. I think  winning   s always better if you can share it with others, and you know  from your sports days and being an athlete how that feels. So, I   ve kind  of taken that athletic background to corporate environment and have a  great desire when I work with our team and our group to let the  workforce and the people who work with me experience what it   s like to  win as a team. And we   ve won a lot obviously. We   ve done well. We   ve  always exceeded expectations in terms of delivering values to the  company, and we   ve been through many years of consolidations and  business cycles and things where we   ve had to manage and lead our  business from difficult circumstances and yet be successful.  The last four years, we   ve had four record years in a row at ONEOK.  We   ve created an additional almost  1 billion in enterprise value within  our segment alone, and it   s the result of, I believe, good people  committing themselves to a strategy and then working diligently on that  strategy. For us who are placed in a leadership role, we have to  understand that there are two things going on here that makes for the  successful results, and I always tell people results matter. You know,  results matter. At the end of the day, if you   re in the corporate game,  results matter. Business is about results, so I can   t stress that enough.  That   s also what makes it intoxicating, but you also have to have fun.  Sometimes people get to work and they   re going,    Argh.    You can have  fun. It   s okay to have fun, but there   s a lot more fun if you   re winning, if  you   re getting results.  So, there   s two factors. I believe strategy is oversold, but I tell people  about strategy. You   ve got to have one. I don   t know if you   re going to  walk the ball up the court or you   re going to run it up the court, but you  know, you can win with both. You   ve got to know you got a strategy  because sometimes even if you don   t have a strategy, that   s a strategy  because then your strategy is,    I don   t have a strategy.    Okay. And I see  that sometimes. But beyond that strategy, leadership and management,  they   re not the same two things. I see a lot of people who are good  managers and they just grind, grind, grind, grind away. But to get to the  top of the mountain, you need leadership. You   ve got to have it, but you  have to have both to be the best. I hope that helps.  15  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  It does. Sam, kind of changing this a little bit, could you talk about some  of your involvement and engagement with community, service groups,  church? Can you share a little bit about some of the organizations  you   ve worked with and some of the things you   ve done?  Absolutely. For years I was involved with the YMCA structure around  the state, and as I moved around in my job, I recall Rita and I moved  about eight times in twelve years, and I always was a Y member, so I  finally figured out I might as well be on the board. I   ve worked a lot  with the United Way over the years. As I mentioned earlier, the Retired  Educators. I   ve chaired the Urban League; I consider myself an Urban  Leaguer for life. That Oklahoma City affiliate by the way, we had some  tremendous success there in growing that affiliate, and I think they just  have continued to do a great job. I worked with Leadership Oklahoma  for many years on their board. I was president of that organization. As  you know, I spent many years working with the Oklahoma State Alumni  Association and their board, my way of giving back to our university.  I was proud of my affiliation with Oklahoma City Chamber. And just  about every community I   ve ever lived in I always   you know, Tulsa   I  chaired their Step Up Tulsa initiative which is kind of a community  economic development effort to get things regenerated in Tulsa. I   m  serving currently on the Governor   s Edge policy board, and it   s the  board that manages a fund that is anticipated one of these days to be a  1  billion research investment type fund to drive economic development in  Oklahoma from a research and technology standpoint. Currently,  though, it   s about at  150 million fund, so we wait for the legislature  over time to appropriate money to that, still a very good effort. So, I  think those that can, should. If you have some ability, talent   public  school foundations, I   ve been involved with those. I lose count of so  many things, but great, great things where you can make a difference in  your community, and just about everybody can do something.  What about your family? I know you   ve invested a lot of yourself into  your family. Can you talk to us a little bit about that?  Yes, I   d love to. Married for twenty-eight years to a great lady, Rita  Combs. Her maiden name is Rita Moore. She   s been my partner for     forever, our families knew each other. Our parents went to school  together to a black public school there in Bristow, and she says we were  crib babies. I don   t believe that, but I   m not going to go that far, but we  certainly have been close. We have three wonderful children. I   m very  proud of them. They   ve done extremely well in school and have good  careers going and are making themselves productive citizens. They   re all  young adults. My oldest is a girl, Erica. She lives in Dallas, is working  in corporate America. My oldest son, Samuel Eric, is the middle child  16  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  and he works in corporate America at Dell Computer. I can brag on my  kids. I have to be careful here, you know. My daughter   s got two  degrees, my son   s a computer engineer, and the youngest is still at  Oklahoma State. He   s got a bright future ahead of him. He   s kind of  entrepreneurial but he   s already got a job lined up in the corporate arena.  Did all the kids get degrees from OSU?  The youngest one was the one that stayed in-state. The other two went  out of state. My daughter went to a historically black university called  Hampton, which Booker T. Washington was a graduate there. It   s out on  the east coast in Norfolk, Virginia. And then my oldest son went to  Washington University at St. Louis, a very good school too, both of  those private schools. But the youngest one, he was the smartest one of  the bunch. He went to good old Oklahoma State University.  To get an engineering degree, decided to go to Oklahoma State.  That   s right, and get the same degree as his dad.  Well, Sam you were talking about some of your involvements. You  alluded to the Alumni Association. I   d like to take a couple of minutes, if  you don   t mind, and talk to you about that.  Sure.  You   ve maintained close ties with Oklahoma State University, obviously,  through the years, through the College of Engineering and through the  Alumni Association particularly as well as some other things. You were  a charter member of the OSU Black Alumni Association.  Right.  You were charter member and also served as president I will say, and  have really been a driving force of that organization. Can you tell me  about the inception of the Black Alumni Association and its goals and  activities?  Well, actually, I have to tell you, I wasn   t a charter member. I was a  long-term member, but there were some other people that chartered that  organization. And, you know, goals are about promoting African  American well-being on that campus and helping Oklahoma State to  grow in its diversity mission. And we   ve had a lot of successes over the  years. One of the things we   re most proud of is the beginning of the  scholarship fund that   s provided scholarships to I think we   re  approaching 130 students over the years. And, as I mentioned earlier,  17  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  that   s about the retention of students, because obviously when you lose a  student who   s an upperclassman, that   s just a travesty because they   ve  already gotten through the early part and gotten off to a good start. We  need them to finish. We shouldn   t let money be a barrier. Another  objective is to help increase the number of black faculty and staff on  campus. And the third objective is to be role models and mentors for  those students. And then a fourth would be to be an advisor to the  executive ranks of Oklahoma State and make ourselves available to the  offices of the university.  Some individuals question the need for a Black Alumni Association  that   s even under the umbrella of the Alumni Association, which it is.  What   s your response to that, Sam?  Well, I think until this country has resolved its issues on race, there is  still a need for it. Because of some of my comments earlier, people have  a tendency to gravitate towards comfort, and I don   t believe people  should view that if you have a black organization that that   s an  indictment of a majority organization. I think the two can coexist, and  we encourage our students to be involved with both. But when you are a  minority, I think we have to recognize the unique position that  minorities find themselves in and that is of being a minority.  It   s kind of an ever-present being. It   s sort of like   how would I liken it  to? If you were to take something to the depths of the ocean, and the  deeper you go the more pressure is on it. So, if it was an object, then at  some point you could crush it just from the external pressures. So, it   s  not that the ocean means to do that; it   s just the overriding weight, force  of that mass on that object. So, being alone and isolated may not seem  like it   s that much of an issue, but it certainly helps if students have an  environment where they can celebrate their differences as we continue to  grow as a country. And I look forward to the day when we say these  types of organizations aren   t needed, but I think in the interim, as we  transition to that, having those bridges and those safe places where  people can have comfort makes sense.  Some African American alumni, when asked to participate ,if you recall  some of the early years in the Alumni Association, shared that their OSU  experiences had not always been as affirming and as positive as they   d  have liked. And I recall at one meeting, Sam, you telling them bluntly,  quote,    Get over it.     Get over it.  Can you elaborate on your response?  18  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Yes because I think this is the other side of the position I just took,  which said that there   s still a tremendous need for this type of  organization on the campus. The other side of it is that we all need to  assimilate and integrate. It needs to go both ways, African Americans.  And I admit, some of our people are the toughest in this regard.  Candidly, they have had some bad experiences, but the thing is, we   re  never going to get better, we   re never going to move this country  forward if someone doesn   t make the move. So, I think it   s a mark of  strength if people who feel they   ve been wronged can put it behind them  and move forward because they   re standing on broad shoulders. There  are others who have done that. I think that   s a compelling thing for other  people and an example for other people when they see you put those  issues behind, move forward, and it also teaches and models for the  younger people who would follow you. So, you   re absolutely right.  That   s the other side of it is we need the organization. Let   s have that  level of comfort that it provides, but at the same time, we all need to get  over this. We need to move forward.  I recall some of your add-on comments to that were,    It   s our university  and we   ve got to move forward and make it better for the ones that  follow us.     Yes, I always tell people that this is my university, and I feel like I   m  entitled to everything that   s available at this university and that it offers.  I   m a part of it, and I tend to and have always availed myself of  everything that is there. So, I think it   s important for us as African  Americans who have passed through to claim it. It   s our right, and we  teach these, and the important piece of this now is that we have to try do  things that will change the landscape so that the students that come  along behind us   if one of us has had a negative experience, we sure as  heck don   t want twenty years down the road some student having that  same issue again. That   s incumbent upon us to change that landscape.  Maybe we can talk a little bit about the Alumni Association. You were on  the board of directors of the Alumni Association for several years. You  served as national president of the organization.  I think I was the first African American to do that.  You absolutely were, and I   m proud that I got to serve with you, Sam. It  was great. In your mind, think back a little bit. How important is a  strong self-governed alumni association for the university?  I think it   s hugely important. Hugely important. The university needs  those advocates. It needs a strong alumni base. It needs the  independence of thought that comes with having an alumni association  19  Gill  Combs  Gill  that is there because people want to volunteer their time and their talents  to the University, not because they   re employed by the University.  There   s a different type of spirit that comes from that, their love for all  things orange and Oklahoma State in there which has to do with their  connection and their life experiences of being a student there or faculty  member, so I think what it offers the university in terms of independence  of thought, volunteer spirit, a reservoir of talent, is hugely important to  the future growth prospects of any university. You show me a university  with a great alumni association, I   ll show you a great university.  Can you share some of the programs, goals, accomplishments, of the  Alumni Association during the times you were in leadership?  Sure. One of the things that I was proud of was that we grew the staff, in  a way, in the programming area. I thought that was important in that     well, actually in all of our program areas, we not only grew our staff, we  grew our resources. One of the key things that I wanted to focus on  when I got there was the actual programs because I said,    The Alumni  Association is of the people, by the people, for the people.    So, we could  do a lot of things, but ultimately, if we   re not providing the type of  services and providing those connections that our members value, then  why are we doing this? So, I can   t say that I can single out any one  programming area. I think if we go back and look at the record, we grew  our membership well that year. We strengthened our Hall of Fame. I  think that across the board, that was an area that when you and I were  working together, that we got better at programming. We put more focus  on it. And the thing about being a chair for a year, you are actually just  holding the seat for the next person, so it   s like a baton in a relay.  Sometimes when you receive the baton, it   s your job to take it and carry  it to the next level and make sure it   s in good shape to give it to the next  person.  But I think that my mark there was ensuring that we did build across the  board and strengthen all our programming, and I think we   re better for it  today. It was hugely rewarding. I learned a lot, and I   m a guy that likes  to be in situations where I learn, and I always wanted to do a good job  for the university. So, I felt the pressure and the need in that role that  year to live up to my part of the bargain, per se, but it was tremendously  rewarding. You got to meet a lot of neat people. I got to interact with  students and faculty. And people, even today, they recognize me for that  tenure there because they recognize that you   re doing things in the best  spirit. You   re doing it as a volunteer for someone else, and that altruistic  behavior is one that we all should try to model and do. It was a year that  I gained more than I think the association gained.  In what ways do you see alumni being advocates for the university?  20  Combs  Gill  Combs  What kinds of things can they do and did you see them doing during  your time on the board?  Let   s take an area like recruitment of students. Well, what better way for  an alum to be a role model, demonstrate character, demonstrate the  values that the university espouses, but good values that you should have  in your life anyway, being active in your community where people know  you as a community servant or a good citizen. You may not be able to  go and serve on boards or trusts or do some of those things, but you  might be a good citizen and a good church member. If people know  you   re an Oklahoma State graduate, that promotes your university  because people get to see these are the types of people that come from  that university.  You can be active in your schools and assist through our alumni  chapter   s organizations with career days and other types of formal  events, but then the not so formal, just advocating in every possible way  around your children   s schools or the schools in your community about  Oklahoma State University. And being a connector to bring that when  we see students out there in your community or in your school district  that are potential Oklahoma State enrollees, kind of helping to clear the  way to make sure that they   re connected to the right officials at the  university for recruitment purposes. That   s just one area.  Legislatively we all are part of the political system, and there   s an old  saying that all politics are local, so what better way, in addition to  attracting young talent and young students, than to work and advocate  for your university, not as a paid lobbyist or anything like that, but  someone who is truly passionate and loves their university. Nobody can  tell that story better than us who attended there to our political  operatives so that they can understand the need for strong educational  institutions, and they hear it from you and that to me comes with a lot of  conviction. So, those are just two ways, but, I mean, it   s just endless.  And you mentioned really, in terms of being an ambassador, of course  you   re saying good things about OSU, being a good example for OSU is  important as well to just lift it up in public.  That   s exactly right. I think that   s part of. Again, I talk about the  obligation to give back. You know, we get these wonderful degrees, and  you find that whenever people introduce themselves or if you see their  bio or if you learn anything, you know if they   re a college graduate. One  of the things that   s going to come out fairly quickly is,    Where   d you go  to school?       Well, I went to Oklahoma State University.    And I see  people proudly announce their degree. That becomes a part of their  persona throughout their lives, but someone prior to us arriving did a lot  21  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  of work to make sure that structure was there to attend that school, to get  that degree.  Is that part of that four and forty that Virgil talked to you about?  That   s from that four and forty. It becomes a lifetime is what it does.  Sam, are you excited about the direction the university is going under  President Hargis    leadership?  Absolutely. I   ve known President Hargis throughout the years and I  think he   s the right man at the right time. And I   m very pleased, God  bless him, for the work he   s doing. I think our university   s on a  wonderful path, just an incredible trajectory, right now. There   s a lot of  spirit, even in a down economy. I don   t think that   s going to dampen us  at all. We   re working on our enrollment, which is the lifeblood of the  university. Our Alumni Association is strong. I read all the time about  academic accomplishments and awards that our students and our faculty  are getting. Our research is improving, dollars are coming in, and, more  than anything, when you have great momentum, in order to keep that  going, you need a good sound strategy. And people have to believe in  that strategy, but you need leadership. You   ve got to have committed  leadership. I think what President Hargis does is he provides that at a  very critical time, so I think the future for this university is incredible.  What about the twenty-five-year campus Master Plan for the Stillwater  campus, the  700 million-plus or so? What do you think about that?  Well, you know, sometimes people think,    Rome wasn   t built in a day.     But it does get built, and I   d like to see them expand it even more.  You   ve got to dream big dreams, and we will be successful. We   ll get it  done. This economy will pass.  Reflecting for a minute, if you will, are there things that you remember  most about your OSU experiences, first as a student and then as an  alumnus? Are there some events or highlights that stand out in your  mind?  Sure. Well, some of the events were getting to watch Barry Sanders  play. I remember President Bush came to our campus; that was exciting.  I think about beating OU. Rashaun Woods is still running. That was a lot  of fun. And I think about all the great basketball wins I   ve seen in  Gallagher-Iba. I think about the nights we   d study late as friends in the  library, kind of joking and stuff, and close the place down. And I told  this before, where I could remember walking out of there many a night,  and they used to have the flags on the north side of that library, and I   d  22  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  always hear the ropes and the rings from that. They   d clang against those  poles. That always stuck in my mind; don   t ask me why. But I guess it  was a quiet thing. But more than anything, Jerry, like yourself, I   m sure I  can speak for a lot of alums, I remember the relationships. Doesn   t get  any better because you   re forever young there and you   ve got your  whole community within a small area. And it   s great living. It   s as good  as it gets I think.  A special time in your life, isn   t it?  It   s an incredible time of our lives.  Sam, you   ve accomplished much in your life and I   ll say that. I know you  wouldn   t.  Thank you.  With more ahead of you, hopefully, how do you hope people will  remember Sam Combs?  Wow. That   s a   I don   t know, Jerry. Someone told me once that the  mark of a successful man is a person who has the love of small children  and the respect of honorable men, and I always tried to understand what  that meant. It sounded pretty cool, but I couldn   t really quite understand.  And I guess the part   I think I get the respect of honorable men. The  love of small children has something to do with your soul, I believe,  because children are attracted to people who are open and there   s a  pureness about them. They   re non-threatening; kids want to come to  them. So, I hope that when it   s said, that maybe it can be rolled up into,     He tried and he cared,    and if the people think that, then that   s good  enough for me.  Sam, there are so many things we could   ve talked about and asked. I  mean, help me. What else would you like to talk about? Are there some  things you   d like to comment on that we   ve maybe not covered?  Well, I   m a guy that   s got a lot of philosophies on life and things like  that, but we   ve covered a lot of ground. I think you   re doing a great job.  I think we have to think about the state of education in Oklahoma. I  mean, we have a tremendous spirit about us in the state. It   s just a  certain western pioneer (whatever you   d call it) type of deal. It  permeates the state, but I think we   ve in some regards failed the  citizenry with respect to education. We   ve got to do a better job. We   ve  got to do a better job in primary and secondary education, got to create  an environment where people want to go to school, they don   t drop out.  We cannot lose all of this good talent. So, I think with these institutions  23  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  Combs  Gill  like Oklahoma State and others that we have to find a way to not  intimidate. Those buildings have to be friendlier. We have to be more  inviting, if that makes sense to you, so that people want to come and  pursue higher learning.  Because, Jerry, as I   ve looked at it over and over, and people used to     old-timers, my parents and relatives who influenced me, they   d always  say to me,    Boy, education is the key.    I heard it over and over, and I   m  sure you heard it over and over again. Education is the key, and I  searched over the years for what is that common denominator, that  single determinant that improves people   s lives. And you go around, but  when you get back to it, there   s nothing better than education. You  know, if they become educated then the world of opportunity opens up,  and then it   s just a matter of all of the stick-to-it-ness, things like that,  dedication and character that goes with it. But without that education,  living in ignorance is a terrible thing. So, the question gets to be,    What  can we do, and are we doing all that we can to create an environment  where education is the norm?    People expect it in this state so maybe  this goes beyond what we   re talking about with my situation, but I  certainly believe for the university it   s a compelling issue and question  for us.  We   ve got to get more degrees in the state of Oklahoma, don   t we?  We have to. We have to. That   s the only way we   re really going to  improve the base of our state, people   s lives. More of them educated,  more going out, a better workforce, more opportunity for them, whether  they   re entrepreneurs or employed. That drives down these social ills of  teenage pregnancy, incarceration, things like that, drugs. All the social  ills come primarily from people that don   t have an educated background.  Remember the bumper sticker on the back of cars that said,    If you think  education is expensive, try ignorance   ?  (Laughter) Yes.  If you think about it, there   s a lot to that.  Yes, yes that   s right.  And I think it   s part of what you   re saying.  That   s exactly right. It   s dogged us long enough. I know Oklahoma State  is part of the solution. It   s got to be.  I appreciate it. Anything else?  24  Combs Nope. I   m good.  -------  ------
