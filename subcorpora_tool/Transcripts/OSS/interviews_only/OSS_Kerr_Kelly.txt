 Neurohr  Today is Friday, March 6, 2009 and I   m at OSU-Okmulgee. My name is  Karen Neurohr. I   m a librarian with the Oklahoma State University  Library in Stillwater, and I   m here today to interview Kelly Kerr. Kelly,  thank you for letting us interview you today for this project.  It   s my pleasure.  Would you tell me a little bit about yourself?  Absolutely. Should I start from the very beginning or how far back do  you want to go?  Sure. Tell me a little bit about your family.  I was born and raised in Ada, Oklahoma   long-time family established  in that area. We were a family that had a pretty strong hold in the oil and  gas industry there, starting with my grandfather in the    40s.  And who was your grandfather?  My grandfather was Robert H. Kerr   not Robert S. Kerr, but Robert H.  Kerr. He was a very mechanically-minded man and made oil and gas  pumps for the oil industry, and that business took us into the mid    90s.  My dad took it over in the    60s and then it lasted until the    90s. Finally  my dad retired and upon his retirement we sold the business. Probably a  good thing, looking at the economy. It survived a lot of ups and downs  but it was a family business. I worked there. My brother worked there,  my uncle, and then my grandfather started it, but my dad kind of ran the  show. He was the guy that made it all happen.  So is your family related to      5  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  We are not, oddly enough. We are all from that same area, but no  relation to Senator Kerr or any of the Kerrs on that side.  Do a lot of people think that you   re related?  Yes, absolutely. I get that every day. They go,    Oh, yeah, we know  you.    I don   t even fight it anymore. I just say,    Yes, yes. That   s us.     Well, after you graduated high school in Ada, then you did what?  I planned on attending Oklahoma State University, and there was no  magic formula for that. My brother was attending Oklahoma State at the  time so I thought that would be a pretty nice thing to do, to follow in his  footsteps, but my deciding factor for becoming a Cowboy was that  Oklahoma State was farther away from Ada than OU was. I figured if I  could get farther away from home and still stay in-state, that I   d kind of  accomplished my goal. But looking back on it now, I fell in love with  the university from my first semester there. I bleed orange and black.  I   m a Cowboy and I   m not shy about telling it around here. So they have  to hear that every once in awhile.  When you were in high school, did you do the campus tours and the  kinds of things that high school students today typically do?  No, I really didn   t. I   d been to Stillwater and been to Oklahoma State to  visit my brother several times. My brother was married in college, so I  would go and stay with him and his wife on occasion. I was very  familiar with the OU campus since Ada and Norman are about 40 miles  apart. So I was familiar with both campuses. It was just one of those  things that I always kind of root for the underdog. Especially  being  in  southern Oklahoma, OU is huge. It   s huge everywhere, but it   s huge  down there. So I thought,    I want to go to someplace that not everyone is  going to.    I would say my graduating class in high school, there were  probably five of us that went to OSU and there were probably 20 or  more that went to OU. So I was always kind of the guy that wanted to  run on the outside, and that was a contributing factor for me getting to  Stillwater.  Besides your brother, do you have other family members who went to  OSU?  Do not. My dad was actually the first member of our family to go to  college, and he attended the University of Arkansas which is a story  within itself, but he did it on a baseball scholarship. He   s a Razorback  and he really enjoyed Fayetteville, but he came home. He had an  opportunity to play a little bit of professional baseball out of college, but  6  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  in those days you could make more money working in the family  business than you could by playing professional sports, so that pretty  much was a deciding factor. I think an injury also contributed, but he  went back home. Then, when it came time for my brother and me to go  off to school, then Stillwater was our choice.  What was your major when you were in college?  Well, I kind of took the middle-of-the-road approach, and I went into  business administration. The thinking was that I would go home to Ada  and work in the family business. I thought that   s what I was gonna do  and was destined to do. But my first semester on campus a guy came up  and approached me with a camera and he said,    Can I ask you a  question?    and I said,    Sure. That   d be great.    It was kind of a man-on-the-  street type thing that the The Daily O   Collegian used to do. They  would ask you a question   kind of a topic of the day   and then you  would give your answer and they   d take your mug shot and  put under  the shot     Freshman, Ada, Oklahoma.     They asked me if the basketball coach  Paul Hansen  at the time should  be fired. This is pre-Eddie Sutton days, and of course I said,    Oh, yeah.  Let   s get rid of him.    You   re 17 years old out away from home and  you   re a smart-aleck. (I   m still a smart-aleck.) But I was really then.  After we got through, I asked him,    How do you do this? How do you  get to do this here?    Photography was barely a hobby of mine at the  time. He said,    Well, if you   ll come down with me and we   ll go down to  the basement of the Paul Miller Building to the The O   Colly office, we   ll  go down there and we   ll get you fixed up.     I go down and it was kind of a hustle and bustle of people and things and  it really caught my attention, looked like a lot of fun and so I said,    Hey,  I like to take pictures,    and they said,    Okay, here   s two rolls of film. Go  use that up.    Probably 10 rolls of film later I got a picture published in  The O   Colly and it was just a picture of a sign. That was my first  published picture ever, was just a picture of a door sign, hanging on a  door, and that   s how it all started. That was the very beginning.  What did it say?  I can   t even remember and it was actually something about the  basketball coach. It was something      We love Coach Hansen    or  whoever was coach   I can   t remember now who was there, but that  really kicked it all off for me and I had the bug and it still lasts to this  very day.  So did you stay in business administration?  7  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  I did. It was funny. I studied in the business school, but I spent all my  time in the journalism building. I was in The O   Colly office anytime I  wasn   t in class or was running around campus with a camera, and I  absolutely loved it. I just couldn   t get enough of it. Just to take pictures  and have them published and then we tore the paper up and started over  the next day. There was something about that I really loved, and it was a  lot of fun. I was young and I was able to buy some equipment and enjoy  what I was doing, and I probably should have spent more time studying,  but I was having too much fun taking pictures. And we had a really,  really talented group of young people in The O   Colly at that time, some  that I still worked with until the time I left The Tulsa World. There was a  group of us that kind of stayed together as a cohesive unit and that made  it really fun. We always kind of would see what we could come up with  as far as the newspaper and we had a quality product. We had an advisor  named Jack Lancaster who just recently retired who cared about what  we did and was not only our mentor but our friend and that made a big  impact on me. He showed me that newspaper work could be fun but yet  it could be rewarding at the same time.  Did you have thoughts that you might move in that direction career-wise?  Actually, it   s so funny because I was so ensconced in the newspaper   I  was the photography editor for three, four or five semesters, something  like that. I was really involved, not only on a shooting basis but making  decisions about the content of the paper. So I was really into it and to me  it was just something I was doing at the time. I didn   t think of it as a  career until my senior year and I thought,    Maybe I would rather do this  than go home and work in the family business and sit behind a desk.  This is more me.    I sat down with my dad and I said,    Here   s what I   m  thinking,    and he said,    Well, you   re not gonna start over,    and I said,     Okay, fine.    Since he was kind of paying the ticket for the thing, he  said,    Why don   t you go ahead and finish your degree and do what  you   ve got to do.    He   s a smart man because if I look back at the people  I worked with, the degrees were all over the place. I guess we   ll get to it  later, but I spent most of my career at The Tulsa World, and the degrees  in the newsroom ran from psychology to English to business. It ran the  gamut. So at the end of the day, I got my degree and that   s something I  can surely hang my hat on, but I had the piece of paper showing that I  did do the work, but I actually got the training at The O   Colly. That   s  how I cut my teeth.  That   s great to hear about. I   m sure students today would love to hear  that story. What classes or professors stand out in your memory, if any  do in particular?  8  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Funny you should ask that. I go back to Jack. Jack was always a friend  and he took interest in what we were doing and made it fun. He cared  about what we were doing and he still does. He keeps up with all the  students and all of his students all over the world. Wherever they   re  working in journalism, he stays in touch with them. He   s very proud of  their work, and he showed that he cared and he was a big influence on  me. Then, I always remember in the business school I don   t remember  much but I remember a professor named Jim  James M.  Jackman, who  was a business law teacher. As I look back on it now, I can understand  why I enjoyed his class so much because it   s very similar to what we do  here at OSU-IT. He came right out of the business world. He was an  attorney in Oklahoma City, and retired, needed something to do, got a  job at OSU teaching business law. What he would do is he would take  these cases and he would tell us about real life cases that he was  involved in his career. So we didn   t get it out of a book, but we actually  got it from his experience. I got so much more out of that than so many  other classes, and he made it fun, too, because he was always kind of a  big kid anyway. I saw him at Eskimo Joe   s just about as often as I saw  him in the classroom. He was fun because it was genuine. It wasn   t just  something. It wasn   t formulas and words. I mean, it was actual real-life  experience, and that   s essentially what we do here. I take my experience  as a photographer and I pass it on to my students and that   s how they  learn.  You mentioned what you do here so we   re gonna sidetrack here just a  second and talk about that for a minute.  Absolutely. I spent the last 14 years at The Tulsa World as a  photographer, had a great career at The Tulsa World. A little over a year  ago now, OSU Institute of Technology in Okmulgee called and said,     Would you be interested in teaching photography?    I said,    Well, I   m  not a teacher. I   m a photographer.    And they said,    Yeah. That   s what  we   re looking for.    I said,    Oh, interesting. Let me come down and we   ll  talk.    I came down actually several times and talked to them just to  figure out if this is what I wanted to do because I   d never done anything  but take pictures since the time I left Stillwater. Sure enough I thought  this may be a great avenue for me to kind of ride off into the sunset as  far as newspaper goes. I had done the book and the book had just come  out. As a matter of fact, came out the week that I transitioned down here  so it was like right on the nose   and it   s just fit me like a glove. I   ve just  enjoyed the students and I enjoy the campus. Like I mentioned before,  the technical school is a little different animal in the fact that we are  teaching real-life experience and we   re giving these kids the skill sets to  leave here and go right into the workforce and we don   t have any time to  beat around the bush. We have to give them exactly what they need right  now, and I   m equipped to do that. I came right out of industry and I have  9  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  a really good pulse on what   s going on in industry and I hand that to  them and they take it and go with it.  How long are they usually here?  It   s seven semesters so it   s a little over two years. It   s like two and a half  years. It   s two years and a summer, and so it goes really fast and some of  them don   t get that when they get here. They think   as a young person  time drags but as an older person time flies and so I tell them,    Your  time here is not long so make the most of it.    They get a lot of stuff in  two years. Our program is at 88 hours and a bachelor   s is 120   so  they   re getting a lot of information really fast and they have to process it  and try to figure out what they want to do within that time. It   s really  unlike any other photo school anywhere I   ve ever seen. Usually other  photo schools, whether they be four-year or two-year, you either get one  thing or another and you have to pick. Ours, we just really slam-dunk  these kids into photography and they have to kind of figure it out and it  works. It   s a good formula, and I   ve enjoyed it and I   ve tried to bring my  experience and my outlook on photography down here and give the  kids   I   m kind of crazy anyway and some of the things I shoot on the  side besides photography   I don   t really consider myself a  photojournalist. I just consider myself a photographer, and I spend most  of my time shooting music bands and things of that nature. So the kids  really enjoy that and the fact that they can get on MySpace or Facebook  and find me and see my work. They really get a kick out of that, and  that   s fun for me because it keeps me young. It keeps me energetic and I  have to keep up with them and they have to keep up with me and it   s a  lot of fun.  Do you have a range of ages of students?  Absolutely. That   s another unique thing about our school is probably  half the class are non-traditional students so I   ll have half the class 18  year olds right out of high school and then I   ll have another half that  runs the gamut. I   ve had 40 year old moms. In my second semester class  now, I have a mother of three. She is extremely focused. She   s waited to  come to school and now this is her opportunity and you   d better stay out  of the way because she   s coming through and it works because her work  is fantastic. She   s very focused. I have guys that are  in their  early 30   s.  Have got a guy  who  used to manage a restaurant in Tulsa and decided  he wanted to give that up and come chase his passion so he came here  and we   re helping him do that   but again,  a  very focused young man.  He knows what he wants and we   re gonna give it to him, and I look back  at when I was 19, 20 years old in Stillwater and then what these guys are  coming out of our school with, and they   re miles down the road as far as  technical experience. It   s really impressive to see some of the work that  10  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  they do.  Speaking of comparing your experience to the students of today,  everything   s changed so much      Well, everything   s changed since last week.  From film and      Yes. You know, I will probably be the last generation of film-trained  photographers. So that does play a part in it, and one thing that I did  notice when I got here   one of the main things I saw was that the  students down here were still using film and that   s okay. But we   re a  two-year school and we don   t have enough time to    If we were a four-year  school, that would be a different story  where  we could dive into  some film and do some different things. But in the workforce, film is  gone, everywhere   National Geographic, Sports Illustrated   it   s gone.   At the  Tulsa World between 1994 and 1995 we did away with film  completely. Most of the students I teach today were kindergartners when  we gave up film. So I wanted these kids to have at least two years of  digital experience. They have to before they get out of here because  that   s really where it is.  Now the world that I live in which is editorial photography has flipped  one more time. Now editorial photographers are made to shoot video,  record sound, put together multimedia packages. Now Canon and Nikon  both have digital cameras that shoot HD video and stills simultaneously,  so you just push one button, you   re shooting video. You push another,  you   re shooting stills. So everything is changed, and we have to change,  too. If we are who we say we are and we want to give these kids the skill  sets they need to succeed, then we have to teach that and that   s a  challenge in itself to keep up with industry, but we have to do it.  So how do you keep up?  Well, I use my friends and all the contacts I   ve made over the years. I  spend hours on the phone talking to them, seeing what they   re doing,  and most of their work is online so I spend a lot of time online looking  and watching, and then I want to do it, too. That   s the great thing is I get  to do it as well. So that   s the fun part. Earlier today I was editing video  and it   s just part of my job. That   s what I do.  This is great. I can tell you certainly have a passion      I do have a passion, yeah.  11  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  That   s wonderful. Okay, let   s backtrack to the    80s      Oh, no.      and your time in Stillwater. (Laughter) Where did you live when you  were in school there?  Where did I live? I lived a couple of places. The first year I lived in Kerr  Dorms so I was Kelly Kerr, lived in the Kerr Dorms   lived on the 10th  floor. My brother lived on the 10th floor so it was kind of a legacy to the  10th floor, but after a year in the dorms I decided that wasn   t for me  (Laughter) so I moved out west of town. I can   t even remember the  name of the apartments now, but I think there   s Ron Shirley GMC is out  there I think   so somewhere out in that area I lived a couple of years.  Then my last three semesters I lived in a townhome right on the edge of  campus over by Old Central, right behind Hideaway. So I had to smell  that every day   every time I left for class or came home, I had to smell  Hideaway which really was bad because I love Hideaway   and so that   s  where I lived. We had a very nice place there and a little balcony and we  always watched all the pledge classes have to march up and down in  front of the campus there and that was always entertaining for us to  heckle people and stuff.  Do you have any particular memories about some of the things on  campus? I   ll just maybe throw some of these out   Theta Pond?  Not really Theta Pond. I didn   t really spend a lot of time wandering  around Theta Pond. Spent a lot of time in the Delt  Delta Tau Delta   house, had a lot of friends in that fraternity. Then I spent a lot of time at  Gallagher-Iba and spent a lot of time at Lewis Field.  For the photography?  For the photography. As a matter of fact, you   ll find this interesting.  This past basketball season, I took my son to his first OSU basketball  game and that   s the first time in 20 years   well, it   s the first time I   ve  ever sat in the stands and watched an OSU game as a fan. I   ve always  had to do it as a media representative. So that was the first time I   ve ever  gotten to cheer for my alma mater, and it was really   it meant more to  me than it did to my son that I got to sit there and actually sing the alma  mater and cheer for my team. It was great fun because I was always on  the floor and, as a media member, you always have to be unbiased.  I was at OSU at a great time. From    85 to    89, the football team was  very successful at that time. The only two teams we couldn   t beat were  OU and Nebraska, but nobody else was beating them either. Pat Jones  12  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  was a barrel of laughs to cover and then we had a guy named Thurman  Thomas. We had a guy named Barry Sanders   Kenny Monday, John  Starks, Richard Dumas   oh, goodness   Pete Incaviglia, Robin  Ventura   so there was plenty. I loved to shoot sports. That was kind of  what I did at The Tulsa World, and I got the best training in the world  because we had fabulous athletes at that time at OSU. People kind of  tend to gloss over that, but as far as just covering these guys and what  they were doing at the time was just phenomenal for me and I had access  to everything. I actually went to Barry Sanders    dorm room and took a  picture to him and said,    Hey, would you sign this?    and he was like,     Oh, yeah. Sure. No problem.    Then he turns around and wins the  Heisman and the rest is history.  But it was just   we didn   t even think anything of it at the time, but what  a great training ground for a kid that just wanted to do that. I really took  it for granted at the time, but looking back on it now and trying to get  my students access to things to shoot, oh, I was so spoiled. It was just a  different time when access was just, if I wanted to walk in and see  Coach Jones, I mean take his picture,    Okay, fine. Just make it quick.     That   s kind of the way it was.  Do you think that   s just changed in general though?  Oh, sure. Sure. Access is   it   s a different game. It   s a different world  we live in today.  College sports      Sure. Oh, yeah. It   s a business now. I mean T. Boone steps in and here  we go and it   s a good thing for OSU. I   m proud of it, but it   s a different  day that we live in today for sure. OSU athletics was always    We still  are the little brother to OU but that kind of helped, too, because  everybody was a little more relaxed maybe at OSU. It was more of a  family atmosphere, and if I wanted to get something for The O   Colly,     Sure, come on in. That   s great.    So I used it to my advantage.  You said that you were shooting sports mostly while you were there, did  you play sports in school growing up?  I did play sports in high school. I was an all-state tennis player, believe it  or not, and I actually walked on at OSU for about (laughs) half a  semester. When I figured out I was the only American on the court and  that I didn   t belong with those guys I quickly bowed out and that was the  end of my tennis career officially. That was one of the things I   m  proudest of is that both my dad and I   and of course my dad was a  much better athlete than I was   were all-state athletes in Oklahoma. I  13  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  kind of hang my hat on that and that   s one thing that I   m proud of. I had  a great tennis career and it was a lot of fun, won a lot of stuff.  State champion?  Yeah, but that      What year?  That would have been    84.  Your senior year, junior year?  Junior and some sophomore, but still guys I play with live in Tulsa, so  we had a very   again, very talented group, a very good tennis program  at Ada High School. They   re not only known for their football. People  forget   I live in Jenks and Jenks is, you know, Jenks. But they don   t  understand that at Ada High School, you   d better have at least 19 or 20  state championships to keep up with their football program. We had a  very good tennis program and we were very competitive and I had a  very good tennis coach. He taught me to be competitive and I liked that.  It really fit my personality. I was never a team sports kind of guy. I  never succeeded at that. Tried, but I never did.  But when I found an individual sport and I look at it now and it really  plays into my photography because all the spotlight is on you. If you  fail, it   s your fault, but if you succeed, you get the glory, and I love that  still to this day. I mean, I look at my career at The Tulsa World and that  was it because, The Tulsa World, or any paper for that matter, your name  goes underneath your work and for everybody to see and if that picture  is awful, they know you took it and it was an awful picture, but if it   s a  great picture your name is on it as well. I loved that. I mean that  competitive drive in me. I can look back at my tennis career and  probably draw from that. I   ve never thought of it that way, but it   s  probably true that I want all the pressure on. If The Tulsa World sends  me to Miami to the Orange Bowl and OU   s driving to win the national  championship, I want the camera in my hand. I want the chance to get  that shot. I love that. I love that, and that probably spawns from my  tennis career, yeah.  That was great. Okay, some other campus areas, campus things. What  was the library lawn like when you were in school?  It was an interesting place. I think there was a guy named Reverend Jim  who used to come and show up and preach out there. I remember   this  is really interesting. I was a freshman and I was walking through the  14  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Student Union, and there used to be a little   I don   t know if it   s still  there, I think it   s still there   maybe not because they   ve built buildings  there   there was a little garden in between the journalism building and  the Student Union. I was walking through on my way to class or to get  something to eat, I don   t know, and there was a guy sitting out there  with a guitar and a beard with about five people in front of him playing  his guitar singing. Lo and behold, that was Garth Brooks. Come to find  out the guy would sell more records than anybody on the planet. So that  was interesting and I remember him vaguely at the time, but he was  around. I actually had a guy, a friend of mine, that used to sing with him  occasionally. Just little things like that you remember that kind of go  back in your mind and you   re like,    Hmmn        I was there during  what  they called the Ice Bowl   the year that the ice  storm got real bad for the Bedlam game in Stillwater. I can remember on  Hall of Fame  Avenue  behind the stadium, because the sun couldn   t get  to the road because of the stadium, ice stayed there for I think three  weeks or something like that. So memories like that and   boy, how do  you   I was trying to think of some other fun stuff we used to do. It was  just a fun time in my life, a challenging time but it was a lot of fun. I  really enjoyed it, and      Did you spend any time in the library?  Very little, I can honestly say. (Laughs) I probably should have spent  more, but only when I had to. I was an average student at best, not a  great student. I unfortunately didn   t care about it that much and didn   t  know how to study, to be quite honest. I was one of those kids that I  just   I didn   t have very good study habits. I can honestly say probably  not until my senior year did I really enjoy the academic side of OSU. I  had enjoyed the other things and I kind of just got through my classes to  get through them, but not until my senior year when I started taking  some classes where I thought,    Hey, this is pretty interesting stuff,    and  I got into it and my grades showed it. My grades reflected my interest in  it at that time, but before that I was too busy running around with the  camera or thought I was Mr. Joe Cool or whatever.  What about Old Central? Was anything going on there? Do you have  any memories about it?  Yeah, one of my favorite memories of Old Central is in the afternoons     and I can   t remember his name now, but the guy that started the  Hideaway      Richard Dermer?  15  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Richard Dermer   I just knew him as Richard   I didn   t know his last  name. He   d be out there flying his kites. He would always be out there  on nice days flying his kites, and I always loved that. He would just be  out there with those kites   the beautiful kites, you know the ones that  hang in the restaurant. He   d be out there flying those kites and man, I  took so many pictures of him doing that and I took one that ran on the  front page of The O   Colly. When they started building the Hideaway  restaurants in Tulsa   they built one at 81st and Harvard, and they put old  clippings on the wall  and  how they laminate them and flap them up on  the wall and that picture was in a montage. We were sitting there one  night with my family eating and I looked and I said,    Man, that looks  familiar.    Sure enough it was the picture I took of him flying his kites  when I was a kid and every time we go in there to eat, I look at it. It   s  like I get flashbacks from seeing him but he   d always be out on Old  Central lawn. He   d just walk across the street from the restaurant right  there and fly his kites.  Would he be alone flying kites or      Yes. Yes, nobody around him. No, nobody around him   just by himself.  I think he   d have one of those little beatnik hats on. I can   t always  remember, but that was a lot of fun to always   you could tell, you just  knew it was him. It was just like part of the furniture.  What about the fire station right there?  Oh, it was just there. I mean nothing special but it was there doing its  thing.  What were the hangouts in the    80s?  In the    80s, Joe   s of course. That was back in the day if you wanted a t-shirt  you had to go up to the bartender and he reached behind underneath  the bar and pulled one out. That   s the only way you could get a shirt.  Was Stan visible in the restaurant or in Joe   s?  I mean, yeah, absolutely and he was around and actually I  have  a funny  story about him. My dad, my senior year, bought me a car for graduation  but he bought   we bought it, oh, probably two months  before ,  probably March or April   and it was a brand new Jeep Cherokee, a  very, very nice truck. I was going to Joe   s one time. I pulled up right in  front and parked, and he came out and said,    Man, that   s a sharp looking  truck. How much you want for it?    Of course, he could have paid me for  it and I said,    No, it   s not for sale,    He said,    Well, that   s really good  looking. You ever get to where you want to sell it...    I remember that  16  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  and then he just walked off. Of course, they had him over at the business  school all the time. He talks over there, but I remember that. That was  kind of an interesting little snippet.  We should say Stan Clark, the founder of Eskimo Joe   s.  Sure. And Eskimo Joe   s was different at that time   the beer garden was  an open area and it was still   it   s before all the expansion days and all  that stuff where it had a little more of that old feel to it. I still love  Eskimo Joe   s. I ate there the other day when I came to visit you guys.  My wife and I snuck over there and grabbed a burger but I could still  remember the days where    Now you can go in there and there   s  balloons and kids and it   s more of a family atmosphere. But back in our  day it was a restaurant during the day and then come about 7:00 it  became a bar. Of course, we were all there. I mean, you had to be there.  It was part of the deal. Then, the summer anniversary parties were huge,  even back then were huge, and we always tried to get cool pictures of  those. That was kind of part of the challenge is who could get the coolest  picture of all those people standing on the street for      Was that for The O   Colly or      Oh, yeah. Yeah, because we could get it in the paper. There were several  of us   that   s another thing, too. Back in those days there was probably  five or six of us guys that were very talented photographers who were all  competing together and that is what made us better, too. Lost a very  close friend   he was a photographer for The Lawton Constitution   this  summer. He passed away, a very dear friend that we all ran together. It  was a competition. We pushed each other. Who was gonna get the shot?  And then I was the photo editor so I got the final say in what shots got  in, so they were usually mine. (Laughter)  Well what other Stillwater hangouts were big?  Oh, I was trying to remember. Dupree   s was still down on the Strip and  then   of course I can   t remember the names of all the places.  Everything looks the same, they just changed the names. The Stables  was there. I was trying to think of what the little book place on the  corner was called. But essentially (Laughs) all the same buildings and  establishments were there, they just had different names and they  probably changed four times when we were in school, but we were  either on the Strip   down on the Strip walking around or we were at  Joe   s. That was really it   no more, no less.  One thing that is noticeable about students today is how frequently you  see them dining out all around town, at the chain restaurants and  17  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  everything.  Right.  Was it like that when you were in school?  I don   t remember it being that way much. I mean we just didn   t have  money to go and go out and eat all the time. It was fun to go and  frequent some of the places. The best I can remember it was good  enough just to scrape and see what you could throw together. I mean,  that was kind of a part of the college experience. We didn   t think  anything of it at the time, but I ate a lot at the Union. I mean, I would  usually eat lunch there about every day.  And what was your favorite place there?  Oh, I can   t remember, just eating in the little restaurant or dining area  was always   usually that was a daily thing or get something to drink.  Was it fast food or more school cafeteria style?  I think it was more fast food style at that time, burgers and such.  What campus traditions stand out for you?  Homecoming always stands out to me. It always seemed like a very  interesting time. There was a lot of hustle and bustle around campus and  that was always exciting, I remember. Always the sport   to me  everything revolved around all the athletic seasons, so football and  wrestling were huge. I mean that   s back in the day where   it wasn   t  Gallagher-Iba then, but the arena was packed 6,000 people into the arena  for Bedlam wrestling or Iowa or Iowa State. I mean that was a big deal  and the basketball, of course, was huge and then the baseball games  were fun as well. You know, that   s back when we were one of the top  two or three programs in the nation, and boy it was one of those deals  where you got out and it was an afternoon event. You went out there and  you hung out. It was more social than anything else and I just happened  to have a camera in my hand. But I remember those times were fun. And  then just the change in the weather and the seasons was great and a lot of  the parties and stuff that I remember were fun and friends, too. It   s great.  That   s one of the fun things about the onset of things like Facebook is  being able to connect with guys that I ran around with back then and it   s  fun to catch up and see what they   re doing today.  Do you remember anything about campus administrators then and what  seemed to be their focuses or their initiatives or what was really driving  18  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  everything? Was it the sports?  No, I don   t remember it being that way. Seemed to me   and this is just  the impression I got as a student, that the Ag School was huge. There  always seemed to be a lot of activity around that, but not so much with  athletics. It didn   t seem to be the priority at all. It just seemed to kind  of   that was just part of the school. I guess that may be different now. If  you drive on campus and you see the football stadium as it looks today,  it   s much more of a dominant feature (Laughs) than it used to be. But  no, it just seems like academics was maybe the thing and not so much  any one area. The Ag School seemed to me to have a lot of things going  on at the time. I remember about the time I was leaving is when the  Noble building or the Noble  Research  Center was being built, the Wes  Watkins building was being built   so those things. Engineering seemed  to be ramping up at that time. I had several friends that were in the  engineering school and there was a lot of hustle and bustle. Architecture  and those areas seemed to be really attractive and then the journalism  school, too, was big. It was a very popular place to be as well. So lots  going on.  The athletes that you covered   the sports that you covered   did it  surprise you the success that some of them went on to have?  Yes and no. At the time you think that your team and your school is the  best ever, but as an adult and as involved in covering sports as I   ve been  over the past 14 or 15 years, it really is surprising because professional  athletics is such a fine, minute population. It   s really surprising that  those guys succeeded as well as they did and got the recognition that  they did, but like Barry Sanders. The year before nobody knew who he  was because a guy named Thurman Thomas played. Then all of a  sudden that one  year  (and that was great because that was my last year  there) Barry Sanders comes out of nowhere. Part of our deal was to  cover him and push some coverage on him to help win, because the  Heisman Committee looks at that and so we took it upon ourselves.     Yeah, we   ve got something special going on here,    and we did. We  covered it that way. I can remember that.  A guy named Billy Berkenbile was the sports editor at the time and he  works at The Tulsa World even today, and he and I took it upon  ourselves like,    Yeah, we   re gonna really emphasize him because this is  something.    I mean, we knew it was special. We knew something really  nice was going on, and of course the team was good. Hart Lee Dykes  and Mike Gundy were playing at the time and we were just    If you  look back at the scoring at that time, it   s kind of like in football today,  they have the west coast offense which is the big pass and run and gun      a  fast break offense. The University of Tulsa plays it where they try to  19  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  score as many points as they can. Well that was kind of the precursor to  that. I can remember with Barry and with Hart Lee and Mike, I mean,  we   d just outscore people. We didn   t have to play defense. We just put  50 points on them and you   ve got them beat and they could do that.  Barry, we just knew that something special was gonna happen with that,  and it did and we got to be a part of that, and that   s just part of my  legacy and part of my thing.  If you go back and look at The O   Colly the day that he won it, we ran a  full-page photograph of Barry Sanders that I took and the headline was     Sanders Wins.    It was just a two-word headline, and we planned that.  We knew what we wanted to do and which was really revolutionary.  Today in the day of USA Today   s and those things where it   s more of a  People Magazine type snippet, web looking thing. That was kind of  what it was, I mean because we basically had one story, one photograph  and one headline on the front page of The O   Colly that day and we did  that several times at The Tulsa World for different things   shuttle  crashes and those types of things get that kind of treatment. But we gave  it that kind of treatment. We thought it was special and we made sure  that they  remembered . That   s some of my memories of college.  That   s really, really great. I know in your book you mention the  importance of music in your life      Yes, yes.      so tell me a little bit if you were involved at all in the music scene in  Stillwater in the    80s that was happening, that I   ve heard stories about.  (Laughs) Well, this was of course pre-Red Dirt days and Garth was there  and there were several   the Tumbleweed was huge, I   ve neglected to  say that. The Weed was   that was a big deal      Everybody called it the Weed.  The Weed. You went to the Weed and it was out west of town and it was  out in the country and that   s where all the country stuff went down, but  it had stories galore. I didn   t go out there a lot, but I did go occasionally  and mostly to hear music   I mean, guys like Dwight Yoakum and some  guys that were pretty heavy duty hitters at the time in the    80s when all  that was going on, I enjoyed that. But really I can remember Garth, like I  said, him playing at the Student Union and then I can remember his first  CD sitting on the shelves at Hastings on the Strip forever, maybe six  months before he got any recognition. And then all of a sudden like  wildfire it hit and it was over. I mean, he was a mega-star.  20  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  But as far as on the Stillwater music scene, I can   t really remember. I  remember one band called The Call, which was huge. They were a big     80s band and they came to town. This is a great story   you   ll love this.  My roommate worked at Garfield   s. I could go out there in the evenings  and he would just slide me food and I could eat for free, so that was part  of the deal. I was out there getting my free meal from Tim, and I look  over and Dennis Hopper is sitting at a booth in Garfield   s in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. So we asked him, we said,    What are you doing here?    and  he said,    Well, The Call is playing here tonight and so I   m here to hear  them.    He goes,    I   m a fan and I write music for them,    and I went,     Are you kidding?       No, it   s the truth,    and sure enough. So that really  stuck out in my memory.  There are a couple of other bands in the late    80s, early    90s. A friend of  mine named Zac Maloy, who I went to high school with, fronted a band  called The Nixons which were big kind of in that time area, and I knew  him. He was just a high school friend and this kind of plays into my life  today, but he was just a high school friend that I knew and he had this  college band and he played with some buddies and then they went on to  be mega successful. We share a studio  Rosewater Studio  today in  Tulsa and he writes for everybody. He has a songwriting contract and  just got through writing with Carrie Underwood so      What is his name?  His name is Zac Maloy, and we grew up together in Ada and so that   s  part of it. I don   t remember any specific bands per se, but there was  always music everywhere and music   s been such a huge part of my life,  even growing up. It   s always been there   all kinds of music. And if you  look   go and you look at my iPod, I mean it   ll run everything from  Michael Jackson to Lawrence Welk. I listen to it all and I take it all in.  You said this was before Red Dirt music. What do you mean by that  exactly?  Well, if you talk about Stillwater today Red Dirt music is the thing and  there was just no such animal back then. Now, I   m sure the guys were  doing it and there were certain guys I look back at now that I   m friends  with I   m sure they were doing it at that time. But I had no knowledge of  it, and it just wasn   t a big thing until I would say probably mid to late     90s when you start to get Cross Canadian Ragweed. You start getting  the Red Dirt Rangers, Bob Childers   those guys start emerging and  becoming popular. I   m sure they were doing it at the time, and there   s  legendary stories at the Farm and things out west of town and those  things that they were doing. I   m sure they were doing it at those times     I don   t doubt that   but just the popularity of the music itself didn   t catch  21  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  fire until a few years ago. Then some of these guys that I had taken  pictures of or knew were all of a sudden, you could see them on CMT.  They were starting to get national recognition and everything pointed  back. They were all talking about Stillwater, Oklahoma. And so that   s  when it, kind of   but I   m sure they were doing it when I was there. It   s  just they were just hanging out picking guitars at that time and now it   s  the flavor of the month type thing.  Can you think of anything else to say about your time as a student at  Oklahoma State University?  Well, it seems like there was something I was thinking about. All I can  say about OSU and Stillwater is it gave me my career, and I can never  repay that because my career has given more to me than I can ever  repay. OSU and Stillwater were a part of that. Everywhere I go I take  that with me and people have asked me because essentially at my time at  the The Tulsa World, as far as covering sports, I usually covered OU  because that   s the big beat and they always pretty much had me  exclusively stay with OU and everybody was like,    Well, how can you  stand it? You   re an OSU guy.    I was just always like,    Well, that   s just  kind of the way it is,    and I enjoyed that. I mean I enjoyed covering the  Sooners because you could depend on every New Years you   d either be  in Miami or San Diego and that   s not a bad place to be on January 1. But  now like I said, it   s like coming home for me, if that makes sense.  I told my boss that when I interviewed here, I said,    I   m a Cowboy and  to me this is coming home for me.    I   ve really enjoyed that part of it  because now I get to almost   it   s almost like I get to 20 years later  enjoy my university for the first time. Then coming over and being part  of the book and coming over to the library and being part of those  things, I can   t tell you what that means to me as an Oklahoman and as an  OSU Cowboy. Those are things that I   ll look back on someday when  I   m sitting in my rocker with my grandkids and be proud of. And I   m  sure like now the book   I   ll pick up the book and look at it and think,     Okay, that   s kind of neat what I did,    but I   m sure as time goes   like  20 years from now   30 years from now, I   ll look back on it and go,     Wow, I can   t believe I actually did that.    Stillwater and OSU and all  the friends and teachers and instructors and all the different restaurants  and all those things, athletes and venues, all came together to play a part  of that.  Well, this has been a great interview, and I thank you so much.  You   re welcome.  I look forward to the next interview where we will talk about your book  22  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  and move in that direction, but this was wonderful. You have wonderful  memories of OSU, and it   s really nice to hear that and it   s nice to hear  you talking about how special it was and how much it means to you.  Well, I can add one more thing. Throughout my travels and covering  college athletics, I   ve been to many, many universities, beautiful  universities, across the country and that runs from North Carolina to  Duke to UCLA, USC. I covered the SEC for awhile so I   ve been to  Tennessee and Kentucky and LSU and Alabama   and they   re beautiful  places. But Stillwater and OSU, it does have a family feel to it and it  feels like a college. It feels like a university, but it doesn   t   it has such  continuity to it, and it does have a feeling to it. And that   s how I describe   it to  people, and my wife is an OU Sooner   she graduated from the  University of Oklahoma and she would agree with me. She can   t say that  about her school   it does have that family feel to it, that you   re part of a  bigger thing. You   re a Cowboy, and that means something. That has a  cognitive meaning to it that you can embrace and hold onto and that  you   re a part of something bigger. There are not a lot of places like that,  especially around here. If you go to say the University of Texas and  you   re on campus with 50,000 students, I mean   I don   t know if you  can really call it a down home feel, but Stillwater is that and OSU is that.  That   s another thing I really love about the campus and about the school.  So what message would you give to students of today or in the future?  I would say that if you want to go to a place that would not treat you as a  number and would care about what you do and show you that, hey, you  can come here and learn but you can also be something, a part of  something, special and bigger than yourself, then we   re the school for  you and I try to. We have several OSU grads teaching over here in  Okmulgee, but I try to kind of show that off a little bit whether they  want to know it or not that I   m a Cowboy and when you graduate from  here that your diploma will read Oklahoma State University as well, and  you can take pride in that. You can root for that and you can cheer for  that and you can be proud of that and you can wear it with pride, and so  that   s what I try to get across. Like I said, I   ve been fortunate enough to  see a lot of different schools and I have friends that have gone to every  school in the nation but there   s something special about Oklahoma State.  Just because it   s in the middle of the country and a small town doesn   t  mean that it   s any less. That   s what I take from it.  Message for administrators and faculty?  Care about the students. Invest yourself in the students and they   ll invest  back. I   ve only been teaching a short time, but I   ve tried to be very  student-oriented. I try to put myself in their shoes and think as they  23  Neurohr  Kerr  think. Not that I want to be best friends with them per se, but if you  invest time in them, they respect that, and also they respect what you do.  If you have passion for what you do and you bring that into the  classroom, they   ll respond to it. I   ve seen that firsthand because I come  in every day and I start talking about photography and here I go. I put a  camera in my hand and they get to watch me do it. That   s so important  that they see that I love what I do and it   s contagious and then they want  to do it, too. That   s so important and that   s so vital to the success of your  students because I   m not just here earning a paycheck. I   m not here  trying to draw a teachers    retirement. I   m here because I love  photography and I want them to love it, too. And if I can get them to  love it, man I   ve done my job and it shows. I can tell right away if they  take it to heart, but that   s the most important thing to me is that teachers  and administrators really show that they love what they do and try to get  the students to do that   and many of them do. There are wonderful  teachers all over the state and at our institution here.  I   ve found the most important ingredient in teaching is that I show up  and I care, and they know it. They know it and every week I come in and  they   ll go,    Kelly, what did you shoot this week? Show us what you  shot. We want to see it.    So I take time to show them and it   s not in a  bragging way or showing them,    Hey, look what I can do    way, but  they   re very curious about what I   m doing and how I   m doing it. So I  show them. I take time to show them. I   m like,    Yeah.    And a lot of  times I   ve invited many of them to go on shoots that I do so they can just  watch me work and it   s very rewarding. They   ll come back with a  million questions. But that   s it, it   s passion, it   s dedication. Those things  sound corny today sometimes but it   s true. I mean that   s the key  ingredient. I tell my students this   we actually have an interview  process to get in our program   and I say,    I don   t care if you can take a  picture. I can teach you to take a picture, but I can   t give you passion for  photography or whatever it may be. If you come in and you want to do  it, really love it and want to do it, then prove it to me and then I   ll teach  you how to work PhotoShop and work a camera and all the knobs and  whistles and everything.    I can teach you how to do that, but if you have  the passion for it then you   ve already won   and that   s what I try to  teach.  Well thank you again for the interview.  You   re welcome.  ------- End of March 6, 2009 interview -------  24  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  My name is Karen Neurohr, and I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Today is Friday, March 27, 2009, and  I   m at the OSU Institute of Technology in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. I   m  here today to interview Kelly Kerr who is an instructor here in the  Visual Communications Department, and our purpose is to capture an  interview for the O-STATE Stories Oral History Project of the  Oklahoma State University Library. This is the second interview with  Kelly. The first interview was about his time as a student at Oklahoma  State University. Today we   re going to talk about his book, Oklahoma  Revisited: Out of the Way Places and Faces, which was published in  2007 by the Tulsa World newspaper. Kelly, thank you for the  opportunity to interview you today about your book.  Thank you, Karen.  Would you start off by reading the first page?  I   d love to.    I am the grandson of Robert H.    Bob    Kerr and Eva Mae  Kerr James and C. H.    Chuck    Eubank and Lidia Eubank. I am the son  of John and Phyllis Kerr. I am the brother of Kerry Kerr. I am the  husband of Gene Ann Kerr. I am the father of Julia and John Kerr. I am  an Ada Cougar. I am an Oklahoma State Cowboy. I am an Oklahoman.     I like that. What a great way to introduce the book. When did you write  that?  I was trying to think of all these profound things I could say. (Laughs) I  wanted it to be emotional and be a tear-jerker but I   m not a writer, so I  came up with the idea to do kind of a stat sheet of who I am and that   s  what came of it. I just tried to keep it simple. I had never thought of  these things before because I   d never done a book, but you start to think  about who do I want to thank, who are the influences in my life, make  sure I don   t leave anybody out (Laughs) and so I thought this is an easy  way to get everybody in there that I think needs to be in there. So I just  looked at it as a stat sheet of my stats as I approached the end of the  book and that   s what I came up with.  I think it   s wonderful. Good job.  Thank you.  Let   s talk a little bit about the book, about how this opportunity came up  and how it was presented to you.  Sure. I was approached by the Tulsa World in 2006, that summer, and of  course I   d worked there many years, since    95. They came to me and  25  Neurohr  Kerr  said,    We   re looking towards the Centennial and we   re looking at  projects that we would like to do for the Centennial. We   re thinking  we   d like for you to do a book. Would you consider doing something  like that?    and right away in my mind I thought, wow. That was really  the final frontier for me in my career, as I always wanted to have a book  of my work. I thought this is the opportunity I   ve been looking for, and  it didn   t take me long to say,    Yeah. I would be really interested in that.     That   s about as simple as it was.  It was a crude process at first because we didn   t have really any  deadlines or ideas of what the book should be or be about and it was  really left to me to start forming those ideas and putting the plan together  to create the book and start the book. Once we kicked it off, then it was  really in my lap, which is unusual for them. That   s not their style.  Newspaper work   s a very detailed work and to get a newspaper out  every day is a very detailed thing. You have to stay right on top of it. I  was really left alone from that point on and it was up to me to generate  the content as well as all the photographs.  So what month did you start shooting the photos?  I started in June of 2006. The first photograph was taken in June of 2006  at the Woody Guthrie Festival, as a matter of fact. I didn   t take any  pictures for about another month after that, but the first idea or the first  thoughts were   and this really sounds very na  ve now looking back on  it   but I was going to shoot my regular assignments for the paper and  then work on the book in the meantime. I found out very quickly that  that just wasn   t going to get it done. I needed to be unfettered as far as  being able to travel and get to the places I needed to get on the days I  needed to get to.  I didn   t need them to give me assignments and then something pop up in  Ponca City that I had to be at and then they would have to hustle and  have somebody pick up my work. So I just said,    Listen guys. Cut me  loose for a year, year and a half. Let me work on this because, as always,  my tendency is if I   m gonna do something, I   m gonna do it right and I  don   t want to have to worry about anything else,      and they agreed.  They thought,    Yeah, to make a 300-page book, you   re gonna have to  apply yourself,    and just the sheer time of getting places and doing  things and arrangement and just the office work of putting the book  together was enough to keep me busy, much less getting out and taking  the pictures. So at that point, I said,    Yeah, I need to really get out and  do this.     Now, in between time there were things that I was doing for the paper.  We were pointing toward the PGA Championship at Southern Hills and  26  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  I was kind of the designated golf photographer, so during the book I  went to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the US Open. I went to Chicago for  the PGA, those types of things. I was trying to remember what bowl  game I went to   I went to a bowl game   so I did things along the way  for the paper, but for the most part I was really dedicated to the book at  that point.  Well that   s very interesting. So that was about a month or so into the  project?  Yeah. I would say a month or two months, probably. It kind of took me  a little while. At first I thought I could tackle it. Hey, I can handle it. I  can build a book and do my job. Then I thought no, there   s no way.  Then once I talked to the powers that be, they agreed fortunately.  Okay. So how did you travel?  Most of the traveling was done by rental car, and the guys at the rental  car place in Tulsa got to know me very, very well. I would just call and  they would have the car ready for me. A lot of times if the trip was  immediate and I just had to get in and go, I would take my own vehicle.  I have a friend that has a helicopter, and he was more than happy to give  his time and his resources to the book, and so I did a lot of flying with  the book as well, which was very helpful to get to places. So I spent a lot  of time in a rental car during that year.  Did you log how many miles you traveled?  I should have. It came out to be slightly more than 52,000 miles at the  end of the day. I had it pretty close, but I kind of lost track. Those are  things   I look back now and think,    Man, I should have really  documented it when I was doing it,    but I made a guesstimate when I  finished at about 52,000 miles.  That   s a lot of miles.  That   s a lot of miles, and most of it was in western Oklahoma and the  Panhandle. (Laughs)  So you started the book around June of 2006. How long were you on the  road taking pictures, just back and forth?  I was on the road until late August of    07. I was trying to think, the last  picture was taken in late August. I was on the road well over a year  working on the book.  27  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  What camera and other equipment did you use for this?  I used two cameras. I used a Canon EOS-1 Mark II, which was the top  of the line Canon camera at the time. That was kind of the standard  camera for the paper and that was the camera that I used. I was trying to  think if I ever used any other, but I don   t think so. That was the standard.  So that was Tulsa World equipment?  Yeah, you bet. They provide your gear.  What else did you take?  Music obviously. I don   t go anywhere without my iPhone and then I  have an iPOD with me as well. So music, obviously. That   s a really  good question. A lot of times though it   s just me and my cameras and a  change of clothes maybe, but as long as I   ve got my music with me I   m  pretty set.  When you had to stay overnight, where did you stay?  I thought about this a lot. This was not something that I just said,    Well,  give me the local Motel 6.    I tried to stay at establishments that were  true to whatever place I was going to. Like when I did the section on  Route 66 in the book, I made a point to never leave the Route. So I  stayed on a motel on Route 66 because that was the parameters that I set  up for that section. As long as I was on it, I would never leave it. So I  ate, slept, played, all those things, on the Route. I tried to stay in places  that were indicative to that area. Of course, when I was in southwestern  Oklahoma, I had to stay at Quartz Mountain Lodge which is a nice  place, so I wasn   t hurting by any means. That was the rule that I set up  for myself.  What about food?  Food was great. Part of the book is about food so there were certain  restaurants and greasy spoons and diners that I had to get to. A lot of  them I had gotten to before, but that was part of the experience, to eat  the food that was kind of native to that area and then I would go and ask.  If I was in a town or a location, I   d say,    Hey, where do you get a bite to  eat around here?    It was never a chain. It was always,    This is the place  you   ve got to go,    so that   s where I went.  A couple of pictures, I think, have your children in them.  Yes.  28  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Did your family travel with you some?  They did travel with me some, in the summertime. That summer I  decided there are gonna be some trips they would enjoy. I have twins  and they were, at that time, 7 years old. And 7-year-olds in a car for any  length of time is a difficult thing so I didn   t really want to take them too  much but times that we could   like when I went down through central  Oklahoma, down through Davis and Turner Falls and places that I knew  they would enjoy, I tried to include them in that. I think I took them to  Red Rock Canyon in Hinton, which was fun. I did include them. But the  one thing I did do with the book is I did not show anybody, including  my wife or my children, any of the proofs or the outtakes of the book. So  Thanksgiving of    07 was the first time anyone   any member of my  family had seen what I had done for that year. So they went with me, but  they didn   t see anything I was working on.  Why is that?  I wanted it to be a surprise to some degree. I don   t know, there was just  something that I wanted to be a surprise. I wanted it to be a gift to them,  especially my parents. I wanted it to be a gift for them, and to show  them, I thought, would spoil the surprise. I get emotional talking about  it. It was a very emotional Thanksgiving that year. This is a whole story  within itself. I don   t think my parents had a grip on what I was doing.  Many times throughout my career I would tell them I was gonna do  something or go somewhere and they would just kind of be like,     Okay.    I actually worked in London back in    02 or    01, and for me to  go overseas and work, it didn   t really hit them until I was over there and  gave them the phone call and it finally hit them. I think in their minds  they figured I would walk in with a little paperback thing and just hand  it and go,    Here you go.    Not for me to present a book that   s hardback  cover, 300 pages that has an ISBN number that is in the Library of  Congress. It   s an actual real book. That really, I think it took them back  a little bit and that was fun for me. That was part of the experience, and I  wanted that. I wanted to experience that. I wanted to have that gift to  give to them and my wife and family, too, because this will be a legacy.  It will outlive me and hopefully that my children   s children will look at  it and enjoy it as well. That   s part of it, and so you start thinking. That   s  part of what doing this did was it made me think in those terms of  beyond my lifetime. Somebody in my family will be able to see what I  did, and how neat that is gonna be. I look at my grandparents and great-grandparents  and think,    Man, that would be really cool to have  something like this from them.    You start thinking in those grandiose  terms when you start doing stuff like this.  Was that a mind shift somewhere early in the process?  29  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Late in the process.  Late in the process.  First in the process I   m just hustling. I   m just doing it. I   m not thinking  about it. It was more of a day to day, kind of like I approach my job, but  whenever we got to the end of the road and it started to come together  and started looking the way the book was gonna look, then I started  thinking in those terms of    Wow, I   m really       Very few times in my  career did I actually go way beyond my means (laughs) and this was one  of those times for sure. Yeah, this could be really something special, and  it was, it was really. And I   m sure as the years tick by, it   ll even get  more and more special.  Do you have any favorite memories from the road?  Yeah.  Any particular stories that stand out? Did people stop you and say,     What are you doing?     Yeah, a couple of great ones. One of the greatest trips was the  Panhandle. I did the Panhandle in one chunk, and I didn   t know how  long I would be out there because I didn   t know how long it would take  me. So I traveled out with the intention of    I might be there two weeks. I  might be there two and a half. I don   t know just how long it   s gonna take  me to cover the Panhandle.    And so when I drove out, I drove from  Tulsa to Black Mesa in one day. I was gonna go to the New Mexico  border all the way and then turn around and say,    Okay. Where do I  need to go?     So I did. I got there late in the day and the sun was going down. It was in  the summertime. You have the cactus and it looks like the Mesas and  everything and it looks like John Wayne should come riding up at any  moment, so I   m taking these pictures of flowers and cactus, which is not  my forte. I have to have a warm-blooded creature in my pictures to make  it   that   s just me   and so I drive around the Black Mesa and there   s  these three guys on horseback herding cattle and I said,    Okay, that   s my  opportunity.    So I drive down and I say,    Hey guys. How   s it going?     They get off their horses and they say,    What are you up to?    I   m  talking and this guy   s like,    Yeah. This is my place    And I say,    Can I  take your picture?       Oh, yeah. Sure. No problem.    They   d go over in  front of Black Mesa and they pose like they   re the Backstreet Boys. I  mean they got into it. They   re all three carrying guns, holsters, the whole  nine yards   I mean they were the real authentic deal   and I thought,     Oh, I   m really on to something here.     30  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  That whole trip through the Panhandle was just exactly like that. I went  to Hooker and I said,    I   ve got to shoot a picture in Hooker. That   s part  of the drill.    I   m in Hooker and I   m driving around. Hooker is just a  small western Oklahoma farm town. It   s got the grain silos. It looks like  every other town over there. I   m like,    Man, I   ve got to find something  special.    And just the name   I mean it   s such a thing to talk about  Hooker, Oklahoma.  So I drive to the football stadium and there   s two little old ladies  walking around the track getting their evening exercise, and they   ve got  the little hairnets on and the whole thing. So I get on the other side of the  track and they don   t see me. I   m shooting across and you could see the  Hooker Bulldogs sign on the press box and you can see there   s a  tumbleweed actually stuck on the field. They   re walking across and so  after I take it I walk up to them, I introduce myself, tell them what I   m  doing and they say,    Oh, that   s interesting,    blah, blah, blah. I get their  names and talk to them a little bit and have a nice little visit for about  five minutes, and they turn and walk toward their house. I go to get back  in the rental car, and they turn around and they go,    Young man, young  man,    and then I say,    Yeah,    and they said,    Now remember, Hooker   s  where we   re from. It   s not our occupation.    (Laughter) And I thought,     Oh, how many times they must have told that?    I mean, it   s got to be a  running joke. So things like that   those stick out in my mind. I   ll never  forget those memories.  In the previous interview that we did, you expressed how much you love  music and you   ve touched on it here.  Sure.  Did you listen to any particular kind of music as you travelled? Any  particular radio stations?  (Laughs) Well, I thought it was really great. You get in the Panhandle  and you hit the seek button on your radio and it just rolls. It just never  stops. I thought that was quite amusing so I got a lot of entertainment out  of that. I love talk radio too and I love local talk radio so I listened to a  lot of that just for entertainment value. But I was trying to think, that   s a  good question, if I was listening to anything in particular at that time.  Man. I listen to so much music that it just all kind of blends in.  Modern and oldies?  Oh sure. This is kind of getting off the track, but in my iPod I have Ray  Conniff, Lawrence Welk. I grew up on all that easy listening    60s,    50s  music that my parents listened to. I still do. As a matter of fact, the  31  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Lawrence Welk Show (and this is another story all together) is one of  my best freelance gigs that I do. I listen to polka. (Laughs) But I   ll tend  to listen to about anything and I love western swing music, I grew up on  that. Anything by Bob Wills is A-okay with me. Then I can listen to the  Flaming Lips and I can listen to anything modern today. So I can   t say  that one particular genre of music, but I do enjoy everywhere I go, I try  to pick up on some local talk radio. I find that fascinating.  I   d like to know a little bit about your organizational process. You were  on the road for so long and the book states that you took over 38,000  photos.  38,136.  So how do you organize that many photos when you   re doing a project  like this?  Well, it   s difficult and easy. What I did was every time I would go out, I  would shoot everything. Then I would come back and I would do a  rough edit, which means I would kind of know what I had to begin, in  my mind. I would go through and edit my shots and then I would pick  maybe 10 to 15 shots from each little thing and I would put those in one  folder and then I would dump everything else in a hard drive. So as I  went, I had kind of a rough edit. Now, by the time I finished shooting  the book, I had a rough edit folder that was pretty substantial that I had  to kind of weed through. The difficult part in that is I had everything I  shot in one external hard drive over here and then I had rough edit. Now  once we sat down and started editing the book, then we had to go  through those and find those.  Now the hard part was, the very difficult part for me was, I went back  and I thought,    Man, what if I didn   t really get the shots I wanted in that  rough edit folder and there   s something sitting over in that hard drive,  some piece of magic, that I missed out on?    And I found a couple.  There   s parts of the book where we did juxtaposed type photos. So what  I did, there   s some pictures that didn   t make the book that I love because  we wanted another picture over here that worked better with its brother  shot. So we actually went back and picked other things to work better  and left some   and that   s the tough part of editing.  When you have 300 pages to work with and you   ve got so many  pictures, something   s gotta get left out. That   s when you have to ask the  question,    Which is your favorite child?    I mean you   ve got to make  some tough decisions. It was tough because, you know, you   re in the  back of your mind going,    Man, what if left out something? Or what if  there   s one that I   m not thinking of or I just didn   t do it at that time?     32  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Because you change. I mean over a year   s time, the way I felt about  things and the way I look at things and my photography changes and my  style morphs and so that   s a good span of time to be shooting one thing  and be thinking the same thing all the time. My attitude starting out was  not anywhere near what it was when I finished. I mean we were talking  two different animals by that time.  You kept notes when you went out?  I did keep notes. I kept one notebook. I went to the store the day we  started and bought an Oklahoma map, which I have hanging on my  fireplace in my home. I used one map for the whole project. I went to a  little closet at the Tulsa World where they kept pens and notepads for the  reporters and I went and got one notepad. I said,    I   m going to use this  notepad and this map starting today until I finish.    And I did. The map   s  all tattered and I had it framed and mounted and it hangs in my home  and the notepad I still have.  How do you label your pictures when you take them?  They   re numbered sequentially through the camera, so the camera does  it for you. Then I would have them, like if I went to say the Woody  Guthrie Festival, I would have a folder that said,    Woody Guthrie  Festival.    Then I would put that into the rough edit folder. Then they   re  already dated.  They   re dated already.  So I knew when I took them. I knew what time I took them, I knew  everything. The camera records all that metadata on each image.  Okay. What about all those photographs that are not in the book? Do  you have any plans for them?  You   re not the first to ask. I could do Oklahoma Revisited: Revisited if I  wanted to. (Laughter) If somebody wanted to come along and do that, I  could do that. I   ve thought about doing maybe a multimedia piece with  all of them. But yeah, the hard drive is still at the Tulsa World. It   s  locked away. And, of course, they own it so they can do whatever they  want to with it. But people have asked,    Where are all the other  pictures?    Travelling road show, I mean there   s been lots of ideas tossed  out. At the time I finished the book I was like,    I don   t want to even talk  about it.    (Laughs)  So when you travel now, after having done this project, do you find  yourself thinking that you need to stop and take photographs?  33  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Oh sure, sure.  Do you do that?  Absolutely. I did it just this last week. I drove to Lake Altus to Quartz  Mountain and we took Route 66 to Oklahoma City and we stopped  along the way. Actually, I   m shooting video now, video   s my thing now,  I   ve kind of shifted gears. So I was shooting a lot of video. But some of  the things that I had taken pictures of, I   d go back. I have people call me  now. I have friends calling me saying,    Hey, I   m going to be in such-and-  such town. Where do I need to go eat?    or    How do I get there?    I  get those phone calls all the time.  So that could be another book, too.  Yeah, I   m a walking Oklahoma road map. So when they need to know  how to get somewhere, they call me.  Okay, anything else come to mind about the travel or the organizational  process before we move into the next area?  No, it was just a great adventure. That   s the only word that comes to  mind is it was just a massive adventure across our state. When I started  out, I thought I had this brilliant grand scheme, which is really ridiculous  now. But I was going to travel every county road in the state, that was  my goal. And I thought,    Yeah, I   m going to see every nook and  cranny.    And it came down to   it was like, what am I thinking? There   s  no way. And then I thought,    You know what, I   m just going to go  where I can go and the book will be there at the end. I just need to do it  and the book will produce itself.    And once I kind of settled down     So was that a little frustrating?  Yeah, at times, because I thought,    Man, I   ve got a lot of work to do.     Then after that I was like,    That   s a little too much. I need to relax.     Whenever I did that, it was neat because I said,    Okay, let   s just cool our  jets a little bit here.    And as soon as I did that, man, then it really started  clicking. Because, you know, this book is not a Chamber of Commerce  piece. It   s what I consider Oklahoma to be. I   m an Oklahoman. I know  what we look like, what we sound like, what we act like. I didn   t want to  have a book to show us how beautiful we are, how pretty we are, and  everybody should come here. That   s not the point of the book. The point  of the book was just to hold up a mirror to ourselves and say,    Hey, take  a look. It   s pretty cool. You know, we   re different than everybody else.  We   re not southern. We   re not Midwesterners, we   re not Texans. We   re,  not from the plains of Kansas. I mean we   re a little bit of everything.  34  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  We   re kind of stuck, we   re kind of the belt buckle and we   re our own  thing.    And so I wanted to show that.  Okay, now we   re going to get into the creative process a little bit. We   re  going to explore your creativity, which is probably not going to be easy  to do. And the process of shooting the amazing photos and how this all  came together. At our first interview for the O-STATE Stories Oral  History Project, you explained how you got into photography while you  were at OSU.  Right.  And that you covered sports for the O   Colly newspaper and the strong  influence that this had on your career choice. Before you went to OSU,  what photographic experiences and interests did you have?  When I was a little kid, my mom had all the photo albums neatly  organized and put on a shelf and all the pictures were in it. I would go  through those things and peruse them over and over and over and over  again. I just enjoy it. I mean even today, when I go home to Ada, I can  go to the shelf and pull off the albums and look at them. There   s  something about a photograph that I really loved and in high school I  had no intention of doing this as a career. Even in college I said that. But  I loved to take pictures. There was something about capturing a picture  with that piece of equipment. I can   t remember what photographer, some  famous photographer said,    You click the shutter and something in your  heart palpitates,    and I know what that feels like. I just enjoyed  photography and I thought it would be like a cool hobby or something.  That was really the start of it. There was really no explanation. It was  just, for me, it really is a creative outlet because I can   t draw and I can   t  paint and I can   t sculpt. But I can take a picture and I can make a camera  do about anything I want it to do. So that   s my outlet, that   s how I get it  out.  Did both of your parents take the photos that you saw in the albums?  No, my mom took a lot of them. Dad didn   t take any. But in the albums  there were family photos from way back, so there   s no telling who took  them. But just the fact that in all these pictures, I think looking back on it  now, all these pictures had people in them. I think that had a big effect  on me because that   s my thing. I   m not real good with photos that don   t  have anybody in them. But you put a red-blooded person in there, I   m  good to go.  Were you a creative child?  35  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  To a degree. I wouldn   t say I was always doing art. Art wasn   t a big  subject for me or anything like that. But I think I always thought  creatively and I was always a good idea kid. I was always very  imaginative, I think. Looking back, I was always creating places to play.  I would take all the quilts out of the closet and make a fort and stay there  for a week. Those types of things I was really good at. I wasn   t big on  taking some construction paper and some Elmer   s glue and some  scissors. That wasn   t me, but I could imagine stuff, I think is a better  way to look at it.  Was that nurtured?  That was nurtured. My mom is a very creative person. She can draw and  sew and those things interest her to a great deal. My dad is very  analytical and very structured and is very meticulous with his hands.  He   s in engineering and machining and he can create that way. He has  the entire Colorado Midland Railroad in our home that he built from  scratch. And that   s talking about little pieces and building the engines.  He can look at a photograph from the 1800s and re-create a building. I  can   t do that, I just go nuts. Because my attention span, I can take a  picture. I can hang in there for about 250th of a second or whatever my  shutter speed is and then as soon as it   s over I   m like,    Okay, on to the  next thing.    So yes, I do get that from my parents.  And I   ve seen that in my daughter. I have twins and my daughter is very  creative and cannot get her hands on enough paper to draw enough. And  my son   s just the opposite. He   s got to have all the boxes and  everything   s got to be organized and he doesn   t find the same enjoyment  from creating. I can see that in them. There   s that whole right-brain, left-brain  thing.  Sometimes artists experience conflict with their creativity. Did you  experience that in school or with friends? Or do you think that creative  people sort of naturally navigate, generate, kind of come together, like  each other?  You know, it   s funny, because I get along with creative people from  other genres. I think that   s why I get along so well with musicians and  singers. But I think it   s rare that if you get a lot of photographers  together, if they   re there together for more than a day then everybody  starts to kill each other. (Laughter) And the same thing with musicians. I  guess that   s why so many bands break up. I think it kind of crosses  artistic tables. (Laughs) So that   s why I can get along, I can talk with  musicians or artists or sculptors or whatever. It   s funny because here at  school, we do a lot of teamwork projects and collaboration projects.  Some kids handle it well and some it just drives them bonkers. I can  36  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  totally understand because some kids want to take over and control     I   m like that. I see my vision and this is the way it   s going to be. And if  it   s not, then somebody else takes care of it.  This project sounds like it was very open-ended. Did you have any prior  experience with developing and conducting a creative project at this  scope?  Not at this scope.  Or smaller scopes?  Yeah, I did tons of projects with the Tulsa World that were week-long  projects. The project I did before this I spent six months going over  Oklahoma shooting World War II veterans. That was a six month project  or a little longer, about a nine month project. Sixty portraits of 60 World  War II veterans, which was miniature in scale to this. But yeah, I   ve  worked on projects that are not just a daily newspaper thing, but nothing  like this. This is a different animal all together. And it   s kind of funny, I  look at it now, and my na  ve approach to it probably helped me because  if I would   ve known what I was getting into, I probably would   ve fretted  more over it as I was doing it. But just going out and doing it, it  probably freed me up just a little.    Hey, cool, book. All right, let   s do  it.    You know and looking back on it now, I   m like,    Oh man, I   d do it  so much differently,    and I probably wouldn   t enjoy it as much as I did.  What would you do differently?  Well, I would be more organized, probably. That   s a really good  question, I haven   t thought about that too much. But just organization.  What do you mean by that, organization?  Well, just knowing where I was going and when I was going to do it.  Because a lot of times it was just shoot from the hip type stuff. And  there were certain things that I missed along the way. I wanted to get the  Prison Rodeo in the book at McAlester and I missed it by a week just  because I didn   t pick up the phone and call. I would   ve loved to have the  Prison Rodeo in my book, it would   ve been fabulous. Little things like  that.  Okay, so how did you prepare to do the book? Did you read anything in  particular to get ready?  I didn   t read anything. (Laughs) But what I did was I worked the phones  like a mad man. There were several people, I think we   ve already talked  37  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  about Michael Wallis, but I called Michael. I used the Oklahoma  Historical Center to a very big degree. They were kind enough to meet  with me several times.  Who did you meet with there?  Oh, who   s the director?  Bob Blackburn.  Bob Blackburn. I   m embarrassed that I didn   t remember his name, but  Bob drew this picture here of Oklahoma. We sat down at his desk and he  took scratch pieces of paper and he drew out the state of Oklahoma. And  he said,    Okay, railroads and highways. Okay, oil and cattle. Okay,  cities. And this one is       he talks about Muskogee, he draws lines  through Muskogee. The Texas Trail, which is highway 75, 69 ran from  the top of the state through Texas, through Dallas and on down. That  was called the Texas Trail. Then the Arkansas River flowed through  Muskogee. So Muskogee was supposed to be our big city because of the  waterways, the railroads, and all the roads ran through Muskogee. That   s  what he was trying to show me in this sketch. And so I kept them, little  things like that, and we put them in this little compilation page and you  can see his sketch there. That   s Bob   s, that   s his little sketch of  Oklahoma, which looks kind of like a cow. (Laughter) But anyway, he  was extremely helpful.  He was kind enough to call me, for the Centennial that year they had a  reception for all the living governors in the state and he thought enough  to give me a phone call. And I thought,    Yeah, I   ll be there.    I got a  great shot. I actually shot a picture for the newspaper and it was a shot of  them all prim and proper. I sent that one to the paper for the next day,  for the next day   s paper. Then I waited. And then they started hem-hawing  each other and joking and then I shot that one and I saved that  one for my book. So I wanted something a little more casual for the  book and that   s what made it into the book. Little things like that was a  big help to me.  I wanted to pick the brains of people that really knew Oklahoma. And I  didn   t necessarily want to read about it, I wanted to hear it. I wanted to  hear it in what somebody said. I wanted to hear Michael Wallis say,     Kelly, you need to be standing on the corner of blablablah at  blablablah.    I wanted to experience that, you know. Or when Bob said,     Hey, you need to drive down this road.    I wanted to drive down that  road. I was trying to think of some more folks that really helped me  along the way, but those are two that stand out. I had several people at  the World that helped me, to be quite honest. Randy Krehbiel helped  38  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  quite a bit. I really tried to use the people at the World that were in the  know. I used our Native American reporter, Susan Ruckman. She helped  me quite a bit just to get contacts and to call people and to feel people   out  for where I need to be and at what times and those types of things.  I used the Tulsa World, the resources we had there, a great deal. I used  our reporters in Oklahoma City. The Tulsa World has an office in  Oklahoma City. I used them quite a bit to get the politicians and people  at the capitol to cooperate. Things like that.  Did you have to make your own phone calls?  Sure. I did everything.  Did you wish that you had somebody to do that for you?  No, I wanted them to hear from me. I wanted it to be,    Hey, this is Kelly  Kerr. I   m coming. I   ve got my camera.    That was part of it. That was  part of the experience is I wanted to do it. I generated all the content, I  made the phone calls, I got the car, I drove the miles, I pulled the camera  out, I shot it. That   s what I wanted.  Did you take notes when you were making the phone calls?  Not necessarily with the phone calls. But I took a lot of notes when I  was at some place or I would write down what a place would look like  or what I was feeling at that time, things like that. I   d put    very tired    or     exhausted    or    elated    or    happy    or    I got a shot, I   m so excited.     Talk about Michael a little bit. We talked when you were at OSU for the  OSU Author   s event, which was in February during Research Week.  Right.  And it was actually during the creativity part of Research Week. It was  really cool that you came over for that. You were sharing some stories  about Michael and the book but we don   t have those on tape, so that  would be great to have.  Michael Wallis   I love Michael Wallis. When he speaks, time stands  still. He was so generous to me and I think it was established back when  I took photographs several times for the newspaper. We kind of hit it off  and he appreciated my skills, I think. Obviously, I appreciate his skills.  And I just knew, I knew he would have something for me. Something  more than I could get out of a travel magazine from Oklahoma or  whatever. So I called and we had several conversations. I called him  from the road several times. I have a whole section in the book about  39  graves. I got on the phone with him and he said,    Kelly, if you want to  really get a nice slice of this thing they call Oklahoma, find out who   s  buried here.    And I went,    Okay, great.    And he told me, he said,    Ma  Barker and her boys are buried up in Blue Jacket. Drive down Country  Road 35 and then turn to the west and the sky will hit you in the       you  know whatever.    And then have a chicken fry at blablablah.    And so I  did. I did exactly as he told me and it paid dividends, big time. And then  I would call back and share with him about my experiences so I kind of  fed him as I was doing it. So that was great.  Of course, I included him in the Route 66 section of the book. I took a  portrait of him in his office in Tulsa. Then there were several sections of  the book, the Route 66 section, obviously, it was so interesting about  that. Here   s where I   ll have to start from the beginning. Mark Brown, the  guy that we need to talk about, he designed the book. He and I sat down  together. The Route 66 section, which was the last thing I photographed  for the book, I told Mark,    Mark, you   re coming with me. We   re going  to do it together.    He said,    Great,    because he   s totally into that thing.  Mark has a pretty good handle on Oklahoma as well. He   s a great writer  and designer and has done a book on Grant Hastings, who invented  Hasty Bake grills in Tulsa back in the    30s and he loves Oklahoma type  things. So I said,    Let   s do it together. Thelma and Louise, we   re going  to hold hands and we   re going to go off the cliff together.    So we drove  up 44, into Joplin   or not quite to Joplin, but then turned around at  Baxter Springs, Kansas and pulled onto Route 66. Pulled off the side of  the road, checked our watches, hit the odometer, said,    Okay, here we  go,    and we drove down together.  Going into it I thought,    Okay, we   re going to have a lot of old signs and  old hotels and greasy spoons,    but it wasn   t about that, it was about the  people of Route 66 and the characters. We got to Commerce, Oklahoma  and this big guy walks in, greasy shirt, and we sit down and start talking  to him. We   re in the little hamburger shop in Commerce. The guy had  just been elected mayor of Commerce that morning. And so we   re like,     This is too good. It   s too easy.     Then we drove all the way across the state. We stayed on the route like I  said, went all the way across the state. Then we get to Erick and we run  into Harley Russell, this guy, he and his wife have a store there and  they   re friends with Michael and like,    Oh he   s an old scallywag,    and  the whole deal. Sure enough, we walk into their store and he   s holding  court with a room full of Norwegian bikers and they   re eating peanut  butter and jelly sandwiches and drinking whiskey. Harley has a bag of  Lay   s sour cream potato chips and I have a picture of him and the  moment   you can see it in the book   he   s holding them, he   s walking  towards me, there   s Norwegian bikers behind him, I shoot the picture, he  40  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  walks up and kisses me on the cheek. I   ve got potato chips all down the  side of my face and I turn to Mark and I said,    I think the book is done.  Let   s go home.    (Laughter) And so we went home and I called Michael  and I said,    Michael, you   re not going to believe this but we found  Harley Russell.       Oh-ho, you found Harley, well       So that was the last  hurrah of the book. I said,    I can   t do any better than this.    So yeah,  those were some of the really good ones. It   s always about the people.  The places are great, but the people are better. Now I don   t even know  where we started with the question, but that   s where it ended.  Oh that was great. It   s okay, we can go any direction here. Okay, now  we   re going to get into the introduction section of the book.  Okay, sure.  So if you want to turn to that.  I can turn to that. Let me find it. Will there be homework afterwards?  Will there be a test because I   m not for sure if I can pass.  No. I spent a lot of time developing these questions.  Did you?  Yes.  Well good, at least somebody did. All right, let me find   oh there it is.  Yeah and there   s Harley right there holding a Norwegian flag on Main  Street of Erick, Oklahoma waving at Norwegian bikers. Okay, there you  go.  There   s Harley, okay. So from there we   re going to move into this. One  of the things that struck me about the book when I was trying to step  back from looking at the pictures and seeing how it was put together and  everything was that the introduction is on pages 18 and 19 of the book.  And that is a little different placement from most books. So can you talk  about that a little?  Absolutely. The goal was since I had control of the situation, I wanted it  to be a photography book. And the original plan, what I told the World is  I want photographs and cut lines. Each page to be   we first started and  there was going to be like maybe six photos on one page and then maybe  five on this one and maybe two on the next one and then cut lines. I was  like,    No, I   m not going to do   I want big, beautiful photographs.    And  so as you go through the book, 99.9  of the book is one page, one  photo, one page, one photo. Then we wanted some information at the  41  bottom. And we were very careful because some cut lines are just very  short, depending on how much explanation was needed, that   s the  information we gave. We didn   t want to get too, we didn   t want to  write   we wanted people to form their own ideas about what we were  looking at. But there were some pictures that definitely needed some  explanation. We did need some kind of,    Hey, this is what this thing is  all about.     Randy Krehbiel, who is a long-time writer at the World, fabulous writer,  fabulous writer. Great guy. Again, another guy that   s in tune with  Oklahoma. We handpicked him to write the intro. I didn   t want to write  the intro. I wanted a writer to write it. But what we did is we went back  into a little closet at the Tulsa World after it was all done. This was  written after it was done. He said,    Tell me about your experience.    I  told him how I felt in my heart. It didn   t take ten minutes. He said,    I got  it.    And the next day, he emailed me this copy and said,    Tell me what  you think.    And to be perfectly honest, I was so blown away, I cried for  awhile and then I actually showed this to my wife. Just the copy, I just  sent her the copy, no pictures. I forwarded it to my wife and said,    Read  this.    And she goes,    What have you been up to?    And she cried. And I  was like,    Okay, I think it   ll work.     You know, and Randy, I will brag on Randy. If you read this, it is the  most outstanding hunk of Oklahoma literature you   ll read. I swear with a  stack of bibles he wrote it off the top of his head. There are things about  Oklahoma in here that the common person will have no clue. I mean he  basically spells out the history of Oklahoma, weaving my history into it,  and then talks about, I was trying to think of some   the naturalist  Thomas Nuttall, I mean okay, come on. But no, he seriously set down  and just started typing this stuff out. That   s why we wanted him to write  it. Because he was going to come up with stuff and he would get the  book and what it   s about and understand what we were trying to  accomplish with the book. And what I love, I mean love about what he  did is he finishes with a quote from Lynn Riggs Green Grow the Lilacs,  which the play Oklahoma  is based off of. And I just went nuts. I said,     This is just the most beautiful thing.     We finished with that and then I finish with a picture from  Discoveryland of the girl that played Laurie. I took this book to her and  gave her a copy and autographed a copy to her, which I had met her  during the year taking her picture. She didn   t really know me, but we  knew who each other were. I handed her a copy (she was from Georgia,  from Atlanta, Georgia) and I said,    Here. Hopefully you   ll look back on  your time in Oklahoma fondly.    I autographed a copy and gave it to her.  She looked at this and just lost it. Because playing Laurie, that   s part of  her life now. There   s another layer of this book and what it means. But  42  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Randy just knocked it out of the park. Just beautiful, beautiful words.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, it   s stunning.  Oh yeah, I mean it captures the passion. And the love.  Yeah, and it   s only four pages. Just right here and right here. And he did  it. He did it.  And his passion and love for Oklahoma, for history, married with your  passion and love for the project and your work. Yeah, it   s great.  It   s fantastic.  Okay, we   re going talk some more about the introduction. There   s a  couple of sections if you want to read those.  Sure, yeah.  We   re talking about the introduction here and some of the things that  stand out in the introduction to me as a reader is that it conveys your  philosophy and process, both. On page 18, when you say that your,     normal inclination is to take the obvious shot then turn it around and  go at it the other way,    what do you mean by that?  Well, there   s a good example. One of my most famous photographs, that  has nothing to do with the book, but it   s a perfect example of what I  mean. I was in Chicago, Illinois at the PGA Championship, which oddly  enough, Tiger Woods had won. And when Tiger wins a tournament or  whoever, when they   re holding the trophy and you see all that pomp and  circumstance, it   s totally staged. It   s basically for TV. Because he   ll  have his watch on, whoever his watch contract is with and whatnot.  Well, when I was in Chicago at Medinah at the PGA, all the  photographers had run down in a big herd and got onto the green and  they positioned Tiger where the background looked real pretty and I got  shoved to the back. And being 5   9   , I wasn   t going to get a picture. I  was getting very frustrated and it had been a long day. So what I did was  I put all my cameras down and I grabbed one camera and I put it on my  hip and I walked around to the side and I focused on Tiger and I slowly  walked behind him, just firing away. There   s all these cameramen and  they saw me and they are all like,    What   s that guy doing?    yelling.  So what angle were you getting of him?  43  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  I was behind Tiger shooting back towards the photographers. But the  end result was Tiger Woods holding a trophy with 200 photographers in  front of him. So you got to peer into what his world looked like for just a  moment. (Snaps his finger) That   s what I do. I try to take the obvious or  all the clich  s and then say,    Okay, what   s the opposite of that?    I can   t  think of any other specific examples, but you can wind it up by saying I  really try to fight clich  s which you see a lot in photography. You know,  we battle   I see a lot here, the students, if you give them an idea, the  first thing you think of is usually what you get. So I try to tell them,     Think beyond that. Think what would be, you know,    I do that a lot  with my portraiture. Like if you take a weightlifter, well they send me  out and say,    Take a picture of a weightlifter.    Well, I would normally  take that weightlifter and then go try and find a ballet class and put him  in the ballet class. That   s what I   m talking about. That   s how I try to  approach everything I do. I try to stay away from exactly the   I don   t  want to get too obvious with my photographs. I try to kind of turn it on  itself a little bit.  Okay, so part of that then, back to the Tiger shot, is perspective.  Sure. I mean that   s photography. I had one guy tell me when I first  started, he said,    Kelly, photography   s just where you stand.    And I  thought,    What? You   re crazy.    But it really is. If you know how to  operate the camera and can do that, then it   s all a matter of where you   re  standing or where you   re sitting is what the shot   s going to be. We do  that a lot, we found that a lot. You speed the clock up to the PGA at  Southern Hills in Tulsa, Tiger wins again. We   ve got five Tulsa World  photographers each at a different location shooting the same thing and  then whatever perspective looks best is what   s going to be seen in the  paper. It just so happened that I was by myself in Chicago, but yeah, I  mean it   s perspective. If you can find that perspective and show it, and  especially when it   s more interesting to people, it pays off. I found that it  has paid off for me many, many times. If you go that extra, give that  little more, nine times out of ten, that   s the one.  What percentage of photographers do you think shoot that way? 50 ?  No, no.  Less than that?  Way less.  People aren   t trained to do that.  I don   t think so. I think it   s here. We have an interview process here and  44  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  we interview students to get in our program and I tell them upfront, we  can tell them all kinds of things about the program,    Well you   re going  to do this, you   re going to do that, blablablah.    I don   t really care about  that. I tell them,    I don   t care how much photography knowledge you  have. I don   t care if you   ve never picked up a camera and I don   t care if  you   ve been handling a camera since you were five years old. That does  not concern me in the least. I can teach you how to take a picture. What  I   m concerned about is what   s in here. Do you have that drive and that  motivation and that passion for the craft? If you do, then I want you.  And you   re going to be great and you   re not going to give me excuses.  And you   re not going to do this, you   re not going to   and that   s what it  takes. When the chips are down, who   s going to deliver the mail at the  end of the day; who   s going to haul it, who   s going to get that shot that  nobody else is going to get?    That   s a rare thing. I mean that   s what  separates the wheat from the chaff.  How did this approach develop in your work?  It was just built within me. I mean I just don   t settle. Never have and  hopefully I never will. I do that in basically everything I do. It kind of  gets me in trouble sometimes because I always want, want, want. I want  the best. I want that one shot that nobody else has or that shot that makes  people go (Gasps). I do that in class, we do critiques of work and if  somebody throws a picture up on the monitor and the class goes    ooh     or    aah,    I   ll go,    Hold it. Wait, wait, wait,    and I   ll tell that  photographer,    Remember that. Remember that sound, remember what it  feels like. Go for it every time. Try to get that.    You know, I wanted that  shot in the paper where everybody   the buzz around Tulsa was  everybody was talking about that shot that was in the paper. I had people  tell me and I   m not trying to be braggadocios about it, but people would  tell me that,    Hey, I don   t have to look at your credit. I know it   s your  picture.    That was the one thing. That was the ultimate compliment  because they just knew it was my work by just looking at the picture,  they didn   t have to see my name. And that was nice.  That is. On page 19 you talk about that almost no one turned down your  request for a photo and that everybody was curious about what you were  doing. How did you explain this project to them?  Well, part of the thing that nobody turned me down I think is just  Oklahoma. That   s our state. I   ve said it a million times, but we   re a  bunch of folks. We   re just nice people. I know that sounds like a clich  ,  so I just kind of turned my own thing around on myself. But it was true.  99.9  of the book, any time I put the camera up and tried to take a  picture, people were like,    Yeah, okay, fine.    Then they   d go,    Hey,  what   s going on here?    And I   d be like,    Well,    and then I   d have to  45  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  explain. Especially the farther away from Tulsa I got. If I   m in Watonga  or Weatherford or Sayre or Gotebo I   d have to go,    I work for the Tulsa  World and here   s what I   m doing. And this will come out in blablablah  and here   s what we   re going to do.    They   d go,    Okay, yeah. All right,  fine.    I   ve had some people call. Some people in the western half of the  state that aren   t readily available to the Tulsa World and the advertising  that went with the book, they   ll go,    Hey, you stopped by my place way  back. Where can I get one?    Then I   d say,    Yeah, here you go.    Then  some people I just delivered them or mailed them a book because I  wanted them to have one. So there were people that remembered, then  some that are just,    Just another day, no big deal.     So did the Tulsa World give you freebies to give away and things like  that?  Oh yeah, I   ve handed out quite a few. We actually had that, we sat down  when the books came in and we tried to sit down with a list of people I  wanted to give books to and they allowed me plenty to give away, which  was nice.  What does the print run? How many are they doing at a     Today, I don   t know. The first run I think was 5,000 or 10,000. Then I  don   t know, I don   t know their plans today, since I   m away from them.  When you were talking to people, explaining the project to them, and  people were receptive to this, was there anything in particular about  your personality you think that enabled you to be able to do that?  I think so. Absolutely. As you can tell, I   m kind of a talker. What I try to  do, Karen, is I try to talk to them first. Unless I saw something that,     Wham, I gotta get it.    More or less, I tried to just sit down and like I  said, I settled down around so many kitchen tables during this project  just chatting with folks. Because I love that stuff. And it shows. I try like  the dickens to tell my students,    If you   re going to be a photographer,  you   ve got to be a people person. And I don   t care if you   re going to be  a commercial photographer in a studio all day with a bowl of fruit. You  have to be a people person.    That   s part of my success. I will credit that  to my success as much as my talent with a camera. Is my talent to talk  and get along with people because especially if you   re genuine, I mean  you can tell, if somebody   s genuine, loves what they do, it shows. I  loved learning about the   for me, like I said, adventure. I go back to that  word adventure and that was part of it. I was on a big adventure to figure  out what we were all about. So pictures were just part of it. If I look  back on it now, you know, I   d probably take a video camera and some  sort of audio recorder with me and it would be a book and a DVD and an  46  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  interactive thing and I   d kind of go    Wow.    But you know.  You   d probably need five years to do that.  (Laughter) Yeah, I know. So time being what it was,    Way back in    07  we did this.     Okay, also on page 19, you talk about the Pawnee Pow-Wow  experience. I would like to hear that in your own words. It   s one thing to  read it, but to hear it in your own words is even better.  Yeah, probably the greatest event of the book. I still can   t even believe  that it happened. But Susan Ruckman, who was the Native American  reporter at the Tulsa World called me. Because I told her,    Susan, you  see anything out there that you think might make a good picture for  me       because I was really concerned about making sure that I  represented the Native American influence of our state properly. I  wanted to show that its due respect. So she called me and she said,    Hey  Kelly, the Pawnee tribe   s having a thing,    and she goes,    I   m not for  sure what it is, but you may want to check it out.    She was working on  other stuff. She   s like,    If you want to go, here   s when it is.    I was like,     Cool, that   s great.    It was a Saturday. So I take off to Pawnee and I get  there and I mean they have their little outside of downtown, you drive  down and their little ceremonial area   s down there. I mean it   s packed  out. Cars everywhere.  So I drive up and I had my cameras on my shoulder and I was just going  to kind of observe what was going on. It was really odd. What it was,  there were two Caucasian gentleman sitting in the middle of the ring and  people around them dressed in the full regalia and they were doing the  ceremony. And I was like,    Now this is going to get really interesting.     So I started walking around and I was asking a few questions and come  to find out the one gentleman in the ring was from Nebraska. Somehow  over the years, he had learned that his ranch in Nebraska was the land of  the original Pawnee nation. He took it upon himself, he had made  contact with the Pawnees before and they had exchanged phone calls  and some information. But come to find out, he lived on their land. He  and his wife took it upon themselves to take the deed to their ranch and  hand it back to the Pawnee nation. He stood in that ring and he said,     This is not mine. It   s yours. Do with it what you will.     And he gave them their land back. Now oddly enough, I was the only  media member of any type there. I would think that something of this  magnitude, if it were known properly, I mean there should   ve been  national media there for that matter. I just couldn   t believe what I was  witnessing. They made him an honorary member of the tribe. The deal  47  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  they worked out is that he keeps his ranch. You know, they   re not going  to kick him off. But if anyone wants their remains to be buried there  from the Pawnee nation, they can. Or any family members or any  members that are currently buried, they   ll exhume their remains and take  them back and they can be buried in their native land.  Now, the picture you see here is a little Pawnee woman shaking this  man   s hand. She   s crying and I take a picture of her shaking his hand,  talking to him. She walks off, I go over and grab her and say,    My  name   s Kelly Kerr, I   m with the Tulsa World. I   m doing a book           Yeah,    she says,    all I can remember growing up is my grandmother  talking about the trip down from Nebraska to Oklahoma. I grew up with  those stories. I went up to this man and thanked him for doing this and  how much it meant to me and my grandmother, who passed away many,  many, many years ago.    And I thought,    Okay, this is just so far beyond  anything I   ve ever gotten into.    I mean, that   s the good stuff. That   s the  meat of the thing and for me to be able to experience that, in some small  way and to be able to put it in my book is just special. That   s what it  was. I still just can   t believe that nobody was there to witness it. It   s just  amazing.  That is amazing. That   s wonderful. On page 20, you say when you  started the section where you wanted to tackle the world.  Yeah, yeah.  Would you read that part there?  Let me find it, I   ll have to find it.  It might be right around the paragraph where I started getting all  these        I started getting all these fantastic photos of all these little towns. And  as they started to pile up I thought,    Well, you could do a book just about  small towns in Oklahoma,    which that may be my next book, anyway.     As a worthwhile idea as that may be, it was not the premise of this  book. I had to figure out a way to start it and finish it. That   s when we  came up with the idea of doing the alphabet in Oklahoma towns. Small  town Oklahoma from America to Zeb.    That actually made it more  entertaining for me. To look at a state map and say,    Okay, I need a C-town     and see a place called Cookietown down by the Red River and  say,    Okay let   s go down there. Let   s go see what   s down there,    Kerr  said. He invoked personal privilege to include Happyland, the place  where his mother was raised and his grandfather   s cattle auction barn  was in Roff. The rest were chosen more or less by whim. Some, like  48  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Ultima Thule, loosely translated as beyond the last known place, are  literally off the map. Others are well-known if not exactly well-visited.  Slapout, for instance.    Should I continue?  No, that   s good right there. At what point of the journey did this occur to  you to go at it from this     Well, probably about half-way. Because I had all these great little  vignettes of these little towns and it was wonderful, but they were just  piling up. I was like,    Oh I have to figure out a way.    Because at first we  had these grand schemes of how we   re going to organize the book.  Weather and it was some silly ideas. And then it started to become  music and food and we had military and the graves and Route 66. And  so I wanted   I had these small towns, I thought that could be a section  within itself. But how do I do it? And I thought,    Well, why don   t I just  do the alphabet?    And so it was fun because it was like,    Okay, I need  this letter. Let me go see what would be good.    And it was hard  sometimes because you had a couple of towns that had some great     started with you know, you have Hooker and Happyland or whatever.  And so that was a dilemma in itself. I had Happyland where my mother  grew up and then I had Hooker. Well, both were great names so what I  did is I shot the church in Happyland where my grandmother attended  and included that in the religion section and then put Hooker in the little  town section. I figured it out but sometimes it was a little hard to gauge  that. But it was fun to see what we could come up with.  Did you zigzag or backtrack with this method when you started going at  it that way?  Oh sure, yeah. I mean there were places that I had been. There were  several times that I had to go back to places that I had been before and  say,    Oops, I missed it.    And I   d go back. I mean this was a one-time  shot and so I was like,    I   ve got to go back.    Really the only place I  didn   t go back to   well, not only, but pretty close, was the Panhandle.  That was a one-time shot. Everything else I covered pretty close to a  couple of times, several times depending on where I was.  How did ideas come to you? Did you have dreams about this?  I would stay awake at night. I still do. When I do my shoots today I get  an idea and I   ll just lay in bed thinking. It drives my wife crazy. But  yeah, this one I would think and I would come up with a great idea and  I   d just have to do it. Yeah, it drives me nuts. Literally. It   s just an itch I  have to scratch and I   ll figure out a way to do it.  I think that   s who you are.  49  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Yeah, yeah it is. I mean that   s my make-up. And even today if there   s a  picture    yesterday, I just had to shoot pictures and so I shot pictures all  day. Just luckily I   m a photo teacher and it works out. (Laughs) But  yeah, I shot all day long. Just stuff around here.  This is a little sidetrack here, but I   ve been doing this research project  over the poet who lived in Lincoln and Creek Counties and so coming  down here to interview you in Okmulgee, I   m taking a lot of the little  roads to come down, just so I can feel her sense of place.  Sure, sure.  Where she lived when she was a child and a teenager. And right after I  went through Shamrock I came around the road and the road curved  and the redbuds were just flaming on either side of the road.  Yeah, yeah.  And my camera was in the trunk. (Laughter) I was like,    Golly.    So I  drove a little ways and then I was like,    I need my camera up here.     Yeah, sure, absolutely.  I missed that shot so on a certain level I do know what you mean about  that.  Yeah, absolutely.  On page 20, you say that,    There are obviously some things that had to  be in the book. You couldn   t have a book about Oklahoma without  them.    And then you go into Route 66, which we   ve already talked about  a little bit. Then after you talk about Route 66, I think on page 21, you  talk about music and your selection of musicians. And this was  interesting.  Right. Well, Oklahoma has a very wonderful musical heritage. It   s so  just hodgepodge and makes it not like Nashville or L.A. or New York.  We have this cosmic space country thing and it   s awesome, I love it.  That   s one thing I love about Oklahoma. And so I started to think,    Well  I love music. I want to put music in the book.    It   s going to be part of  my thing, it   s just part of my life. Part of my photography. So I thought,     Okay, Garth, Reba, Toby,    you start naming the megastars, right? So I  started thinking,    Okay, I   m going to go after the   I   m doing it. I   m  Kelly Kerr and I   m going to call Reba McIntire   s deal and I don   t care if  she   s in Hollywood, I   m going to go. And Garth   s just up in Owasso, so  I   m going to get Garth. And then I started to think about it. I said,    No,  50  Neurohr  Kerr  that   s not my book. That   s not this project.    I thought,    I need to go  deeper.     It   s not the obvious, I   ve got to go beyond the obvious. And that   s when  Red Dirt, western swing, Cain   s Ballroom, and Woody Guthrie, those  type of things that are the heart of what our music is about. And the  music that grew out of Oklahoma and is still growing   the Flaming  Lips, Leon Russell. I can   t think of one single guy that has influenced as  much music in the world as Leon Russell. You   re talking about a guy  that worked with the Beatles, a guy that worked with the Carpenters. I  mean you can   t get any more diverse than that. There was a time in  Tulsa where you could drive down Third Street and George Harrison  may be riding his bike down the road to go see Leon at his studio  because he   s spending the week with Leon. Things like that, in  Oklahoma.  I had to kind of catch myself and say,    Okay, yeah, would it be cool to  have Garth and Toby and all that? Sure. But it   s not the essence of the  book.    And so I had to dig deeper. We did some really nice things.  Obviously the Woody Guthrie festival was an easy one, but I called my  buddies in Stillwater and we did a Red Dirt reunion photo at the farm  where it started, which was great. And luckily you know, like the  Flaming Lips and bands like that that just aren   t your everyday thing.  But it goes beyond that.  I went and tracked down Florence Birdwell who is a voice teacher at  OCU. She has, I think, four students on Broadway and I think three of  them have Tony awards. She has a little piano studio on campus at  Oklahoma City University and teaches voice to these wonderful  students. Things like that that aren   t your top-shelf things but are just as  relevant. That   s the fun part, to go find that. And sure, I set with  Florence who is of retirement age, I don   t know how old she is but you  know, she was telling me,    Kelly, if they can   t sing, I   m going to tell  them. And I   m going to tell them with an expletive.    I mean she was this  saucy lady. And no wonder she   s successful. That   s Oklahoma music.  So that   s what I had to go find.  Did you already know about her?  I was trying to remember how I found out about Florence. There was a  reception for her. They were paying homage to her. It seems like I found  out maybe through the Miss America people. I can   t remember. I was  trying to track down somebody somewhere and they said,    Man, you  need to go see this lady.    And I said,    Okay.    And so I did, I called her  on the phone and she said,    Yeah, come on by.    We sat in her studio and  again, I photographed her in about 30 seconds and I sat there for an hour  51  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  and we just talked. She didn   t know me from Adam, but we talked.  When you mentioned Leon Russell and his influence, that made me  wonder about influence and if there were other people in the book that  you chose specifically because of their influence in other ways.  Sure. Well, I mean it   s obvious if you look at Oklahoma, you start right  at the top. I mean I   m an OSU Cowboy but I   m not na  ve enough to  think that the king of Oklahoma is OU football. So I called Barry  Switzer. Now, I had taken Barry   s photo a couple of times over the years  for one reason or another, but I got his cell phone number and I called  him, told him what I wanted to do. I told him he   d be great. He said,     Yeah, let   s do it.    That had to be a part of the book. Same thing with  Eddie Sutton. I got Eddie   s cell phone number, called him, told him  what I was      Sure, yeah.    Same thing, both of those gentleman, we  spent a minute taking a picture and a half hour talking. They didn   t have  to talk to me you know, but they did.  Then, it   s really funny, my father went to school with Barry Switzer at  the University of Arkansas, so there was a little connection there. Barry  in the meantime has actually   actually the picture that   s in the book,  I   ve made eight prints of that for him so each of his children and each of  his grandchildren have a copy of the picture. So that was great that I  could share that with him and that it meant something to him and  because it meant something to him, it meant something to me. Those are  the gifts that you really   that   s so much more than a paycheck to me. I  got paid for doing the book but that   s the good stuff.  The things that stay with you.  Yeah, sure.  We   re at a point now where I would like to work through the book with  you. If you want to just start at the beginning I guess.  Okay, I can start from the beginning.  And I don   t expect you to talk about every picture, you know, that   s not  what we   re trying to do here.  Sure, sure. Well I can walk quickly, I mean we can do this.  Let   s page through, but do be sure and give page numbers so right now  you   re talking about the endpapers.  I   m talking about the endpapers, this is an actual list of Sooners. These  52  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  are people that crossed the line early for the Land Run. This is a typed,  submitted list by the Fifth Cavalry back to the United States government  of people they arrested for crossing the Land Run early. So these are  actual Sooners. And that   s, I think, I found it.  Were there names that you chose that particular section for?  No, it   s just      It was just random?  It   s just the way it happened and actually they   re different. The ones on  the front inside cover are different from the ones on the back, so there   s  different names in there. But there   s Sam Lu, Chinaman (it gives their  nationality and everything so I thought it was fairly interesting). Then  the opening shot is the Panhandle just running out to the middle of  nowhere, kind of gives a view of Oklahoma. Then we come back with  the Runestone and for those that don   t know what the Runestone is, it   s  the rock in Heavener where the Vikings actually carved into it, which is  fascinating and that kind of opens the book. I had this picture here, this  is one of my favorites, this was actually Mark Brown   s, the guy that  designed the book, this was his favorite photograph.  The garage sale?  The garage sale in Coalgate where you have the little girls and the old  ladies together. Then you have a picture of angels in the middle. And  that was just a drive-by thing. I was just driving down the road and bam  I saw it and wheeled in. The opening page, which I read earlier, talks  about me. This is the brick walkway at a ranch in Locust Grove. I was  there shooting pictures, just happened to look down and there were my  hometown and the town I live in juxtapose and I thought,    That   s got to  be a picture.    The opening section of the book is really neat. What we  wanted to do was we wanted to go from rural to urban, rural to urban,  rural to urban, rural to urban, as we got smaller and smaller. So we start  out with kind of a Dust Bowl look out on I-40 in western Oklahoma to  come back to Tulsa. And I started with Tulsa because that   s my  hometown.  This was shot from the Mid-Continent Tower. Everybody thinks I shot it  from an airplane, but I was sitting on top of the tower. Then I go from  Nowhere, Oklahoma and then Oklahoma City. Then here   s a view from  Cordell of an old wind-blown farmhouse and then Bartlesville, which  my wife   s from Bartlesville and you have Frank Lloyd Wright and Frank  Phillips, the two Franks going together. Then you have Mount Scott and  then Guthrie, first capital of Oklahoma. And then the capital in Cordell  53  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  Neurohr  Kerr  or the Washita County Courthouse, which is a great looking courthouse,  and then Black Mesa. So we went b
