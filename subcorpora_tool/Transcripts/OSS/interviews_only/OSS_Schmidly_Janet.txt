 Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  This is Monday, April 16, and I   m in the Angie Debo Room at the OSU  Library with Janet Schmidly, who has been the First Lady of OSU for  the last four years, and this is Jennifer Paustenbaugh and I   m the  Associate Dean of Libraries. We are going to talk about the Schmidlys     time here at OSU, about some of the accomplishments, and about what  life holds ahead. When you came here, you had already been a First  Lady at Texas Tech University for several years, and so I know that you  came into this role with some expectations from your previous role.  Could you talk a little bit about what your expectations were and how  those have evolved over the last four years? What it is that a First Lady  is expected to do, what did you want to do, and how did you want to  define that role?  Having been a retired schoolteacher, I had taught twenty-six years, my  whole career dealt with youth and children and being involved with  them and then our own two children. So everything that I had done at  Texas Tech really revolved around the students and where I wanted to  go with the students. Since that is my expertise, that   s where I usually  go. That   s what I know best. In addition to being on several other  committees and boards here in town, that became my focus. Let   s look  at student issues; what do students need, what would they enjoy doing,  and how can I get to know them better? This led to many of the other  things. I feel like you always need to go with what your expertise is,  what you know best and where your interest is.  You   ve given me such a perfect lead in   I wanted to ask you about the  Parents Association and how that came to be because I feel that could  be identified as your legacy on the campus, the formation of that very  important organization.  Actually I hope it is, I really do, because I feel like it   s such an important  step for every major university to have a strong involvement of the  5  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  parents of their students. All the research lately, and in the last few  years, has shown the involvement of parents with their students now.  Back in the late sixties and seventies, the students were pushing their  parents away, and now the pendulum has gone back the other way with  cell phones, e-mails, the internet. Students are in touch with their parents  two and three times a day. That is a known fact. It   s documented. The  parents are paying so much more now for education. They want to be  involved. They want to be a part of that. Also, I had many parents say,     You know, all through school, high school and grade school, I was  always involved with my child. Why should I all of a sudden shut the  door and not be involved anymore? It just left a void.    So, knowing that  OSU had a strong Greek society here, which is wonderful   they have  Mom   s Day and Dad   s Day, and that is     Right, parents are really involved in that.  Parents are very involved with the Greeks, but there are a lot of students  that do not belong to the Greek sororities and fraternities. I felt like they  also needed to have their parents involved and feel a part of the  university. So the Parents Association really evolved, in my vision, as an  overall umbrella association for all the parents, Greek, non-Greek   all  the parents at OSU   to give them a place to come, to have activities, to  be a part of the university. We have an e-mail, an e-newsletter that goes  out monthly with lots of information that parents need to know, like  when to get shots, when pass/fail is up, when to pay bills, just anything  happening on campus. It has information about tents prior to football  games where parents can stop by and gather and get to know each other,  family weekend   giving them a sense of belonging to the university as  well. We have a lot of first generation students here, so we have a lot of  parents that maybe did not go to OSU or any university. This gives them  a sense of belonging and a place to go, and when their child wants to go  off and be with their friends, they still have something to do.  Right.  Another thing that we started was called the Posse Pit Stop.  Yes, that   s a great program.  Well, this came about while talking to one of our Board members. What  is something that we can really do? What do parents want? And, of  course, number one is that we want our children to be safe. There was an  unfortunate situation in another university where there was an accident  due to a car that was not in tip-top condition and there was an injury. So  as we were talking we thought,    If students could have their cars  checked prior to University major breaks to know that there   s not  6  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  anything significantly wrong with their car         because in Oklahoma,  especially out in western Oklahoma where there are few and far between  towns, if a car broke down or something, it would be difficult.  In some of those places you   d be lucky to even get a cell phone signal to  call AAA.  Exactly. Absolutely. And so, let   s come up with what we can do for that.  By going to some of our garages and car dealerships, we got them to  agree to, free of charge, to inspect student cars   a general inspection of  the hoses, the belts, the water and all of that, with just showing their  Student ID, and so students can continue to do that. I have had personal  e-mails from students that have lived out of state and across Oklahoma,  down into Texas, that have actually used this and have e-mailed back  saying,    Thank you so very much, you know, they found a problem.    I  even had a girl tell me that the dealership found a problem with her car.  She didn   t have the money to fix it, and they fixed it for her.  Oh, that   s really nice.  That   s the Cowboy spirit. That   s what OSU is about. If I had been here  longer, (Laughs) we were going to expand it all across Tulsa and down  in Oklahoma City and have the Posse Pit Stops all across Oklahoma.  Because if they do have a problem, then students would have a list of  dealerships they might call wherever they were that would come help  them out, as you said in western Oklahoma or someplace. But, I am  proud of that. I think that is worthwhile and actually it has been  documented, put in newspapers and presented at other parent association  meetings across the United States.  Oh, okay   as something that they might want to consider adopting     Right.  What a great idea.  And I feel good about our organization, even though it   s young. Fran  Gragg, who is the coordinator, has attended many conferences where  they talk about the parents groups and she comes back with a lot of  ideas. We are happy that many of them we have already been doing.  That makes us feel good that we are either ahead of the game or we   re  on top of it and we   re meeting the needs of our parents.  And another goal of the organization is to have a parent club in all of our  counties in Oklahoma, which we are growing. We already have one  down in Texas, and   in fact, our president of the Parent Association is  7  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  the head of the parent club in Texas   so it   s expanding and it   s doing  well.  That   s great.  You can tell I   m enthusiastic about it. (Laughs)  I think that it was something long overdue here and   I came here from  the Big Ten where a lot of Big Ten schools have parents associations  that were really active and supporting different things. I know at  Wisconsin and Indiana they were really involved in supporting the  library, and so I was really surprised when I got here that there just  wasn   t an organization like this and I   m so glad that that has come  about. So many different groups benefit already and will continue to  benefit as it grows.  I haven   t said this but one of the first things that we did as an association  was to give scholarships. Every year the Parent   s Association gives  student scholarships. They also give a stipend to a faculty member and  to a staff member because the parents felt so greatly that their students  would not be successful if not for the faculty and staff that helped them,  so scholarships are given and that   s one of the main focuses as well, of  the Parents Association.  That   s great. I have seen the list of recipients from last year, and I was  really surprised when I saw that a faculty member and a staff member  had received a stipend. That   s very nice recognition.  We started with a steering committee, an original steering board  committee, and they laid out what they wanted to see. Danny Stith     many people know Danny as a great OSU alum   he really did  spearhead that. Everything that has been done, really, has been from the  parents themselves, what they wanted.  Was there a parent   s organization or association at Texas Tech?  Yes.  And is there one at New Mexico?  Yes. A lot of ideas I drew from Texas Tech and from Texas A M. And  everybody knows about the Aggies and the Aggie spirit and  everything   but they have what they call a Mom   s Club     That   s one I   ve heard about, yes. (Laughs)  8  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly     and it just rules the roost. I know how important parents are. They   re  your best recruiters. They   re your best networkers, and if they   re happy,  they will support you, and if they   re not, then we need to know that.  Right.  We need to give them a way to let us know what needs to be done.  It seems like they   d be a really important part of the whole retention  portion.  It is, absolutely.  Well, that   s great. That   s been really exciting to watch develop. Now I  know that, in addition to starting the Parents Association here, that you  have been involved with a myriad number of organizations on campus. It  would probably be difficult in the space of this interview to talk about all  of those, but what are some of the involvements that you   ve had that  have been particularly meaningful to you.  On the campus?  Yes.  Well, as I said, I really enjoy being with the students. I like being with  the student government leaders. Saturday night we drove to Ponca City  for the wedding of a past Student Government Association president,  Lauren Detten.  Oh, she got married? Oh, I didn   t know that.  She got married   gorgeous wedding. A year ago, we promised her we  would be at her wedding, and so promises are promises, and we drove  up there. But having said that, it was wonderful because not only did we  see beautiful Lauren get married, but Joe St. John, another past  president, drove in from Tulsa, and Wei Lee from Oklahoma City, who  was president when we first came and they had come to her wedding,  and so it was really a great reunion to see all the past presidents.  It   s always hard when you come to a new university, for people to  accept you and to get to know you for who you are and it   s not like  you   re just coming in. Everybody knows you, but you don   t know  anybody, and these student leaders were so helpful to us and so good  that I truly appreciate them. I loved working with Kent Sampson in  Campus Life. Kent is just the best, and I laughed at him. I said,    Kent,  don   t you dare call the University of New Mexico and tell them to hide  9  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  if they see me walking down the hall,    (Laughter) because every time I  would see Kent, I would come up with a new idea, (Laughter) but he  was always so wonderful to say,    All right, let   s do it   let   s do it.     David and I were involved in so much of the Walkaround and the Lights  on Stillwater. I think this is the first administration that actually had  tables set up and did handouts for Lights on Stillwater. I remember  giving flashlights and, you know,    President   s Office focuses on  students.    Last year we gave out water and     Which is always appreciated when it   s so hot out there. (Laughs)  Yes, and I think it said,    Quenching the thirst for knowledge.     Oh, okay, how cute. (Laughs)  I think this is the first administration that really got involved with Lights  on Stillwater and we enjoyed it. Of course, we attend all the athletic  events.  Well, I know that one of the things that I think was started in this  administration was the President   s Posse.  Yes, yes.  Can you tell me a little bit about that because they were involved in so  many events that the two of you did?  Right. Well, here again, having been at other universities, it   s nice  because you can pick and choose the good that you want to bring with  you, and Texas Tech had it and, of course, Texas A M also had this,  but every major university has an ambassador group that represents the  president or chancellor   s office. We had them at both other universities  so I wanted to establish one here. It spun off the Student Alumni Board  because they were the ones that gave the tours, and I knew they knew  everything about the campus. They also were good students that could  handle extra duties and activities, but I wanted it to be more diversified,  so we opened it up to applications and the interview process, and we   of  course, we called it the President   s Posse because the posse member  rides with the President. They helped us entertain and host events at our  home, at the President   s home, in the stadium, in the suites, or in the  basketball suite or anything over at the Alumni Center   wherever     whatever the President hosted, at student events plus adult events, or  alumni events. Also, they were very good at meeting and visiting people  coming in, say at the airport, and escorting them and just talking to them  on the way back to campus or to an event. We had meetings   monthly  10  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  meetings   where they would sign up and they had requirements that  they had to work two events per semester. We had thank-you cards with  President   s Posse on them   and so when they met someone very  important or one of our wonderful donors or just an alum, that next  meeting they would sit and write a short note, just a personal contact  from the student.  That   s a really nice touch.  It is, and so many of our alums really appreciated that. It felt like they  were so special that a student would take time to do that. This was  networking for them, too.  Absolutely. What a fabulous idea. (Laughs)  The first meeting after they were selected, Debbie Strickland talked to  them about manners and etiquette and how to do introductions and how  to make small talk with somebody. All of that was very helpful. When I  first said we were going to do this, I thought these kids are going to roll  their eyes. They didn   t. They were very engaged, and we did this all  three   four years. We had someone come in with etiquette training.  They had questions. They wanted to learn because they knew that this is  part of your success in life.  I   m a little frustrated now because the interviews were to be this spring  and since, you know, we   re not President anymore, the kids were not  sure how that was going to work out. And so last year we had fifty-six  applications and we could only take forty maximum. This year we did  not get enough applications because everything was in limbo, and so I  don   t know what the new president is going to do. That   s one of the  things you have to accept when you leave. Some things survive. Some  things don   t.  Right.  I   m really hoping that whoever comes in will see the importance of this  and start it up again and try to get it to grow, because I think it   s  important.  Well, typically how many years would a student participate in this?  We only took juniors and seniors.  Okay. So two years     Two years.  11  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly     would be the maximum?  Right. We only did juniors so at the end of their sophomore year they  applied. Then they could serve their junior and senior year. One of the  nice things that they got from that is when they graduated, they would  have a nice letter of recommendation from the President if they were in  good standing which, of course, they are. But that   s something nice to  put in your file, a letter from the President. And many of them have gone  on to medical school and law school and   yes, David has written letters  for them.  Well, that   s wonderful. Tell me about the experiences that you   ve had  being involved with things, either locally off campus or in the state. I  know that there are things that you have been involved in. If you Google  Janet Schmidly, it   s amazing what you can find     Is it really? I   ve never done that.     because people put their newsletters online and their announcements  about this and about that     You might need to tell me what   s online. (Laughter) Obviously, I   ve  never Googled myself. I don   t think I want to.  I think a lot of people don   t, or you get curious when someone says,    I  Googled you.    I get calls out of the blue from people I haven   t talked to  in twenty years and they   re like,    I Googled you.    I think,    Oh, that   s  kind of frightening    but     It is.      for instance, I had seen that you had been involved with the starting  of the Mya Gonzalez Foundation and some other things, and your  involvement in United Way and in the Magic Empire Council of Girl  Scouts, and I know that Ann Halligan before you also was just incredibly  involved in the wider Oklahoma community. How do you pick and  choose the things that you   re going to be involved in?  Well, here again, I try to narrow it down to what I know best   students.  On the Mya Gonzalez Foundation, I was a special-ed teacher for most of  my twenty-six years, so that had a very special interest to me because of  all of my years teaching special-ed children and autistic children and  Down syndrome, and just education in general. I knew about the Rise  School, so when this came about I said,    I   m on board. Count me in,     and I am so proud of Mary and Jimmy Gonzalez, at how much they have  worked and how organized they are   and it   s going to happen, and I  12  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  think what a coup that it could be here at Oklahoma State     Oh, yes, absolutely.     in central Oklahoma   that is going to be a wonderful recruiting tool  for many parents and for people in this area and in the whole entire state  that I   m going to miss. I will definitely keep up with it, but I   m going to  miss being involved in that and seeing that complete and actually  helping children.  I was on the Stillwater Public Education Foundation Board, and I  enjoyed that greatly, too, because I saw the other side of it. Having been  a school teacher for so many years, I was, you know, down in the  trenches and it was wonderful for me to be able to give back from the  other side to help do the fundraisers, to help plan the recognitions and  the grants and everything, and give back from the other side.  That must have been real satisfying.  Yes, it was fun, and one year I was principal for the day (Laughter) and I  got to go to Will Rogers Elementary School and walk around the school  and everything and it just   oh, I felt so comfortable to be back on  campus again and with all those kids and everything. That was fun. Of  course, I was going to be on the board of the Girl Scouts, and I had to  resign from that, but I enjoyed being the honorary chair for the years it  was held here in Stillwater. Actually, I asked our interim president,  Marlene Strathe, to give a talk two years ago, and she was wonderful.  I wondered if you were the one that made that happen.  Yes, yes, and I was so impressed. She did a wonderful job talking about  how a girl from a very small rural town, I think she said her graduating  class had like ten or fifteen in it, and now, you know, all the experience  she   s had because of her education   and now she   s interim president of  the university     Right.     but anyway, I enjoyed that. I was also going to be on the board of the  Special Olympics, and had to resign from that. It   s amazing when people  find out that you will work, and I never accepted a job or a position I did  not think I could work on. If I did not have time to do something, then  I   ll say no, because if I say I   m going to be on something, then I   m  going to do what   s needed, and   just like SPEF  Stillwater Public  Education Foundation    on Taste of Stillwater, I will be there and pick  up the tables and clean up and do it to the very end because that   s what I  13  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  said I would do. So I had to kind of pick and choose and mainly do the  things that I knew I could fulfill.  I think it   s interesting, the whole role of the First Lady and I really think  that it   s been in the last twenty years   and I could be wrong   but it just  seems like that role has changed and really expanded, and it is a full-time  job. I am saying First Lady, but today it could be the husband, too.  When they hire a President, they hire the President   s spouse and     Yes.     how do you become prepared for that role? You talked about that you  gravitated toward doing things that are comfortable for you, but is there  any way to prepare for it? Did somebody mentor you or     No.  No?  No. (Laughs) I belong   well, the whole university belongs to an  organization. It   s called NASULGC  National Association of State  Universities and Land-Grant Colleges .  Right and I saw that you were the secretary for their     Well, no, I   m president-elect     Oh, okay, now.  Now   now, and we have our planning meeting in May.  Okay.  Then the following year I   ll become the president, thinking I was going  to be here at Oklahoma State and now I   m going to be at the University  of New Mexico. But there   s a council for presidents    and chancellors     spouses, and we do have men there. It   s not just women. We meet  separately and we plan our meetings. I   m going at the end of this month  to the planning meeting. We have a whole day of presentations and  discussions of what we need. I started attending those when we were at  Texas Tech. The very first one I went to, I thought,    This is where I  need to be,    because everything presented is what needed to be heard     how to entertain, how to live in a university home, some of the pitfalls  and the things you need to know, how to give interviews, just sharing in  the afternoon. The mornings are all set out and we have presentations     but in the afternoon, we get together and just have a one-on-one talk, and  14  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  that   s where things really come out. It   s amazing, all over the United  States, every spouse deals with the same things. When somebody would  say something, you could see the heads nod because everybody goes,     I   ve been there. I know.     So, no, I never really had a mentor. Fortunately, I started on a small  scale when David was CEO of Texas A M at Galveston on the island,  and it was a very small island, but he was a CEO and so I was able to  gradually ease into it. It was a very social setting there, and then every  place I   ve gone you tweak it some. You know what works, what doesn   t  work. But the main thing is just be yourself. I   ve had many people ask  me,    Do you feel like you have to dress up every time you leave the  house or         well, no, I go to Wal-Mart in my blue jeans like  everybody else. I   m still Janet, but as far as what you do outside and in  your position, you just be yourself and it all works out.  So is the University of New Mexico part of NASULGC? Is there a state  university part?  They   re a state university. They   re not land-grant, but they   re a state  university, and they have always gone and they have always had  representation there.  Right.  But, yes.  Oh, that   s good.  On the state university level.  Okay.  It   s a really good organization for universities, and as I said, I truly enjoy  and get great ideas and support from the people in this organization. And  our men are very vocal as well, because they even have more of a  unique     Right. I mean, they are sort of in uncharted territory     Exactly.     in a way. At least the women, they   ve figured this out for, you know, a  long time and seeing other people do it, but     Absolutely. One time we had an attorney who was known for  15  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  negotiating contracts for university presidents and chancellors, and he  came and presented benefits for spouses because the big debate now is,  should the spouse be paid? Should they be a paid employee or should  they just have benefits. That   s the big debate because a lot of spouses  have had careers and they leave their career and just become the spouse  and do all of that, or do they maintain their career and they   re not able to  attend and do all these things because maybe they   re an attorney or  teacher or whatever? So that   s the big debate now, whether spouses  should be paid.  Well, I can see why it would be somewhat of a debate. I think about all  of these women and if something happened you would have liked to have  had a work history with Social Security and that kind of thing. You  sacrifice   they sacrifice a lot.  Especially if you give up your career.  Right, exactly.  But on the other side of the coin, if you are not under a contract or a pay  contract, if there is something you really did not want to do, then you  were not obligated to do it.  Right.  So it   s a two-sided coin.  I can see that there would be a lot at issue. So you taught for twenty-six  years. At what point did you decide to leave that (Laughter) and was  that a very difficult decision?  Oh, very. I still miss it. I started teaching in Lubbock, Texas, taught at  Champaign-Urbana, Illinois and then College Station, Texas for most of  my teaching career. When David became CEO at the Galveston campus  for A M, I thought,    Okay I   ll retire.    Our children were out of high  school, so I left and told everybody goodbye, moved to Galveston, was  miserable, and so after one year of retirement, I went back to teaching     back to my same school in College Station.  Oh, wow.  I commuted     Now how far of a commute was that?     on the weekends   it   s three and a half hours, through Houston   I  16  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  know, it was crazy. When I think back, I go,    What was I thinking?    But  for three years, every Friday afternoon I would get in the car and drive to  Galveston and spend the weekend and do all the social things, get back  in the car Sunday afternoon and drive back to College Station and live in  a condo and teach school. So I did that for three years and then when  David left Galveston to go to Texas Tech, which was nine hours, I  thought,    You know, I don   t think I can do that.    (Laughs) So I went,     Okay, I   m going to try retirement again.    So I retired again and  decided   by that time I had enough years in that I could retire under the  Texas Teacher Retirement. I actually worked for Texas Tech for one  year to get twenty-seven years into the system. I helped them write a  grant for an area of the town of Lubbock that was going to get a lot of  state money for programs for their youth, and we had this huge grant to  write. So I directed the grant writing, so they gave me one more year  into the system.  How did you decide on education as a career in the first place?  You know, back then there were not that many careers. You would be a  secretary, a nurse or a teacher. (Laughs) And I, of course, liked teaching.  But there were not that many choices back then, and it fit well with the  fact that David was going to go on and get a master   s and a PhD and all  of that.  Sure, so you knew you would always be in a community   too, which  valued education which makes a big difference.  And I knew I could always be near a university where I could go back  and get another degree or get a certification or do whatever   which is  what I did at Texas A M. I went back and got my special-ed  certification, so that helped.  So how did you decide that you wanted to teach in that area, because  that seems like such a challenging area?  It just evolved. You don   t ever really totally plan out your life. I did  regular education for a few years, and an opening came up as a Chapter  One teacher for remedial reading and I took that and loved it and did that  for nine years. Then I got a certification for special-ed and had a crisis  room, which I truly enjoyed because I was able to reach all the children  in the school including   we had some autistic children and some Down  syndrome children. I was also in charge of discipline (Laughter) for  several years, which was unique. But it evolves. You don   t really plan it.  I was fortunate that I taught in a school right across from Texas A M,  so we had good students whose parents knew how important education  was to their children.  17  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Right. They were going to be involved.  Exactly, and even though they were graduate student children or  whatever, that was the focus. And then my teaching family were just like  family. I   m an only child so my friends are very important to me. I had  the best of all principals, and my teaching family so I enjoyed every  single year of it.  Now talking about your family, you don   t have brothers or sisters and  you grew up in Texas?  I was born in Missouri.  Oh, okay.  St. Joseph, Missouri and moved to Texas when I was a child and grew  up in Dallas.  And you are a graduate of Texas Tech?  Yes.  I had seen somewhere that you, because you had been a speaker at the  Beta Tau Alpha event maybe last year, were an alumni initiate at Texas  A M     Right.  All right. Well, I just wanted to make sure because I thought you  graduated from Texas Tech. So how did you meet your husband, while  you were a student at Tech or     Did you ask him this?  No, I didn   t. (Laughter)  I just want to make sure we coordinate our time. (Laughter)  But I will now that you   ve asked that question. (Laughter)  I   ll tell you the truth. I just want to know what he said. Actually, it was a  blind date. (Laughter) His roommate and my roommate had dated the  previous year and had always tried to get us together, and we both were  too busy dating other people, so the first football game of our sophomore  year, they finally got us a date, and that   s it. (Laughs) So it truly was a  blind date. (Laughter)  18  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  So much of your time here has been doing things on campus but what  are your personal interests and how do you find time to sort of keep a  hand in those things that really are important to you personally?  Well, as I mentioned to you earlier, I have a ninety-five year old mother,  and being an only child, she is my responsibility, and I take that very  seriously. So you just set priorities, and she   s number one in my priority  list because I   m the only one she has. I go see her every single day when  I   m in town. I juggle it around all the other places I need to go.  Fortunately, David is very understanding and allows me to do what I  need to do. We have two children that I speak to every single day. We   re  very close.  One lives in Connecticut and one lives in Albuquerque?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes. And we have two grandchildren by our daughter, and so we   re just  a connected family. I always try to think if I had to make a decision  about which to choose, do I do a family thing or do I do a university  event or who is asking me to do this and that. I don   t know if this is right  or not, but I always ask myself,    Fifteen years from now, which is going  to remember where I was the most?     Right.  Is it going to be my granddaughter or is it going to be two hundred  people at an event? That   s the bottom line, and so that   s kind of how I  make my decisions. You just can   t do it all. (Laughter)  That   s right.  Who   s going to take care of me when I   m ninety years old? I don   t want  to make anybody mad.  Well, do you have any hobbies?  Oh, I love to read. I love to garden. One of the things that I did break  away from my child-oriented activities    when I was at Lubbock, I was  on the Lubbock City Beautification Committee. It   s a city committee  and then on the campus beautification   you know, poor Lubbock. It was  kind of barren and     I   ve never been there before.  19  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  You   ve never been?  I just have this image though in my mind   kind of the image that people  have of Oklahoma who haven   t been to Oklahoma.  Yes, exactly. Exactly. Even I was surprised at the rolling hills and the  lakes in Oklahoma.  Yes. And the trees. (Laughter)  And the trees. People think that of Lubbock and it   s not that bad either.  You can always use more trees in west Texas and so there was a campus  beautification committee. We had a great time doing that. I love to  garden and plant things and, of course, now I   m moving to New Mexico  where there   s nothing but ground, but I   ll find a way.  I was going to say that   ll be a whole new challenge.  It will be   all these arid plants and desert plants and whatever, but we   ll  find a way. Reading, being with friends   it   s interesting. I   ve never  played golf. I   ve never done things like that because I   ve always either  taught school and juggled that with being a mother, or being involved  with David in what he does, and so it doesn   t leave a lot of time to really  develop your own interests that takes a lot of time. I worry about that.  Someday, I   ve often thought about David when he retires, he loves to do  research and write, and I think,    I   m the one that may have the worst  time in retirement. What am I going to do?    Because I   m so used to  getting up every morning and     Having something to do.     having something to do, and then juggling that around groceries or  cleaning or talking to the children or whatever. I may be the one that   s  going to be in trouble, but I   ll come up with something. I   ll probably  volunteer again.  Well, I think that gets in your blood and it   s hard to stop doing.  Yes, yes. We   ll see.  Well, this is a great follow-up question to something that you just said     do you have any advice to offer to women who are trying to achieve  balance with their family and their career and other obligations that  they may have in their community or     Well, I think you have to set your priorities and stick with them. One  20  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  thing I learned, you asked me if I had any training for the job but one  thing I learned when I was in Galveston   being such a very, very small  community   even smaller than Stillwater. I was young   much younger,  and I was always worried about what people would think, and you have  to lose that. You can   t worry about that. If you   re happy with yourself,  and if you know you   re doing the best you can do, make your decisions,  set your priorities and then don   t look back. Don   t look back.  Yes, that second-guessing is what really hurts you.  That   s what wakes you up in the middle of the night. Set your priorities,  and if you feel in your mind you   re doing the right thing, then you are.  Well, let me ask you a couple of questions about the next phase of your  life, of going to New Mexico, besides being close to your   is it your son  that lives in New Mexico?  It   s our son.  Besides being close to your son and his family and the beauty of New  Mexico, what are you most looking forward to about going there?  Well, we had planned it   life is amazing. You asked me how I got into  special-ed and it just evolved. It is the same thing with this. We   ve had  youth ask us if we planned it,    How did you plan out your life,    and you  just don   t. But five years ago, we had purchased an auction item from  the athletic auction at OSU for four days at a condo owned by an OSU  graduate in Taos, New Mexico. So we took some friends with us and as  we were driving back to the airport in Albuquerque, we had some other  friends in Placitas, which is between Santa Fe and Albuquerque      Let   s  stop off and see them,    so we did. Well, there was a house for sale and I  said,    Oh, that house is fantastic.    It was all adobe and pitched roof and  all that, and we kind of looked at it, came back home, talked about it,  and   at that time, we did not own a home and so we went back out a  couple of weeks later and looked at it again and bought it. (Laughter)  Well, you were lucky it was still available.  And we were, exactly. So we thought this is a great place to vacation  and have our children come here because they love to ski. They love to  backpack. Santa Fe is just thirty-five miles north. There   s just so much  to do here because when our children come home, it   s not home to them  because they didn   t grow up here, so we wanted to find a place where  they would want to come see us plus have things to do. So we bought  the house and have used it since then for vacations and thinking  retirement down the road. Well, things evolved, and look what  21  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  happened? So one of the things that I think that I   m going to enjoy is,  number one, being there before retirement to give us an opportunity to  meet a lot of people.  Right.  And when you retire it   s so much harder to get out in the community and  meet people. Well, now we   re going to have that network of people and  friends and knowledge of the state and knowledge of all the important  history of New Mexico because, like Oklahoma and Texas, New Mexico  is rich in history and so I   m looking forward to that.  So will you be able to live in that home while you   re there or will you  have to live closer to     Well, we   re going to do both.  Both, okay.  Actually we   re going to do both, and we   re going to put our  possessions   our things in both places because the house already has  quite a few things in it because we   ve been going out there. So we   re  going to put some things at the campus house. The University of New  Mexico has a historic adobe house on campus, which is just lovely, and  we   ll put some of our private things upstairs and use that for when we   re  in the city, late nights or early morning meetings or whatever, and then  also use our house for whenever we can get out there   because it   s  about twenty-five miles north of Albuquerque. So we   ll juggle back and  forth.  And you   ll just have to remember what stuff is at what house. (Laughter)  Well, I know. I   ve kind of been doing that anyway, (Laughs) so, yes.  Is it difficult at all to get excited about being a First Lady for the third  time? (Laughs)  Yes. (Laughter)  I just wondered how you would gear up to do it again. Everybody  expects you to come in and be excited and they   ll expect you to hit the  ground running because of all your previous experience. It almost seems  like more pressure maybe.  You know, actually there was more pressure   and I probably shouldn   t  even say this, but there was more pressure coming here because Ann  22  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Halligan was such a wonderful First Lady and everyone loved her so  much. But when I came, I had three different groups ask me point-blank,     Are you going to be as nice as Mrs. Halligan?     Oh my gosh. (Laughter)  Yes, and so I told them   in fact, I almost told David I   m not going to do  this because I felt like I was just being set up for failure.  Yes.  And so I think the pressure was even more coming here because she   s  such a wonderful person, and Ann and I have been friends through this  NASULGC organization for many, many years. But I just thought,    Oh  my goodness,    you know,    I   m constantly going to be compared to  Ann,    and I probably am. But the University of New Mexico, they   ve  had quite a few turnover of presidents and spouses. Their last few have  not been real involved. So, I   m going in kind of being able to do my own  thing and to be as involved as I want to. There   s not that high  expectation that there was here.  Well, that   s great. I   m glad that you didn   t shrink from being involved  here because you   ve done some really important things here.  Well, thank you. But here again, you have to just be yourself and do  what you think is the right thing to do and don   t look back.  Right. Is there any advice that you would have for a spouse of a person  who   s just accepted a position as a university college president?  (Laughter)  It   s interesting because I think of Marlene Strathe and she   s newly  married. Her husband is wonderful. He is just a fantastic man and I think  of John.  Did he know what he was getting himself into? (Laughter)  I   m sure he didn   t because this happened   bam. When did they get  married? October, I think, and who knew? We didn   t know. And like  I   ve said so many times, you just go in and feel your way through it. Do  what   s comfortable for you. Be supportive of your spouse because there  are good days and bad days, and keep your chin up. Keep a smile on  your face because it all works out. We   ve had so many wonderful people  thank us for what we   ve done and say they   re going to miss us, and I  hope that we will have left OSU just a little better than when we came  because I think the university is just right on a roll, just ready to really  23  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  have greatness, and I really feel like David came in and dug through  some of that stuff that needed to be done and has OSU ready to go.  Yes   yes. He did some of the hard stuff that had to be done that some  people didn   t like.  Take the nods. Take the hits. Keep a smile on your face, and let me tell  you, he really did a good job because I know it hurt. A lot of the things  hurt. It hurt both of us deeply, but he could just stand up there and take  it, and Calvin Anthony said,    You know, the worst part about some of  that is having you sit in the back of the audience and hearing it,    and it   s  not easy.  Right.  But when you   re in the public eye that happens. That happens.  Well, I was just thinking about this as you were talking, and   whether  it   s difficult to be nice   to turn around and be nice to people that you   ve  just seen give your husband a really bad time. (Laughs)  It   s harder for me.  It gets kind of ugly, yes.  It   s harder for me than it is David. David can do it. I   m a woman and a  mother and a     Well, that   s what I think about it. You know, I don   t get offended really  easily when people say things to me, but if they say it about my kids or  about my husband, it   s a whole different     That   s right. That motherly instinct comes out in you.  That   s right.  But I think   oh my word, you   all of these   the President and all of the  people in public office and everything   oh. Because I do know Laura  Bush. We knew them when we were in Texas and everything, and she is  such a nice, quiet person. She   s just a regular person like I am   a  schoolteacher and everything. She never thought she was going to be,  (Laughs) you know, First Lady of the United States and to get up every  morning and just hear criticism after criticism after criticism, it   s tough.  Right.  24  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  It   s tough.  That would be really difficult, and just to be in the public eye so much.  Yes. Their children, their two girls, are   what are they now   twenty-something  years old? They have always had some sort of security, either  a state level or a federal level. They have had security following them  every year of their life except one. Can you imagine?  I can   t.  Being young teenagers and every year of their life, but one. I would just  think, gosh.  Yes. That would change you in some way.  It would have to.  Yes.  It would have to.  That   s pretty amazing to think about. Well, is there anything that you  wish that you had had an opportunity to do at OSU that you didn   t get to  do?  Oh, probably complete some of the projects and finalize, firm up. I think  the Parents Association is off and going. I really think that   s going to  continue. I worry about the President   s Posse, our ambassador group.  Right.  I worry about that   nothing I can do about it, but I certainly do hope  that it is started again and continued on because that   s very important to  have our student representation for our alumni and for our top donors  and visitors. So I worry about that. I would have liked to have been on  the Special Olympics board, and I was asked a couple of times to be on  the Ronald McDonald House board. I   ve done that in two other cities,  but commuting. I just don   t have that many free evenings to commute to  Oklahoma City to do that, but someone will come up behind me.  Well, is there anything that you wish that I had asked you about that I  didn   t? I   ve asked you lots of questions.  You did a great job.  25  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  J. Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Well, sometimes there   s something that someone would like to say and I  haven   t given them the opportunity.  You piqued my interest. I may go home and Google myself. (Laughter)  Well.  I think you did a great job. Thank you very much.  Well, thank you so much for spending the time.  -------  -------
