 Sherman and I   m a member of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Today is September 15, 2009 and I   m at the  home of Dr. Billy Tucker. We are interviewing Dr. Tucker as part of the  O-STATE Stories Project. The focus of this interview will be about Dr.  Tucker   s work and especially on the Magruder Plots. Thank you, Dr.  Tucker, for this interview.  Thank you.  First off, can you describe your background? Education, family  background, and where you grew up?  I grew up in far western Oklahoma, fairly close to the Texas area. I was  there all the way until I left to go to school in Stillwater.  Now did you grow up on a farm?  Yes.  What kind of farming did you do out there?  It was the nicest thinking farms that there   s ever been.  Yeah?  It was me and my two brothers, my dad, and my dad had a good farm. It  did really good. There were two creeks that run through it so we had the  water. On the farm there was cotton, sorghums. We also had a huge  number of ones that were in on the cattle. So one thing that my dad did  was he had a large number of everything. (Laughs)  What county was this in?  5  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  It was in Roger Mills County.  Okay, what towns are nearby?  Well, Cheyenne. That was right on the edge of Beckham County.  Now, when did you come to Oklahoma A M?  Just as soon as I got through from   no, I started to say just as soon as I  was through from high school, but no, I went into the service for three  years. And that was busy. I was on boats over east. (Laughs)  Navy guy?  Navy guy. Then I came back home. My brother, when he got back from  being in the Army, why he started doing most of the farming. In fact my  dad kind of pushed away, he   d worked too hard. (Laughs) But he gave  my brother, Earl, the farm. He wanted me to stay there.  Your brother did?  No, my brother didn   t. My dad did. He wanted me to stay, but my  mother didn   t want me to stay at all. She said,    You need to get some  education and go from there. You need to go to Stillwater for that.    So I  got in the car and went to Stillwater. (Laughs)  What were your first impressions about campus and the town of  Stillwater?  Oh, it was more than I   d ever been in before. It was a good place. The  university was just fantastic as far as there   s a place to go and you knew  where to go for your classes. There were such good people, I thought.  Was Stillwater the biggest that you had ever seen before you came here?  No, but it was a good size.  Where were some of you classes? What buildings were they in?  The first one was the one right there, I don   t know how to tell you where  it was, (laughs) but it was right in the middle of where the whole thing  was. It was the center of it. And if I could say it, you   d remember which  one it was.  Was it the one shaped like a castle?  6  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  It may have been.  Right by the fire station?  No, it was on this way. It   s still there.  The Classroom Building?  Yeah. I think it still is.  Yeah, it   s still there. It   s still standing, it   s still in use.  And we had one room upstairs for our work. I thought it was a  wonderful place. It was soil science.  Were you involved in any activities? Did you join any student  organizations?  The only ones we had were those that were making them and sending  them to your class. There wasn   t any one of the big ones there. At that  time, it was the superintendent   s job to take care of that, too.  Now did you rush a fraternity?  No, I did not.  Any reason why you chose not to?  Yeah. I was too busy. And I had a job inside the building where the soil  laboratory was. I was getting fifty cents an hour for working on that.  Particularly   well, (laughs) I   m trying to think of where it was, but it  was at the top of the building.  What did you do for that job?  I just did work for them and they gave me a little bit of money and I  thought it was great. Then, it wasn   t very long that I was there that I got  married. I went back to Sayre and got me  a wife . Of course, I had  known her for all my life, just about. (Laughs) So she came to Stillwater  with me.  Did you live in the married couple   s housing at that time, once she came  to Stillwater?  No, I had a good response to what I wanted and I had a little house with  my wife. She had two kids while we were up there.  7  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Now do you remember going to any of the sporting events on campus at  that time?  I went to all of the football games.  What was the team like back then?  Wasn   t very good. (Laughter) You could lose a lot, I   ll say that,  regardless of who it was. But I   d walk from my house over to see it. I  couldn   t hardly stand it if I wasn   t going.  Did you go into any of the basketball games too?  Yes.  What was Gallagher-Iba like back then?  It was new then.  It was new?  Yeah. It was new and it was good.  Do you have any other special memories of campus from that time  period during your undergraduate years?  Oh, I have a bunch.  You have a bunch? Anything that stands out that you   d like to tell us?  Not really. But we did have a thing that was given to us at the end of the  season for how much of your things you had. I had the top guy in the  soil. They had some   I can   t remember the name, but anyway it had a  lot of guys would come over to it that their teacher had these names for  them and about all that we did that first year was to say who was one,  who was two, who was three. Kind of crazy now.  Like ranking them?  Yeah.  And your professors would rank you?  Yeah. So far, I mean they wouldn   t rank you if you didn   t really... And I  managed two of them.  8  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Wow.  The guys that I had that were the teachers, I just got in with them. I liked  them and they liked me.  That   s always a good thing. Did you have particular professors that you  remember?  I had Robert  M.  Reed. Do you remember him? Well, I had some I  can   t remember their names now. But yeah, I had them all. And the first  one was the old-timer, let me see who he was. Horace Harper.  So you had him as a professor then?  Yeah, he was a professor.  Wow. So we   re getting really full circle here. Alright, now after you  graduated from undergrad in agronomy, you went to the University of  Illinois.  Yeah. That was way past my time. I had been at OSU a long time. Bob  Reed was the one that told me after I was taking some things that he had  looked at after me and things, he said I should go to the University of  Illinois. And I said,    Yeah, but I don   t have enough money.    He said,      You   re  going up to Illinois and we   ll see what we can do.    When we  got back, why it wasn   t good money   I mean it was barely good money  but it was good. By that time I had two kids. So we had to get in our car  and go off to Illinois. But we found over there one of the finest men I   ve  ever been around.  And who would that be?  I thought you   d ask that. (Laughter) I   m getting where I can   t remember  anybody   s name.  That   s alright.  I   ve got his picture and if I look well enough I   d have his Christmas  card.  Oh, wow.  So I can find it if I can find my Christmas cards. (Laughs)  We can fill that in later too. So, now did you work on the Morrill Plots  up in Champaign?  9  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  No, I didn   t work on them but I saw the corn one. That   s the only one I  saw.  So you did your research on the South Farms at the University of  Illinois?  No. Well, I did some work in some of the farms but they weren   t  anything like that.  Alright, just checking here. What was the focus of your research up  there at the University of Illinois?  By the time I got there and was starting to work, they had all of the  elements and were making special gases. Having every one of them, if  they didn   t have all the information on nitrogen or on phosphorous or on  potassium, but they had somebody that already    then challenging on  what their growth in the soils were and what they should be. I got there  and I got magnesium. (Laughter) Well I walked around the whole all of  the     The fields?  Yeah. All over the country. They gave me the pickup to go do it. By  myself. So I got in the pickup and I   d done all these things and got with  people in the counties and got their information. And then, of course,  another Tucker, he was from down south of Illinois. Well, I   ll tell you in  a minute, I hope. (Laughter) They gave the two of us a building bigger  than this and that was for us to do our own work in this area and here   s  all of the things that are necessary to do the job. And his name was  Tucker. But no, never had seen or heard of him before, but when he  graduated, why, he found a job in Kentucky. I found my job in  Oklahoma and I hurried back. (Laughs)  Now how   d you hear about the position?  They called me.  They called you? So they thought you would be a good fit for the  program.  Yeah.  Who called you?  Oh, Dr. Harper.  10  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Okay. And this is in what year?  I   ll have to find that out.  Now we   ll get into questions concerning the Magruder Plots. Were you  initially assigned to oversee the Magruder Plots?  It was a year or two or three maybe after I was down here and doing  other things that I was told to do this, the Magruder Plots. Oh I was  talking to Horace Harper. He was the guy that I worked for in the shop  that I was telling you we were doing it every Saturday right there on  campus. He was still around, he had been gone and he was back when I  got back.  Now did you work on the Magruder Plots as an undergrad? Did you  have experience over there working with them?  We may have taken a trip over there to learn things, but that   s all that it  was.  Alright. Just curious. First off, can you define agronomy for me?  Agronomy is the production of things that have been gathered, growing  out in the fields, whatever   s there, why it   s there, that   s agronomy.  Okay. Now since the Magruder Plots are part of the Oklahoma  Agriculture Experiment Station, how does the Agriculture Experiment  Station work within the university structure?  Oh, very, very much. A lot. Still got a good plot out there.  What can you tell me about the history of the Magruder Plots?  This guy is the first guy I knew that worked in it. He was here between  1926 and    51. He   s the guy that started it when he got here again. I don   t  really know where it was at. There   s actually some areas that doesn   t say  Magruder that has all these others because they   re the same thing but it  says,    The first of the Magruder Plot caretakers to enjoy lengthy tenure  at Oklahoma A M College.    He was down here doing that because he   s  from Iowa. He came from Iowa down here. And he says,    Why study  our soils?    Then all these guys say,    I can tell you why I study these  soils.    (Laughs) It   s pretty important. The governor at that time was     Alfalfa    Bill Murray. You   ve heard of him, haven   t you?  Yes, sir.  11  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  (Laughs) So I don   t guess I answered your question.  Did he ever tell you how the plots were moved to the current location?  I think he did, but I   m not positive which one was going then. And  before that   and I heard about it, I   ve never even seen anything going  on over there at that place. When it was moved out to the field, why I  was surprised.  Now who were some of your students that you worked with over at the  Magruder Plots?  Back then it was    Here   s Webb, and here   s Westerman, and here   s  Billy. (Laughs)  Nice. And can you tell me their significance? What they   ve done since  working with you?  They had stopped and it wasn   t moving very good. So I call these guys  and said,    You   ve got to come see me.    And they did. They really did  like it. Of course, Westerman has been the author for awhile. Now, he   s  the guy.  What have they done since working on the plots? Like what   s Dr. Webb  done?  Pretty well to what we   ve said a few years ago. But in order to decide  what you needed to do, you had to take some test and see what you need  to work with. I   ve been asking them what they   re doing and they say  they   re still treating them about like they were when I left.  And can you describe how you treated those plots? What the actual  experiment was doing?  Yeah. By this time   this has been changing all through the years, but  I   ve been told that we can just leave them like they are now. When I say  that, you can still change potassium, you can still change phosphorous,  you can still change nitrogen. But once you do, you   ve got to see if it   s  still there. And if it was making the crop areas and particularly with  nitrogen, you can go and put some nitrogen on in the fall and then by  spring it   s doing much better. But it   s not worse enough that anybody is  saying,    Dig it up.    They   re saying,    You might put some more nitrogen  on if you see in the fall that that   s the thing to do.     I heard that each plot, you have one plot that is just completely left alone  and another plot manure spread on it, another plot nitrogen, another  12  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  one phosphorous, and then     Potassium.  Potassium and then I think there   s two more. Now is that correct, each  plot is measured and the stats are kept up?  Yes.  How are the plots treated? Like how is nitrogen actually put on the soil  or the phosphorous put in the soil?  Oh, they have the fertilizers that are on all   every farmer in Oklahoma  has these. This is to tell how much will do the job and what should be  used.  And with the fertilizers, is it a constant stream applied to  the plot  or is  it a one-time shot?  It   s not necessarily a one-time shot, but it   s a few times maybe. They go  out and take the samples. It   s whatever the sample tells you down at the  lab. Why you know what it   s going to be and if you haven   t looked at  what they   re doing, if you haven   t been out to the plots, you go out there  and you can just look and see the nitrogen has got everything.  Now has there been a time when the plots were in danger of  disappearing?  Yes.  Can you tell me about that?  That   s when the Magruder Plots were over right behind   which one  would you call it? Anyway, it   s the big room. It hadn   t been built yet.  The second one from the south of the lady   s     Oh, Stout Hall?  Yeah. And whenever they decided that they were going to do that, some  of these old-timers said,    No, you   re not. We got our plots over there  and we   ve got our work over there.    Well, they come up to see me and  asked me what they should do. I went around asking would they really  put that building right over the top of it and they said,    Yes, the  building   s going to be there.    So myself and some others said,    Okay,  but we   ll move it out to the farm.    And I think we told them if we   d give  them  10,000 we might be glad that we   ve got it. We   ll just move it over  13  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  there. And what you have to do when you move it is be real careful  because you have got layers going all the way up and how you are going  to take a truck from up here to not tear up your area. But it was pretty  well done when it was over.  Now I heard there was a second time they were in danger when the  athletics were eyeing to put a stair     Did you hear about that? (Laughs)  Yes, I did. Can you describe that for us, what was going on at that time?  Yeah. Real, real, real big. I   m the one that is making all the problems,  because I went and told them,    You are not going to have a building   if  you have a building out there you   re going to move it up north or  something. You   re going to leave this up there.    And it was strong  enough, I even went to Washington.  Oh, wow.  And I just told them, I said,    No. You can move them like we did from  building to building, but you   re not going to have a big something like  that going around.    So I guess it was me. They made a trip around  Oklahoma and we went to all of the guys that were growing these crops  and they said,    Well, we think that we can really make a big deal out of  it that you   re not going and ruining the Magruder Plots.    They had it all  put down that,    No, you   re not going to go and we   re not going to sell  that area for softball.    And they bought it. I mean it was bought in  Washington by the guys that are giving us money for these kinds of  things. They were all over them. Then, I went all over the state of  Oklahoma and told them what the deal was, and they said,    You   re not  going to let them do that.    (Laughter)  Now was this the impetus for getting the Magruder Plots registered as a  National Historical Place?  Yes.  Can you describe for me about that process, about how you got  registered?  We just went to see the right people. I forget who they were now. And  that was pretty simple and easy, they immediately said,    Yeah, okay.  We   re not going to bother you.    But see on that first deal, back in those  days, you go back to every farmer in the state and he believes you and  then he goes to Washington to tell them,    You   re not going to do it.     14  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  They didn   t do it.  I was asking how you got the plots registered as a National Historic  Place.  We did that and that was just easy to do. That was after we were telling  the people here,    You   re not going to tear it up.     What kind of training opportunities do students have with the Magruder  Plots?  Oh, they do have them coming out and showing them what this is and  giving them what each one of them are and which values are there and  that   s how that is. That   s done oh, four or five times in the spring.  Explain how the wheat is tested and experimented on.  The wheat? It   s not the wheat itself   well, it is too. It   s the soil volumes  of different things. And, of course, if you   ve got certain volumes that  you stick your probe down and get, why there   s no need of clipping it  off at that stage to the plants. Now after it   s harvested, yeah you do,  there   s quite a bit of sampling of the straws that   s out there. So that tells  you what you should think of next year.  Now, has mechanized farming hurt the plots?  Mechanized? I hope not. And I   m kind of thinking that maybe it doesn   t  hurt at all. But I wouldn   t say that there might come something. But so  far it hasn   t hurt.  Okay. Just wondering if it had any effect on it. Now the nitrogen, are  these just fertilizers or how does that work?  That   s fertilizer.  Just fertilizers?  Yeah. Ammonium nitrate, something like that, is good for the plant.  They   ll start really coming up and producing something.  I know there are different types of wheat varieties on the plots. Can you  possibly explain the differences in the wheat varieties that are within the  plots?  I could   ve before I quit. But after I quit, I really haven   t been there  enough and done things, that I couldn   t. If it gets very bad, I know what  15  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  a few of them will do. Like this in the middle here. He   ll tell me what I  should do. He   s my student. All the way through college. And guess  where he went when he was getting ready to go to a school that   s got  more?  He went to Illinois.  He went to Illinois. And it just so happens he hit the same stuff up there  that I did. I was just coming home and he was going up there. (Laughter)  And Bob Reed was the guy that got him the same thing up there at  Illinois that he and I had been there.  So a shared connection. Now, maybe you can explain not a variety but  the type of wheat that is used.  Hard red winter.  Hard red winter? And that was brought over by the Germans or who  brought that wheat? Or Ukrainian?  It wasn   t the   what was the last thing you said, Ukrainian?  Yeah, the Ukrainians.  I think that   s right.  So this wheat is a non-native species of Oklahoma?  Yes.  Is there a native species of wheat that   s grown within the state?  No.  Okay. What would you use this hard red winter wheat for?  Bread. That   s number one.  What other uses? Like would you use it for cattle feed?  You use most of that for hog stuff, if you   ve got extra. You don   t feed  the cows very much wheat.  What kind of knowledge from the plots has been implemented on farms  across the state?  16  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  When I left from here west was pretty even. There were some people  over east that didn   t want to. What they didn   t know was that it was  more important for the east people than the west. (Laughs) But they got  back into it. As far as I know, everybody   s using the right approach now,  that they get from here.  What about you? What have you personally learned from the plots?  What kind of knowledge have you learned?  Oh, real early a whole lot. I mean it was really, really big time. For  example, when it was over the one that got moved off   I remember that  some farmers would have yields up to 12 and 14 per acre. I myself went  up north of Enid and was doing that. It was a place that they had given  us to do the work on so we did that. The average yield of the wheat after  you increased it by using ammonium nitrate to go out went up to 50. So  that was big time.  And then my dad   s farm over there where he was, it went way up.  Because I just took him some and told him to get off the tractor, I was  going to put on something. (Laughter) I just put them here and here and  here. And later in the fall, in the winter he says,    What in the world is  wrong with this?    (Laughter) And so he got farmers all over the western  part of the state and they got together and they told me I had to come  and talk to them. And I did. And that   well, it would be green and nice  here and over here it   d be pretty poor. Because it had a lack of nitrogen.  Now did you have any mishaps working on the Plots? Anything you  realized that you shouldn   t have done?  I don   t think so. I can   t really remember anything. But I   m going to have  to tell you a story. There was a guy at the time that was   we were not  only nitrogen, we had other things. One of them I think it was a side of  potassium, I believe. So that   s when I was going around and doing  things with farmers. They would come to the meeting at night. Out in the  panhandle we had one and we had the meeting. We were telling them  what to put on not only their wheat, but for any other thing they had that  they didn   t have any nitrogen for. So I went up by there, that same area a  little later and they said,    What do we do?    He used something that   s  kind of like a   he was recommending that they do his stuff that was  nothing but rocks. (Laughs) But it was if you take them and pour them  down. So he had these small rocks that he was saying that he had used  his stuff.  So the farmer says,    Are you going to tell us? Are you going to have  something growing here?    I said,    I sure will.    And so then he found out  what the guy was doing and he put his nitrogen and stuff on. And so he  17  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  says, let   s see I   m trying to think it now   oh, what he did, he goes to his  papers, he had a whole paper on his thing and it says,    Dr. Billy Tucker:  Put up or shut up.    (Laughter) So that whole country. This week,  somebody says,    Hey, Billy, put up or shut up.    (Laughter) But he wrote  a letter to the dean and he wrote a letter to the president and he wrote to  Oklahoma City and so it was so crazy that they all came around and  said,    Billy, write that      this was our president, and he says,    You go  ahead and tell this guy to fly a kite.    (Laughter) And so three of them  did. Three of them asked me to. So they got onto him.  Did you have a pretty good working relationship with the farmers that  you talked to?  Yeah. Some of them I didn   t know. But I know they were all good   I  knew they had good fold and stuff.  Your working relationship with the farmers, did it help that you were a  farm kid yourself? That you   ve had the hands-on knowledge before you  became an academic?  I think most of them know me completely, when I came up here and  what I was doing. And we had meetings forever and so we knew them  all.  Now just to wrap this up, can you place the Magruder Plots with the  overall history of Oklahoma State University and Oklahoma A M  College? Like what is the ultimate significance of them?  Oh, Magruder Plots. I think they keep doing a little bit better. And they  learn some things that they might not have. But it won   t be anything big  like this. They   ll still have signs up to put out your fertilizer or put out  your wheat and things. Get it out there. I don   t think the ball people will  get it. It   s going to stay there. As long as this group   s got guns. (Laughs)  They won   t come. No, I was kidding.  Now, one last question. Do you consider yourself an Aggie or a  Cowboy?  Oh, an Aggie. Yeah, I   m not a Cowboy.  Okay, just had to ask since you went to Oklahoma A M.  Yeah, well we   d have had some of these same kinds of people, they   re  all from my time. But cowboys are alright, too.  Is there anything that you would like to add that we haven   t discussed?  18  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  Sherman  Tucker  No. I hope I did you well.  You and Dr. Westerman have done quite well, added insight. And we  thank you for that and thank you for allowing us to come into your home  and interview you today.  Well, thank you.  You   re welcome.  And Dr. Westerman is here because I went down to his farm and  brought him here.  Yes. (Laughter) That   s right. He   s a good man.  He   s a good top notch.  Yes he is. Well, you brought him along and the university can thank you  for that. And for that I   ll thank you and also we   ll just conclude our  interview right here.  Alright.  -------  -------
