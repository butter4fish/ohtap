 Gill. Today is February 5, 2010. I   m visiting with  Sarah Jane Rodgers in her home here in Holdenville, Oklahoma. This  interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Sarah Jane, I appreciate very much you  allowing us to come into your home and visit with you today.  Glad to have you.  Now I know you   re a member of the Berry Family that has been  historically significant to Oklahoma State University, to Stillwater and  to the state of Oklahoma. Your father, James E. Berry, was a five term  Lieutenant Governor of the state of Oklahoma, and I want to visit with  you about the Berry Family, but first let   s find out more about you.  Alright.  You were the youngest of seven children, is that right?  Yes.  And you were born     In Stillwater.  In Stillwater, Oklahoma. And you grew up in Stillwater? Do you  remember the home that you grew up in? Was it on Duck Street?  Yes     Can you tell me a little bit about it?   The address was 502 Duck Street.  It was built by  Marshall Edwards,  5  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  then he sold it to  Dr.  W. C.  Whittenberg.  While he owned it  it  served as  chapter houses for Alpha Delta Pi and Sigma Nu . When Dad  bought it he had to add on a bedroom even though it had been used as a  fraternity house. They bought it  in 1926 , the year before I was born.  Did you live up on the second floor?  My bedroom was up there.  What were some of your favorite memories of Stillwater as a child  growing up?  The median out in front, cars going by, but we always had that grass  median down there and you could walk   a friend and I used to walk  over to the courthouse and roller-skate on all their sidewalks. It was a  great place to grow up. I could walk to Jefferson School.  Where was Jefferson School located?  On Main Street, where Chamber of Commerce is  now .  There on Main Street  in what is  the school board building now?  Yes.  What were some of your family activities at that time?  We   d go out to Yost Lake occasionally and swim out there and the kids  went down to Crystal Plunge and we swam there nearly every day.  At the old swimming pool off of East Sixth Street?  Is it not there? In fact, Bill and Bob went down there one time and they  had just been to the city and bought bathing suits. They were just trunks  and people at the swimming pool told them they would have to go home  and get something else on. (Laughter) They couldn   t swim with just  bathing trunks.  You went to Stillwater High School. Can you tell us some activities at  the high school?  I was busy in high school. I was drum major   drum and bugle corps and  active in all of the clubs in the school. Glenn Varnum was our band  director and I really did like him. He   s still got family in Stillwater.  What musical instrument did you play?  6  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Bugle.  Drum and bugle corps   that makes sense.  Then, he   d call me into the band sometimes when they were marching  and I   d play cymbals. I was good at that, too.  Sarah Jane, what were some of the family values that you were taught as  a child that stayed with you later in your life?  Always to be honest and don   t talk about your business. In fact, I   d ask  Dad some questions about personal things and  he  replied,    If anybody  asks ya, tell   em you don   t know.    That was his answer to most things.  And work hard. When he   d give me a chore to do, I had to stay right  with it until I finished. Then, when I was in high school, I spent a lot of  time in the summer typing for him down at the office. That was my  part  of the  campaign.  Had the old carbon copies then?  Oh, yes. (Laughter) And pretty much a form letter. I could whip that out  in a hurry.  Then you attended Oklahoma State University after you graduated from  high school?  I went to Sullins  College  for one year in Bristol, Virginia.  It closed in  1978.   Is there a story there of why you went all the way to Virginia for a year  of school?  No. My sister went to Ward Belmont in Tennessee and I don   t think it  was there anymore and we latched on to Sullins and it was an interesting  year, but I came back to OSU   A M.  And what brought you back?  I just wanted to go to A M.  Let   s talk a little bit about your student experience here at Oklahoma  State. What was your major?  English. They gave me a sweatshirt for Christmas    I   m an English  major, you do the math.    (Laughter) Which is true. Beverly has to take  care of my math. When I came back in    45, September, the war was just  7  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  over and the boys were beginning to come back and that school grew  from 3,000 to about 15,000 in a hurry. Had all the Quonset huts out  there. Had classes in Quonset huts, but you knew just about everybody  on campus. It was wonderful.  Where did you live? Did you live on campus?  No. I lived at home. A couple of years I got to stay in the  Kappa Alpha   Theta house. I found out now that Boone Pickens was our dishwasher  (laughter), but I didn   t know it.  Sarah Jane, could you talk about some of the organizations you were a  part of? Some of the student activities you were engaged in?  I can   t remember. I was in the Terpsichorean  Society  which was  connected with dance and Orange and Black Quill and then made  Mortarboard, which was very exciting, but all the athletics. I twirled  with the band.  Like halftime at football games twirler?  We weren   t as good as the ones now. But it was fun. Enjoyed it. Enjoyed  that.  Who was the marching band director then?  Hiram Henry. And Jimmy Baker was the drum major.  Jimmy Baker, I   ll be darned. Did you have some favorite faculty  members you look back on that were mentors to you, do you recall?  No. Dr.  Edwin R.  Walker taught humanities. He was a favorite.  Were there some favorite student hangouts at that time, on campus and  off campus?  Trying to think what   s the name of the one over across the street from  the Chi Omega house.  It wasn   t Swim   s. Swim   s is on Knoblock.  Swim   s is on Knoblock. I can   t remember what it was called, but that  was a good hang out.  Was the Y Hut still there then? Just north of what is the Student Union  today. I guess it wasn   t there when you were there, but     8  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  No.  Did you ever have any activities around Theta Pond?  (Laughs) Nothing like that.  Nothing that exciting.  No.  I have got to ask you this question because we   re going to talk about  your dad later, but I want to interject here. Of course, your father was  Lieutenant Governor, when you were going to Oklahoma State  University, in the state of Oklahoma. How did that affect your  relationship with other students? Was being  the  Lieutenant  Governor   s daughter a good thing or a bad thing, socially?  Didn   t make a bit of difference. Dad never would have let us make  anything out of it and it just wasn   t brought up.  Did any of your friends know about that?  Yes. Just had a high school reunion the last couple of years and one of  the questions they asked in a little skit was,    Who was lieutenant  governor when we started school and was still lieutenant governor when  we graduated?    (Laughter)  Did you get the answer to that one correct?  I got that one. (Laughter) Most of them did.  Sarah Jane, you were talking about when Dr. Bennett brought in all the  Quonset huts from World War II and the units to help the housing  growth. Are there other things you remember about the campus that you  look back on now and recall during your three years there?  No. It wasn   t near as busy as it is now. And we all walked. We didn   t  have a car. We didn   t have congestion. We had no Student Union. It  was a good campus.  As you look back at your time at Oklahoma State University, are there  any special memories that you have about Oklahoma State?  I can   t think of any. It was a good college.  All of them are special, right? Growing up and throughout your life,  9  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  were you aware of the extended Berry Family history and traditions in  the professional stature of the members of the Berry Family. Did you  know about that and was that special to you?  No. It just was.  It was just family. Did any of your father   s brothers and sisters ever  have family reunions and get-togethers?  Yes. We had a couple of family reunions. Not as often as we should  have. We went up to Pawnee one time to Uncle George   s house and then  out to Melinda   s grandparent   s south of town.  Thomas Berry    Sarah Jane Mullendore was the oldest daughter?  Yes.  Your aunt, you were named after her, is that correct?  Yes.  So there   s Sarah Jane, Dora Alice, Thomas Ian, and James. Is that  right?  There were just four in his family.  Did you know some of those personally? The aunts and uncles? Are  there any special memories you have with the family?  Aunt Dora and Aunt Jenny    we visited with them often. Aunt Jenny  lived in a two story brick house in Cleveland and we used to go up there  and see her. She had a music box with a dog   s head. You   d pick it up  and it would play. I loved that music box.  Were there any family traditions or stories that you remember telling as  they   d get together for special events, maybe Christmas time or  reunions   stories that they would talk about with the family that you  could share?  We always had Christmas dinner at home. Everybody came back and  then my brother Bill was a decorator and he would bring a carload of  hats and Virginia, Monica, Joyce and I would all try on hats and decide  which one we wanted. (Laughter) It was crazy. The little kids would  walk down to the picture show while we visited.  Did you know your grandfather, Thomas E. Berry? Was he still alive  10  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  when you were a child?  No. My Grandfather was William Edward Berry.  Thomas Nelson  would have been my uncle.   Sorry if I get it mixed up there occasionally.  That   s alright. I do, too.  Do you remember anything about your Grandfather?  No, he died when I was two years old. I remember Grandma, she lived a  few years longer, but I don   t remember much about her.  Was it special to you that your home was still on Duck Street and, like I  said, it   s been changed a few times since, but it   s still well maintained.  So far.  Do you ever drive by and take a look at it?  Oh, sure.  And memories just come back to you?  George, such a good hearted fellow. He told us he had rented the house  to a couple of real nice fellows and we said,    Well, that   s good.    We  said,    Will they take care of it?    and he said,    Oh, yes. Take good care  of it.    And about that time, one of the granddaughters came to her  mother and said,    So and so just called. They   re having a big party at the  Berry House. (Laughter) Everybody is invited     So we had to get them  out.  How important is the Berry Family legacy to you? How has it influenced  you?  Oh, it   s very important. I am so proud of Mom and Dad. They were just  really super people and I   ve wanted my kids to know more about them.  Can you talk a little bit about your mother? Edwina Morrison was her  maiden name.  Yes.  Can you tell me a little bit about her family background?  11  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  She grew up in Taylorville, Illinois. Her father was a merchant and her  grandfather had a two story brick home out on the edge of town and the  bricks were made there on the farm. He had a bee house. The bee house  had, let   s say, twelve openings and they were all painted a different  color and the bees knew which was their color. I never quite believed it,  but they said it was true.  Then in 1898 they moved to Stillwater and the mother and father came  down first and set things up and then Edwina, who was ten years old,  came down and brought her little sister Virginia,  who was three,  with  her. They were on the train for three days by themselves, but they made  it. Then Grandfather started Morrison   s Dry Good Store there in  Stillwater, which is up around Hunkel   s Printing Shop, which run the,  well, just north of the drugstore at Eighth and Main. Momma worked in  the store every Saturday and she ran a cash register. She had to balance  out at the end of the day. She was always good in math. In fact, she  majored in math at the college. Then, Grandfather died before he was  forty. Grandmother kept the store open for awhile. I don   t know how  long.  Your mother went to Oklahoma State University or Oklahoma A M at  that time. She graduated in   .  1907. Their class yell was     Wisdom, Wit  Sand and Grit  1907   We are it     (Laughter)  Did she ever talk about some of her experiences as a student?  I   m sure she did, but I don   t remember. She and Dad were married in  1908. Her mother was very socially conscious. I mean, they sent out  engraved invitations for the wedding, engraved announcements that they  ordered from St. Louis, but they had a social group,     The Bachelor  Girl    , and they had a dance and sent out invitations to the fellows and it  said,    at home.    And that meant that there was going to be dancing.  Then Dad had a party before they married and they all went to Guthrie  on the train and they went to a play or an opera. It may have been an  opera, and they stayed a couple of days, but Mrs. Morrison went along  and chaperoned. (Laughter)  (Laughs) To make sure it didn   t get out of hand.  Oh, yes. And then,  for the  statehood  celebration , she and Dad went  down on the train for the ceremony and an Inaugural Ball.  12  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Let me back up and ask you, now your Father went one year to  Oklahoma A M?  Yes.  Did he say anything about his year there   his experience?  No, he didn   t talk about his childhood too much or his young years.  He went on to the business college     Business College in Quincy, Illinois. It was GEM College.  Back to your mother, I understand that she had a keen sense of humor,  was a woman of her time, was well educated, and was a progressive  thinker.  Yes, she was.  What else should we know about your mom?  She went back to A M in 1928-   29 and took speech lessons because  she knew that she was going to have to make speeches, so she got that.  At the same time, she was made an honorary member of Theta. She was  in college and that made it legal somewhat, but she was very involved  with Thetas. Did a lot of things. Went to a lot of meetings.  Reunions, served on their board of directors and     Oh yes, she was chairman of the board for a long time.  What was she like as a mother?  She was a wonderful mother. She had had a lot of heartache, but she  never talked about it. She lost James Ed when he was sixteen over in  England at a Boy Scout World Jamboree   fell off a cliff. And Bobby  when he was in the war  World War II , but she never   you know. She  grieved, but not around us.  Robert was the last boy and you were the last, so how far between ages  were you?  Four years.  He was killed in World War II, is that correct? What theater was he in?  13  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  He was over in Germany.  In 1944?     45. Just before the war ended.  How tragic.  Yes, we already knew the war was over in Europe. We were excited  because he was safe and then I was still at Sullins when I got the word.  All four boys were in the war, Bill, Navy; George, infantry belonging to  the Air Corps; Frank was infantry, and Bobby was in the Forty-Second  Division, which Dad served in the first war  World War I .  Talking about your mother again, you reported that she was an ideal  politician   s wife. In what ways was she helpful to your Dad   s political  campaigns?  She kept him focused and every time they   d go.  She remembered  names for him.  She   d have friends and she could talk to anybody; talk  to the farmers about their crops and merchants and then teachers. She  was really a very educated person. And a real lady.  She also organized  and ran the office in Oklahoma City.   What was the story you were talking about, she should have been a  horticulture major? Can you tell that story?  Oh, yes. Somebody asked her what she majored in in college and she  said,    Math, but if I   d known I was going to raise Berrys, I would have  gone into horticulture.    (Laughter)  I   m thinking in 1908 or    7 when she graduated   was it very unusual for  a woman to be a math major then?  Oh, yes. Sure it was.  She was a pretty progressive gal then, wasn   t she?  She was smart. She could do that math.  (Laughs) You had the t-shirt   what was it?    I   m an English major, you  do the math.     That   s right.  So your mom did the math? (Laughs) Did she share your father   s love of  14  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  politics?  Oh, yes. She was instinctive about it. She sat on the floor of the Senate  while he presided. At that time they let the lieutenant governor use the  gavel. His first term, he got mixed up with their rules and procedure and  had to back out. But by the next session, he knew how to do it and she  would sit down on the floor and do her needle point. We have so much  of it here at the house. It kept her busy and the senators would come by,  speak to her, visit with her, and one senator came by one day and said,     Mrs. Berry, is there anything I can do for you?    and she said    Yes, I  want you to add Oklahoma to the state flag.    She said,    We go to  meetings out of state and they let all the flags fly and nobody can tell  which one is Oklahoma.    And he said,    I   ll take care of it.    I did have  the letter from him telling about that, but the letter got lost. I don't  remember which senator it was, but every time I see Oklahoma on the  flag, I think of my mom.  You were old enough to remember some of the campaigns. Do you  remember what your mother did during some of the campaigns? What  role she played?  Yes,  she was campaign manager in 1942, 1946, and 1950, and  I think  it was the    38 campaign, she had four kids at home and she   d get up  every morning and get things started. Then, she   d get dressed and drive  to the bank, pick up the mail and drive to Oklahoma City   seventy  miles at what, thirty-five miles an hour?  Whew.  Then she   d run the state headquarters and be sure they were going good  and then she   d get back home and fix dinner.  (Laughs) Wow, what a special lady.  In the meantime, she spoke when they were out on tours. If Dad couldn   t  go to Claremore, then she   d go and speak for him.  She   d speak on his behalf in front of the whole group?  Oh, yes.  Was she a pretty good orator?  Yes.  Did you ever hear her speak?  15  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodger  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  No, but I   ve got a lot of her notes and she had made some good  speeches.  Was that unusual for a woman, at that time, for the spouse to actually  make campaign speeches?  I think it probably was.  Amazing.  Marland was the first governor he served under and she and Mrs.  Marland were very friendly. I   ve got several notes that Mrs. Marland  wrote to her and they came up to Stillwater for a football game. She had  had that open house and let them come and bring all their people and  had Stillwater people, too. But she was a lovely social hostess.  Did she host a lot of activities, not just campaigning, but clubs and  activities at home?  Clubs.  What were some of the organizations that she was active in in  Stillwater?  The Women   s Club and she played bridge.  Also DAR, Daughters of the  American Revolution, and AAVW, the American Association of  University Women.   I bet she was a pretty good bridge player.  AAUW. Well they both played bridge. They finally had to split the     they had four couples that played and they finally had to split up the men  and the women. (Laughs) Keep the squabbling down. (Laughter) They  played with the same ones for years and years.  Now your mother, I understand, was very fashionable. She had a thing  for hats, I understand?  Yes.  Could you tell me a little bit about that?  She was just a good dresser. Every afternoon she   d take a nap and then  get up and put on her linen dress and shoes that match and go sit on the  front porch and needle point. But when she went to banquets or dinner,  she always had a good looking outfit and a small hat that matched with  16  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  that outfit.  She had a different hat for different outfits for different occasions.  That   s right. And they all matched.  Shoes, too.   What do you remember most about your mother?  Her kindness. Her smile. How much fun we had together. Dad didn   t eat  dinner at night. She and I would go up to Chili Bowl  on Campus  Corner  or go out some place for dinner. She always let me use her car.  Or I used it a lot. Lately, I wondered how she ever got anything done.     Mom, can I use the car?       Sure.    (Laughter)  I   ve got to ask you, your father did not eat dinner?  He was just always on a diet and he   d eat when he got home from the  bank at three or four o   clock. He   d eat a big dinner and then try not to  eat again.  Have either an early dinner or late lunch about two or three o   clock?  Yes.  Speaking of your dad, I   m going to ask you questions about him. How  old was he when you were born?  He was forty-five probably. You do the math.    81 from    27.  We were talking about your mother, what do you remember about your  father? The private person, what kind of father was he?  Distant. He   d come home from the bank, go in the den and sit in his  chair and read all the newspapers and the news magazines. He didn   t  want us to bother him too much. He was friendly but he just wasn   t the  type to sit down and visit with us too much. He and Momma played gin  rummy all the time and the kids played cards. We went on some trips  together. Drove down to Florida one time. He didn   t gamble at the races  or anything, but you drive along, he bet you that turtle was not going to  get across the road. (Laughter) He always wanted to go someplace, but  as soon as you started he was ready to go home.  Sarah Jane, what values did you learn from your father?  The value of money and how to keep it  as well as to treat everyone the  same and to not ever brag .  17  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  What kind of personality did your dad have? What were his character  traits that you remember?  He could be funny at times   a sense of humor, I guess. He was just  reserved. Didn   t have time to make a lot of small talk.  Did he have a good sense of humor?  Occasionally. Not every day. I worked with him down at the bank  without pay.  Right. But he was a fairly hard working person, as you described him.  Very disciplined and organized.  He greeted everybody when they came in the bank, I can remember that.  Speaking of your banking experience with your dad, Stillwater National  Bank has been a part of the Berry Family for what, four generations  now, but it   s an important part of your family. Your father became  president of the bank in 1929 and inherited and took it over from his  father. Now that was a pretty tough time to take over a bank     Yes, it was. W. E. Berry moved to Stillwater and was the charter  member of the Oklahoma State Bank, I think it was. Then, that merged  into Stillwater National and he became President. He served until he  died in    29 and Dad served until he died in    66.  Was this right before the banks shut down   the banking holiday that  FDR had later? I guess this was a pretty tumultuous time     Oh yes, but it stayed open. They didn   t shut it down.  Can you share some of your memories then when you worked there?  What would you do? You said you did secretarial work for him?  Yes. And then handed out statements. You know, just     An errand girl, kind of doing things?  Yes. But I did a lot of typing for the campaigns at the Capitol, they ran  out of money one time and they all had warrants, but they couldn   t cash  them. And they all needed money to live off of, so he walked up and  down the halls and took their warrants, cashed them and charged them  one or two percent or something and they could pay him back.  He had to have been a pretty popular guy then, didn   t he? (Laughter)  18  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Did you know David Sylvester?  Yes.  He came over from Arkansas, landed at the bus station and the bank was  across the street, so he walked over there and Dad went out and said,     Do you know who the lieutenant governor is?    David said,    No, and I  don   t give a darn.    (Laughter)  Did he then introduce himself?  Dave wanted to borrow some money to go to school. That was what Dad  always asked,    Do you know who the lieutenant governor is?     (Laughter) Dave laughed about that.  Wasn   t long before the students became voters, right? (Laughter)  Malinda indicated earlier that he was known for greeting everybody.  Sort of the front person to the bank?  Yes, he would stand out in the lobby and visit with all of his friends and  meet new friends.  Were there other members of the family involved with the bank at that  time?  George was there and then Frank was president after Dad. After Frank  died, they had to go outside the family.  Sort of changing direction on your dad, he had a military background.  Did he help organize the local National Guard Unit?  Yes, he did.  In Stillwater?  I had a sheet of paper with all of that on it, but I   m not sure where it  went. He organized Company I of the National Guard in 1913. That   s it.  This was after it and I don   t know why he was such a nut on the military  when he had had no ROTC or anything like that. In December 1913, he  organized the Company I   he was captain in the First Oklahoman  Infantry and they served on the Mexican border, 1916 and then they  came back for a few months and then were called back into service to go  to Europe. He went over there with the Forty-Second Division.  Do you remember anything about his service in World War I? Where he  worked, served, or what campaigns he was in or anything?  19  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  No, I don   t. But he went over on a troopship and one night they had a  scare about a submarine that they told about in one of his letters. It was  interesting.  Then, after he came back from Europe, he organized the National Guard  again in 1923   Division Headquarters Company and he was a major,  but he took his guard company down to Fort Sill every summer for camp  and he just really enjoyed that military. He had Frank and George   they  both went to OMA  Oklahoma Military Academy  and Frank was in  ROTC at OSU.  They were both in National Guard.   The Oklahoma Military Academy at Claremore?  Yes.  It was a two year school at the time, wasn   t it? A couple of years of high  school or prep school and then two years of college.  Yes. I think they just went to high school because he came back and  went to OU one year and quickly saw the light (laughter) and came back  to Stillwater and hated OU.  (Laughs) You kind of bring the question up, there   s not a question  somewhere with his interest in military in the family or anything?  I don   t know where it came from. It was one of those things that I didn   t  think about at the time. Now, I wonder and there   s nobody to ask. But  his company, if you said a cuss word, you had to put a quarter in the pot  and evidently, they were pretty bad because they had a lot of money in  the pot and he gave it to the cook and they had the best food in camp.  Everybody would come over and want to eat with them, but the cook  was a man from Stillwater. Had a little diner, just a small one off Main  Street, on Thirteenth or so. Well, he   d go down there and eat with him  real often.  He  kept his friends from the military.  He retired then  as a  major.  Yes. Phillips made him retire. He was lieutenant governor and then they  called up the National Guard to serve again and Dad was all set to go.  He was going to go with them and Governor Phillips said,    Make up  your mind, you   re either a soldier or you   re a lieutenant governor. You  can   t do both.    He was a little old to be going anyway, so he had to  resign his commission  which he did in September 1940 .  Probably a tough decision for him then.  20  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Oh, it was. (Laughter) Got a cartoon of him sitting on the Capitol steps  in his uniform wondering what to do.  So your father served five terms as lieutenant governor, the most in the  history of the state in 1935 to 1955, so twenty years. That   s  unprecedented in Oklahoma history. How was he able to get elected five  times? What was his appeal to voters?  Mostly, he just would keep in contact with them, lots of colonels on the  Governor   s staff and you wonder why he works so hard for a job that  paid a  1000.  In his first year, he was paid a thousand dollars?  The first eighteen years that was his salary.   Reading from editorial cartoon.  It says at the bottom and I am reading  here,    To be or not to be?   Which is to be a part of the military or not to  be a part of the National Guard. Is that what he is pondering there?  Lt. Governor or Major Berry. One or the other?  (Laughter) That   s great  What did Oklahomans like about your dad so  much that they continued to vote him into office in five different  elections? And he won pretty handedly in most of his elections, what was  his appeal? Why did people keep voting for him?  I don   t really know. He enjoyed shaking hands with all of the people and  he went to a lot of bean dinners.  I read somewhere that he loved parades. Participated in a lot of  parades, made a lot of social events and community events, is that right,  in and around the state?  Every parade in Stillwater he led on a horse, had somebody let him  borrow a horse, and he was good looking when he wore his uniform and   would  sit up there and just ramrod straight with boots. (Laughter) They  brought me a picture this last time Malinda was down and he is good  looking     So he   s riding a horse in the parade in full uniform with polished boots.  He sits on the horse ramrod straight.  He really was, but they went out at night a lot to different towns.  Did your mother go with him a lot to those activities?  21  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Oh, yes.  The older brothers and sisters kind of took care of the younger kids  then?  That first year,    34 when he ran, they sent me up to Cleveland to stay  with Cousin Mildred. The thing I remember about that was I fell in the  cactus plant (laughter) and she spent most of the time picking needles  out of my     Your posterior. (Laughter)  Never stayed with Bessie. Just that one time with Mildred.  Do you recall a little bit about your father   s political philosophy? What  were his core political beliefs? Did you ever talk politics with your dad  or your mom?  They were both Democrats, no doubt about that. They thought Roosevelt  was doing things right. But he just really enjoyed going to the  inaugurations with (they had a big train) a lot of people and he   d visit  with all of them. When Phillips was governor, they didn   t get along for  some reason and Dad was   I guess Phillips asked Dad to represent the  state, but he wouldn   t give him any of the tickets to get in. So, Dad and  Mom got up to Washington and he scurried around to all of the  congressmen from Oklahoma and they finally secured the tickets so they  could go to the events.  Like a presidential inaugural event, something like that?  Yes, and the party beforehand. All the social activities. He   d ride in the  parade after the inaugural. One year, they had given him a box lunch or  something and he had picked up a sack of oranges some place. So as  he   d ride along, he   d pitch an orange out the window to the policemen  who had to stand there in the cold or just the crowd, but they all cheered.  As you got a little bit older, did you participate in some of his political  campaigns?  I didn   t go out and make speeches.  1948 or somewhere along in there? Would you have been out of college  at that time?  I don   t remember what I was doing in    48. But I didn   t.  22  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  You never went out and heard him speak and stump.  In    48, I had a job in the City, but he had very strict ideas about what a  girl should do. I wanted to go to business school at A M and he said,     No, you can   t do that.    When I graduated, I wanted to work as a  secretary someplace,    No, you go to work for DHS.    And I didn   t want  to do that. So I didn   t. Mom and I played that year.  Could you describe your father   s campaign strategy? Did he have a  campaign manager?  Just that first time he ran. He had two or three. I guess they didn   t stay  long, but after that Momma did most of it.  Your mother was his unofficial campaign manager? She managed the  state   s campaign from Oklahoma City and the campaign headquarters?  Yes. Then, after the third time, I think they didn   t have to campaign out  of the City, he   d just do it from the bank.  After two or three terms, did he have an opponent from the Democratic  Party side?  Oh, yes.  Did your father enjoy campaigning?  He loved it. He liked to get out and meet people.  You mentioned a little about he and Governor Phillips didn   t get along. I  think the governors he served under were  E. W.  Marland, Leon   Phillips,  Robert   Kerr,  Roy  Turner, and Johnston Murray. Are there  any stories that he told about the governors that he worked with?  No. He didn   t say much about them.  Now, a    politician    who never ran for office, but who was a pretty good  politician was Henry G. Bennett. Did he have a close relationship with  Dr. Bennett?  Yes. In fact, one time he was thinking about running for governor and he  kept waiting for Bennett to make up his mind. He was thinking about it  too, and Dad said,    I wouldn   t run if Dr. Bennett did.    But neither of  them ran.  Did your father ever want to be governor? I mean, I know he was acting  23  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  governor many times in his career, but did he ever want to run for the  governorship?  Yes, he did. But he just never did. I guess Momma kept him from it.  (Laughs)  Other than your mother, were there other reasons you think that he  didn   t run? It seems like he would have a pretty good support base after  two or three terms as lieutenant governor.  Well, he ran for the United States Senate once and got clobbered.  Oh, really? Who did he run against?   Elmer Thomas,  a good one.  He didn   t do very well.  No.  Did you ever visit your father at his office in Oklahoma City? Do you  have memories of the Capitol and his office?  Yes. Now the lieutenant governor has a big fancy office. When he went  in, he was just given a regular senator   s office. Just one room, one  desk   I guess two desks, but he wanted a little privacy. So he paid to  have the front room partitioned off so he could have a private office.  I   d go down when he was campaigning, there was a newsboy selling  papers out in front of the Biltmore Hotel named Louie. When Dad would  come up, he would wave his paper and say,    Vote for James E. Berry      (laughs) or put his   I think he had a sticker on his hat, but he and Dad  got pretty well acquainted and he hired Louie to be his personal page.  Three dollars a day. Louie was making  2.50 a week selling papers. He  was tickled to death. He was trying to support his mother  and his  father  had died, so Louie stayed with him for quite awhile. I   d go down and go  around the capitol to see what was going on.  Did he ever walk around and take you to the floor of the Senate with  him?  No.  He felt that would be taking advantage of his posisition.   Although your mother was there now, as you described her     I probably went with her some, but I thought it was boring at that time.  24  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  What did your father enjoy most about being lieutenant governor? Do  you know?  Having people recognize him. It sure wasn   t the money.  What do you think motivated him to serve all those twenty years? He had  a full time job as a president of a bank and the family and then  lieutenant governor. What was his motivation?  I guess it was just to be lieutenant governor  and  the prestige that went  with it.  He wanted to help people.   He had a sense of service. He served the people of the state?  Yes.  How would you describe your father   s political legacy? What do you  think would be his legacy?  Good Democrat and he thought the Republicans were too hard on  people. Would not help the small business person or the farmer.  Would you describe him as a fairly progressive Democrat? Kind of the  FDR mold.  Yes, I would. His hobby was raising bees. He had a lot of hives down at  802 Duck and then out on the farm. He was always trying to get the  Department of Transportation, tell them to quit cutting the clover on the  side of the road. Said,    This pretty clover comes up, and just as it gets  ready to bloom, they cut it down and the bees can   t get any food.    He  was a farmer. Very interested in his farm and talked to the A M people  about different practices that would be good. And he clerked all the farm  sales. He liked to do that.  Sarah Jane, we were talking about the accomplishments of your father,  but from your perspective, what were some significant contributions,  politically?  Jerry, I can   t think of this right off hand. But I will tell you the story that  Beverly mentioned. I   d been out of school a year. I met Jim Rodgers  from Holdenville. Or I met him in college, while still in college and that  summer he was campaigning for Dewey for president   Thomas E.  Dewey. His dad was a Republican and they were paying Jim a hundred  dollars a day, two days on the weekend to go out and campaign and in  1948 that was doggone good money. He was still in school   in law  school and needed it. So he was campaigning for Dewey and he would  25  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  come up to Stillwater, driving his campaign car with big Dewey signs on  it. (Laughter) And I said,    Jim, you can   t park that out in front of our  house.       Oh, it   s alright.    And Frank said he wanted to run out with a  shotgun and chase him off, but he was afraid the neighbors would get  the wrong idea. (Laughter)  Oh mercy. Good story.  After we got married, he saw the light and became a Democrat.  Last question about your dad, how do you hope people will remember  him and his legacy, his contribution? How do you hope people  remember him?  As a good banker and as a congenial lieutenant governor.  Let   s pick back up on your personal life, Sarah Jane. We   ve kind of left  you at OSU   you said you met Jim Rodgers, your husband that you  married later, at OSU. What did you do after you left OSU?  I had just had one year. Mom and I just ran around. Went to New York a  couple of times and just had a fun time.  So instead of a tour of Europe, you toured the United States with your  mother? Was this the summer that your dad wanted you to work for  DHS?  Probably.  You said that you wanted to do business work   professional, secretarial  work and did he think that was appropriate?  No, and after I married Jim, he didn   t want me working in Jim   s office.  He needed a secretary and I thought that   d be great. Dad did not  approve.  Going back to Jim, is there a story about you and Jim? How did you  meet?  He had a date with a sorority sister of mine and she got sick and went  home and asked me if I   d go out with him. (Laughter) And I did.  That   s a great story. Did you ever get in a squabble about this  afterwards?  No, they weren   t romantically involved. They were just both Young  26  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Republicans.  You have got to help me understand how you dated this guy if he was a  Republican.  Well I did   I was nice. I just ignored it. (Laughter)  You converted him later, right? As you said, it worked out pretty good.  When you left OSU, you had a degree in English?  Yes.  What did you intend to do? I mean, have you ever thought about, career  wise, what you wanted to be? You were still single and out of school.  I had no plans. I was supposed to go to college, so I did.  Were you and Jim still seeing each that year then after you graduated?  Oh, yes. He finished law school and took the bar that summer. He was in  the City studying and I think I was in the City working for Halliburton   department store  that summer on the college board. No pay, just  having a good time. Lived at the YWCA. So we could see each other a  time or two during the week.  What year did you get married then? Would it have been in    49?     49.  Where did you and your husband   s career take you from there?  Holdenville.  Why? Was this his hometown?  Yes, this was his   his father was an attorney. He came down and went  into practice with him. Dad wanted us to move to Stillwater, which we  should have done, but (laughter) Holdenville is a good place to raise  kids.  Did your husband Jim   of course it was small town and  he  probably  had a general practice   did he have a specialty area?  No. Civil and oil and gas. His dad was Indian Law.  You were talking about having a family, can you tell me a little bit about  27  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  your kids?  We have two boys and two girls. Bill was the oldest and he   s in Dallas  and is a computer consultant. Bob was next and he is Chairman of the  Stillwater National Bank and was in the car business.  Was he in Pauls Valley?  Pauls Valley. And then Becky retired after thirty years with IBM and  she   s in Georgia. Built a home in Reynolds Plantation which is a golfing  community and she and Steve live there and play golf every day. Then  Beverly went to law school. She was mayor of Holdenville for four  years.  Wow. No wonder she knew everybody and they know her.  Well, that   s been a long time. She was twenty-nine years old when she  was mayor and then she went to law school and became city manager of  Okmulgee and City Attorney of Sapulpa and Midwest City. Then, I  talked to her into coming back and she had a job with an oil and gas  company here, but they   ve sort of gone under. But she   s taking care of  me and my business.  Did you ever have an active role in the Stillwater National Bank?  No.  I guess you   re a stockholder.  Oh, yes.  But never had an active role on the board or anything?  No.  Now your son is the current chairman of the board of Stillwater  National Bank. That   s Bob?  Yes.  So the tradition has continued?  Yes. I had seen Aunt Jenny and Aunt Dora serve on the board and they  were both just agreeable to what was going on and I didn   t want to do it.  But you might ruffle some feathers a little bit?  28  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  I just didn   t think it was going to help the bank. But here Beverly could  have done it. But Bob McCormick suggested that Bob go on the board  and he was glad to do it and has really enjoyed it and works at it.  We talked a little bit about your father, I   d like for you to share with us  some of your political experiences you had in politics, but I wanted to  ask you first of all, did your interest and love of political affairs come  more from your dad or from your mom, or both?  Both. I ran for City Council one time and didn   t make it.  Here in Holdenville?  Yes. Momma said,    I could have told you that your slogan was wrong.     (Laughter)  What was your slogan?  Why Can   t a Qualified Woman Serve? (Laughter).  You were just a head of your time, Sarah Jane.  She said it should have been    A Qualified Women Can Serve.     Now this was your mother   s advice? Your mother was a pretty good  politician.  She was sharp.  I think you may have gotten more from your mom than you did from  your dad in that deal. I know you were active in the Democratic Party  here at the state level for many years. Can you share a little bit about  your political experiences?  Well, of course, going to the  Democratic  National Convention was the  big experience.  Your daughter said you got to the national convention a couple of times?  Delegate twice and alternate once. I was there when Jimmy Carter beat  Ted Kennedy  1980  and then    72  for McGovern . Beverly went in    76   as a page and was Carter nominated . And then in  1980 it was Carter .  Were you backing Carter all the way in the early part of the campaign?  Oh yes.  29  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  People were wooing you for your votes.  McGovern was running that year and I said I would not support  McGovern in the primary. But if he was a nominee, I would. It was just  exciting to meet all of these politicians.  Who were some of the famous people you met and shook hands with?  Tom Brokaw.  Discussing her daughter  She was a page and had a red,  white and blue hat outfit. She could run all over the Madison Square  Garden and get in anywhere.  Also Senator Henry Jackson, Senator  Lloyd Bentsen, Senator Robert Byrd, Senator Rockefeller. President  Jimmy Carter invited me to the White House three times: for breakfast,  lunch, and for a press conference in the East Room.   Can you share some of the inside stories? You watch things on TV and  you get sort of images of it, you   re an uncommitted delegate so you   ve  got people, what   s the experience like? Can you share a little bit of that?  Tell you what, the best thing about the convention was sitting behind  George Nigh. Just sat right behind him and listened to him talk to  people. That man   s a whiz. He can talk. And he   s smart.  Maybe the second best lieutenant governor ever in the state?  That   s right. (Laughter) That   s right. I   m sure glad he didn   t run again.  Of course, there   s a bunch of noise. You really can   t hear what   s going  on at the podium.  Did you ever get into the so-called    smoke filled rooms    where people  were making deals? Did you get into any of that?  No. Those were the big dogs. Then, I was in the National Federation of  Democratic Women and was Vice President.  National Vice-President?  Had thirteen states that I traveled over and that was interesting to meet  the people in different states and go and fly up to their conventions. Bill  was a flight attendant for American and so he could get me free tickets.  You had to stand in line, so I made a lot of conventions.  Did you ever serve at the statewide level or local level in terms of the  Democratic Party?  Yes, I was on the committee representing the Third District. I was co-  30  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  chair and then I was chairman.  So, at the old Third District here in the southeast, Little Dixie district.  Did you get to know Carl Albert?  Jim was on the American Legion national committees. He   d go to  Washington every year. I   d go up with him. I   d go see Carl and he got  me into one of the Watergate hearings at the courthouse.  Did you hear some good stuff at the tail end of it?  That was exciting. (Laughter) But Carl was really nice to me. He and  Gene Stipe   Gene was a good fellow. When we were going down to the  Third District, he   d say,    Now, if you run into any trouble, you call and  I   ll take care of it.    (Laughter) In the Third District, that   s important   Did you work with Wes Watkins also at that time? What do you  remember about Wes? Any favorite Wes Watkins stories?  I worked with Wes and Lou both and thought they were great and they   d  make these speeches about how wonderful the Democratic Party is and  how we   ve got to get out and defeat these Republicans and I just sat  there and took it all in. Then, they turned out  to be Republicans . And  I   ve never gotten over it.  Are there other facets, Sarah Jane, of your life you would like to share  with us that we haven   t talked about? We talked about the bank  involvement, we talked about a little bit about your family life, about  some of the things you did politically. Are there some things we missed  or any other organizations we   ve been a part of that you   d like to share  with us?  The first fifteen years I was here, I was active in every organization they  had and then finally was on the library board with Veldo Brewer and  that was interesting. We built a new addition   the Grace Pickens. Guess  who gave us, I think,  20,000? Boy, we were cheap.  Veldo was a pretty good fundraiser, wasn   t he?  Yes. He was a nice fellow.  You talk about a strong OSU background and a couple of your kids  are     Jim went to OU.  31  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  That   s what I was going to say. I thought someone else in the family  slipped away from OSU.  Yes. Bill went to the Air Force Academy for two years and then came  back to OU. But I couldn   t talk him out of it.  So Jim and Bill both.  Yes, and then Becky and Beverly went to OSU. Bob went to East  Central. But Jim was prisoner of war during the Second World War in  Germany for a year. Then came back and devoted his life to the   American  Legion, helping people. He really was sincere about wanting  to help anyone he could. He went to all of the Legion meetings and was  on the national committees and we   ve all   of course, Dad was a  Legionnaire, too. He always had his legion pin on.  Sarah Jane, I think we sort of missed a little bit of the heavy lifting you  did in the political arena. I know you worked with campaigns in a lot of  the politicians for state offices and then you were chairman and co-chairman  of the Third District. Can you describe what a campaign year  was like and how you organized it? The trips you made, the  appearances. Can you talk about that a little bit?  The bus tours were the big deal of the campaign here and that was  sponsored by the Federation of Women. We had to raise the money to  rent a bus and then be sure that we had campaign material delivered to  the bus and all of them   one or two women representing each candidate.  So we went out for David Hall   s campaign. Jo Hall was on it and George  Nigh was running for lieutenant governor. Donna was on and Shirley  Castle probably and then we had someone rep for each office and we  had a schedule. We   d go down here at ten o   clock, have coffee with  women in this town, men and women, and then we were over here for  noon, we   d have lunch, have it set up and go all through the week like  that. But it was fun to get to know these candidates. Of course, Jo Hall  wouldn   t be the only one on there. There   d be somebody for  each state  office .  I guess you   d get to know a lot of the local chamber of commerce  people, the mayors and city council and leaders of different  communities   sort of a whistle stop tour.  You   d walk the town and hand out leaflets, do the parade and jump on  the bus and go to the next one.  Did you do some of the prep work? Or did some of the candidates come  in behind you, or come in usually in front of them or     32  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  They probably were someplace else working. We just had our group.  How long would this go on, like you said a week here or two or three  days off and then hit another tour or get the whole district in one week?  Yes.  Wow.  Then, we would have bean dinners at different places after the tour,  before the election.  Can you tell me a little bit of what it took to set up this? I just think of  logistics. That would be staggering just with all of the contacts, phone  calls, meetings. Can you share a little bit how you organize that?  Very carefully. (Laughter) It was a lot of work, but we thought it was  worth it because we got to get our message out.  So you didn   t have a fax, didn   t have a cell phone, this is pressing the  flesh in the old fashioned way, wasn   t it? Are those good memories for  you?  Typing those letters.  Your experience came in handy from Stillwater National Bank typing for  your dad.  I was a good typist at that time.  Were there some special friendships that you made? Can you kind of  share some of those with us?  Edna Mae Phelps over at Seminole.  She was a sharp lady, wasn   t she?  Yes, a sharp lady. Lorray Dyson, Guthrie. Overa Bergdall, Enid, but that  was the core of my friends and then we   d have our Democratic  conventions.  Statewide convention.  In the City or someplace. We   d go down two days before, have a  hospitality room, cokes and chips   no drinking.  33  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Nothing behind the curtain.  No. But it was expensive working for a national delegate. I had to  entertain all of the people.  You were talking about D.C.   you were there   you ran for national  office? What was that like? You provided refreshments and  entertainment?  In Oklahoma City. Or sometimes in Ada, but we had to have a  hospitality room and people come in you   d try to get them to vote for  your delegate.  Can you talk a little bit about what did you have to do to become a  delegate? And first of all, you did all of the leg work and all of the years  in the district, but how did you    campaign for or run for    national  delegate?   Before the convention I drove to all twenty-three counties to visit with  our county officers.  You have big signs and tell people you wanted to  go and why they ought to vote for you.  And this was voted  upon  at the state convention, is that how you were  elected?  The district could elect so many. So if you didn   t get it in district, you  had to go onto the state and try to get elected up there.  Kind of the state-at-large where the congressional districts   not only  within your congressional districts? Were you elected from the district  or at-large?  From the district.  You were probably pretty popular with the candidates.  There were county officials, so you had to get to know them. And that  was a big help.  How many counties did you have?  Twenty-two. Payne County was in it at one time.  You had to have loved politics to do this.  Oh yes, or you would go nuts.  34  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Was it the excitement, the enthusiasm, the adrenaline rush, maybe?  What made you work so hard and so passionately?  Well, my friends Edna Mae and Lorray were doing it, too. In fact, they  did more than I did. It just got to be exciting.  Did you feel strongly that you were making a difference by helping get  candidates elected and get people in office?  I enjoyed meeting the candidates, knowing the candidates. You know,  I   d go to the capitol and know an awful lot of people up there.  When you used your name, they   d return the call?  I don   t know. It   s just fun to be recognized by people that are doing  good work up there. Dad ran and he was elected in    34. He ran again in      38,    42,    46, and    50 .     55 was his last year served, so    51 would have been his last election.  He ran again. He ran in    54 and was defeated.  Who did he run against?  Cowboy Pink Williams. (Laughter) Embarrassing. He was ahead in the  primary, but Pink got in the runoff and won in the runoff. Always has a  better chance.  Was it a close election?  Yes, but oh we were crushed. And Dad was upset. He was really upset  and Momma was quoted in the Tulsa paper saying,    Well, tell you one  thing, I   ve got some dresses for sale   cheap. Have two pink dresses and  I   m never going to wear them again.    (Laughter).  So we had this state convention a couple of years   I guess it was after.  Probably in the   70s or something.  Yes. Bob Funston was chairman. He was a good friend. He was always  sticking his foot into something and getting jumped on. So he thought,     Boy this time, I   m going to be really good.    He got up there and he  said,    Sorry to tell you that Cowboy Pink has died and now we   re going  to have a few moments of silence.    I went up to him later and said,    You  son of a gun. What do you mean having silence for Cowboy Pink?    And  he said,    Well, I didn   t think anybody would mind that.    I said,    I did.     35  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  Gill  Rodgers  He thought that was the one thing he could do that wouldn   t be  controversial and it was. (Laughs) He knew I wasn   t serious.  Looking back on all that, you made a lot of friends and influenced a lot  of people. How do you want to be remembered? How do you think  people will remember Sarah Jane Rodgers?  Golly, I hadn   t thought about that. Remember me for my four good kids   You   re very modest. What about some other things you want people to  remember you for?  I have no idea.  Besides being a yellow dog Democrat. (Laughs)  That   s for sure.   Daughter says: You stick up for the small person. You fight for their  rights.   And a friend to all.  Sarah Jane, I really appreciate you taking the time to visit with us. It   s  been great to learn more about you and your parents and  about  your  mother. I found out a lot of things that I didn   t know about her. I loved  the story about the two dresses. Is there anything else that we left out  that you want to share with us?  No, I can   t think of anything. I think we   ve covered a lot.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jerry.  -------  -------
