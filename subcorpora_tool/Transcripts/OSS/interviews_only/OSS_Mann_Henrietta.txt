Gill  Mann  My name is Jerry Gill and I   m interviewing Dr. Henrietta Mann in the  OSU Library on the OSU campus on September 13, 2008. I   m a faculty  member at Oklahoma State University Library, and this interview is  being conducted as part of the O-STATE Stories Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program.  Dr. Mann, you   ve been recognized as Cheyenne of the Year, as National  American Indian Woman of the Year, one of the    Top Five Women  Educators of the Twentieth Century    and yet you have been quoted as  having said,    My entire goal in life is to be nothing but a good  Cheyenne woman.    Can you explain what you mean by that?  Of course. I am Cheyenne. I was born in Hammon, Oklahoma. I was  born Cheyenne, and my grandfather and my father   s teachings as I was  growing up were,    It doesn   t really matter where you go, what you do,  you just have to always remember to be Cheyenne, to speak your  language, to know your culture, to be proud of who you are, to help  others, help to understand all people.    And so it is really nothing more  than being the best person that I can possibly be, who happens to be a  Cheyenne Indian woman. To be a compassionate person, to be generous,  to be helpful to others, and in my profession, to teach others about the  larger world and about themselves. If I were to put myself into a  category, I would say that it would fall more in the line of being a  humanistic kind of educator because I believe in the person. It has been  a joy to be a junior high teacher, a high school teacher, a university  professor, to have been involved in shaping the intellectual capital of  this country and all the more joyful, the American Indian students.  So by being a good Cheyenne, I hope to set an example for others to  emulate. Very basically to say, you know, this is the standard or this is  the bar for me, but I expect you to come along and set a higher standard.  Set that bar higher because you can. I believe in the human potential, the  5  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  potential of each person regardless of who they are, but my emphasis has  always been focused upon American Indian students because of the way  that we have been disadvantaged. Disadvantaged in terms of the  achievement gap that exists now but certainly not disadvantaged when it  comes to our cultures. We are very spiritually rich. We are culturally  wealthy, and it is exactly that that I have wanted to emphasize and the  reason that I have taught Native American Studies for my entire  professional career at the higher education level.  You   ve also indicated that you were called by your parents and your  grandfather to be a prayer woman, and you prayed in ceremonies;  indigenous gathering of tribes in New Zealand; Ground Zero--former  World Trade Center; Stonehenge; Cape Canaveral for a Native  American astronaut; and hundreds of other events. In the Cheyenne  culture, what is a prayer woman and how were you called?  From a cultural frame of reference, one has to understand that we, as  human beings, are part matter or physical, but there is that spiritual  dimension to us that makes us spirit centered, spirit filled. We need to  walk on earth as if we were living a prayer. Every step we take is a  prayer upon this very beautiful and fragile mother of ours that we know  as earth   that we know as a grandmother. So there are some individuals  within the tribe that have a certain inclination to go and be one of the  keepers of the sacred knowledge of the Cheyenne people.  As it turns out this is something that, unknown to me, was set forth for  me to do as a very young child maybe by my great-grandmother. My  great-grandmother was unfortunately and tragically at the massacre of  the Cheyenne along the Washita River.  Often called the Battle of  Washita River.   Sand Creek.  She was at Sand Creek, and my father told me that when he brought my  mother and me home from the hospital that she was waiting. She was a  mid-wife. She took my tiny body in her hands and used it in a very  sacred way in the way that one handles a pipe and pointed my head to  the four sacred directions of the universe, and to the above and below,  and in her language prayed for good things for me, I am sure. My father  said a long life, a good life. As it turns out, I followed the traditions of  the Cheyenne people as one of the prayer women of the people having  participated in the Cheyenne Sun Dance, which we call the    Dance of a  New Life    or the    New Life Lodge    which begins our new year. It  began in July this year. I am one of those women   a very long line of  prayer women who have responsibility for maintaining and upholding  and keeping our spirituality as a people strong and viable so that we can  live.  6  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Are your prayers in Cheyenne language?  They are.  Are there different prayers for different occasions?  It   s usually the same prayer, and I think certainly not just for  Cheyenne   s. One has to remember that American Indians pray for all  life. They pray for everything in this universe and in the creation that  was put here. I would begin my prayers with saying:   prayer in Cheyenne language   I have greeted our creator and said that    I send a prayer to you  today. I call upon you. I call upon the spirits of the four  directions. I ask that you will watch over all humankind, all  people. I want you to watch over all of our relatives, the four-legged   s  and those that fly, those that crawl on the ground, those  that stand rooted in the earth. I ask that you watch out for and  always keep the sun and the moon and the stars safe in their  constellations and in their orbits in the universe. I ask that you  watch over and protect these four basic elements of life   the  earth, air, fire and water   and ask that you will always love and  have mercy upon this place that we call home.     So very simple, but it encompasses everything in this universe   and it  can be no more than that, or I could just say:   prayer in Cheyenne language      Watch over all my relations.     So that is something that two keepers of the tribe do daily for us as a  people   the    Keeper of the Sacred Arrows    who lives here in  Oklahoma, and the    Keeper of the Sacred Buffalo Hat    in Montana. And  they do nothing but continue to send prayers out to all the spirit beings  in the world. So that   s a very honorable job. It is a job of high calling  because not all are called to do that. It is also a very awesome  responsibility, so as you mature and walk around this earth   s circle of  life and reach the age that I have reached at this point in my journey  here, then I am expected to strengthen myself spiritually. My physical  capabilities are starting to diminish   osteoarthritis, you name it. Now  that I   m reaching that point where I   m going back to live in the world of  spirit and going back to live with spirit, then I need to make sure that I  am strengthened spiritually to make that final step back to that world  from which I came initially. So it is that kind of knowledge that I carry  7  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  as one of the prayer women of the Cheyenne people. Does that explain it  to you adequately?  Very good.  I   m very humbled to have that responsibility.  Picking up on your conversation about when your grandmother kind of  presented you   your great-grandmother   can you share with us a little  about growing up   details of your early life growing up in western  Oklahoma   in Hammon, America   and explain the people and the  culture that influenced you?  I was born Cheyenne, and I don   t know what my grandmother said, but  whatever it is she firmly grounded me in this earth. She firmly grounded  me in my culture. So growing up Cheyenne in Hammon, Oklahoma was  a wonderful, wonderful experience. It also had racial overtones that I  experienced, but the good parts I prefer to remember. I am told by my  father that as a baby our little community   and there were the majority  of Cheyennes in Hammon who still lived in the camps as we called it  and in box tents. They lived there all year round. They preferred to live  in this community   wonderful community   and so I was elected the  chairman of our Christmas Committee, as a baby. (Laughter) Of  course, I was very, very powerless to be a chairperson of the Christmas  Committee, but this is something that my parents did for me. They  assumed that responsibility. So did my grandfather, and so did my great-grandmother.  They did all the planning that was involved with having  our Christmas celebration, which we celebrated on December 25.  We had a very strong Mennonite Indian community growing up, and so  we would have fundraising activities and get enough money to hire a  flatbed truck to come to the Canadian River and to pick out a beautiful  cedar tree. We would take it and decorate it in the new traditions and the  way that the people who brought their traditions with them taught us.  We would have gift giving and of course we loved that because we give  away all the time   any occasion. It can be very expensive to be  Cheyenne in 2008, but nonetheless you give because you   re also  expected to be generous   generous of heart and generous of spirit. And  whenever that Christmas tree    the decorations taken down, the limbs  were taken off and they were given   a limb to each family so that they  could take that cedar and dry it and use it to smoke their homes  throughout the year because we say that the cedar is very powerful. We  believe it doesn   t get struck by lightning. It   s always green, and we burn  it in our homes and in our ceremonies to make things good and holy and  green and close to the spirit. So that the community then would take  those cedar branches home with them and remove the needles and dry  8  Gill  Mann  Gill  them and use them for the rest of the year until the next Christmas  celebration. And they used them to smoke their house to protect  themselves, to take away anything that might be negative and to put a  very strong protective shield of the cedar smoke around them. So we did  that on Christmases.  We celebrated many occasions. Our own    the Sun Dance, Mother   s  Day   we celebrated Flag Day. We   re very patriotic as a people and  we   d all gather in the community and we would all eat together. There   s  usually an organizing committee that divided responsibilities and  brought us together. We have always lived in community   valued  community and have always wanted to keep it strong and so that was a  part of the cultural life of growing up Cheyenne in Hammon, Oklahoma.  The other was growing up Cheyenne in a school in which we were the  minority, even though we had a very high percentage of the population  of Hammon, being Cheyenne. I went to school with maybe   usually a  handful of Cheyenne children in each of my classes and we dealt with  the kind of tension that sometimes occurs between Indians and non-  Indians. I would say very normal   a very normal teenage life, and  participating in extra-curricular activities, the life of the school itself but  always having that cultural life available at the Indian camps   keeping  that strong, speaking our languages at home, speaking our languages in  the community, and celebrating in the summertime with gatherings with  foot races or gunny sack races or having a couple tie the inside legs  together and jumping all three-legged    Just those normal things. I grew  up with that kind of an experience.  They had a Christian influence. We learned to sing little Christian  hymns, make signs to go along with them. My mother had a beautiful  voice and could sing many of our other Christian hymns in the  Cheyenne language. I picked up some of them and can sing along with  somebody else today. But I   ve been away for a long time. I was gone for  about 35 years, and I made a full circle. The circle is virtually complete.  I   m supposed to go back to Montana. Montana is home. Montana was  good to me. I enjoyed a wonderful childhood. There were the challenges  that one had to face   alcoholism, racism or discrimination, health issues  that have become more pronounced today. But I look back upon my time  in Hammon, Oklahoma with a very good heart, with fond memories.  You indicated that you knew at an early age you wanted to be a  teacher     Right.     and then you enrolled when you were only 16 years old at  9  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Southwestern Oklahoma State     I did.  Can you tell us a little about the calling to be a teacher and then also  your experience there at Southwestern?  I had an unfortunate experience that was racially motivated and became  very disillusioned about my fourth year of grade school   and I know I  went home in tears. My grandfather held me and soothed me as only a  grandparent can do and talked to me about it and said,    This is  something that you are going to have to learn to live with because it  exists.    What a horrible thing to have to tell a child, that we have to live  in a world where there is racial discrimination and that kind of tension.  And he said,    And it   s going to be up to you, how you deal with it. Of  course I never, ever want you to deny who you are as a Cheyenne  person, so maybe you need to be teaching that to someone. Maybe you  need to be like those first students that we sent to off-reservation  boarding schools. Maybe you need to build those bridges of  understanding, and maybe you need to think about teaching as a  profession.    By that time, of course, I loved education. I   ve always  loved education. I   ve always wanted to learn, and so I said,    Then, I   m  going to be a teacher.    If it   s going to be, in my child-like mind, to build  those bridges of understanding and make life more harmonious and  more peaceful for us as human beings, that   s what I want to do. And I  became a teacher, wanting to help create bridges of understanding  between and among cultures.  So you got your degree in Education there at Southwestern and     I did. My first degree was a Bachelor of Arts degree in Education with a  major in English, simply because I speak English with an accent. I didn   t  speak English very well in my home. Our first language was Cheyenne,  and I knew that if I was going to be a teacher and if I were going to  succeed, that I would have to learn to communicate in the way that  mainstream America does, so I majored in English. I have two degrees  in English, as a matter of fact, and that was what I wanted to teach. At  the foot of the hill from the school in Hammon was a theater, and there  was a little curb. I can remember my grandfather sitting there and  visiting with his cronies and saying,    You know, Henrietta   s going to go  off to college and she   s going to go and learn English and she   s going to  teach English. She needs to do that because she   s going to be a teacher.     Many years later when I finally got my first degree it seemed as if my  grandfather and his cronies are still sitting in the same spot and he says,     Oh, you remember my granddaughter, Henrietta. She   s gone to school  and she   s learned to speak English and now she   s going to teach English  10  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  to the white people   s children,    and he said,    but the beauty is, she still  remembers and knows how to speak Cheyenne.    And so it was very  important for me from the age of   in my formative years   to have  decided to become a teacher, and that   s what I became. I followed my  dreams and I fulfilled them, and I   ve retired as a university professor.  So your dream first took you though from Weatherford to Barstow, is  that right? Barstow, California teaching middle school? How did you  wind up in Barstow?  Oh, let me see how to explain this. I wanted to teach Indian children, but  I did not want to teach in the Bureau of Indian Affairs school because I  had my idea of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and how it had contributed  to the deculturation of Indian people. But I wanted to teach Indian young  people. I just wanted to teach, period. My mother lived in California and  so I decided that I wanted to spend time with my mother. She lived in  Los Angeles. I applied for a job in Barstow, California, which was  advertising for teachers and so I ended up teaching social studies at a  junior high there.  That   s a predominantly white population?  Yes  And I decided that that is not what I went into my teaching  profession for, and I came back to Oklahoma and ultimately married,  and started my family. My late husband worked in the Public  Information Office here at Oklahoma State University, and we moved  here to Stillwater. My youngest daughter, Jackie, was born here and...  A lot of good memories here in Stillwater then for you.  Very good memories.  And you got your masters degree here     I did. My Master of Arts degree in English     English, yes.  It was something I had to learn to do. I had to learn to speak in the  language of communication of this country. So we moved here to  Stillwater. I have good memories. I got my masters degree ultimately  and then that was when I found my place in this world in terms of  teaching, teaching Native American Studies at the higher education  level. I went from here in Stillwater to teach at the University of  California in Berkeley.  11  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Were there people that you developed friendships with or relationships  with or were special to you while you were here at Oklahoma State? Any  names you remember of faculty or friends?  I worked in the Art Department. J. Jay McVicker was my supervisor.  But to be truthful, I really have not stayed in touch with many  individuals here at Oklahoma State University   sadly, because I went  off   was fulfilling my dream. I went to teach in Native American  Studies at the University of California at Berkeley but Oklahoma State  University certainly prepared me well for that job, in terms of my  confidence. But I had to go back and ferret out the information in  teaching about Native American Studies on my own. No institution in  the world could have prepared me for that anyway because it just was  not the thing, to teach about Native Americans at the time I was growing  up and then going to school here.  You were in Berkeley then and you did your doctorate at the University  of Mexico, is that right?  I did, eventually.  So you were at Berkeley for a few years and then      I was at Berkeley for two and a half years during the heyday of activism.  My students were out at Alcatraz   occupying Alcatraz. They finally  came back to school. Having grown up in Hammon, Oklahoma, living  here in Stillwater, Oklahoma, I   m really just a small-town girl at heart     and I thought,    This is not the place for me.    I applied for a job in  Montana, and that has been home for the past 35 years. I retired from the  Montana University system, and I went up through the ranks. I started  out as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor with  tenure, became a full professor, and I left the University of Montana to  go and teach and accept an endowed chair position which is what we all  aim for in the professoriate. I accepted that and went from the University  of Montana to Montana State University, and I retired, technically, in  2003. I still continue, however, to be employed on a post-retirement  contract with the president of Montana State University as his special  assistant, and he has loaned me to the tribes for this year to be the  president of our tribal college, the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal  College.  Let me back up just a little bit. The 28 years at the University of  Montana   my understanding is it is one of the first programs in Native  American Studies      Well, among them at least.  12  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann     so you got in on the ground floor of that. Could you just share a little  about the kind of legacy that you think that program left and that you left  there at the University of Montana? Some of your major goals and  purposes there and what you feel like you accomplished there?  Having taught at the University of California at Berkeley, Native  American Studies was a part of the Ethnic Studies Department and we  were housed along with other minorities at that time, Chicano Studies,  Asian Studies and Black Studies. My experience there and my  commitment to Indian education to Indian people conditioned my  thinking that the next job I go to would be a stand-alone program and  not part of an Ethnic Studies program. For some, that works well but it  didn   t work well for me just in terms of my orientation and what I felt I  had to do.  So I went to the University of Montana, and there were three courses  when I went to work as the Director of Native American Studies. When  I left there, we had a baccalaureate degree in Native American Studies  and it was a stand-alone program. It was    take this and build it   do what  you want with it,    and I did. It was a wonderful process in change and  development, having to develop courses dealing with the American  Indian Experience, American Indian Literature, seminars on American  Indian Women, Montana Indians, and Introduction to Native American  Studies. What I liked best were, of course, teaching the Cheyenne  language and culture courses, which I did. It   s a very academically  rigorous baccalaureate degree program in Native American Studies that I  certainly helped to develop at the University of Montana in Missoula.  Someone had guessed that maybe 80 percent of the students you had  taught had been non-Native American     Right.     and could you share what you think you were able to accomplish or  achieve in explaining Native American culture to     (Laughs) Parents would probably just be surprised because,    I was  about instituting and bringing about a peaceful revolution, if ever a  revolution is peaceful.    It was helping the children of my non-Indian  brothers and sisters understand that there are cultural differences in the  world. That we are different. That even the flowers that we see around  are very different, but they   re flowers. That we have a common  humanity, but there are cultural differences. There are differences in  historical experiences. There are different ways of looking at the world  and relating to that world and to the environment about us and in Native  American Studies, I could do that. It was wonderful to go to work every  13  day because it was a joy for me to tell others about the beauty of what it  is to be American Indian, in my case to be Cheyenne. But at the same  time also to remind them that if indeed there is going to ever be peace in  this world that we have to understand each other and we have to  understand our experiences.  And I had to teach about the tragic kinds of experiences that we  encountered as Cheyenne people, that the Indians encountered in history  in terms of the de-population of this country following contact. From its  5.65 million, I believe those are the most recent adjusted figures of the  population at time of contact. Others say 16 million to a population low,  as you are aware, of 250,000 in 1890 when Indians were first included in  the federal census. That is a dramatic decline and how did we do that?  Yes, we did it through conflict, but a lot of it was the result of   maybe it  wasn   t intended   I could certainly equate it to a form of biological germ  warfare. The kinds of diseases that were brought to this country by those  who came from other parts of the world and brought the diseases that we  had never experienced before to which we had developed no immunity,  whether it was whooping cough, smallpox, tuberculosis, on and on and  on. So that we succumbed to those kinds of new diseases that came here,  so that     I guess if we want to put things in proper perspective after 9/11, we of  all people can understand the fear that was created by the kind of  experience that we collectively shared as the United States of America     we call terrorism. But unfortunately if we   re going to be true to history,  American Indians also suffered that same kind of experience and that  when we think of anthrax, yet it may not have been anthrax in post-contact  times   the early contact times but it was smallpox when  blankets were deliberately infected with smallpox and issued to  American Indian tribes for them to develop that disease. Maybe it wasn   t  true for all that we encountered, but I do know as this country  manifested its destiny and cultural imperialism was put into play,  cholera   there was a cholera epidemic in Europe consequently leading  to a cholera epidemic in St. Louis and as the settlers went out in the mid-  1800s, they carried that same cholera. They carried cholera with them  and decimated Cheyenne camps by about 50 percent as has been  described by George Bent, that entire villages were oftentimes left  standing with the dead in those tents   the result of cholera.  So, yes   so we need to understand that, we are the first people to this  country. You   re not going to find us any other place in the world. Our  first languages are the first here. Our cultures are the first. And I think it  was very important for me following our own traditions to maintain that  tradition of being among the first teachers of this country which  certainly led me to go into the education field.  14  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  You mentioned you were primarily teaching Native American students     you really had a larger mission, too   perhaps educating    non    as well?  It was. And so those parents knew it. Their children were about the  process of developing understanding      Sure, sure.     and in their own way, affecting change to create more harmonious  relations between and among the cultures and just recognizing that kind  of link that we have to one another as human beings first.  Your heart has always been with your people. As you mentioned earlier,  you   ve come full circle and back to Oklahoma. You retired from  Montana State but not for long. It was April this year that you were in  officially inducted as President of the Cheyenne Arapaho Tribal College  there in Weatherford. Could you tell us a little about the philosophy and  mission of the college and your aspirations for it?  The vision of the college is to be an educational sanctuary and to house  the cultural capital of the Cheyenne Arapaho people and to develop the  ability of our students to think, to be good-hearted Cheyenne people, to  be good Arapaho, but to have a safe place to learn that, a safe place that  honors their heritage as Cheyenne and Arapaho people. This college is  really a monument to all of the Cheyenne ancestors that have ever lived  on this land. It is their legacy and we had wonderful educational systems  of our own maybe not the way we know them to be today. But our  educational systems, I would say, were performance-based or  competency-based educational systems. We educated very skillful  knowledgeable men and women.  And so we continue along that same line, with that same kind of  thinking, to want our young people, hopefully, to be skillful and  knowledgeable Cheyenne and Arapahos. Even though they live in the  21st century in a different time, they have an educational tradition that  they can fall back on. So ours is that sanctuary that houses traditional  knowledge of the Cheyenne and Arapaho people and has some  responsibility to teach that kind of traditional knowledge to all Cheyenne  and Arapaho young people. In terms of the mission itself, we want to  provide nothing but a very culturally based, academically strong,  education to Cheyenne and Arapaho students, to other Indian students,  to non-Indians that want to come to our school as well and help them to  understand their place in this world, in this time, in this place.  I   m going to share a couple quotes, if I can. One author wrote,     Henrietta Mann embodies the ideology of a tribal leader. At the same  15  Mann  Gill  Mann  time, she defies it.    Another wrote,    She is traditional values and action  and what it means to be a contemporary American Indian.    Can you  explain the anomaly here the contradiction in those statements?  Rick West, I think, is the one that said that. (Laughs) There   s no  contradiction, absolutely no contradiction. If you stop and think of those  that came to live with us, just think of the cultural knowledge that was  brought to this country by those who came here to live with us whether  it was German, French, Irish, Italian   all of that   because everyone has  that kind of heritage that they can say is them. We might say we   re all  American, but what is American? I know there   s no one model  American. I haven   t found that one model American yet but I can be  Cheyenne. I can go into our most sacred place, our Sundance Arbor. I  can go to fast at Bear Butte, which is the spiritual center of the universe.  I have my responsibilities to care for and to pray for all life, to ask for  blessings upon this creation.  But at the same time I can go into any classroom, any venue where I   m  asked to speak and, I hope, bring a message of love, compassion,  understanding and peace along with that I have learned in an academic  context. I can   t separate them. They are the same for me. They are who I  am. I had the best education. I have a very good education, among the  best that we can get in terms of college degrees but that hasn   t changed  who I am in terms of my heart and my spirit and my culture. But I can  be both. Rolling Stone magazine can hail me as one of the ten top  professors in the country, but that has not changed me or derailed me     kept me from being just a good-hearted Cheyenne woman.  Back to where we started   Cheyenne woman. If you would allow me one  more quote. Dr. Gamble, the President of Montana State University,  described you in this way. He said,    Henrietta is a most remarkable  woman and also a very powerful woman   spiritually powerful,  intellectually powerful, politically powerful.    Wow, you   do you agree  with him? (Laughter)  That   s his assessment. I just take these talents that I have to work with  people, whether they   re legislators or the governor of our tribe or elected  leaders. I   m never conscious of that power. I may be perceived as having  it. I have responsibilities. I have responsibilities to build a peaceful, safe  world for my daughter and for my grandchildren and   all of my  grandchildren. And maybe it takes power to do that, but I never perceive  it. I think if people become aware of their power, then they lose it  because power can be abused. Power can corrupt and so I never think of  myself in that context. If it is there, I hope I will always use it for the  good of the people.  16  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Well Dr. Mann, what has been your talisman, your true north, that   s  guided your life?  Love and respect. I have been taught that love and respect are our most  powerful weapons and that the most destructive weapons are jealousy  and fear. So my true north has been about love, about respect, about  compassion, and being of service to others.  Thinking back in your life, have there been some people who have  shaped you, have been role models and mentors for you in your life     have been important in your life? Who would some of those be?  My grandfather and my father have been powerful influences in my life.  They kept me grounded. They still keep me grounded even though  they   re not here. Other individuals, my English teacher in high school. I  decided that I wanted to be like her, and I don   t think I   ve ever told her.  She was left-handed as well. Her name was Louise Sadler.  Is she still alive?  I don   t know.  Maybe sharing this with her, you   ll get a chance to tell her now.  And so Louise Sadler was left-handed   this left-handed English teacher  who would come along and look at the way that I held my pen. I wrote,  as most left-handed people did, and she would come and turn my paper  around. She said,    You can write that way,    and so I wanted to write that  way. My letters have a backward slant to them. I decided that I wanted  to become like Louise Sadler, not so much another Louise Sadler but  like Louise Sadler   an English teacher, a left-handed person that held  her paper right so that she could maybe be, sort of, normal like other  children were normal in the way they held their paper, even though they  wrote with the right hand.  Did you have the half-chair that was for right-handed people? I   m  looking at the same thing, trying to write on a half desk that   s for right-handed  people. It   s kind of tough, isn   t it?  I know, and did you realize that we have a shorter lifespan than right-handed  people? (Laughter)  Now, I don   t want to hear that.  Statistically that   s been stated. And Louise Sadler. But beyond that, my  great-grandmother giving that welcome to me into this world and I guess  17  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  culturally grounded me but also gave me a purpose in life to remember  who I am and to always help Cheyennes. I can remember her from my  childhood, seeing her once. When we had the opening ceremonies of the  Cheyenne Arapaho Tribal College on August 25, 2006 was the first time  I ever saw a photograph of her. The photograph was given to me at the  opening ceremonies of the college. Then I knew what she looks like  and     And she was the one, Dr. Mann, who survived the massacre by Black  Kettle tribe?  And in that particular photograph, she   s holding a little cradleboard and  in that cradleboard is me. I mean, it was almost as if I had finally  found   I knew where I came from. I knew where I belonged. She has  had a phenomenal, phenomenal impact on my life. My father would say,     My grandmother said this and I   m telling you this.    My grandfather  would say,    My mother taught me this. I   m passing it on down to you,     and just as his father told him,    I don   t have anything to leave you. The  only thing I have to leave you is my words, and those words come from  my grandmother. Those words come from my mother.    It   s those kinds  of teachings that come from one generation to the next that are so  important that help us to maintain our sense of history, this continuum  between yesterday and today   and it   s got to be there for tomorrow.  And that, I think, is another one of my reasons here to make sure that  there is that bonding of traditional Cheyenne knowledge and teachings  and those ceremonies that are going to be there for all Cheyennes who  have yet to come to live on this earth. So she has had an absolutely, I  would say extraordinary, impact on my life for me not to have known  her, but I have known her in a way. I   ve known her genetically. I know  her spiritually. She was a mid-wife. She was a doctor in our traditional  sense, in this case a doctor of horses. We relied upon horses. And there  is Louise Sadler. Ironically, I learn from my children.  Well     They have taught me a great deal about love, about what it is to  understand, to be patient, to be generous. So it   s been family, aside from  the English teacher.  Dr. Mann, in all of the things you   ve accomplished in your lifetime, how  do you want to be remembered? What do you hope your legacy will be?  I just want to be remembered as a good Cheyenne woman (Laughs) who  lived a life of service, who put the honor of the people before her and  wanted to be honorable like them and to make sure that they never had  to endure, again, the kind of sadness and fear and tragedy of Sand  18  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Creeks or Washitas   that that would not be a part of their experience.  And that   s what I   ve been doing in terms of my peaceful revolution, to  teach the children of my brothers and sisters who came to live with us  about us. That we are not to be feared. That we   re not obstacles to  progress. That we do not stand in the way of expansionist doctrine and  policy. That we are human beings.That we gave away an entire country  to others whether it was through taking and fraud or disowning us. That  there is still the very fact that we live here together and that we should  honor each other   s cultural differences and cultural orientations  regardless of the cultural backgrounds from which we come. If we don   t  do that, then our grandchildren are never going to know that world of  peace that they deserve to live in.  Dr. Mann, is there any other topic that we haven   t touched on   anything  you   d like to share that we haven   t discussed yet?  The Cheyenne Arapaho College is very small. It   s very fragile. It   s like a  little plant that has to be nurtured and nourished, and it   s probably the  biggest educational challenge of my life. I   ve done many things and  have been very blessed with having, sort of maybe, succeeded. I   ve gone  up through the ranks in a major university, retired, and been an endowed  chair. I think all of that has prepared me to be a college president, a  tribal college president, but it is by far the biggest challenge that I have  ever experienced in my life. I   m glad to be there helping but there are  days where I stop and look around and say,    What am I doing here? I  should be retired.    Then I look at the younger people and some of them  say,    Well, I don   t want to go to college. I don   t see the value of an  education,    and I am taken a little bit aback by that.  It has been very difficult to get an enrollment or a student body for the  college. We have over 100   or around 100 part-time and full-time  students   but each one of those students has been like pulling eye teeth.  So we have to make sure that we go back and inspire and motivate them  and encourage them to see the value in education if they are going to be  the kind of self-sustaining and independent people that we have always  been as Cheyenne and Arapahos. So that   s a big challenge for me right  at this point in time. I   ve never been daunted by many challenges except  that I feel right now I am working against time. I   m going to be 75 this  next year and I guess ultimately I   m about looking for the right person to  come to work with me for a year and then it can be that person   s  responsibility to take the college from where I leave it.  I wouldn   t bet against you, Dr. Mann. (Laughter) Anything else?  Oh, no. And I look to institutions of this type to develop those kinds of  people. You can always hope to find the right person with a PhD, an  19  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  EdD will do, too, but a PhD. That   s important. It   s very important. But  I   m also going to need someone that has a commitment and love of the  people here inside. It   s got to have a passion. It   s got to be very, very  committed to Cheyenne and Arapaho culture.  You were on the Board of Trustees and then Interim President and now  President and they had to kind of win you away (Laughs) from Montana  State, I understand     Oh, I   ve got to tell you the one day where I thought,    Oh, good        someone said,    Who doesn   t want to be an officer?    and I held up my  hand. I didn   t want to be an officer. I had plenty of things to do. And so  they   ve let me get by with it and I thought,    oh, that was easy. I don   t  have to be an officer.    (Laughter) Then about the next hour after lunch  I was approached about,    Well, now we want you to be the Interim  President and I said,    I can   t be.       Oh, we want you to be the President,     and I said,    I can   t be. I   ve got a job in Montana. I have a home up there.  I can   t do that.    And they said,    Well, will you be Interim President and  you can go back and forth?    and I did for a year. You don   t run a college  or build a college from Montana and very fortunately President Gamble  from Montana State University said,    We have to help tribal colleges,  and so we   ll help your tribe. You go down there, Henri. You do it.    He  said,    Come back home. We   re going to be waiting for you.     We kind of feel like you   ve already come back home to Oklahoma, too,  Dr. Mann. Thank you very much.  Well, thank you. I hope you got whatever information you needed. It   s  been wonderful.  Appreciate your helping   absolutely.  You had me think very deeply in my heart for a lot of your questions.  ------- End of September 13, 2008 interview -------  My name is Jerry Gil and the date is October 10, 2008. I   m visiting for  the second time with Dr. Henrietta Mann in Weatherford, Oklahoma.  The interview is part of the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma  Oral History Research Program. Doctor Mann, after teaching in  California you came back to Oklahoma. What brought you back to  Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University?  Well, I taught at the University of California Berkeley but I left there to  go teach at the University of Montana. And I actually taught at the  University of Montana off and on for 28 years. But I left there at one  20  time to go teach in the Graduate School of Education at Harvard  University. And then I took some time off to go and direct the office of  Indian Education Programs for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. And also  served as a visiting professor and interim Dean of Instruction for Haskell  Indian Nations University.  The University of Montana was a spring board, just like Oklahoma State  University was to new challenges, new experiences in the field of Indian  Education. And I retired from the Montana University System but very  specifically from Montana State University in 2003. But in 2000 I left  the University of Montana to accept and fill an endowed chair at  Montana State University, an endowed chair in Native American  Studies. Well, that   s the pinnacle that University professors, I think,  strive to achieve and I had to go and fill that endowed chair. It was an  honor for me to be asked to be the first person to serve in that position.  And I did. And when I retired, it was a three year chair; I decided I  didn   t know what I was going to do. And the President of Montana State  University said I absolutely cannot let you go. You have to stay on. And  that   s where I   m at right now on a post-retirement contract working as a  special assistant to the president of Montana State University.  I had been involved with the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes in the area of  education for most of the time I had been gone. They passed a resolution  to establish a tribal college and the passed a resolution to establish a  Board of Regents. I was asked to serve on that Board of Regents and I  did so willingly and commuted from Montana here  to Weatherford  to  serve as a Regent. Then as work on developing the Cheyenne and  Arapaho Tribal College progressed I ended up being asked to serve as  their interim president. Which I did, but I was still located in Montana.  And finally I decided this isn   t working. Either they   re going to have to  find a president who will be there full time or we   re going to have to  work out something different.  The president for whom I work for at Montana State University says,     We have to support Tribal colleges and their development. And right  now since you   re Cheyenne and you   re needed down there then by all  means we   ll do what we can to make sure that you   re there.    And I said,     Well, what about my options of returning?    He said,    Well we can  continue as it is and you go back and forth and do what you can for the  college from a distance. Or the other extreme you might just decide to  say    I quit    and leave Montana State University altogether and leave  Montana    or he said,    we can develop a compromise position. The big  compromise position that I have is I give you a leave of absence and you  go down to assume the presidency of the university for a year,    and now  it   s two years,    and then you can come back.    So that   s what brought me  back into Cheyenne and Arapaho country, brought me back to  21  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Oklahoma, brought me back in contact with Oklahoma State University  where I received my master   s degree. And when I drove there to accept  the Alumni award and to go back to the student powwow I thought,  there   s good memories here. This is a good place. It was a good place to  pursue my education. They prepared me well.  Right.  And     A step back, before Montana you were teaching, I think, at a Middle  school in Barstow, California. And then the next thing you come back to  Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. Can you tell us a little bit about your  career there and how you got back to Oklahoma and started your  Master   s program at Oklahoma State?  Well, I graduated with a Bachelor   s degree in Education from  Southwestern Oklahoma State University. I was determined to be a  teacher. And my mother lived in California. I wanted to spend time with  her after graduation. And I went to Los Angeles and I got there and  began looking around for teaching positions and finally found one out in  Barstow, California, and taught in the Middle Schools, taught Social  Studies and Reading and English. And ultimately I decided that  California wasn   t where I wanted to establish my career and came back  home to Oklahoma. Married. And my husband was a student at  Oklahoma State University-Okmulgee.  Where   d you meet? And is there a story there a little bit?  Oh, I met him here. He was Cheyenne and Arapaho and I met him in our  homeland here. Actually in Oklahoma City  I guess that   s still part of  our homeland. And he was Cheyenne and Arapaho. So we married. And  he was in school at Okmulgee and applied for a job at Oklahoma State  University in the Public Information Office and got the job. So we  moved to Stillwater. The rest is history.  When you went back to Oklahoma State did you then think at that time  about starting your master   s program? Did you start about the same  time?  I did. I had actually started my master   s program here at Southwestern  Oklahoma State University and never really completed it. When we  moved to Stillwater and relocated our family, and this was in the early     60   s, it was a most natural thing for me. I worked in the art department  as a secretary and began taking classes. Finally in 1970, I was at the  thesis stage before that of course, I thought now I   ve got a master   s  22  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  degree, what do I do. And I had always wanted to teach Indian students,  but I did not want to teach in a Bureau of Indian Affairs school, just in  terms of my own mind set. Because in my estimation they hadn   t done a  very good job of educating Indian young people for life.  But I wanted to teach Indian students and became aware of a new  discipline on college campuses in California at places like the University  of California-Berkeley and other of their units, San Francisco State  University. It was about that time that American Indians had occupied  Alcatraz and it was in the heyday of activism, Indian activism. And I  applied for a job, I called San Francisco State University and told them I  was interested in a job and they said    You have to go to Cal-Berkeley,  they   re hiring right now.   So I applied at the University of California-  Berkeley, was offered a job, picked up my family and left and never  looked back. I went to the west coast. I mean it wasn   t Horace Greely  telling me to    go west young man,    but it was just me saying,    I want to  go and be involved in Native American Studies.    A new academic  discipline for which there were very few, if any, precedents so that   s  how.  When you were at Oklahoma State, you   re major was English?  It was English.  You got your bachelors in English? Did you have an inkling when you  were going through the program at Oklahoma State that you were going  to focus, in your mind, in Native American Studies?  Actually I did not. I just wanted to teach. But it wasn   t Native American  Studies per se. I just assumed I would be teaching English somewhere,  teaching English in some high school. I never ever dreamed that I   d be  teaching at the university level. I just thought that I was no longer going  to be teaching in a middle school or junior high. And high school,  maybe? Maybe a junior college setting? And I wasn   t methodically  preparing myself to teach at the higher education level. I was just getting  a good education from Oklahoma State University, expanding upon my  degree in English. I think I talked a little about growing up speaking  Cheyenne and how important being able to communicate in the larger  society is to me and so I needed to develop my English speaking skills.  Both the oral and written. And I still have to work on my oral  communication skills at time. Written I don   t worry about too much. I  wanted to be a teacher my whole life. My grandfather and I started this. I  guess he put that dream in my head when I was maybe in the third or  fourth grade in school. And I decided at that early age that I wanted to  be a teacher. And that was all that was in my mind when I was pursuing  my master   s degree at Oklahoma State.  23  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Did any of your professors or advisors influence you in your time there  that you recall? Any of the teachers that you had, professors,  administrators?  Not really. They were good, but I was working full time in the art  department and I took a class a semester. And it was just a class a  semester. And I just I went to classes and never really was ever  conscious of saying    I   m going to have my master   s degree.    I mean,  somewhere in the back of my mind I wanted it. But it was just going to  school and taking advantage of the opportunity that Oklahoma State  University provided us with my husband working there and with my  working there. I   d have to go back and review my transcript to see who  even taught me. I don   t know if that   s indicative of extreme and severe  memory loss or not. I can remember professors from Southwestern and  professors from my PhD. But somewhere or another I   m trying to think  of a name. Dr. Jay McVicker     Jay McVicker        was in the Art Department. He was probably the most influential in  my life there. He provided me with the opportunity to go to school. And  so I remember him more so and was extremely influenced by his art. I  didn   t really have much time for anything because I was working full  time, and rearing my family.  Working full time and going to school is probably a pretty good load.  What was the culture? Was it an inviting culture for Native Americans  on campus at that time? Do you recall a little bit about how  supportive   .  I don   t think it was that inviting if you want me to be frank.  Sure.  In fact, my late husband and I were asked to be the sponsors of the  American Indian Club then. Dr. John Tippeconic was a student. There  wasn   t very much of a support system. Let me put it that way. Maybe it  wasn   t that it wasn   t inviting, but there wasn   t the kind of academic  structure that would be conducive to helping students get acquainted to  the university to know that there might be tutoring services available to  help them succeed in college. So there weren   t really any kind of  retention programs that I was aware of. Except that we were asked if we  would sponsor a very small Indian club, so we did. And I like to think  that in that way we helped and provided a supportive atmosphere for the  students at Oklahoma State University.  24  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Oklahoma State University has come a long ways from that day, in  terms of the students   the caliber of the students that it has. The fact  that it has someone like Robin Williams there. But she   s just a  wonderful young woman who is a credit to Oklahoma State University.  And obviously has done an excellent job in working with the students in  terms of the kind of team work and cohesiveness that I saw exhibited not  just at the award ceremonies but at the powwow this past weekend. The  powwow was student organized, student run, student implemented and  Robin was there assisting them. I think they had one other faculty  sponsor there. I don   t remember his name. And so from the late 60   s to  now Oklahoma State University has certainly developed a very strong  infrastructure for supporting Native American students and helping them  to succeed through graduation.  Outside of the academic arena, do you have any special memories or  things that you recall, any special places on campus from when you  were there?  I recall the library.  That   s good.  I spent a lot of time there when I could squeeze the time away from my  family. I never spent much time at the Student Union. I couldn   t, I didn   t  have the luxury of that time. When you work full time and go to school  part time, I didn   t have the luxury of getting acquainted with my  professors, with other students, or places. I just know that   s it   s a  beautiful little campus. That it was a good place to be for me at that  time, obviously. We lived in family and graduate housing and then we  moved out by the little lake out north of town.  Boomer Lake?  Yes. We purchased a home out there and lived there until I decided I  was going to go and work in the area of Native American studies. And it  was probably the best decision that I could have ever made for myself in  terms of utilizing my academic background in a new and different way.  Because Native American studies was not a part of the regular  curriculum of most colleges and universities. All of them maybe.  So in terms of family education, you   re husband was working. Was he  working on his Master   s Degree?  No he didn   t. He got a certificate from Oklahoma State University     Okmulgee in drafting. So that was his field. And then he got a job in the  Public Information Office and he did the art work for the campus.  25  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  I understand that there is a story there about you saw some art when you  received your recognition award there in the Oklahoma room, there in  the Student Union...  Mm-hmm.  Was that special for you?  It was. But of course I   ve got paintings of my late husband at home. But  it was nice to see that those paintings that Oklahoma State University  owns being displayed for other people to enjoy. My son saw them and  he literally came running out of the room yelling    My dad   s paintings  are in here     and he was shouting to the world    there are five paintings  of my dad   s in here.    So he and the other child that attended the awards  ceremony, my youngest, Jackie, who works for a public broadcasting  system in Las Vegas, they enjoyed seeing them. They took photographs  of them. And it was nice to receive an award in that room because I  certainly could feel my late-husband   s presence.  And so what I am hearing you say is that in addition to commercial art,  he also an artist on campus?  He was. He was a commercial artist and he painted Indian   well I guess  I   d call them Indian paintings.  So by a class a semester plan you got your master   s. Did you then go  directly from there to the University of New Mexico, at that time?  I actually left in 1970. Although I completed my degree requirements, I  left early. I left maybe in March or so to go teach at the University of  California in Berkeley. So I went directly from Stillwater to Berkeley.  Talk about culture shock  Talk about the transition from being a part  time student, a nontraditional student to a university where half my  students, my Indian students were out on Alcatraz. And I walked into  my first higher education university classroom at UC-Berkeley, there  were no Indian students. I was highly dismayed. There were a lot of non-  Indian students and I thought,    but I wanted to teach Indian students,     and what do you do? That kind of set the tone of the kind of classroom  composition that I had to accept. About 90  of my classes were non-  Indian students. And so we went to Berkeley. It was the heyday of  activism. Students began coming back from Alcatraz. I stayed there for  two and a half years and decided that the Bay Area was just not quite the  place that this little Oklahoma Cheyenne gal wanted to be or could be.  So at that point in your career, you decided that California was not for  me, then.  26  Mann  Gill  Mann  Yes, and I applied for two jobs then. One at Bellingham Washington  and one at the University of Montana-Missoula. I was offered a job in  both places, so I had to make a choice. I took the one in Montana which  was the best one. But by that time at the University of California-  Berkeley, Native American studies was part of the Ethnic Studies  Department. The Ethnic Studies Department had four programs. It had  Chicano studies, as Hispanic studies was then called, African American  studies, Asian studies, and then lastly Native American studies. It was  called Native American studies. Sometimes we use the term American  Indian studies and I   ve noticed that the term indigenous studies is being  used more frequently to indicate this particular discipline. But when I  left Berkeley I decided that I wanted to go to a place where Native  American studies stood alone. And that it wasn   t a part of an ethnic  studies program per se. That we as Indians deserve to have our own  academic discipline, stand-alone programs and went to the University of  Montana in Missoula. There was an American Indian studies program  there all by itself that offered two courses when I got there, one course  and then an independent studies course. So by the time I left in 2000,  we had a baccalaureate degree in Native American studies.  A new program when you got there, and you kind of helped build it from  scratch?  It had two classes and independent studies. And so I did it. I worked  there off and on for 28 years. But I did leave to go teach at Harvard. I  left on an inter-governmental personnel assignment to direct the Office  of Indian Education Programs for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I only  lasted a year. But it was by my choice. Bureaucracy was strange to me. I  saw that change was not going to happen very quickly. That if change  was going to occur, I was much more apt to make those kinds of  changes, suggest those kinds of changes in my classroom rather than  sitting as the highest ranking Indian women in Indian Education for the  Reagan administration, although I   m a democrat. So I was there a year  and said,    No.    Furthermore I didn   t want to compromise my integrity  anymore. Government has its own kind of personality. It definitely has  its own culture. So I went back to my classroom.  Then somewhere along the way in 1977   it was when we left Harvard  that my husband said,    You   re teaching PhD level students. Haven   t you  ever thought about getting your PhD?    I said,    Yes of course        Well,     he said,    Then it   s time for you to go get it.    He had some health issues  by then. His kidneys had failed and he was on a dialysis machine which  we had in the house. So we went back to Montana and got things ready.  Got our house ready for renting. And we moved down to Albuquerque,  New Mexico and that was in 1979, the fall of 1979. And I went to school  full time. The university had given me three years to complete my  27  doctorate degree which is a very short period of time  So I said, okay. I  had gone there the summer before to see whether or not I could still do  the coursework. And I was very pleased when I got my 4.0 for the  summer, even though the classes were very intense.  We went down and I completed my coursework and sat for my  comprehensive and was notified on December 5, 1980 in the morning  that I had passed my comps and I guess was officially a PhD candidate.  That was 9 in the morning. And by 5 o   clock that evening my husband  had passed away from a massive heart attack, a coronary. That certainly  left me, again, with some decisions. Do I go back to Montana without  my degree? I could have gone back. But I looked at the general pattern,  that many of my peers had reached the A.B.D. stage which was where I  was, all but dissertation. Many of them never got past the A.B.D. stage,  they just stopped there and never completed their degrees. I weighed my  options. I thought I can go back to my job. I was only on three year  leave to complete my doctorate. Or I can go into debt and stay here and  get it all done. So I went into debt and applied for loans. I stayed and did  research on my dissertation and wrote my dissertation and got my  Doctorate of Philosophy degree in American Studies which is the closest  I could come to Native American studies in May of 1982.  So I went back to the University of Montana then. And in 1986 I was  asked to assume the directorship of the office of Indian Education  programs. And then I went back to Montana. And then I was invited by  Haskell Indian Nations University to come down as a visiting professor  and I did so for two years. But my reputation sort of became tainted with  the Native community nationally because of my association with the  Federal Government and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. So in 1992 I went  back to Washington, DC but this time as the National Coordinator of the  American Indian Religious Freedom Act Coalition and worked on trying  to get amendments to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act that  would guarantee first amendment rights to American Indians. We   re still  working on getting that kind of First Amendment protection for Indian  Sacred Sites.  So the University of Montana was very good in letting me go off to what  I call my own sabbaticals, to go off to do other things. And then finally  in 2000, I left to go to MSU to fill the endowed chair. So that is the story  of my career in higher education and what I   ve done with my life.  It   s strange that throughout that time I never spent much time coming  back to Oklahoma. I would come in occasionally for speeches when I  would come in to visit schools when I directed the Office of Indian  Education Programs. I came home for funerals. It was just almost as if  when I left in 1970 that I severed my cultural umbilical cord and left.  28  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Now I   ve reconnected that umbilical cord. I   ve made those connections  back to Oklahoma State, a fine school for western Oklahoma here, and  to contributing what I can to help the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes to  have their own college.  It seems like, and correct me please, that you sort of lived in two  cultures. In the Native American culture and more traditional Native  American culture where you grew up with your great-grandmother, your  grandmother, and your parents. And I understand, from a previous  conversation, that your mother even was in the Mennonite church and  your father. So you got the languages, the culture, and the religion.  Could you explain a little bit about that dichotomy in your life?  Actually, you know Jerry, I don   t see it as much of a dichotomy as two  parts of a me that make a whole, that make me complete as to who I am.  One of the teachings of our elders is that you live in harmony and in  concert with the time in which you live and the place in which you live.  And we were comfortable with change. Change on our own terms. And  knowing that cultures continue to evolve. Assuredly the kind of culture I  live as a Cheyenne woman right now is dramatically different from that  of my great-grandmother, White Buffalo Women. She never went to a  public school, as I did. But the times have changed. I am very blessed to  have had the kind of cultural upbringing that I did from family, from my  parents, from my grandfather and all those around me. But at the same  time even though my grandfather showed up at the doors at Chilocco  Indian School and said.    I   m going to only come to school, but I   m  going to leave when I want.    Students were expected to have signed  contracts by parents to stay for three years. He said    I want to be  educated, but I   ll leave when I want.    He and his friend Amos, White-  Hawk showed up at the gates, I found out.  I think I   m a rebel like my grandfather. Life is going to be on my terms  as much as I can dictate it. So life has been on my terms. I   m so proud  to be Cheyenne. I can   t never think of anything but being Cheyenne. I  speak my language. I think I know about our culture. I have participated  in our highest ceremony as a woman. I like to think that I   m culturally  and spiritually grounded in my own traditions as a Cheyenne woman.  But at the same time, I have the best education that public schools could  have offered me. And that   s to be expected.  As I recall from a previous conversation Dr. Mann, your parents were  very strong in getting an education. You told the story about in fourth  grade when you went home crying that you didn   t want to go back to  school     That was my grandfather. That was when I decided to be a teacher.  29  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill     and he told you to go back and stay in school. Do you feel like you had  a supported home for education, a little different than others might  have?  I did. I had support for education, in terms of a public education. But I  also had support for education continuing to be taught, our traditions as  Cheyenne people. My dad   s first cousin, actually my aunt, his sister, was  brought in to essentially home school me in the Cheyenne culture after I  got off the bus and before I went to bed every night and on weekends.  My parents did believe in education both in a cultural sense and in terms  of what is required to be educated from our perspective of mainstream  education. So yes, I have had a very supportive environment about  education. I   ve been encouraged to acquire the best education I could.  But implicit in that is to be the best person you can possibly be. We want  you to be educated, but if you can   t be educated then you   ve got to be  the best Cheyenne, the best human being. You   re blessed with a  Cheyenne heart. You   ve just have to be the best person you possibly can  be. And being that best person is to exemplify our values of generosity,  of service. All of those virtues that we learn about in   wherever we  learn them, in church or   and so yes.  About cultures, did you ever attend church with your mother?  Of course.  You chuckle, there   s got to be a story here.  I could only answer,    of course.    She was my mother, and I went to  Mennonite church with her every Sunday. And I really enjoyed it. And  there was a lay minister that late Homer Hart who would preach in  Cheyenne and interpret for the preacher. I would go to the Indian  Baptist church with my mother   s aunt whose husband had attended  Carlisle. And they lived in Watonga and so, yes. I can recite scripture  from the bible. I grew up with a very strong Christian underpinning. But  that   s alongside my very strong cultural underpinning of my father and  my grandfather attending Native American church ceremonies. Or going  with my family to camp where we held our major ceremonies. I think  the greatest gift that my family has given me was this freedom to go and  pray in whatever way I wanted. Which I still do. I   m considered a  Sundance woman now. I go to our Sundance ceremonies. I don   t  necessarily go to church every Sunday, but I go when people invite me.  Jumping back on education, how that has impacted your life and now as  a president of a tribal college, what do you feel should Native American  students be studying? What professions should they be going into? Do  you have a feeling about that?  30  Mann  Gill  Mann  Gill  Mann  I have a very strong feeling about what students at a tribal college should  be studying. They should be studying their own languages. They should  be studying their own cultural histories. They should be studying their  own world views. They should be studying about their contemporary  status in modern day America. They should study about their own tribal  government. They should know who they are as Cheyennes and  Arapahos, and be very familiar with that and be very competent     intellectually competent   in that area. At the same time, I expect them  to get a good general education. I expect them to learn to read, to write,  to be critically analytical, to do math, to learn the skills that are  necessary for any kind of profession that they might elect to enter.  I like to think that maybe at some point in time we will have several  programs and we have submitted our first associate degree in Tribal  Administration. Hopefully we   ll train students for jobs in tribal  government, our casinos, operating and running our own programs, and  running our own federal programs. That is what I see in this tribal  administration and management degree. We must train our own to go in  and operate our own programs, to reinforce this concept of sovereignty  as the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes. I want the best for them. I want  them to just be the best they can possibly be and learn all they can in  terms of traditional knowledge, but all that they need to know in terms  of the skills that are necessary for being self-sufficient and empowered  individuals who can live very well in the twenty-first century.  Does your curriculum combine with the general education curriculum?  Is it a bachelor degree or a two year degree?  It   s a two year degree. We   re a tribal college, a two year degree granting  institution. And until we become independent and have our own  accreditation, we are using the accreditation umbrella of Southwestern  Oklahoma State University. Our students are dually enrolled as students  at Southwestern and students in the Tribal College. And so whereas we  provide that emphasis in studying about American Indians, they also  have to fulfill the requirements to have a very strong general education  background as a general education background should     Then they can build on that to a four year degree program if they want  from there. Dr. Mann you have such a broad grasp on this, do  American Indian students today have the opportunities, encouragements,  support to obtain degrees that they need?  I wish they had more. I like to think that as our students graduate with  degrees here that they will serve as those viable valuable role models to  say    I can be like him or her; they   ve got a degree from the Tribal  college, so will I.    I believe that that supportive environment is there,  31  Gill  Mann  Gill  but it needs to be strengthened. We all need to encourage our young  people from headstart on up that they truly represent our future and our  continuity as a people. And that education is a key to their very survival  and that alongside getting a very good college education whether it is at  the associate degree level or at the baccalaureate level or even beyond  into graduate degrees that they need to get that because we expect them  to come back and be involved in our tribal government. We expect them  to continue to come back and be involved in our traditional ceremonies  and ways of life. I expect much from them. But my grandparents  expected the same from me. And their grandparents before them  expected the same thing from them. We have a responsibility to our  ancestors and that responsibility also extends forward to those who have  yet to come to walk on this good earth with us. And I like to think that  we   re building this college for the next generations. This generation, but  primarily for those that come after them. For the small ones. So, yes...  Well we   ve talked about a lot of things in two interviews. Is there  anything we haven   t covered that you   d like to     You haven   t left anything uncovered, Jerry.  Well, thank you very much.  ------- End of October 10, 2008 interview -------
