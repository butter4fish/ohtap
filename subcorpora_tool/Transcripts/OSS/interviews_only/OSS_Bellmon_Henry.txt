Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Well, today is a special day. We have the opportunity to talk to the one  great Oklahomans of all times, Henry Bellmon, former Governor,  former Senator, head of large agencies, and as he says, just a farmer.  How are you today?  I   m good.  Great. We   re going to talk a little bit about your life. I want to talk  about some of the obvious political things but I want to get a little more  into your background. And start with your family. You were born in     were you born in Billings?  Well, I was born on a farm east of Tonkawa. My mother went up to be  with her sister-in-law while I was being born.  I see.  So we lived out on the farm by Billings but I was actually born near  Tonkawa.  But you were raised on that farm?  I still live there.  I   ll be darned. Talk about where your family came from and how they  ended up in northern Oklahoma.  My dad was from Sedan, Kansas. He   d been born up by Pittsburg and  then his father took the family out to what was then No Man   s Land.  They lived in a dugout on the bank of the Beaver River for five years.  And he worked as a ranch hand. He and his dad picked up buffalo bones  and hauled them up to Liberal, Kansas and made their living selling  5  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  buffalo bones.  What do you do with buffalo bones?  You make white wash.  Oh, you do? Well, already learned something.  And then when he was about 15 they came back to Kansas and lived in  Sedan. He got married and when they opened the Cherokee Strip he was  only 19 so he couldn   t make the run. But he came down later and paid  another fellow who had a claim,  700 to relinquish his rights to my dad  and that   s where we lived.  How many acres was that?  160.  So it was just the Homestead Act.  Yes.  Did you have to be 21 to make the run? Was that the rule?  That   s the way I understand it.  Yes. And you had siblings.  Well, I had many siblings. My father and his first wife had seven girls  and two boys. And then his first wife died on Armistice Day in 1918.  And then he married my mother a couple of years later and there were  four boys in that family. So there were 13 of us all together.  Were you all on the farm? What was the age spread?  Oh, I don   t remember. It was considerable.  But were you all on the farm at the same time?  Not at the same time. My mother   s family was from Iowa. They came  down in 1907, statehood year. They came in a covered wagon and made  kind of a picnic out of the trip. It took them a couple, three weeks to  come down. She was a teacher. She taught school in the one room  schoolhouses for about 20 years. And then after she was married she  stayed home and looked after her family. And then World War II came  they were short on school teachers so she got a job as a teacher at  6  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Banner and walked three miles a day each way to Banner to teach the  eighth grades.  I   ll be darned. So you went to school. Did you go to school in a one  room schoolhouse?  Glenrose.  At Glenrose?  Yes.  All the grades were in there together?  Eight grades.  Eight?  There was a little oil boom there at the time and there was about 40-  some kids in that school when I went there. And we had one teacher and  eight grades.  And the same teacher taught math, English, all the subjects?  Everything. We didn   t call it math, it was arithmetic.  Arithmetic.  Yes.  And did the older students help the younger kids?  Not intentionally.  After eighth grade, did you go on to high school?  I went to Marland which is 12 miles east of where we lived. Marland  had school buses and Billings didn   t. We lived in the Billings district but  Marland let us ride their school buses. I went to Marland for three years,  and then the last year Billings got school buses and I went to school at  Billings and graduated there.  Oh I see. What year was that?  1938.  7  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  1938. Of course the drums of war had begun to beat in Europe.  Not really. Well, yes in Europe, but not here. We weren   t interested in  their war.  Is that right?  Yes. At least I wasn   t. I was prime draft age.  So when you got out of high school, you really weren   t particularly  concerned with what was going on?  The war wasn   t a big thing with people my age. That was in 1938. I  came to OSU in Fall of 1938 and then graduated here. I got my class  work all done in January of 1941.  So it was Oklahoma A M?  Yes.  Not too far away from home.  Forty miles.  What made your decision to come to Oklahoma A M, now Oklahoma  State University?  It was close. And it was an Ag school. I wanted to study agriculture.  So you wanted to stay in the farming business?  Yes and it didn   t seem like it was going to cost as much as it would have  to go to OU  University of Oklahoma . My dad wanted me to be a  lawyer.  Is that right?  He didn   t think there was much of a future in farming. He   d been at it  his whole life and he knew what he was talking about.  What do you think? So you decided to come here and study agronomy?  Yes.  What was it like at Oklahoma State?  8  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  It was very different. There probably were not over 10 automobiles on  campus. And everybody was hard up. They didn   t have a lot of money.  There wasn   t much social life. They had dances at the girls    dorms that  you could go for an hour on week nights. And I joined what was called  Aggie Co-op. We hired a cook and she cooked the meals and bought the  groceries and charged our proportion to share the bill. It cost about  12 a  month for food.  Where did you live?  I lived at first in a rooming house. It cost me six dollars a month for a  room.  Was it close to campus?  It was at the corner of Monroe and 6th.  And then did you ever live on campus? In any of the dorms?  No, I never did.  Were there dorms then?  Yes, there were dorms. Not big ones. Murray was there. Willard was  built while I was here I think. Weren   t many dorms for men.  How many students were here, approximately, in those days?  I would have to guess but I would say 10,000 or somewhere in that  range.  Did you find that the preparation you received at that one room  schoolhouse through the eighth grade and then at Marland and Billings  prepared you for college?  Oh, probably not. But it didn   t take long to catch up. I didn   t like  college. I didn   t like being cooped up. I liked being outdoors. So, I took  a heavy course and got jobs and worked my way through.  Where did you work?  Well the first job I got was picking pears for a lady on Monroe Street.  She had a couple of pear trees and couldn   t climb them, and I could so I  picked her pears and she paid me for it and so I made a few dollars. And  then I got a job washing windows at the new library which had just been  built.  9  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  It   s the building we   re in right now.  No, I am talking about the city library.  Oh, the city library.  And then I got a job washing dishes at the co-op and got my meals for  that. And then I worked at the power plant and then I got a good job at  the soils lab grinding soil samples. And I don   t know, I had other jobs.  I worked at the Daily O   Collegian as a reporter for the School of  Agriculture. And they were supposed to pay me and they never did.  Well will see if we can make that up to you  (Laughter).  I   ve got a claim I going to show you   Okay good. So you didn   t particularly like college, why   d you stick with  it?  I wanted to get a degree.  How come?  I wanted to get a good job.  So you didn   t envision going back and farming?  I don   t know that I did or not. That decision came after the war.  Well, let   s talk about that. So you got out in 1941-42?  January of 1942. I finished my class work in seven semesters and  finished up in January of 1942.  So by now we were     War had started. The war started on the 7th of   December 1941.  Where were you that day?  Well, I was staying at the boarding house down on Knoblock,  Dickman   s Boarding House. I had a job there making beds for the rest of  the residents.  They didn   t make their own beds?  10  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  No, I was the bed maker and the janitor.  Never heard of that.  Anyhow, it was a Sunday and we were lounging around and listening to  the radio and heard about the bombing of Pearl Harbor so I immediately  went to the O   Colly office. We had an AP wire and we turned it on and  listened to the reports coming in over the AP wire. So I was here on the  campus when Pearl Harbor happened.  Were you surprised? Shocked?  I was stunned.  Really? There was no expectation that the Japanese would attack?  None that I know of. Otherwise we wouldn   t have been a sitting duck.  Yes. I guess the draft was underway by then.  Yes, the draft was in operation.  And with the draft, they would draft you into the Army.  Yes.  But you ended up in the Marines?  I volunteered for the Marines.  Why   d you do that?  Well     Why the Marines instead of the Army or Navy?  Some of my friends had already gone to the Marines. Don Dickey and  Wayne Miller were two I can think of. So I thought I would get into the  same outfit as some of those people I knew. And really, I think I   m  accurate in saying this there   s a certain feeling if you wanted to be where  the action was, you wanted to be with Marines.  They were going to be the first ones in?  I don   t know anything about that.  11  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  So where did you enlist in the Marines?  Oklahoma City. I hauled a load of hogs down for my dad and went by  the recruiting office and signed up and had to go get a picture, so I went  where you put a quarter in a machine and you get your picture. I still  have that picture somewhere.  Did you sell the hogs?  Yup.  So, that   s a good day   s work. You enlist in the Marines     Yes, a hundred miles down there and a hundred miles back.  Yes.  And then I joined the Marines.  And they didn   t have I-35 either.  No it was Old Highway 77.  So what happened then? Did you get dispatched to Quantico or  somewhere?  I had my degree. I finished my college class work so they put me in the  officer candidates    class and there wasn   t a space for me at Quantico  until November. So I had from April or May until November to stay at  the farm and help my dad.  And then went and did your basic training?  So then they sent me a train ticket, and I had never ridden a train before.  This long complicated ticket almost threw me. But I got to Quantico on  time. First thing I saw was bayonet practice on the walk from the train to  the barracks. People trying to kill each other with bayonets. It was kind  of a rude     Thought maybe you had come to the wrong place.  Yes, thought about getting on the train and going back.  Well, of course, in your book you chronicle your experience in the  military and in the Pacific. I know you   ve done some interviews on that  subject so I   m not going to spend a lot of time on it. But I was struck by  12  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  the contrast of growing up on a farm in northern Oklahoma and all of a  sudden being thrown into the greatest and most horrible war of all time  in the Pacific Theater which is a long way from Billings, Oklahoma.  Yes. I went to Quantico for five months and then was sent to Camp  Elliot by San Diego and given tank training which took three or four  months. And then I was put in Fourth Division that was being formed up  to make the landing on the Marshall Islands. We were stationed at Camp  Pendleton.  I   ve heard you say that you populated your unit with farm boys because  they could fix anything. I think you said that all a tank is is a tractor with  guns.  And armor plate.  Yes.  That   s right. We tried to do that. And I think it worked. We had a good  outfit.  Yes. And I know you were on Iwo Jima. Were you in the first wave at  Iwo Jima?  Probably not, I would imagine that we were in the third or fourth wave.  The first wave was infantry. They were supposed to secure the beaches  so that we could get the tanks in and other hardware, amtraks and  amphibians. So we probably landed had about 20 minutes after the first  wave.  Was the fighting fierce?  It was pandemonium. There   d been a storm the night before and waves  had kind of made a terrace. It was like they built a wall around the edge  of the water. We couldn   t find a place to get up over the terrace to get  our tanks onto the beach. We finally got to where somebody had  knocked the terrace down and we went through there. And my tank got  about 300 or 400 yards up the side of the mountain, if you want to call it  a mountain, and hit a mine and broke the track. What the Japanese did  was to bury a 250 pound bomb and then put what   s called a yardstick  mine on top of it. When the tank went over the yardstick mine it would  blow the track off and set the big bomb off and blow the tank apart and  kill everybody in it. But that bomb, that yardstick mine didn   t do it. It  broke our track but it didn   t set off the bomb. We didn   t know what had  happened. So we sat there that afternoon for three or four hours and right  ahead of us was where the Japs had put a bunch of junked airplanes and  13  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  hidden a bunch of machine guns in there. And our infantry on the beach  was getting fired from out of the junked airplanes. So when we   d see a  machine gun open up we   d knock it out with our canon. We had quite a  little activity there for three or four hours when we   d knock out one of  their machine guns over on the right flank, stationed there close to their  coastal defense guns. When we   d open up on their machine guns, their  defense guns would open up on us. But they didn   t have sense enough to  shoot armor piercing ammunition, they were shooting high explosive.  And they   d point detonate. It would make your head ring, but it didn   t  do any damage.  When you were going on to the beach, was there just a hail of gun and  artillery fire?  Well, if you   re in a tank, which we were, and you   re buttoned down,  which we did. You   re pretty much oblivious to what   s going on outside.  Really?  You see what you can see from the periscope. But the thing I did  remember was the other infantry left our area alone. They didn   t come  through there because there was so much of this fire coming from the  coastal defense guns and the machine guns. It was not a good place to  be.  What do you take away from that experience? I know you went on for a  long time after that, but are you better off because you went through that  experience?  The experience of the war?  Yes. I guess you grow up pretty fast, don   t you?  Yes, in many ways. I   d be hard put to put into words what you would  take away from an experience of where you are worried every day about  being killed or trying hard to kill everybody around you. I remember not  having any qualms about seeing people killed. I had two of my tanks  blew up with mines that went off and killed ten of my good friends in a  matter of a few minutes. And I don   t remember that I thought I was next  or anything like that. It didn   t worry me. It didn   t cross my mind to be  afraid. Just went ahead and try to do what you could do.  I think some of the things I learned as a result of the war were different  enough and apart from the fighting. That is that we had a base camp on  Maui which had a segregated society. The whites controlled the land and  the economy and the Japanese and the other Orientals were field  14  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  workers. And it seemed to me to be a waste of human resources to not  give those Orientals a chance to participate in the full economy. And, of  course, after the war was over, they did open it up, and give people a  chance, like Daniel Inouye came out of that.  Yes. Well you came home and ran for the legislature.  Yes.  As a republican?  Yes. My dad saw to that.  Tell us about that.  Well my dad was a hard shell Kansas republican. And when I got to be  21 years old, he went down to the county seat and registered me as a  republican and sent me the registration papers and that was it. I was  overseas.  So, it wasn   t a philosophical decision on your part?  No.  Because the state was dramatically democratic.  Yes.  I think there was 38-6, in the Senate, democrats had. And then the house  was 95-25.  Yes, it was not a smart political decision.  Well, but that was a pretty republican area wasn   t it? Was your  predecessor republican?  Yes. My predecessor was Bob McCubbins who had been a republican  legislator and he resigned to become District Attorney and left a vacancy  so he asked me to file for it and I did.  So, that   s how you made the decision to run?  Right.  What did the legislator make in those days?  15  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Six dollars a day when you met.  When you actually met and you served the first two years. What was  that like? I mean here you are back from war and now all of a sudden  you   re     A lot of others were back from the war. That was no big deal although  we made an issue of it when I ran, that I was a veteran.  But you were a decorated veteran, right?  Well, lots of them were.  Didn   t you win the Silver Star?  Yes.  What was that for?  It was for dragging an injured Marine out of a burning tank.  Who was it?  Dick Haddix. By the way, same name. He was from Oshkosh, Nebraska.  Is that right? Well my brother worked for you many years, Dick Hargis.  I remember Dick. Yeah. I never thought of that before. He died here a  couple of years ago. He was the postmaster at Oshkosh.  But you saved him?  Well, he had his leg shot off by a tank missile. The gunner who was  sitting between my legs got hit in the chest and he was dead. But when  we got out, we found out there was just three of us. We climbed back on  it to look and see what had happened to the others and Haddix was still  alive. So we drug him out and got him to a first aid station and he  survived.  And you stayed in touch with him all those years?  Yes. I talked to him just shortly before he died.  Well, back to running for the legislature. So you ran, and who   d you run  against?  16  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Um   Taylor. No, that   s not right. I am sorry. I can   t remember. He was  a retired major from the Army.  And what were the issues of the day? The big issues that you dealt with  in Oklahoma City at the Capitol?  Well, there was no huge issue that sticks in my mind. The state was not  flush with money, but it was adequately funded and we didn   t have any  big tax issues. I remember trying to get the sales tax exemption for feed,  seed, and fertilizer and couldn   t get it done. But when I got to be  governor, I got it done. And education was a big   one of the big things  was re-apportionment.  Re-apportionment?  Yes.  It was apportioned pretty democratically.  It was apportioned one legislator to a county, with seven for Oklahoma  County and Tulsa. And I think Muskogee and maybe Garfield County  had two. But most every county had at least one legislator   one  representative.  You ran for re-election?  And lost.  Who beat you?  It was Dr. Seids  F.C. Seids . He was a dentist.  Was he a republican?  He was a democrat.  Really? So a democrat beat you. How   d he beat you?  Well, he had made friends by pulling people   s teeth, I guess. He had a  lot of contacts. He was well known.  Had you done something to make somebody mad?  What I did was I   d gotten married, and we had a child and I was in the  bulldozing business. I thought I   d done a good job as a legislator and I  didn   t need to campaign and I spent my time looking at my own affairs,  17  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  which is a mistake. If you   re going to run for a office, let the people  know you want it.  You want it. Ask for their vote. Well, you mentioned getting married.  Talk about meeting Shirley.  Well, Shirley grew up on a farm about six miles from where I grew up.  So did you know her all your life?  I didn   t know her at all. Our parents were on friendly terms. They didn   t  socialize together. Her granddad was someone I   d known for a long  time, Bart Osborn. He was a fine old gentleman. He was hard of hearing,  when you talked to him you had to shout at him. Bart had a pasture right  across the fence from ours. At times our cattle had gotten mixed up and  so we had some dealings together. But I hadn   t known Shirley. She was  six years younger than I was. So when I went off to the war, she was still  in grade school. And when I came back from the war I was busy with  getting a new business started and getting farming going. I first  remember seeing her at church. And then shortly after that, I had a flat  on my old car and she gave me a lift down to get the car tire repaired and  we made a date and went to the movies and things went on from there.  You didn   t do that flat on purpose, to meet her?  I wasn   t that original, (Laughter) no.  Then talk about your daughters.  Well, the girls were born at Enid, we lived in Billings. Pat was the  oldest and she was born during a fierce blizzard. It was March 9th, so it  was a late blizzard. Shirley had a doctor   s appointment that day     morning. And we started to the hospital to see the doctor and got stuck  in a snow drift. Her folks had a new car and they came and got us and  got us to the hospital in time. She started having birth pains and the baby  was born the next morning, during the night. Her dad and I went back.  We both had sheep that were having lambs and we needed to be back to  help the ones who got in trouble. We had to walk through the blizzard  for about three miles. The car got stuck in a snow bank again. So we  walked to his house and I spent the night there and the next day I found  out I had a baby.  Gail was born during a windy time. I think we chose the name because it  was a high wind.  You   re talking about Gail?  18  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Yes. And Ann, I don   t remember anything dramatic about her being  born. But the girls all grew up on the farm and were almost teenagers,  not quite teenagers, when we went into the Governor   s mansion. I don   t  think they ever had any bad impact from being somewhat famous for  kids.  So you got beat and there was a long period of interim before you got  back into politics, wasn   t there?  Yes, I was defeated in 1948 and ran for state chairmen in 1960. So, it  was 12 years.  And just spent your time farming?  We had a bulldozing company, had bulldozers and built terraces and  ponds and waterways. What I learned, among other things, when I was  in the legislature is that you can   t make a living in politics at six dollars  a day. So I decided not to try anything more in the way of getting elected  to office until I had our finances in better shape. So I spent those 12  years trying to accumulate cows, machinery and land.  So what caused you to get involved in the republican party apparatus as,  I think, Noble County republican chairman and later state chairman?  I was elected Noble County republican chairman. I don   t know why I  was elected particularly. I guess just because nobody really wanted the  job. But I worked at it and I caught the attention of John Tyler who was  the state chairman. And John decided he wanted to become the National  Committee man for Oklahoma. So he resigned the state chairmanship  and promoted me for the job and helped me get elected to state  chairman.  What year was that?  1960.  So 1960, you became state chairman and Oklahoma would hardly be  considered a two party state at that time. I mean the democrats still  dominated the legislature.  They dominated but they didn   t win presidential elections. We voted for  Eisenhower twice. And I felt like there was a chance that people would  vote republican for other offices if they had a good candidate and a good  campaign  So what did you do as chairman? What was your agenda and activity?  19  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  The agenda was a GOP countdown and the objective was to capture the  governorship in 1962. We set forth a ten point program with dates and  objectives for the amount of funds we raised and how much we   d need  to do it. We had a budget. And I can   t remember all the ten points but  one was re-registration drive trying to get the democrats who voted  republican to register republican and candidate recruitment and  candidate training. We had the whole nine yards and we followed  through with it very well including a fund raiser in every county. At that  time the republican party was financed by a small group of very fine,  wealthy, and generous Tulsans, mostly, oil fellows. And they had what  was called the State Finance Office. They operated out of Tulsa and  they kept control of the money and by doing that they controlled the  party. And I had to tear that up.  Take control of the money.  Yes, and fire the head of the Finance Office.  Now that doesn   t sound like a real good plan if you want to run for  office yourself, in that party.  I wasn   t thinking of running for office. I just knew that you couldn   t run  an organization if the money is being controlled by people who don   t  have any feel for what     Did you try to attract a candidate for Governor? Did you talk to people  to get them to run?  I talked to several. One of which was Jenk Jones.  Tulsa Tribune?  The Tulsa Tribune. Very eloquent, articulate, well-known man and I  thought he   d make a great candidate. But he wasn   t interested. He   d  rather be on the outside taking pot shots than inside trying to fix the  problems. I remember Jenk Jones.  It   s Jenkin Lloyd Jones, right?  Now, Jenkin Lloyd was the first. This is Jenk Jones. And then there was  Jenk Jones the second, junior.  Got it.  Yes. I   m having a hard time thinking of the others I talked. I didn   t talk  to Bud Wilkinson at that time. I talked to him about running for the  20  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Senate. To answer your question, we didn   t have a candidate.  And you   d done all this build up     Yes.     with your ten-point plan?  Yes.  And now it   s time for the governor   s race and you don   t have a  candidate.  Right.  So what did you do?  I ran. And I didn   t want to do it. I felt it   d probably bankrupt me and I   d  lose what little head start I got from farming.  Did you have any illusion at all that you could win?  No.  What did Shirley think about it?  She was reluctant, I guess I can say but she never drug her feet, she did  her part very well. She and the girls and I spent the summer in a station  wagon campaigning on the main streets all across the state. And she  hung in there every bit of the way.  Did you do any TV? Television advertising?  TV didn   t pay any attention to me and I didn   t have any money to pay  attention to them. So we kept our separate ways?  Who were you running against? Did you have an opponent in the  primary?  Not a significant opponent. It was some perpetual candidate type guy.  But the democrats had a mean contest between Raymond Gary and Bill  Atkinson.  Raymond Gary, who was from Madill, Madill area.  Yes, ran for governor.  21  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Right. And Bill Atkinson was from Midwest City.  Yes, he created Midwest City. He was the founder of Midwest City.  Had the newspaper there, too.  Later on. He did that after he was defeated because he felt the  Oklahoman hadn   t treated him right, so he was going to get even with  them be putting them out of business.  Did the Oklahoman support you?  Yes.  Did you go down and see Mr. Gaylord?  Many times.  And so you ran that race. What did you spend on that race?   225,000.  And were you able to raise it all? Or did you have to spend your own  money  I raised it all with a little bit left over. I didn   t have any money to spend.  At what point did you begin to think you might actually win this thing?  Well, the weekend before the election which would have been on  Thursday, Bill bought a whole series of ads accusing me of having a  secret plan to raise taxes. My issue was no new tax. I can tell you a  story about Bill, maybe I shouldn   t.  Yes, go ahead.  Bill and Raymond were scheduled to have a debate in Tulsa before the  run-off. They ran a run-off. And the Tulsa World...  Now Raymond Gary had already been governor, right?  He   d been governor.  But you couldn   t succeed yourself.  That   s right. One term.  22  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Right.  So the Tulsa World held this debate and Phil Dessauer was their main  political reporter. They invited me to be there, so these two Democrats,  one on one side and one on the other with me in the middle. We   re on  television and Phil Dessauer asks, they  the Tulsa World  were  supporting Bill Atkinson, but Phil asked this question of Bill, he said,     Now Bill, you   re running your campaign on the issue that the state  doesn   t have enough money to provide the necessary services and you  propose to get the money we need by raising the sales tax by 50 .    Now  he said,    The present Governor has proposed the same kind of program  to the legislature and they   ve turned him down. Now my question to  you is how would you run state government if the legislature won   t go  along with your program?    Bill sat there for a moment thinking real  seriously and he said,    Well, if the legislature won   t vote to raise the  taxes the way I want them to then we   ll get rid of the waste, graft, and  corruption and run the state on the money we   ve got.     Oh my goodness.  My goodness, I   ve told that story a hundred times. He was saying that  we   ve got to raise taxes to pay for the state   s waste, graft, and  corruption.  You didn   t use that did you?  Every time I was with him. Bill didn   t want to listen to me anyway and  this totally frustrated him. He couldn   t deny he had said that. Anyway, I  feel like that   s when the election turned.  So you were elected in 1962. Three daughters, Shirley and I guess John  Kennedy is president.  Until 1964.  Yes. Talk about moving that family into the Governor   s mansion.  Well, I give Shirley and the girls great credit. They made the shift, as far  as I could tell, with no hiccups at all. The girls, we had college students  from OU Medical School, and some law students for guards, for the  mansion security people. And the girls had great times with those young  men.  Oh yeah, I imagine they were sliding down the banister and just having  a great time.  23  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Yeah, climbing on top of the Capitol and sitting on the lions that are up  there. They had the run of the place, I think. You can talk to them if you  want to. It was a great pleasure for me to see how well they got along.  We tried to have dinner together every night and on weekends.  The lieutenant governor then was who?  Leo     Bill Winters.  Leo was a good guy to have as a partner. He did his thing and left me  alone.  Yeah. Well, that really was a momentous time really. One of the main  things, of course, they cite when you were governor is the beginning of  our vocational tech.  Yes, we passed the state constitutional amendment to set up the  vocational technical system.  Was that your idea?  I think the idea was from Dewey Bartlett, best I remember. He was  impressed with what South Carolina had done.  He was in the state senate at the time?  Yes.  And ended up following you as governor.  Yes.  Anything else from that period that you recall?  Well, there   s a lot of things. A lot of significant things that happened.  We exempted feed, seed and fertilizer from the sales tax.  You got that done.  And we set up a state employee retirement system which is a really good  thing. And we went four years with no tax increase.  Did you find a lot of graft and corruption?  24  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  I can think of a few things. The answer is we weren   t equipped to do  investigations. The governor   s office doesn   t have that capability. But  we found several things were wrong. Well, just to give you an example.  The state buys a lot of insurance on buildings and those policies had  been handled on a buddy basis. When a policy came up the governor  would say give that one to Jones Company and that one to another  company which is obvious opportunities for hanky panky. So we started  a policy of bidding on the insurance, putting them out for competitive  bids. And the insurance people screamed and said you won   t get any  bids because there are set rates that they have to charge. But we got bids  every time we asked for them and we saved the state a ton of money on  premiums on insurance policies. And then there   s another place where  there   s a state institution that was about three miles from a major gas  transmission line and one of the local citizens had made a deal to lay a  three mile to his pipeline over to this major pipeline and furnish gas to  heat and cool this institution. He was charging like five times the going  rate but he had a monopoly on the pipeline. So we had to stop that.  So you finished your first term as governor in 1966?  Yes.  And what were the plans then? Just to go back to the farm?  No. I   d gotten real fed up with Mike Monroney.  Who was the senator   well he and Bob Kerr   well Bob Kerr had died.  He died in January before I became Governor.  Right. And then why were you fed up with Mike Monroney?  Well, he had forgotten where he came from. He became    Mister  Aviation    and he spent his time working on legislation dealing with  aviation rather than what was important to our state. Of course, aviation  was a big deal. You   ve got to get him credit for getting a FAA center  located in Oklahoma City. That was a good accomplishment for him. So  he was effective in his way but he was aloof and really didn   t act like he  had time for Oklahoma   s problems.  So you then decided to run against him in 1968.  There was a petty thing that happened that made me decide to do it and I  don   t think it   s the thing you wanted to hear.  Oh yeah, sure. It   s for posterity.  25  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Well, this shows you how things sometimes happen. The year I ran for  governor, we built our house on the farm and I borrowed the money  from the Farmers Home Administration to build the house. And we  were totally eligible to get the loan and use the money as we did. But  then the rules provided that if your condition changed and you became  eligible for regular loans that you should pay off your Farmers Home  Loan and get a loan with a regular insurance company or real estate  firm. Well, right after I was elected, that was the last thing I was  thinking about. Monroney was in the process of investigating this loan.  And luckily for me the Farmers Home manager was friendly towards me  and he called me up and told me,    I don   t know what   s going on here  but somebody   s digging around here looking at your loan.    And he said  that I probably should move it if I could. So I called Albright   s Title and  Trust in Newkirk and made a deal to refinance the house about  10,000  or  12,000 deal. And we were in the process of refinancing it, which  took a few days to examine the title and other things you have to do.  And Monroney made a big announcement that he found this terrible  thing I had done.  You think he anticipated you were going to run against him. Is that why  he was trying to do?  I think he did. He was trying to do me in. But it made me think he was  so petty that he didn   t deserve to be in the senate.  Right along in there somehow you got associated with Richard Nixon  and actually were named as National Campaign Manager.  It was after my term was over.  Right.  End of the first term.  How did that happen? How did you get on the national stage there?  Well, what happened was that I was republican state chairman when he  ran for president the first time. And we had a fairly active time of  organizing party. We hadn   t started the GOP Countdown yet but I had  secured a chairman for every county in the state. Up until that time many  counties didn   t have a republican chairman. So I worked at it. And  anyway, when the campaign time came we mounted a pretty effective  Nixon effort. Raised some money and put on a good campaign. But  Nixon, he came   we had a Republican National Committee meeting in  Oklahoma City and Nixon made a talk. I got acquainted with him. And  then when the campaign time came he sent a guy named Peter Flannigan  26  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  down here to organize what was called the Democrats for Nixon. And I  told Pete Flannigan to get out of town, that we didn   t need him. That we  would organize the party and we were going to build up for the future.  We didn   t want him to come in here and take off all the excitement and  all the campaign support for a onetime thing. We wanted it to be here  permanently. And Pete got kind of irate about it. And after several  weeks of haggling he finally come down here and set up his own  organization anyway. And we used it as a dumping ground for some of  the oddballs that always showed up at campaign headquarters, we   d send  them over to Democrats for Nixon. And we carried the state. I think we  were next to Nebraska in giving him the best percentage of vote. And he  was thankful for that and finally called up and apologized and we got to  be good friends later on when he changed over to Republican. He was in  the White House     But then Nixon asked you to be his campaign chairman.  Well, that came about because Flannigan asked   they started a thing  called the Committee to Elect Nixon after Nixon lost for President and  lost the Governorship in California.  Right,    You won   t have Richard Nixon to kick around anymore.     Well, they set up this thing called the Committee to Elect Nixon and  Flannigan was in it   or I can   t remember, the Attorney General from  Arizona  John Mitchell  that got in trouble. Anyway, there were eight or  ten of these guys. One of them was a guy named Parkinson who was a  doctor from San Diego. And Parkinson was named as chairman of this  Committee to Elect Nixon. And he put together a book of things that had  to be done step by step to get Nixon to the White House. But  unfortunately he never got around to doing anything. He   d just sit  around and talk and make plans and didn   t do any work. So Nixon was  about to have to fire him but Nixon had quite a reputation of not being  able to get along with staff and so he didn   t do it. And Parkinson just  right about this time found out his wife had cancer so he resigned and  went back to California. They were looking around trying to find  someone to take his place and they decided that I was kind of in the  middle of the political spectrum. I wasn   t a hard-line right-winger or  liberal. I could talk. What they wanted me to do is line up as many  prominent backers as I could because Nixon was kind of out there all by  himself.  So did you travel the country?  I traveled the country.  27  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  At the time, you had already decided to run against Monroney, hadn   t  you?  I had started running against Monroney.  So you knew you couldn   t stick with this through the 1968 election.  I took the job on the understanding that they   d get somebody to be  campaign manager for the total time but they couldn   t find anybody.  They never did find anybody. This guy I   m trying to think of who was  Attorney General  Richard Kleindienst  under Nixon, he kind of served  as campaign manager. And the guy who ran the campaign was a  congressman from Kansas but Nixon thought he was too liberal to be the  front man.  So Nixon, of course as we know, got elected and beat out Hubert  Humphrey. And you beat Mike Monroney. How on earth were you able  to beat a   I mean Mike Monroney was an institution. He had been in the  Senate for 30 years.  Thirty years in Congress. Twelve in the House and 18 in the Senate. I  don   t know the answer. I don   t know why anybody votes for me in the  first place. I   m not eloquent. I can hardly get two words to stick  together, and I didn   t have any money and I didn   t have any fame. I  don   t know. I think when people look for someone to vote for I think  they look to see somebody who they could approach if they needed the  help. Somebody they could trust.  But my experience with you is you study the issues, you think about them  carefully. And then when you make a decision, you usually stick with it. I  know. I   ve tried to talk you out of it before.  Yeah. The rule is get your facts, make your decision, and stay with it.  What were the big issues then in 1968? I mean I guess we had that  tumultuous Democratic Convention. We had a lot of Vietnam and Civil  rights turmoil going on at that time.  Yes, we had all those things. The issue we used on Mike was he had  forgotten where he came from. He was not representing Oklahoma.  So you went into the US Senate in 1968, and obviously had a close  relationship with the President as a result of having been his campaign  manager.  I did and I didn   t. Nixon, well the one thing I can talk about that shows  28  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  what our relationship was is   Bryce Harlow, who was his chief of staff,  invited me down to have breakfast with him one morning at the  University Club in downtown Washington. I had no idea what it was  about. Bryce told me that the Secretary of Agriculture was going to  resign or had resigned and they were looking for someone to take his  place and they had come down to two names, me and this fellow from  Indiana. He wondered if I would consider it if Nixon offered it to me. I  had just been elected to the senate and didn   t feel like I could walk  away. I talked to Abe Ribicoff who had been governor and then  senator   well been governor and then he   d been Secretary of HEW  before he came to the senate. And Abe said that switching from  governor or senator to cabinet officer was a bad proposition because  when you   re governor or senator you make your own decisions, and if  you   re in the cabinet you have to be a team player. So he advised me not  to do it, so I didn   t.  Well, I   m fast forwarding through your first senate term and I need to  back up and talk about a couple of major issues that happened along the  way. And I guess the first I want to talk about is the Panama Canal  Treaty. Now that probably was the most controversial issue of your  entire political career, wasn   t it?  Probably so. And it served for a kind of a curious reason. There is kind  of a game played in Washington where special interests groups find that  sensational issue or that sensitive issue or emotional issue and use it to  raise a lot of money and then they live on it for three or four years until  they think up a new one. And they chose Panama Canal as the    cause  c  l  bre    for these right wing groups like the John Birch Society to get  their membership and get them geared up and it   s a bad way to make a  living.  Interesting.  And so they were pushing the Panama Canal. It got to be an issue for a  lot of people too, but the one who was caught up in it was Ed Gaylord.  Yeah, your friend  Well, that   s another subject we could talk about.  All right.  But Ed was insisting that I come down and talk to him about Panama  Canal so we met for breakfast at the Skirvin Hotel. And I remember I  brought a   I picked a mess of asparagus to take back to Washington so I  had it in my suitcase and I gave it to Ed as a peace token and we talked  29  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  about it and then he gave me a bundle of literature for me to read about  the Panama Canal. And it was all from the John Birch Society. And it  just made me realize that this was not a group that I wanted to be making  national policy. And     So the proposal was that the Panama Canal would be turned back to the  country of Panama over a period of time.  Twenty years.  Twenty years.  For ten years there was a commission made up of five Americans and  four Panamanians and then the membership shifted to four and five.  Well in the face of this outcry from the rightwing of the Republican  Party and others that we own that canal and it was sovereign soil of the  United States and that giving it away was almost treason. In the face of  all that, how did you make the decision to support it?  Well, basically two things. One was this happened Dewey Bartlett gave  me a book called Path Between the Seas written by David McCullough  that talked about what led up to the United States building the canal and  the problems we had building it. It ended in 1914 so it had nothing to do  with the treaties. But it made me understand that the Canal was not built  on sovereign soil but it had been owned by Columbia and Panama and  we had been involved as leasers.  Anyway the other thing was the General in charge   after the Panama  Canal was built it had been operated by the Corp of Engineers for 75  years. And the current person in charge of it was a General named Parfet  and he came to Washington for some interviews and I asked him to  come to my office and he did. We talked about the Canal and what was  likely to happen if we turned the treaties down. And I asked him if he  thought Torrijos who was head of the government in Panama would start  a war if we turned down the treaties. Parfet said there was no question he  would. He had set up his whole campaign and administration based on  getting the Canal free. Well I said, the obvious next question is if they  start a war down there by the Canal, can you keep the Canal open and  can you handle the insurgencies? And he said,    Well that   s the question  that I can   t answer for you. I can tell you militarily we can handle it, but  we can   t do it if the politicians keep taking potshots at us and withhold  money or support we need. You   re the politician, I   m not. So you   ve  got to answer your own question.    And I felt like that if we got in there  and got a lot of people killed or hurt and got the Canal blocked by  people   somebody sinking some ships in those narrow places that it  30  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  would be another Vietnam type mess. So I decided that we better face  the music and go along with the treaties.  Well, I know you had said that our warships couldn   t use the canal.  No, the carriers and the big tankers and the battleships can   t get through  there. It   s too narrow.  Jimmy Carter was president.  Yes.  Did that affect your decision at all?  Not really. Again there   s a lot around this. Jimmy Carter had a guy  named Harris, Herky Harris  Hubert Harris  who was part of his liaison  with the Senate. Herky was the one who contacted me and Herky set it  up for me to come down and see Carter and Carter explained the  situation. And I told him that it was a very delicate issue back here at  home and I didn   t want to appear to be influenced by the President or  anybody else and I   d make a decision based on the facts as best as I  could determine what they were. And Harris left me alone. I never went  to see Jimmy Carter and never talked to him on the phone or anything  else. But when I made the decision to vote for the Canal, for the  Treaties, I told Herky that it was going to cost me here at home because  it was a very bad political mistake in the eyes of most people. And I said  that we   ve got some water projects if you   d see fit to approve them, it   d  sure make things easier. And we didn   t have any understanding or  anything, he never agreed to it. But when the Carter budget came out  that year, they put Arcadia and Atoka both in it.  Lake Arcadia and Lake Atoka?  Yes.  Well Gaylord called you the    Senator from Panama.     He called me a traitor.  Yeah.  It hurt.  Yeah. Well it   s certainly for a decorated Marine on Iwo Jima to be  called a traitor. I remember you called him the    Senator from Hee  Haw.     31  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Yes.  Referring to his ownership of that television show.  Let me tell you too   I don   t know if we   re wasting time here, but two  stories about Gaylord   s and my relationship. And one of these is in the  book, so maybe I shouldn   t tell it again but Shirley and I went there. We  were trying to get Bill Banowsky  William S. Banowsky  to run for the  senate. And Ed Gaylord had a meeting at his house with some of the  potential supporters for Banowsky   s candidacy.  Who was president of OU at the time.  Yeah. And we had a nice dinner, and for some reason Shirley and I were  the last two guests to leave. And before I went out the front door, Ed  grabbed me by the arm and said,    Come back here, I want to show you  something.    He took me back to his bedroom and into the bathroom.  And there was a closet like that. It   s higher than that with solid doors.  And he opened the door and inside this door was two photographs.  Dewey Bartlett and Henry Bellmon. And Ed said,    I just wanted you to  know that these are my two favorite politicians.    And he closed the door  and we left.  The other thing that happened was, Ed had pancreatic cancer and was in  bad shape. This was after Thelma had died, of course, but he was  keeping company with a woman named Jo.  Oh yes, Josie Freedie.  Yes, Josie Freedie. Well his son-in-law     Clay Bennett?  Clay Bennett. Clay and Louise invited Eloise and me to come to their  house for dinner one night. And Clay   s a great chef. He had a fabulous  dinner. And the guests were Clay and his wife and a couple of their  young girls, and Josie     Freedie.  Josie Freedie, and Eloise, and me. I believe that was the last dinner he  went to before he died.  Well, he was certainly a     He was trying to tell me something I think.  32  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Yeah, could be. I skipped over a very momentous electoral experience  you had when you ran for re-election against Ed Edmondson, the long-time  Congressman from Muskogee. And I was involved in that  campaign.  Yes you were.  And he     Involved in all the campaigns.  And you won by 3,000 and some odd votes which was a pretty narrow  victory coming after everything that had gone on. And Ed Edmondson  complained that there were voting machines in Tulsa that did not   the  straight party lever didn   t work on them. And so     No. What happened was that there was an American Party candidate guy  named Ruel Little from Madill and the machines they had in Tulsa were  only rigged for two candidates. The law requires that you have to be able  to vote a straight party ticket. And when they tried to comply with that  law, they had to set it up so you had to push five levers to get to vote  straight party.  Mm-hmm.  And Ed Edmondson made his case in the fact that, and I   m paraphrasing  a little bit, republican voters were more intelligent than democrat voters  and they could figure this out and democrats couldn   t.  So we, that case was tried before Judge Knox Byrum, who was from  Shawnee, and it was tried in Tulsa. And you won it there.  Yes. He was a democrat.  He was a very prominent democratic judge. And then it went to the  Oklahoma Supreme Court and you won it.  And the judges I appointed   what   s the word you use   recuse?  Recuse. And then     Were all democrats.  And then I learned at the time, I   m embarrassed to say as a lawyer I  didn   t understand that the United States Senate can seat anybody they  want.  33  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  They   re the judge of their own members.  Yes, so even though you had won and it had been validated in the  District and the Supreme Court they could actually refuse to seat you.  They certainly could.  And that was the proposal that was made, I guess.  That was Ed Edmondson   s plan.  Yeah, so     He was betting on the partisanship to be so strong that they   d vote for  him and not me.  And so in fact, was it Howard Cannon   s committee     Yes.  From Nevada?  The Rules Committee.  Rules Committee decided to take it to the floor.  No, there   s a little more to it. They had two contests, one from New  Hampshire where the governor was one party and the legislature was  another. And the governor issued a certificate of election to the one  candidate and the legislature issued a certificate to the other one. So both  candidates had certificates that they had won and the Candidates Group  had to decide which one to seat. And it got to be very bitter. And they  put ours on the back burner until this was all over with and it took 16  months.  When they finally did vote     They seated me, but they seated me provisionally. I wasn   t a full  member. When it finally had drug on so long that we decided to try to  force it to a vote so we   d be done with it. I can   t remember exactly how  we positioned ourselves but if we   d lost, I wouldn   t have been out of the  senate. We would still have to go through the     Election again?  Yes, anyway the democrats outnumbered the republicans in the senate  34  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  by about nine or ten votes. We had to have nine democrat votes to win.  And we got nine. And I counted on Ed Muskie helping me but he didn   t.  He was on the Budget Committee with you?  Yes. He was chairman and I was ranking member. So we were on good  terms. I supposed he would have voted for me, but he left town. And  Hubert Humphrey voted against me. We were on good terms. And  Hubert said,    Well I had to cast one vote for the Party.    That   s Hubert.  You couldn   t depend on him. But the one that surprised me was Lloyd  Bentsen from Texas.  Mm-hmm.  Lloyd was new   fairly new in the senate. And I hadn   t had many  dealings with him whatsoever. Hardly knew him. But he voted to seat  me. And that was the ninth vote I needed. Later on when I got to know  Lloyd better I felt comfortable to asking him why he voted for me as he  did. He said,    I   ll tell you what happened. I was running for President,     and he was. He was a democratic candidate trying to get nominated.  And he said,    I was in Tulsa to call on Ed Edmondson to get him to help  me and he refused.    And he said,    That night I was in my hotel room  getting ready to go to bed, and I had the news on and they were  interviewing Bellmon on television and the reporter, after asking some  other questions, asked which democrat I thought should be the  Democratic nominee and I said Lloyd Bentsen.    He said,    I paid you  back.     That   s great. Another momentous decision you made as a United States  Senator was to vote to allow bussing of     Integration.     school children.  Yes.  That also was a very controversial vote.  And it still is. And rightly so. I don   t know what the answer is.  What made you even consider supporting it because obviously there was  tremendous controversy about the subject?  Well, let me say two or three things. First of all, remember back to the  Maui experience where you had the color line and the Orientals were on  35  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  one side and the whites were on the other. And the Orientals were kept  from being doctors or lawyers or professional people because they  couldn   t get education. They were supposed to be field workers and be  content with that. And it seemed to me like that was the same thing we  had in this educational thing. We had this segregated school system and  black schools were not good schools. And     You had actually visited them when you were governor, hadn   t you?  We toyed with the notion of sending our girls to Lincoln School. But  when we went down to look at it, it was incredibly bad. The window  panes were broken out. The trash was stored around the corner. And just  kind of pandemonium. I don   t see how anyone could get an education  there. So we decided we   d send our girls to public schools but not the  one in the community where we lived. Anyway, it seemed to me that  education was the key to the long term health of the country. And while  nobody liked bussing, if you were going to have integration in a  situation where the communities are segregated in their housing, then  you have to have some way of moving them around and bussing was the  logical way to do it. The issue was really segregation or integration, not  so much bussing. Bussing was a means to the end.  And looking back on the decision, what do you think? Was it a positive  overall, or not?  Well, look at it this way. If we hadn   t done it, where would we be today?  I don   t think anybody will say that bussing has been a great success. It   s  caused a white flight. It   s behind the boom in Edmond and Yukon, more  in Norman. It   s caused affluent whites to leave Oklahoma City school  systems in many cases. And yet if you look at Tulsa, they didn   t have a  forced bussing system. They used what are called magnet schools, and  that hadn   t worked very well either. So I don   t know what the answer is  except time.  Well you decided not to run for reelection to the United States Senate in  1980 and stepped down and came home.  Yes.  Are you glad you were in the senate?  Oh yes, I think so.  My sense was that you didn   t like it all that much.  I didn   t like it at all.  36  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Why not?  Well, the senate is a great place to do nothing. You talk and propose and  hide and avoid making decisions as long as you want to, practically. The  Governor is a place where you   re kind of in charge of the agenda and  you can make things come to a head pretty fast.  They even called you Governor, didn   t they? After you were in the  senate?  I don   t remember that.  Lamar Alexander  senator from Tennessee  was talking about that.  I don   t know. It could have been.  Yeah.  I had so many good friends. In fact, Ted Stevens  Alaska Senator  was  my good friend.  Yeah, just finally defeated after he was convicted of     Getting his house built for nothing.  Yeah, ethics violation. So then you came home and you stayed out of  politics although you were involved in saving the Cowboy Hall of Fame.  Came back and you were the receiver of that. And then George Nigh  appointed you to DHS Chairman or Director or whatever we call them.  But then in 1986, you decide to run for governor again.  Yes. It seemed to me like the state was kind of in a crucial point.  It was a terrible time.  Yeah.  Penn Square had gone down on July 5th of 1982, the banks are closed.  Revenues had fallen off. It seemed to me like we had to have somebody  willing to make the tough decisions even though it would cost them the  chance to be re-elected. I didn   t want to be re-elected anyway.  Yeah, by then you could succeed yourself.  Yes.  37  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  So you ran for governor and ran against a young kind of upstart named  David Walters.  Yeah.  Everybody thought Mike Turpen  Michael C. Turpen , the Attorney  General, was going to get the nomination but Walters slipped up on him  and beat him. You really didn   t have a primary opponent as I recall, to  speak of.  No, I didn   t have one at all.  And you were elected. And among your first acts was to make me  Chairman of the Department of Human Services. And I said you did that  to people that didn   t give you enough money.  You were great.  But lots happened during those four years when you were governor.  Probably the most notable that will be remembered was the Education  Financing Reform Bill called     1017.  ..1017 That name is still well known in the state. Talk about that.  Well, that happened during the last year I was in office. It became plain  to me that we had to provide more funding for education and particularly  beginning teacher salaries were  15,000- 16,000 a year. Young  teachers were not staying in Oklahoma. They were leaving to go to  places where they could make more adequate salaries. Yet, I knew that if  we waited until the next session started that the attention would be  focused on the next election and they wouldn   t be willing to cast hard  votes on the school financing reform package. So I didn   t talk to the  legislative leaders or staff or anybody. We just called for a special  session-this was after the other session had been adjourned-with the sole  purpose of dealing with the education reform and funding. And we had  to have a bill prepared which we did quickly and it wasn   t adequate at  all but it was a vehicle that could     Get it started.  Yeah, start the wheels turning. And we couldn   t find anybody to  introduce the bill. Finally we got one legislator, Bill somebody from     Veitch?  38  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bill Veitch  William A. Veitch . He had the courage to introduce our bill  and of course he was the only vote he got.  I know it.  The Speaker, Steve Lewis, had been working on an education reform  idea and the legislature had passed a resolution instructing the Speaker  and the Governor and the President Pro Tempore to appoint an  Education Study Commission. So we quickly formed it up and got  George Singer in Tulsa to be chairman of it. And they took several  months to hold hearings around the state to find out what kind of  reforms people wanted in the school system. And then we drew up a bill  that included these reforms plus  250 million of new money for  education. And we tried to tie the money down so it couldn   t be used for  anything else. I don   t think that was successful. Anyway, it became  House Bill 1017 and we finally got it passed by one vote in the Senate  and a few to spare in the House. And I think it was a well written reform  package. I didn   t do a whole lot in drawing it.  Would you say that that   is that the most notable achievement of your  public life?  Yes. There   s one other thing that   s not necessarily notable or probably  hardly even noticeable, but I think it   s important. And that is if Ed  Edmondson had succeeded in getting me thrown out of the Senate on a  party line vote for no more serious issue than he had, it seems to me like  it would have rocked the foundations of the electoral system. If  partisanship gets to be powerful enough that it can rule the outcome of  the elections, then it   s a serious issue.  But back to your question when it comes right down to it, most of the  decisions in government involve money. And the most heated decisions  are how much do we tax people and how much do we spend for the  various services the government provides. And overriding a lot of issues  is the all mighty dollar.  Speaking of the all-mighty dollar, the endowed chair program was  passed under your leadership as governor which has been a very  important thing for where the state would actually match dollar for  dollar endowed chairs at institutions of higher learning.  That was my plan. That was my program, and I   m very proud of it.  It just benefitted Oklahoma State University ultimately to a little over   300 million.  39  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Wow. Well, I hope it had the effect of keeping some of the more  talented academicians here in the state and bringing in some others from  outside. Here   s what lay behind it, we have, I think it   s 27 state  supported institutions of higher education and when you appropriate  money to them, they cut it in 27 slices and everybody gets their piece of  the sandwich. And it seemed to me that what they need to do is  strengthen our premier universities and you can never get the  legislatures to do that. They won   t vote extra money for OU and OSU.  They want to give every institution the same proportionate share. So we  had a windfall of  125 million that came when we settled an insurance  issue with the foreign insurance companies and the Attorney General  settled that and gave us this  125 million onetime money. We didn   t  want to use it for something that was going to have a repeat cost like  teacher salary cost because it wouldn   t be there the next year. So we  looked around and decided on this Chairs Program. I wanted to make it  two-thirds private and one-third public and I wish we had done it that  way. The private money comes in a lot better than the state funds.  Yeah that   s right. Well there were a number of other things. You  appointed Hannah Atkins, a wonderful lady and civil rights leader as  Secretary of State. That probably wasn   t expected of a republican  governor.  No, Hannah was a deserving person. We had three democrats on our  cabinet. By the way that was the first cabinet we had in the state  government that really functioned. George had kind of a figure head  cabinet.  George Nigh, yes.  Yes. But we had a functioning cabinet and had three democrats and three  women on it.  We   re sitting here on November 21, 2008 and we just elected a new  president.  Yes.  First black president in the history of this country, what are your  thoughts about that?  Well, forgetting for a moment the black issue, it doesn   t seem to me like  two years or four years in the US Senate is adequate preparation to be  President. I was there for two years and I know I would have hated to  even think about taking over as President without any more background  than that. This man has probably better background than most that had  40  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  the same experience because he was a Harvard Law graduate. I don   t  know how much better Harvard Law is than Oklahoma Law or any  other     None.  None, it has sort of an aura about it.  But what does it say, apart from that? What does it say about where the  country is today that a black man could be elected to the highest office?  I think that   s a good thing, assuming he handles the job well and  survives the vicissitudes of the office.  You   ve always been very comfortable in your own skin. When people  talk about Henry Bellmon, they talk about you they say you don   t worry  about what people think. You worry about what   s right. What would be  your advice to politicians today? Because it seems to most observers  that it   s a pretty cynical business. And that people are pretty well driven  by polls and form their opinions and make their decisions based on the  polls.  I think that   s a cowardly thing to do. We had one congressman here who  always looked at the polls and did what his voters want him to do. Well  voters should and do try to hire people to uphold these offices on the  basis of their ability to solve problems and make wise decisions. And if  the job is only trying to count the polls, or count the numbers at the polls  what do you need a qualified person? You can do that with a computer  automatically. So I think it   s a cowardly thing and I think it   s a  dangerous thing for public officials to pay any attention to polls. I  suppose as a candidate you can use them to gauge the efficiency of your  campaign expenditures and time. But once you   re in office you better try  to get the facts and do what is in the national interest. You can   t always  be sure you   re making the right decisions no matter how hard you try or  how careful you are to get your facts straight. But I think it   s a lot better  than just sitting back and looking at the latest polling results.  After you lost Shirley, you ultimately remarried Eloise Bollenbach.  Yes.  And that   s a new chapter in your life.  Yes. Irwin and Eloise have been friends of ours for long time. Irwin was  a pilot and often flew me around the state for meetings when I was a  candidate and sometimes when I was governor but the governor has a  41  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  plane of his own. But Eloise and I have had a good five or six years  together. She   s not well right now, but she   s getting better.  Well, I think we   ve come to the end of the time here. I appreciate your  sitting down with us. Really, Henry Bellmon is one of our most  distinguished graduates, maybe our most distinguished graduate. And  you   re certainly one of the most distinguished Oklahomans of all time.  And I   m proud to say you   re my friend.  Well, thank you. You   re my friend. I wish you well as the new president.  Thank you, I   ll need it.  You   ve got your hands full.  Well, we   re here at Henry Bennett   s hideaway office at the Edmon Low  Library. He never got to use this office, he died in the plane crash in  Iran but you consider it yours and come back anytime.  Well, I   m glad you are willing to take care of my papers.  We are indeed.  Somebody can get some good out of them. We were told when we made  this arrangement that the Library would even like to have the contents of  our wastebasket, so you have a lot of stuff here.  Well, good. We could use it. Thank you very much.  ------- End of November 21, 2008 interview -------  Well, welcome back. This is Burns Hargis and we   re here at a very  special place. It   s the farm and the home of former U.S. Senator, former  Governor, and OSU graduate Henry Bellmon. This is part of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the Edmon Low Library.  We   re going to have some discussion with Senator Bellmon about his  career, his life, his family, and this great farm. Good morning   Good Morning.  I can tell you   re halfway farming and halfway being governor. The top  half is governor and the bottom half is farmer.  It   s just a mixture.  This farm is a very special place to you and to your family obviously. It   s  42  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  been the foundation, in a way, I think, for the person you became. I bet  you have a lot of wonderful stories.  Well Burns, this farm has been in our family for a hundred years. My  dad, who is about the same age as most people   s granddad, homesteaded  this farm in 1897.  My goodness.  And we   ve had it in our family ever since.  And I guess it   s grown and contracted and grown over the years.  It   s hung on. It   s grown some in recent years; my dad homesteaded 160  acres and we have about 1600 acres.  Were those cattle I drove by coming in yours?  They were mine up until the first of the year and I sold them to a  neighbor and retired from the cattle business.  You did?  Yeah.  Are you farming any wheat on this land?  We have a wheat crop that will be harvested in June and then I   ll be out  of the wheat business.  I see. So then you   ll just be a gentleman farmer?  I   ll be a gentleman has-been.  (Laughs) We want to hear some stories. You used to tell a story on the  campaign trail about the cow.  Yeah. On my campaign for governor in    62, we had a system of  arranging with a local supporter to park one of his flatbed trucks on  Main Street of the county seat town. We had an arrangement with a  band, actually Leon McAuliffe was one of the band members. In fact  with his band, Leon and his group would go ahead of us and go up on  this flat bed truck and strike up a tune. This was done on Saturdays,  when most of the rural people would come to town to trade (unlike now  when they go on any day of the week to Wal-Mart). But Saturdays used  to be big days in the county seat towns. Then after the band got playing  43  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  for five or ten minutes I   d arrive and go through the crowd shaking  hands. When the band saw that I had been there long enough, I   d go up  on the back of the truck and the band leader would introduce me. Then  they   d fold up their band instruments and move on to the next stop and  I   d harangue the crowd.  I used to wind up telling a story about this farmer who had a cow he was  going to have to sell. So he ran an ad in the paper and said he had a cow  for sale. Some reader read the ad and was interested in the cow so he  called up and asked how much milk the cow would give. The farmer  said,    Well I don   t measure the milk, we just use it here in the family.     And the caller said,    Well how much cream? How much butterfat in the  milk?    The farmer said,    I don   t separate the milk and don   t measure the  butterfat but it   s all we need.    And he said,    But I   ll tell you one thing  about this cow. She   s a good ole    honest cow and she   ll give you all the  milk she   s got.    And that   s what I said.    I   m going to be a good ole     honest Governor and I   ll serve you all I can.     They were telling the story of a guy who had a horse that was blind. He  was an honest man, but he was selling the horse to this guy and just kind  of assuages his ethics he said,    You know this horse doesn   t look too  good.    And the buyer said,    He looks okay to me.    And he said,    Well,  whatever you think.    Anyway, not as good as your story. You also tell a  butter story.  Yes. This story has no point. (Laughter)  Most of mine don   t either.  I tell the story about being invited over to Holdenville for the FFA  dinner; the FFA have dinners generally once a year. At that time I was  very busy in the office. I came in early in the morning, missed lunch,  and worked on through until I went home. And the girls and Shirley got  used to this     You were governor, at this point.  I was governor. That was the routine, and when I came in I would be  famished. They   d get supper on the table and we   d eat. And I   d fill up so  I could be lived with. But I went to Holdenville and I missed my lunch  and I missed my supper. Service was very slow. There was this lady  moving around putting water on the table. I looked around and noticed  there was a plate of rolls there with some butter. I got a roll and broke it  in half and buttered half of it and ate it quickly and then I ate the other  half and then I was out of butter. There was no more. There were plenty  of rolls but I was out of butter. So this waitress came by and I said,  44  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis     Could I have some more butter please?    And she said,    No.    I kind of  bristled a little but I sat there and she kept scurrying around but there  was no food. So I said,    Look, I missed my lunch. These rolls are here,  and I   d like to eat one of them but I don   t have any butter, could I have  some more butter, please?    And she said,    No     And I said,    Maybe you  don   t know who I am.    And she said,    No, I don   t.    And I said,    Well,  I   m the Governor of Oklahoma.    And she said,    Pleased to meet you  Governor. Maybe you don   t know who I am.    And I said,    No, I guess I  don   t.    And she said,    Well, I   m the girl in charge of the butter.     (Laughter) So the hierarchy was established.  She had the power.  You don   t run as a team of course in Oklahoma for governor- lieutenant  governor, but the guy who ran as lieutenant governor was Bob Wooten.  Yes.  And Bob was from a very different background from you.  Yes.  Bob grew up in Nichols Hill and slept a little later than you do in the  mornings.  We got along all right. I remember a time with Bob Wooten, you had me  thinking about a time out in El Reno where we arranged to have a rally  out there and Bob arranged to rent an elephant. An elephant is of course  a symbol of the Republican Party. We had our rally in the parking lot of  a grocery store. The parking lot sloped down to the street. We had a  truck, a semi-flat bed truck parked up near the store and folding chairs  set up for the crowd down in front of the truck where the slope was from  the truck down to the chairs. This elephant was paraded back and forth  in front of the truck while the speeches were going on. Along toward the  end of it, the elephant feels the need to relieve itself. There was an ocean  of urine sprayed out across that parking lot right where the people were  (laughter) having to hold their feet up and hold their noses. Elephant  urine is not very pleasant to smell. Broke up our rally.  That was the last great idea Bob Wooten had. You know he tells the  story about you waking him up all the time, that you called him too early  in the morning. And one night he had stomach trouble so he called up  here to the farm, he said about 4:45 in the morning, and Shirley  answered the phone and he said,    I really hate to call this early and  disturb you all but I really need to talk to Henry.    And Shirley said,  45  Bellmon     Bob, I   m sorry, but I haven   t seen Henry since early this morning.     When we talked earlier, we talked about the fact that you were national  campaign chairman for Richard Nixon and then came back and ran for  the senate against Mike Monroney and defeated him. Went to  Washington. I would like you to talk   obviously the most notable thing  that happened during the Nixon administration, beside the Vietnam War,  unfortunately, was Watergate. And you, I assume, were a reasonably  close advisor to Nixon. Would you just talk about that whole episode and  your involvement with Nixon and what you observed? As I understand it,  it went up right until the very end.  Yes it did. It started in the summer of    67. Our family had gone out to  Ghost Ranch; it   s a Presbyterian family camp out near Santa Fe, New  Mexico. And while I was there   well, this started a little further back  than that. During the time I was state chairman  of the republican party ,  a fellow named Peter Flanigan was head of the Democrats for Nixon  organization. I was state republican chairman. Pete Flanigan came here  and tried to set up an organization to support Nixon, and I told him we   d  built a good republican organization and we were going to carry the state  and we weren   t going to build a party around his campaign. We didn   t  want him coming in here and siphoning off our funds and our top  citizens. We want them to come and work for the Republican Party and  to be here, when the campaign was over. We   d be running other  campaigns. Flanigan didn   t do anything for a while and finally he went  ahead and set up his Democrats for Nixon organization, despite my  opposition. It was so late in the campaign that it didn   t make much  difference and we used it as kind of a dumping ground for the oddballs  that would come into the campaign headquarters to see what   s in it for  them. Anyway, that was my beginning with Flanigan.  In    67, Flanigan, who was a New York banker, and Dick  Richard   Kleindienst and a fellow from Borden Milk Company and several others  set up what was called a Committee to Elect Nixon. They invited me to  join with them, and I did. We met several times in New York to support  Nixon   s efforts and give him whatever guidance we could. The  campaign wasn   t progressing very well because the fellow in charge of it  was a doctor from San Diego   I   ll think of his name in a minute   and  he made great plans but he didn   t have any motivation to get the plans  into effect. It looked like we were going to have to fire him, and Nixon  hated firing because he had a reputation of being hard to work for and  difficult for staff people to communicate with. So he didn   t fire him. In  July the doctor   s wife became ill with cancer and the doctor resigned. So  they looked around to see someone who could take over the campaign.  The fellow who originally had it was Bob  Robert  Ellsworth who was a  former congressman from Kansas. Bob was looked upon as being too  46  Hargis  Bellmon  liberal. They needed somebody that was more out of the center, so they  decided that I should take the job. So I became the campaign manager I  guess you could call it and Ellsworth was the director. We worked  together from August of    67 until the New Hampshire primaries were  over in March of    68.  They called me when I was with my family at the camp out in New  Mexico, and I couldn   t understand them, the line was so bad that I  couldn   t make out what they were saying and I didn   t know that they   d  offered me this job until I got back to Oklahoma and got on a better  phone system. I told them I couldn   t take the job because I had already  planned to run for Senate against Monroney and we   d started the  campaign effort. I didn   t think I   d want to give it up to be a campaign  director for Nixon. We had an event planned down at Wewoka, it was a  lunch. I went there to make a talk and was in the middle of my speech  when somebody came and told me I was wanted on the telephone. I  went to the phone and it was Nixon. He asked me to take the job, and  you don   t turn him down easily. I took the job and put the senate  campaign on hold.  I felt like it would cost me the election because defeating an incumbent  senator is not easy and Monroney was not a slouch. But we went ahead  with the campaign for Nixon until the New Hampshire primaries were  over. Then I came back and went back to the senate race. We were  successful. But anyway, that   s the background of my connection with  Nixon. When I was serving as his campaign manager, we met many  times in his apartment up there on Park Avenue in New York City to  talk about staff issues and campaign events and generally I got to be  with him a lot of one-on-one. The one thing I noticed about Nixon is that  he hated to make a decision. He hated detail and minutia. It just irritated  him. But you have to think about some of those things. So we often went  up there with a list of issues we needed to have settled, and we   d come  back and we hadn   t got an answer for any of them. One of the things that  led up to Watergate is that he delegated a lot of authority to the people  around him and some of them didn   t live up to the job. I don   t think  Nixon even knew about Watergate until it was all over with and he got  involved trying to shield some of his staff.  Did you sense in those days that, it   s as if Nixon had a really galloping  paranoia about the press, the Kennedy   s, and just all of the swells in  Washington?  I don   t know that I can do a shrink on Nixon really. It seemed to me the  thing that motivated him most was the international politics or  international affairs, and he didn   t really give much thought to anything  else. He was actually a very petty person in many of his dealings. But on  47  Hargis  Bellmon  the other side of it, he had probably as good a global view as anyone in  public life at that time.  So after he was elected, you were in the senate. What was your  involvement? Was it considerable and beyond just normal senate  business?  Well, the first real involvement   these two stories go together here     when he   d been in office about three weeks, Rose Mary Woods called  up one day, she was his secretary, and invited me to the White House for  dinner that night. I went down and they had a fine meal spread out for  us. There were about 20, 25 people. Most of them were members of  Congress or governors. We stood around and ate tidbits and talked.  Nixon came in and met with us and ate with us, showed us around  through the White House, took us up to the family quarters. We walked  by a room and he said,    This is the Lincoln Bedroom and I   m going to  use it for an office.    And we came to the grand piano and he said,     Harry Truman left this piano here,    and Nixon sat down on the piano  bench and played the    Missouri Waltz    using both hands. He was a  pretty accomplished piano player. Anyway, he told us that we were  members of the Early Bird Club. That we were the early birds that had  joined with him before he won the New Hampshire primary and he  couldn   t have won it without us and he was going to remember us. He  wanted us to know that we had a friend in the White House; when we  called, he would reciprocate. Anyway, that was the first meeting of the  Early Bird Club.  The next meeting was another afternoon when Rose Mary Woods called  up and invited me down for supper. I went there, and it was a totally  different atmosphere. Nobody had any jokes or no greetings or any  congressman chit chat at all. Just standing around. We met in the  Cabinet room which has a long table and there   s one chair with a high  back and that   s where the President sits and the other cabinet officers sit  around where there   s a space. So we stood in the cabinet room and  waited a while. Nixon came in after a bit and he came in with his head  down, didn   t speak to anybody and didn   t recognize who we were. But  then he sat down in this high chair and when he did, the rest of us  scrambled around and got a seat next to the big table.  He sat there for a minute with his head down and then he looked up and  started to talk. The words just poured out of him. He said that he not  only wanted to be a good president, he wanted to be a great president.  He talked about the things he thought he   d accomplished; he talked for  probably half an hour, or maybe longer without interruption. Then he  dropped his head and looked down at the table for a minute and looked  up at us and said,    I hope I haven   t let you down.    And he started to cry.  48  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  He got up and ran out of the room and didn   t speak to anybody at all.  We went into the press room and they had three network television sets  turned on and Nixon came on about 8 o   clock and announced that he  would be retiring the next day. And the next day at 11 o   clock he  resigned, got on Air Force One and flew back to California.  Did you have any direct conversations with Nixon about what he   d do,  and when he knew it, to quote Howard Baker?  No.  So he never directly lied to you about his involvement in the actual event  or the cover up?  No, I never discussed it with him. I don   t know that I ever discussed any  business with Nixon after the election. I wasn   t on the Foreign Relations  Committee. I wasn   t on the Appropriations Committee at that time. I  was sort of off his radar screen.  Did you ever see him after he resigned?  Oh yes, I saw him several times. They had an event in Washington for  Bob Dole and Nixon came, I saw him there. Once when I was governor I  went to New York and had some free time and I went over to New  Jersey, he had his office in New Jersey. I went over and met him there.  He used to send me his books, when he wrote them he   d autograph them  and send them to me. I read some of them. They   re all on foreign affairs,  foreign relations.  Was he in good spirits after he was president?  Yeah. Let me tell you another event. Doug McKeever was close to  Bryce Harlow who was Nixon   s Chief of Staff. When I came back from  the senate, Doug McKeever and some others had arranged for a  welcome home party. They prevailed on Nixon through Harlow to come  and make a talk for it. I think it was his first public appearance after  Watergate, after he resigned. Now that may not be a fact, but I think it   s  true. We met in a women   s building at the Garfield County Fairgrounds.  I think there were maybe 600 people there. Nixon was in great spirits.  The people came to him   I sat beside him, and I would imagine no less  than 100 people came and asked him for his autograph. He signed them     Richard Milhous Nixon,    and then he   d push them over to me for me to  sign. I   d sign them right alongside him. Then he made a talk and it was  the same darn thing about foreign relations. He talked to this crowd and  they ate it up.  49  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  I think the last time he went to a public meeting before he resigned was  when he made the commencement speech at OSU. I worked that out for  him to come down. I got him to come down for the dedication of the  Kerr-McClellan Waterway.  Of course, Gerald Ford was appointed President after Nixon resigned.  Were you involved in that decision at all of them appointing Ford?  No.  Never talked to you about them appointing you?  No. Bryce Harlow invited me to breakfast once and talked to me about  becoming the Secretary of Agriculture.  And you turned that down?  Well, I told Bryce that I didn   t want to be considered. I   d just run for the  Senate, I   d been reelected and Abraham Ribicoff had become kind of a  friend of mine. Abe had been Governor of Connecticut  1955-1961  and  then he became Secretary of H.E.W.  Health, Education, and Welfare .  I   d talk to Abe about it and Abe said when you   re governor you can  make your own decisions and set your own agenda but when you  become a cabinet member you have to subordinate your thoughts and  convictions to whatever the president wants to adopt as his policy. And  he said it   s kind of a miserable experience.  While we stay on this with the presidents, what was your impression of  Ford as president?  Well, Ford took over at a tough time, it was after Watergate. He was  probably the right person for the job, but as far as getting forward  motion, as far as trying to accomplish anything, I don   t think Ford even  tried to do very much. He   d been the minority leader of the House for  many years. He was accustomed to being the no-man. He wasn   t  charged with the responsibility of doing things. He was the same as  president.  He, of course, was challenged by Reagan.  Yes. Reagan didn   t get the nomination the first time  in 1976 , but he got  it the second time  in 1980 .  Were you a Reagan supporter?  Well, I wasn   t a supporter of his so-called supply-side economic theory.  50  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  I feel kindly toward Reagan because he ended the Cold War and he  invigorated the Republican Party. It became a power in politics. We   ve  not held power for a long time, except for Nixon and Eisenhower.  We were talking about Reagan, and that you appreciated his     The thing that I disliked about him was the fact that he ran up the federal  debt so much. He made it fashionable to run government on borrowed  money. That   s going to ultimately be our undoing. It   s gotten   in this  present atmosphere, we   re talking about trillion dollar deficits. A trillion  is a thousand billion, I think.  Several billion.  Yeah.  As long as we   re on this, what about Jimmy Carter? You served under  Carter?  Yes, I wasn   t close to Carter. I had some meetings with him on Panama  Canal Treaty issues, kind of indirectly.  You said he had you up to the White House one time.  Yeah, he had me up there. It wasn   t about Panama, as I remember, but I  don   t remember what it was. It must have been a budget issue or  something like that. I was in ranking on the budget committee so he on  occasion wanted to talk about that. But there was a guy named Herky  Harris who was his lobbyist on the Panama Canal issue. Herky lobbied  me hard about the Panama Canal and tried to get me to go down to the  White House and talk to Carter. I told him I thought I had to make a  decision without the influence of the president and declined to go. But  he would have liked me to come down.  You were usually about the only farmer in the Senate during your  service, and Carter had been a peanut farmer.  He was a genuine farmer. When I was down to see him, we talked about  whatever issue he wanted to discuss for maybe five or ten minutes, and  then he kept me there for maybe an hour talking about farming matters.  Farm issues. He was homesick to get back on a tractor.  So were you.  Yeah, I never got off.  51  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  You had a story about Jim Abrams.  Yeah. Jim Abrams was a New York City bond   he wasn   t a broker, he  was a bondsman. He created bond issues and he worked with Allen  Company. They had traditionally handled the Oklahoma Turnpike  Authority bond issues before I became governor, and we continued to  use them while I was in office. We undertook to build the Indian Nations  and Muskogee Turnpike and to have some money left over for the  Cimarron. It wasn   t a particularly attractive issue. Those are fairly  remote areas and traffic loads aren   t heavy. It was just kind of a question  of whether we could make it fly or not. So we thought we ought to  cultivate Jim Abrams a little bit and try to warm him up to the idea. So  Harry Bailey put on a big party for him at the club up at the First  National Bank Building.  Beacon Club?  Beacon Club.  That   s H.E. Bailey for the H.E. Bailey Turnpike?  No, the Harry Bailey was already funded.  James  Howard Edmondson  got it started.  But it was named after him?  Yes, Bailey was the father of the turnpike system in Oklahoma.  Was he the director of the Turnpike Authority?  Yes, very colorful man. Anyway we     While we   re on that, what was his background?  Harry Bailey?  Yes.  He was a civil engineer who I think worked for the highway department  before the Turnpike Authority was created. But he took over the  Authority and built the Will Rogers and the Roy Turner and H.E. Bailey  and built the Muskogee and Indian Nations and got them funded.  So Abrams tried to get him     Yeah, we tried to get him to handle the bond issue for us. We were  52  trying to butter him up and so we had this nice dinner for him at the  Beacon Club. Doug McKeever, who was our attorney for the Turnpike  Authority, took him up to Enid and he spent the night in the Youngblood  Hotel. Doug got him up at 4 o   clock the next morning, took him out to  the Great Salt Plains to go goose hunting. It turned out to be a cold,  windy morning with the wind out of the north. We put him in a goose  blind to face the north, so he sat there from about 6 in the morning until  9 o   clock with the sand blowing in his face, shivering and chilling and as  miserable as he could be. And we never saw a goose. We could hear  them, but the damn things wouldn   t fly.  We had arranged for an airplane to come and pick him up. We flew an  old twin prop and it looked like a wreck and pretty factually was. But he  finally got on it. We were going to take him out to Hal Cooper   s Ranch  at Fort Supply to hunt quail. It was an overcast morning and we flew  west. The ceiling got lower and lower and lower and we got as far as  Woodward and the pilot   the airport at Woodward is about six miles  west of town. And the pilot said,    We can   t make it.    He said,    We   re so  low now we   re going to hit some of these TV aerials. I   m going to have  to go back.    So we want back to Waynoka and landed. Just started to  land and the pilot throttled the engine down, and one of the engines  wouldn   t throttle, it ran away. He panicked and called a mayday  warning. The fire department from Waynoka came out with their sirens  and red lights and then all of these pickups were trailing along behind it  to see the wreck. And finally someone suggested the pilot just shut the  engine off and land it on one engine. He did and we landed without  incident.  So then we had to drive to Woodward. We called a highway patrol car  and it came. Unfortunately it was one of the cars that was equipped with  scales to weigh trucks on the highway, so the trunk was absolutely full  with paraphernalia for this weighing operation. We had to drive from  Waynoka to Woodward with Jim Abrams holding his suitcase on his lap.  We got to Fort Supply and Hal Cooper put on a really fine dinner. It   s a  big ranch and he had several cowboys and they were used to having  good food and they did a fine job of entertaining him for dinner. And  then after dinner, he said he   d put on his hunting clothes and he came  out dressed in fox hunting clothes which was suede leather. We started  hunting out in the sage brush and that sage brush just tore that fox  hunting regalia to shreds. Then the payoff came when he was walking  through the brush and a wild turkey flew up and he shot it, out of season.  The game warden was out there with us, so we had to pay his fine and  that was the end of that. When he went back to New York he wrote me a  letter and sent me a package of paperclips and rubber bands and said,     Fix up your god damned airplane.     53  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  (Laughter)  And he handled the bonds for us.  He did handle them?  Yeah.  And sold them?  Sold them.  That Cimarron is just right out here just a piece down the road.  Well, they didn   t fund the Cimarron; they took the Cimarron out of the  package. But there was about, as I remember, about  18 million left to  start funding the Cimarron. He funded the Muskogee and Indian Nation   Turnpikes .  One issue that has been front and center in politics in Oklahoma and  nationally, and it seems to have dominated the differences between  republican and democrat parties, is the whole subject of abortion. The  Republican Party, of course, has had a very strong pro-life platform all  these years. I don   t recall you weighing in on this issue too vocally, but  talk about that issue and your thoughts and how it   s dominated politics  and either contributed or deteriorated from our conversation.  The abortion issue came to a head when I was out of office. I don   t  remember just what year it was, but when I was asked about my position  on abortion after the governor   s race in    86, I told the reporter that asked  me about it that I felt it was an impossible issue for the government to  deal with, and that I felt the court was doing as good a job as humanly  possible in resolving the issue, and that I supported Roe v. Wade. I  stayed with that position all the way through.  And that was clearly not the Republican Party   s official position?  I   m not sure the Republican Party had an official position at that time.  But it   s certainly not their position now. But I still think it   s about as  good as we can do with the issue.  Should it have the prominence that it has in the national dialogue?  No, it shouldn   t, but it   s one of those emotional issues that stir people   s  feelings. But there are people who oversimplify things and they  shouldn   t.  54  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Was Roe v. Wade consistent with your feelings about the subject?  Oh, my feeling is complicated by the fact that I   I don   t know that I  ever tried to figure out any other solution other than that one, Roe v.  Wade. It   s just one of those issues that there   s no good answer for.  What about the subject of gun control? That   s been another dividing  issue between the parties.  I am not in favor of gun control, but I   m not in favor of the assault rifle  being sold in back alleys and gun shows.  What about background checks?  Yeah, they should certainly have a background check before they   re  allowed to buy even a hand gun.  Isn   t the second amendment, though, its specific language, doesn   t it  make it difficult to ban any kind of guns?  That amendment said that each state should have a militia.  Right and should not abridge the right to bear arms. The citizens    right  to bear arms. Do you think those two are connected?  Oh, Burns, you   ve got me on that. I don   t know if I   ve thought about it. I  know that when I thought that the government might prohibit you to  own a handgun, I thought well I own  one  and don   t get mine; I   ll hide  it. (Laughter) But I   ve now given it away.  I don   t know that it was involved in politics when you started running,  but the surveys have become very popular where the National Rifle  Association or Pro-Choice, whatever it may be, send these surveys     business groups often do it   to candidates. Did you get those? And did  you fill them out?  We got a few, but not like what you get now. And I used to fill them out  begrudgingly and not feel like I was committing myself to a position in  most of the issues. The truth of it is, Burns, that somebody can simplify  an issue and make it sound pretty reasonable, but then when you get into  the depth if it, it   s a totally different matter. And I used to   they   d ask  me if I   d veto a bill. I   d say,    Give me a copy of it and I   ll read it and  give you an answer.    But you can   t say that you are going to veto or sign  some bill that   s not even written yet. It   s the same with some of these  issues that come up from time to time. For instance, the issue on  integration in schools; I don   t think that anyone   s yet figured out how to  55  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  deal with that one. Strom Thurmond used to  say  that you couldn   t bus  past the nearest school house. Then races live separately in their  communities and you don   t accomplish any integration at all. You have  separate systems and separate   they   re not equal.  You earlier alluded to the current economic crisis that we   re in and the  efforts to address it included the so-called stimulus package, which is  proposing to spend astonishing sums in the economy. You were a  ranking member of the budget committee for many years, considered a  fiscal conservative, balanced the Oklahoma budget as the constitution  requires. What do you think about all of this spending that   s going on  right now?  I think they are going to destroy the worth of our money, the currency.  It   s not going to have any meaning much more than the paper it   s written  on.  Does that result in runaway inflation?  Yes. It takes some drastic measures to avoid runaway inflation and I   m  not sure the political system will withstand the kind of drastic curbs that  are going to be required. And yet, at the same time, there   s no question  that the country and the world is going into an economic recession. It   s  going to take a long time to work it out unless they do something pretty  drastic.  You are a child of rural America, and one of the most perplexing  problems now is the economic and social health of rural Oklahoma and  the country. The explosion of methamphetamine violations, production,  abuse, and violations is really an epidemic in rural Oklahoma. We seem  to have had in our state and in many states this rural/urban split in our  legislature and otherwise. What would be your remedy? Are we pushing  a rope uphill here, or is there a way that government can address the  problems for rural America?  Well, the government has spent a lot of money subsidizing crops, wheat,  cotton, corn, soy beans, and probably it   s killing the system in ways they  didn   t intend or didn   t expect. The net result of what   s going on in  agriculture is that we have fewer and fewer farmers who are larger and  larger as years go by. We   re now down to probably not more than a half  million actual commercial farmers. There are many other farmers who  own a few cows or a few horses or a few animals and live on a small  farm and are working in the town or the city, and that   s fine. But the real  production comes from the farmers who have thousands of acres and  have machines that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The market   s  not going to stay viable when it depends heavily on the government  56  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  subsidies.  So the system is not healthy. I don   t know what that says about drug  abuse. I wasn   t aware it is more of a problem for rural people than it is  for city people. I   m not sure that the government can deal with it. But  it   s going to require more attention from the parents and the social  organizations to help young people to resist the temptation to experience  it and wreck their lives.  I   m going to fast forward after your last time as governor and what you  have been doing in so-called retirement. I know you   ve worked with  OSU, with the Alliance, continued farming. There   s a program at  Oklahoma State which nurtures and promotes scholars run by Bob  Graalman and we   re beginning a Bellmon Scholars endowment at  Oklahoma State. This is, of course, to enable our students to be named  Truman, Fulbright, Udall, Claire, Oxford and of course Rhodes  Scholars. You had an involvement in getting Oklahoma State kind of on  the radar. Can you talk about how all that started?  Yes. I had not too much to do with it, but I was on the Truman Board for  a while.  Truman Scholarships?  The Truman Scholarship Board. The board that picks the winners for the  region and maybe for the nation, I don   t recall whether we had the whole  country or just part of it. But it seemed to me that the Truman  requirements or Truman standards fit OSU   s land grant mission  precisely. And it seemed to me that the candidates that we got from OSU  weren   t   they were the right people, but they weren   t properly prepared  to compete with candidates from other institutions. So I went to Bob  Graalman and told him that I thought if he would look into the Truman  standards and requirements and mentor some of the candidates a little  better, that OSU could have more success than  we were  experiencing  in the past. I also told him that this fellow who ran the Truman  Fellowship program would be a good one to use as a resource person  and he could bring him down and let him meet the students and get to  know the university better.  Louis Blair.  Louis Blair. And I think Bob did that. And OSU has been very  successful. How many Truman Scholars have you had now, do you  know?  I don   t, but it   s 10-15, something like that.  57  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  And one Rhodes Scholar.  One Rhodes Scholar, Blaine Greteman. He was from Hydro.  Yeah.  Do you think that   s an important initiative for Oklahoma State?  I think it   s very important for two aspects. It   s important for the  university because it shows you   re one of the heavy hitters in the  scholastic areas as well as in the athletic area. And it   s important to the  students who win and it   s of considerable importance to the ones who  compete and they don   t win. They take advantage of development that  they might not otherwise get.  I want to run some names by you and get your reaction. I know that you  had an occasion to meet with  Leonid  Brezhnev of Russia.  Yes, I was in a delegation of senators who spent a couple of weeks in the  Soviet Union. It was at the time that the Cubans were beginning   I think  it was the F16. And Chuck  Charles Harting  Percy who was a former  astronaut and who was on the Foreign Relations Committee was a  member of our group. Brezhnev at this time was not well. He had an  affliction of some kind and was only able to function about three or four  hours a day. I   m not sure who was in charge of setting the schedule but  they gave our group about half an hour with Brezhnev. What amazed me  was that Percy had the gall to carry a recording device with him and  undertook to record Brezhnev   s comments for the group, which I  thought was about the brassiest thing I   ve seen a senator do. The KGB  didn   t let him keep his microphone, they took it away from him and  gave it back to him when he left.  You met in Red Square? Or at the Kremlin?  Yes.  Is it opulent? Is it a     Very. It   s kind of sad to see so much wealth squandered on opulence in a  country that   s basically almost on the verge of starvation at the time we  were there.  Could Brezhnev speak English?  No.  58  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  So you spoke through an interpreter?  As I remember, and this was a long time ago, we spoke through an  interpreter, but very frequently the interpreter would start to interpret the  statements and Brezhnev would break in and answer before the  interpreter had time to translate. So it was obvious that he understood  more than he wanted us to know.  Did you have any direct conversation with him?  Only as a member of the group. I stayed another time in the Soviet  Union, Hubert Humphrey and I went over there together. It was after the  grain sell of    72 when they came here and bought all of our wheat before  the market had a chance to react. Anyway, we had meetings   might  have been Khrushchev, but we met with the second in command and the  commanding officers of agriculture and energy and different  departments. Hubert was kind of a favorite of the Russians. They liked  him. He   d been there when he was Vice President, and it was quite  entertaining to be with him. The thing that impressed me about the  Russians was they were pretty nice people when you got to know them  one on one.  They didn   t mind you not taking a shot of the vodka?  No, the first time I was confronted with that was when they took me out  to the horse training stable and put on a horse show. Really, people were  standing up on the bareback horses and running around in a circle and I  was the only witness, only spectator. And then when we were through,  this fellow who was head of the horse farm said,    Why don   t we go into  the house and have a drink.    And I thought I was dead in the water. So  we got in the house and I said,    Well, I   ll have a soda.    And he said,    So  you don   t drink?    And I said,    No.    And he said,    Well, I don   t either,  I   ve got ulcers.    (Laughter) So got over that hurdle all right.  That   s good. What about Anwar Sadat?  Well, this was before the Suez Canal War. I   d been invited by Bill  Hughes who was head of electrical engineering at OSU   I think he was  head, he was an electrical engineer from OSU, a professor. He was then  involved with the Aswan Dam, with its construction, or with its  operation. He was invited by the Egyptian government to come back and  advise them on something to do with the Aswan Dam; he invited me to  go with him and I did. We went up to Aswan and spent about a week or  so in Egypt. He had connections with someone who was in the Ministry  of Energy. This fellow showed us around and entertained us; it was a  very fine experience. During the time we were there, the   I guess you  59  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  can call it the war scares   became even greater and it was suggested  that I try to get an appointment to see Sadat, and I did. I asked for an  appointment and didn   t hear anything back until after I had to leave.  I went to London for a meeting of the Agriculture Attach  s, and while I  was there, I got a message back from Egypt that they set up an  appointment time to see Sadat, so I had to fly back to Cairo from  London. I went into Sadat   s residence, and as I remember, sat on a hard  bench kind of like that for what seemed like a long time. Sadat finally  came in and sat down beside me. He kind of read me the riot act. He told  me that Egyptians couldn   t stand to have  the  Sinai  peninsula   occupied by Israel and that they  the Israelis  are either going to have to  get out of there, or there would be war. He was the most intense man I  ever was around. He was unbelievably strong. He told me when I got  back to Washington for me to go see Kissinger and tell him that they   ve  got   I   ve forgotten what he said now   two months or six months to  solve this problem or we   re going to have war.  He spoke English, didn   t he?  I believe he did, now that I think about it. But they did have a war.  They did indeed. What about the whole Israeli-Palestinian matter?  Well, I   ve never had any dealings with it in an official capacity, but I  have my personal convictions about it. When you go back to the  beginning, it has to do with the Holocaust, the effort literally of Hitler  and the Nazis to exterminate the Jews, citizens of Europe. And when the  war was over, there was no country in Europe where the Jews were  welcome. In fact, there was a ship load of them, I think there were  around 300 or more than that that came to this country and we wouldn   t  land  them  here either. There was just no place where the Jews were  wanted.  And so Truman and Churchill worked out this plan to turn Palestine,  what was then Palestine, which was a British protectorate, to turn it into  an Israeli state and to pay the Palestinians for their homes and their  businesses and their property that they were going to be forced out of.  The scheme might have worked if the Palestinians had accepted the  money and relocated, but they didn   t want to sell their houses and their  farms and their businesses. And they didn   t want a Jewish state in their  country, and so they   ve resisted ever since.  I don   t know the solution. I think in retrospect, and I   ll probably be hung  for saying this publicly, but I think in retrospect if we   d opened up the  regulations and allowed a million or two million or three million or  60  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  whatever the number of Jews to come here, we could have absorbed  them easily into our economic social system and wouldn   t have had  problems. As long as the Jews and Arabs hate each other as much as  they do, and as long as we have political pressure from the Jewish  community to support Israel, I don   t think there   ll be peace in the  Middle East.  You had occasion to meet with King Hussein of Jordan?  Well, more than once. One time   well there   s a kind of a practice in  Washington for foreign potentates  when they  come to town to make  the social circles and do the proper thing diplomatically, then they go  home with foreign aid. This one night they had a dinner for King  Hussein of Jordan who had been entertained by the people of the White  House, so Hussein put on his own dinner for us   for the people in  Washington, and I was invited, my wife and I, Shirley. The dinner was  in an art gallery and you came in on the second floor off the street. They  had a reception at that level and then at the proper time you walk down  along a stair case into a very ornate room with a lot of chandeliers and  crystal.  We were seated at tables for eight people. The table with Hussein and  his wife had Nelson and Happy Rockefeller, he was Vice President, and  Henry Kissinger and Nancy and I think there was another one. Shirley  and I were sitting at a table with  Mark  Hatfield of Oregon and some  other senators. The deal was, they served about a five course meal, and  then they   d serve dessert, then they   d pass a box of chocolates for the  ladies and cigars for the men. Then the host would make a speech and  the guests would respond, and then the dinner was over. The response  had to do with the foreign aid package. Well, this night, they served the  meal and they were ready to serve the chocolates and cigars when  Happy Rockefeller decided she needed to go powder her nose. She got  up, she was next to and she told Nancy that she was going to go to the  ladies room, and so Nancy and the other ladies got up to dismiss her.  And when they stood up, the men stood up, and when the men stood up  the rest of the crowd stood up and the party was over, and he never got  to make his pitch for money.  That was it.  That was it.  Well, I think he got plenty.  You know Burns, this is just an aside. I don   t know how long this  country can carry so many people on their hip like we do. I haven   t seen  61  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  the numbers for years, but I   m sure they haven   t gone down, probably  gone up. But we spend billions of dollars in supporting Israel and Jordan  and Egypt. I don   t know what we get for it. I guess we call it peace, but  it certainly hasn   t kept the terrorists from doing their thing.  What is the solution for the Middle East? Many think just preserve it for  our oil and gas supplies. But clearly, most of the states in that region  hate America.  I   m not sure. I don   t know what the root problem is. It could be in the  difference between Islam and Christianity. The Islam Mullahs teach hate  in their schools. The group that came here and blew up the buildings in  New York City was mostly Saudi Arabians. They had no logical purpose  for that. It was just a hate action as far as I can tell.  And now with Pakistan having nuclear capabilities.  And North Korea and Iran pushing in the same direction.  You just wonder what the solution is. Mainly, they want us out.  They want us out of Israel.  And then they want to take care of Israel.  Yes.  But of course, Israel is not going to let that happen. They have nuclear  capability, don   t they?  Yes.  Is that kind of a common secret? Worse kept secret in Washington?  I don   t know that it   s even a secret.  Like Saddam Hussein?  Yeah.  Should we have gone into Iraq?  Well, if you remember, Hussein had attacked Kuwait and set the oil  fields on fire and had aspirations to go into Saudi Arabia where he  probably could have prevailed. They don   t have armies anything like  Iraq had. I think it would have been a   we saw what happened to the  62  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  price of oil when we had a little shortage here a couple of years ago. It  went to  150 a barrel. I don   t know how you   d get us out of a worldwide  panic but we   d have definite shortages. So I think the answer to your  question is yes, from just the results we know, though a long war was  unexpected.  Well, we   re going to wrap this up, but I want to come back, as you have  all these years, to the farm.  Okay.  To this farm. It seems like you went to war, you came back to the farm.  You went to the legislature   I guess you never really left the farm then     but you went to the Governor   s mansion, came back to the farm. Went to  the U.S. Senate, came back. In fact, the whole time I knew you in the  U.S. Senate, you kept talking about how you didn   t like the Senate  compared to being Governor.  Yeah.  And you certainly didn   t like either of them compared to the farm.  Yes.  Then of course Governor again, and then back to the farm. This place is  hard to leave, isn   t it?  Well, farming   s something that I feel like I understand, and I   m not  necessarily any expert or any whiz-bang farmer, I   m just kind of run of  the mill. But it   s here where I feel comfortable and confident, and where  you can solve the problems. Some of the problems you run into in the  government, they just don   t have a solution.  Everything   s pretty straight forward.  Yeah, that   s right.  Kind of like you.  You know when it   s time to plant and when it   s time to harvest; when  the calves are going to be born and how to manage your property. So  it   s     Would you recommend a young man to go into farming?  Well, if he had the background and resources I would, but it   s a tough  63  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  Bellmon  Hargis  slog for a few years. It probably takes 200 cows to make a living for one  family, and that involves a lot of acres of grassland and a lot of bank  loans unless you   ve got some family wealth. And if you do have, you  probably wouldn   t want to invest it in agriculture.  We are of course doing this oral history for OSU. Let   s just close by  talking about what a difference in your life OSU made.  I think it   s made all the difference. OSU gave me the foundation for the  variety of activities I have pursued over the last 60 years. At OSU I  learned that seemingly impossible goals could be achieved through  perseverance and diligence. The OSU experience set the parameters and  the direction I took for the rest of my life.  Well, on behalf of OSU, we   re glad you came there, and kept you off the  ground and in the tank. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.  Thank you, Burns. I wish you well.  I   ll need all your wishes. That concludes our oral history with former  Governor and U.S. Senator Henry Bellmon, certainly one of our most  distinguished graduates, and in my opinion maybe our most  distinguished. Thank you.  ------- End of April 3, 2009 interview -------
