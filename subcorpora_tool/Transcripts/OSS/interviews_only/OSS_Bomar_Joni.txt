 Ahrberg, and today is October 15, 2009, and I am  visiting with Joni Harper Bomar in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview  is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. So, welcome, Joni, back to campus for the Women of  Willard    WOW    Reunion.  Thank you.  Let   s start off with having you tell me about your early life, like where  you grew up, your family, and your school and things like that.  Okay. Actually, I grew up in a little town called Crowder, Oklahoma,  which is just north of McAlester. My granddad had the general  mercantile feed store. So, I grew up there, and I had an older brother and  a younger brother. I was in the middle and the only daughter. We lived  there until I got into high school, and my dad felt like we needed to be in  a little better school so he moved us to McAlester. I finished high school  in McAlester.  How big was your graduating class?  In McAlester it was about 175. But Crowder was a very small school,  and he just didn   t feel like we were getting the education there that we  needed, so we moved to McAlester.  What were some of the activities that you were involved with?  Well, in Crowder about the only thing there was to do was play  basketball. (Laughs) You know how small towns are. So, I was in 4-H  club, and I also played on the basketball team and on the softball team.  And then, let   s see. When I moved to McAlester, basically just P.E. and  things like that, but I was always in the 4-H club, and I raised fat cattle  5  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  for the stock shows and things. My dad was a rancher, and he had a  ranch outside McAlester.  How many head of cattle did he have?  He would run around 300-350. He had about 1,500 acres outside of  town.  That   s a lot.  Yes. I was raised going back and forth out to the ranch, so I had a lot of  cattle and things like that for 4-H club.  Was it hard to make the adjustment from your small town to McAlester?  Very hard. Very hard. McAlester was a very good school, but they were  very, very tough scholastically. I found I had to study a lot more, but I  did okay. I made the National Honor Society there at McAlester High.  What influenced you to attend OSU?  Actually, I had a scholarship to a junior college over at Wilburton. I was  scheduled to go over there, and I had a girlfriend who lived out by our  ranch and she was going to Oklahoma State, A M at the time,  Oklahoma A M, and I rode up with her while she came to enroll. And  when I went back home I told the folks,    I really want to go to Stillwater  to school. I don   t want to go to this junior college.    So, they decided  they   d let me go to Stillwater, but if I hadn   t come up with her, I would  never have made it.  What year did you enroll?  In 1954, fall of 1954, so I was a year ahead of most of the girls.  Well, on that first trip up to Stillwater, what was your impression of the  campus and of the town of Stillwater?  The campus was beautiful. They had lots of flower gardens, the Student  Union was brand new, the library was brand new, and the lawns were so  well kept. It was just a beautiful place, and everybody was so friendly. I  just decided that I would rather go there.  What about the town? Did you get to see much of the Stillwater town?  No, I don   t remember that we spent much time there. I was riding with  her, and she had come up to enroll. So I decided   I went back home and  6  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  told the folks this is where I wanted to go to school.  And they were okay with that?  They were okay, yes. I just had gotten a scholarship over to the junior  college.  What kind of scholarship was it?  It was scholastic.  Were there a lot of McAlester people coming to OSU, or Oklahoma  A M, at that time?  No.  You were like a rebel, then.  (Laughs) The girl that I came up with, she came, and there was one other  girl in our class that came up here, but those were the only ones that  came to Stillwater.  So, what years did you live in Willard? All four?  All four years.  All four years. That   s awesome.  They assigned me a roommate my freshman year, and she was a senior,  and all the girls who lived around me there were seniors. And I  happened to have been here during the infamous panty raid, which  happened in the spring of    55. I was a freshman.  Tell us a little bit about that.  I started to say, do you want to hear about the panty raid?  I want to hear about the panty raid of 1955, yes I do.  Well, I was in my room, and between Murray and Stout there was a  fountain out between the two women   s dorms. And we heard these kids  throwing each other in the fountain, you know. It   d be like kids just  playing around, throwing each other in the fountain, and then some of  the boys from the fraternities came over and they started getting in on it.  Then it kept getting louder and louder and louder and louder, and the  kids just came from everywhere until there was a huge mob out there  7  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  around that fountain. And then all of a sudden they yell,    Let   s get  Willard   s panties     real loud.    Let   s get Willard   s panties     Well, I was  a freshman, and one of the seniors had come down to our room, so I  went down to the room and they shut the door. My roommate came in,  and she was in the room, and so they yelled at her to go down to the  room. Well, when she ran out of our room, she left the door open, and so  here comes this mob. We looked out the window, and here was this mob  of guys, huge mob, just pouring across the yard in front of Willard Hall.  And then we heard the French doors being broken open, then we really  got scared. They were breaking into Willard Hall through the French  doors, and then they were running up and down the halls. And  unfortunately, my roommate had left our door open, so they got into our  room and stole all of our underwear.  Were you scared?  Scared, yes. We were scared because they were totally out of control.  It   s the first time I   ve ever seen a mob out of control. It was very scary.  So, did they hit every room?  Well, they were running up and down the halls. The doors locked when  you shut them so they were only getting in the rooms that the doors were  open. Some of them I think they might have kicked the door in. But they  got all of our panties, I remember that. And my mother had put my name  in all of my underwear. I don   t know where my underwear ended up, but  I think it was all over campus. (Laughs)  Well, were girls handing them out to the guys as they came by?  Oh no, no, no. We were hiding in the room with the door shut. No, we  weren   t handing any   at least not that I know of. We weren   t handing  any of them out.  What time of day did it happen? Evening?  I think it was late afternoon, and it was getting pretty close to finals. I  mean, I think everybody was just kind of stressed out and ready to let  their hair down, and it just got out of control.  What did the house mother do? Was she on the phone to campus police?  I don   t know. We were hiding in our room. I don   t know, but I know  they took a lot of pictures, and a lot of the guys got expelled from  school.  8  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Really?  Yes.  So, campus police finally showed up?  Yes, I guess. We were hiding in our room. (Laughs)  Were they hauling them off in the paddy wagons? Oh, my gosh.  They were taking pictures, I know that, because they got a bunch of the  boys expelled for it.  I   m so glad you were able to share your story because everyone I   ve  asked that, they   ve said,    Well, I heard about it, and I heard it was  really scary,    but no one   s actually said they were in it, so that   s really  good.  Yes, well, see I was a year ahead of most of the kids, so I started in    54.  They started in    55, but it was in spring of    55.  So, did your parents ask you about it? Did they hear about it?  I don   t even remember telling my folks about it. They might have come  and got me. (Laughs)  And said,    You   re going to Wilburton.    I   m glad you shared that. So,  did you specifically request Willard?  No. I just signed up for a room, and they put me in Willard, and the girl  that I roomed with was a senior, and all the girls around me were  seniors.  How was that for you? Did they take you under their wing?  Yes they did. Actually, one of the girls in the corner room, her dad had  been the county commissioner down where we lived, so Dad knew him,  and she really took me under her wing. But one thing I noticed, when  those girls were in school, they used to do more pranks on each other  than our group did later. Like if they   d catch somebody in the bathtub,  they   d run and pour blue dye in it. Or I remember one lady, an older  lady, that lived in one of the rooms was gone for the weekend, and so we  sat there all weekend and wadded up newspapers. And when she came  home and opened her dorm door, her room was completely packed with  wadded-up newspapers. (Laughs) And short-sheet the beds, we used to  short-sheet the beds all the time. But the group that I was with, the  9  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  younger group, we didn   t do that that much, but those seniors did it all  the time.  Second floor is where you lived?  Right.  And that was the only floor you lived on the whole time?  The whole time, right.  The first time you walked into Willard, what was your impression of it?  That it was big, there were a lot of girls. And of course, you know, I     Did your parents help you move in?  Yes, they were there, and one thing I remember was that I was going up  to my room and they were helping me take my stuff up. I didn   t have a  watch, and my mom took her watch off and gave it to me so I   d have a  watch for college.  Wow, that   s some memory. What was your room like?  It was small, and we didn   t have a corner room. We had a small room in  the middle there, 213. Each one of us had a twin bed and a desk and one  little closet and one sink with a little medicine cabinet that was in the  front of it.  Did you bring your own sheets and bedding?  Yes, and all I can remember is that the floors were made out of some  kind of material that was really hard to keep clean. We used to have to  try to mop them all the time, and every time you   d walk across them, it  would leave dust prints.  Did you try to decorate your rooms?  We had bulletin boards that we kept our pictures on. We wore a lot of  crinolines at that time and we didn   t have anywhere to put them, so we  would hang them on our hot water pipes.  Could you paint your room?  No, we never painted our rooms.  10  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  What were the colors of the room?  Prison green  (Laughter) They were just a light color. They had the  radiators, and once they turned the heat on, it was on for the winter. If  we had a warm spell in January or February, that was just too bad. You  couldn   t turn those radiators off. We   d have to raise the windows.  So, I assume you brought fans.  I don   t remember having a fan.  Well, you were able to open the windows, though, weren   t you?  We had to open the windows, yes. It was warm in September, too, when  we would get there, but we just, when you   re kids I guess it just doesn   t  bother you. We   d raise our windows and go on with it.  What was it like trying to have a personal conversation on the floor  phone?  (Laughs) Our one phone? Well     Did you use it much?  We did, but we didn   t have very much personal conversation. I mean,  usually it was a guy calling somebody to ask her for a date, and he   d ask  her for a date and that   d be it. I mean, we didn   t get into long drawn-out  conversations. Usually the only time that happened is when maybe a girl  and boy were fighting about something or, you know, (Laughs) had  some things to hash out, but it wasn   t a problem for us.  I was going to say, with a phone like that, did you hear a lot of personal  things that you probably wouldn   t have heard otherwise?  You know, we were so close. Our group was always so close that there  wasn   t much going on that we didn   t already know about. I don   t  remember that being a problem.  Did you mingle with the other girls on the different floors?  Some. If we had them in class or ran into them in the cafeteria we would  visit with them some, but not a lot. Not a lot of comingling, just passing  and speaking and things like that.  You mentioned the bathtub thing. There was a common shower and  restroom area on your floor, right?  11  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Right, right.  Can you tell us a little bit about how many women shared that facility  and some other stories, maybe?  Well, let   s see. We had one on our end, and then there was another one  on the other end, so it was like half of one floor. There were several  shower stalls, maybe six or so, and then the one bathtub, but we didn   t  bathe that often because you had to get in and scrub it out before you  could use it, you know. (Laughs) And there were plenty of stalls,  bathroom stalls. That   s all we were used to. We weren   t used to anything  any better, so it didn   t really bother us.  Did they have cleaning ladies that came in like once a day to clean the  bathrooms, or was that a responsibility that you all had to do?  I really don   t remember. I remember if I wanted to bathe that I would  scrub out the bathtub.  That was your responsibility, but you didn   t clean the showers?  No, no.  They usually had help doing that?  I guess so. We would wear those scuffies in the shower. Take our own  towels and soap and stuff.  But there never was a problem trying to get to the shower like on a  Friday night, nothing like that?  No, I don   t remember there ever being a problem.  Any cold showers? Did they run out of water?  (Laughs) Not that I remember.  Was Willard, in your mind, considered to be a popular or prestigious  hall at the time?  No, no.  It wasn   t a stand out? I mean, it wasn   t like,    Oh, everybody wants to  stay in Willard,    because it was the place to be?  Well, we thought it was the place to be, (Laughs) but actually Stout Hall  12  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  was the newest, and most of the sorority pledges all stayed in Stout. And  Murray was, I think, maybe a little older than Willard. I   m not sure, but  we liked Willard Hall because it overlooked Theta Pond and it had  beautiful gardens down in front.  Was it easy to get to and from your classes by being there?  Yes, it was. Actually, when you go back now and see how big the  campus is, you realize how easy it was for us to get to our classes.  And it was close to the Student Union.  Yes, and all those beautiful flower gardens that they had between. And  something else that I really missed after I left, they had a big bell tower  on top of the library, and on the hour, every hour, they would play the  chimes. And then about five o   clock in the evening they would play  music on the tower. It was so pretty to come home in the evenings and  have the music coming from the library tower.  Oh, that   s neat. I hadn   t heard anyone say that. In your mind, what set  Willard apart from other women   s halls in the late 1950s? Was it the  building itself? Was it the people? Was it your activities that you did on  campus?  I think it was the people and the activities. Nobody had a car, I mean,  and there were no highways, freeways getting to Stillwater, so we didn   t  leave on the weekends. We stayed there most of the time, and if  somebody had a car, five or six would climb in the same car because so  few of us had any kind of transportation. So, I don   t know. It just  seemed like we bonded really close because we didn   t have any way to  get anywhere.  So, you had to depend on each other. Do or die.  Yes. Also, a lot of us were very involved in Wesley Foundation, which  was the Methodist Student Center there. And a lot of our friends, we had  that as a basis for our friendship, also. Usually other girls who were in  our group came because they grew up with one of the girls from Wesley  Foundation or they knew someone that was in Wesley Foundation, so  that was really a basis for our group.  Did you stay on campus at any time during the summers, and if you did,  did you stay in the dorm?  No, I didn   t.  13  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Did the dorms close at that time? Were they closed down during the  summers?  I don   t know, but I would imagine it   d have been awfully hot in those  dorms in the summertime because there was no air conditioning.  So, where did you stay when you were in summer school?  I had a little rent house, and I worked in the housing office. I worked  there actually the whole time I was in college after my freshman year. I  typed the letters that went out to the kids who wanted to request a room  on campus. I worked there for     Wow, you were a person to know, then, weren   t you?  I typed the same letter over and over every day so I didn   t even have to  look at the page. I could just type it. But I stayed there and worked one  summer and had a roommate, and we rented a little house.  Was the summer a different time on campus? Did it feel different than it  did in the school time?  Oh, yes, yes, because there were very few of my friends who were there.  Did you go into town much?  Not a whole lot because, like I say, no cars, and if we did, we   d all pile  in a car and go down and get a burger.  Where did you go to get a burger?  Burger Barn, Burger King, I can   t remember exactly, but I remember  they had the best curly fries, their burgers, and then they had those big  old juicy curly fries, and they were all handmade, nothing frozen. So,  that   s usually where we   d go eat.  Now I   m going to talk a little bit about your traditions that you  experienced at Willard. I   m just going to throw some things out and see  if you remember any of these.  Okay.  One is Willard Beach. Do you know where that took place, and could  you tell us a little bit about it?  Yes, it was the roof of the porch. The porch went all the way across the  14  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  front of the dorm, and this was the roof of the porch. All the girls who  lived there in that middle section, their windows opened up onto that  porch, so when we   d want to go sunbathe, we   d climb out their bedroom  windows and lay out there and sunbathe on the roof of that porch. And  that was our beach. (Laughs)  Did most of the women wear two-pieces, or did they were a one-piece?  What was the style back then?  One-piece, I   d say. Yes.  Everyone there wore a one-piece.  Yes.  So, does that mean you did it in the middle of the afternoon or in  between classes?  No, we   d usually do it after class or on the weekend.  What about Christmas traditions? Did you participate in any Christmas  traditions there?  Usually through Wesley Foundation we had a choir, and we would go  around and sing carols at different places. But usually it was with the  Wesley Foundation.  So, you don   t recall anything at Willard that you did? Did you have a  tree?  Well, yes, they had a Christmas tree, and we probably had a party get-together  there. But we were so involved in Wesley Foundation, we did a  lot of our stuff through the Wesley Foundation.  Did Willard participate in any Homecoming events or contests during  the Homecoming time? Did Willard get out there and build a float or     Not that I remember. I don   t remember us having anything.  And what happened when a woman in Willard became engaged? Was  there a particular ceremony? Did they throw her in Theta Pond?  They threw the guys in Theta Pond. We   d hear them splashing. Or when  they got pinned or something. I don   t know if we threw them in the  bathtub, or I don   t remember that we had any kind of     15  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  A candlelight or serenade or anything?  Not that I can remember. It could   ve been, but I don   t remember exactly.  Do you recall anything about the dorm scrapbooks? Do you recall  seeing those?  I do remember them down in the lobby with the different classes, I think,  but I don   t remember much about them.  I wonder if they were filled with pictures by Doc Pruett.  (Laughs) Oh, I   ve got a million pictures that Doc Pruett took. I have a  million pictures.  I think we all do. He was around when I was here.  Oh, gosh, I wonder how long he was here. He was an old man.  Well, he was in the    70s, let me tell you, when I was here. But Doc  Pruett, yes.  We have lots of pictures that he took of us.  What were the resident hall hours when you were on campus?  Freshmen and sophomores had to be in at eight o   clock during the week,  and then we could stay out until twelve thirty, I think, on Friday and  Saturday nights and eleven thirty on Sunday nights. But then when we  got to be juniors and seniors, we could stay out until ten thirty during the  week. We had counselors on every floor that saw that we were in our  room studying.  Did they come in and knock on the doors?  They came and checked to see if we were in our rooms.  Now, if you needed to stay out a little bit later, did you have to ask for  permission, or was it just not permissible at all?  I imagine if you had an exception you could probably ask for  permission. I don   t remember ever doing it, but surely. If you didn   t get  in, like, at twelve thirty, they would start flashing the lights, and if you  didn   t get in in time they would lock the door. Then you had to go to the  house mother, and if you got, like, three marks against you then you had  to go to the dean of women. (Laughs)  16  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Did you know anyone that had to do that?  Not any of our group, I don   t think.  You guys are just too good. Nobody has said that they know anyone that  has done anything like that. You were just a good group of girls.  Well, I   ll tell you, when we were seniors, the very last night, we had not  been locked out one time, so a group of us decided the very last night,  we stayed out in the street until they locked the doors so we could.  (Laughs)  And what happened?  We had to go talk to the dean of women, explain to the house mother.  And what did she say?  I don   t think she said much. I mean, she knew what we had done.  What was going on.  Yes, it was our last night.  Was there a dress code in Willard?  Oh, yes. There was a dress code on campus.  And what was that?  Well, you could not wear pants. You couldn   t wear pants to class. You  couldn   t wear pants down to the cafeteria to eat except, I think, maybe  for breakfast and maybe on Saturday or something, but basically you  couldn   t go to class in pants. And it gets cold in Stillwater.  Everyone did their hair back then in curlers. Did girls come down to eat  in their curlers, or was that allowed? Do you remember?  I don   t remember. I don   t remember. They could have. Maybe like in the  morning or something. I don   t remember anybody coming down in  curlers, but it   s possible that they did.  Was PDA, public display of affection, a serious infraction?  (Laughs) Well, the only time I saw any PDAs was at closing time when  she started flashing the lights because we all had to go places in the  17  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  same car. There would be three couples in a car, and we   d go to a movie  or go to a dance or something, and the only time you had a chance for  that was when he   d walk you to the door. And that   s about the only time  that we ever had any.  But the house mother wasn   t standing out there.  Well, she started flashing her lights, but before that, you could pretty  well hide in the bushes there. (Laughs)  Tell us about your dorm mom. What do you remember about her?  Oh, she was a sweetie. She was a sweetie. We may have been the nicest  bunch, but I didn   t say we were the quietest. And one night we were all  down in mine and Janie   s room, and it was getting late, and we were  really loud. And so Ms. Proctor came down and knocked on the door,  and we were all trying to hide. An ironing board was standing, and we  spilled popcorn everywhere and knocked the ironing board over on Ms.  Proctor. (Laughter) So, she made us all go to our room because we were  too noisy, and that was down in mine and Janie   s room, too, by the way.  Oh, and something else. I   ve got to tell you about my parakeet. I had a  parakeet in the room. His name was Willy. I had that parakeet for maybe  three years, and he was just like everybody   s pet parakeet, and he used  to chew everything up, you know, like the pictures we   d put on our  bulletin boards. All my pictures still have the tops chewed off for Willy.  But one time I came home, and the bedroom window was open, and all  the girls were in there and they were just, oh, they were just mortified.  And they said,    We are so sorry but Willy flew out the window and got  away.    And I went down in the trees looking everywhere for Willy.  They had taken him and put him up on the third floor and hid him, and  finally they confessed that they had my parakeet. (Laughter) But I went  down looking all around Theta Pond for Willy.  Well, does Willy live in a cage or he just had free roam of the     Well, we had a cage, but he didn   t stay there much.  So, Willy was like your third roommate.  Yes. Poor Janie, she had to put up with her pictures being chewed up  and     Was it a mean bird?  No, he wasn   t mean. He was just a regular parakeet.  18  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Did the house mom know that you had Willy?  I guess so.  Because no pets allowed, I would think.  I don   t know, but there was another girl down the hall who had a  parakeet, too, so I guess they allowed parakeets.  I think they were pretty popular in the    50s. Oh, that   s a cute story. I  hadn   t heard that. What were some of the special hall events and  activities that you remember, like dances or     Well, we had dances in the basement pretty regularly, and we had a lot  of dances that were sponsored, like the fraternities would have dances  that we would be invited to or campus dances that would be over at the  Student Union. So, we had several dances there at Willard Hall down in  the basement.  You said the fraternities would have dances. Did the women who were  not in the Greek society that lived in the dorms mingle much with the  Greek men? Was the campus, well, everybody was real friendly? They  just went wherever? It wasn   t a divided situation where the Greeks were  on one side and non-Greeks were on the other?  No, it was never   I mean, we went to lots of Greek parties.  Activities and so forth.  Yes, we did. A lot of the guys that we dated belonged to Farm House  fraternity. That was a fraternity that a lot of the boys belonged to, and  we went to a lot of their dances.  And I guess Elvis Presley   s name has come up.  Oh, Elvis.  So, tell us about Elvis. Was Elvis popular with you? Did you like Elvis?  No, not particularly. He was, I think, maybe a little after me. I was trying  to remember. We went down to see that first movie he was in, and it was  so hysterical. It was supposed to be sad because he died in it or  something, and we were all just laughing our heads off because he was  such a terrible actor. (Laughs)  Did you watch the infamous show when he was on Ed Sullivan?  19  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Oh yes, yes, we had to watch that.  So, you were part of that group that went downstairs and watched that?  Yes.  You talk about some of your special memories. Is there any particular  one maybe? You mentioned Willy and the panty raid.  Well, let   s see. Oh yes, there was one other one, and that   s when we beat  Kansas in a basketball game. Has anyone told you yet about that?  Well, they   ve mentioned that, but let   s hear your take on it.  (Laughs) Okay. Well, you know, basketball was so popular in Stillwater  that you only got tickets for every other game. I didn   t have tickets for  that game, so I had to hunt around and switch with somebody so I could  go to it. And I still remember Hank Iba was our coach, and he was a  great one for stalling the ball, you know. And we   d dribble down, and  we   d stall and stall and stall, and then we   d get a good shot, and then  they   d race down the other end, hit a basket, and then we   d come back  down, and we   d stall and stall and stall. Well, it got down to ten seconds  left in the game, and we were tied with ten seconds. So, Mel Wright,  who was our captain, drove in and shot a basket from the top of the  circle, and it went in and we beat Kansas by two points. And we were  the only team that beat Kansas that year.  Wow.  Wilt Chamberlain was on the team, and he was the longest, tallest,  skinniest kid I ever saw.  So, what happened after you won the game?  Oh, well, everybody sat in there and screamed for about thirty minutes,  and then we went back to our dorms because, you know, we had to be in  by twelve thirty. (Laughter)  Oh, that curfew.  Oh, that curfew. Everybody was so excited, so we all get up, and we   re  all parading through the halls,    We want a walk-out  We want a walk-out      We were all dorm officers. I was a social chairman, and Willene  was, I think, president of the dorm. But, anyway, we weren   t supposed  to be doing something like that. So, we were running around up and  down the halls yelling,    We want a walk-out,    and here comes the house  20  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  mother up the stairs. And, so, Virginia and I run and hide in one of the  rooms, (Laughter) and she knew we were in there, so she stands outside  and gives us this lecture about how we were supposed to be setting the  example for the dorm. (Laughter) But, anyway, we got our walk-out. We  got our walk-out the next day. We didn   t have to go to class.  Wow, that   s incredible. Well, those are some really good memories. Is  there something you remember about any tough times in Willard that  you experienced, a sad occasion or a bad semester?  We did have a sad occasion, and it was through one of our friends at the  Wesley Foundation. We were in a play together that we were putting on  for the Wesley Foundation. We were traveling to other towns and  putting on this play, and she played the marimba. That   s what she did as  a talent, and so she would go as a talent to other towns and perform.  That   s how they made some extra money. And she and a couple other  girls and the associate dean of men were going to perform at some little  town, (I don   t remember which one) and a drunk driver crossed the  highway, and she and the associate dean of men were both killed. It was  very, very tragic for all of us because we were young and healthy, and  we didn   t expect to lose one of our good friends.  She did not live in Willard?  No, she lived at home, but we were very good friends, and it was very  sad. We all tried to sing in the choir at her funeral, and it was very tough.  Yes, that is sad.  But other than that, we had mostly all positives.  Was there diversity in Willard? Did you have any ethnic or international  students that lived in the dorms the same time you did?  Not that I can remember. I know we had one black girl who was in the  Wesley Foundation who joined the Wesley Foundation maybe my junior  year or something, but we just had the one black girl, and that basically  was it.  Were you active in the Willard or OSU women   s resident hall  associations? Did you hold a hall or floor position? I think you just  mentioned you did.  Yes, I was a social chairman.  What did you do in that capacity?  21  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Oh, I planned all these dances. (Laughter) And we had lots of social  activities, and I would work with the social chairman from the other  dorms and things, and we had dances.  How often did you have dances?  Oh, maybe once a week, once a month.  And did you ever co-sponsor one with another dormitory?  Well, we had what was called Independents, and then we had the  Greeks, and I know the Independents all had a dance over at the Student  Union. I probably was involved in that, but I don   t remember exactly.  And you did say you worked, and you worked where?  In the housing office.  And you worked there all three years?  Yes.  Do you remember how much you were paid?  Yes, seventy-five cents an hour. (Laughs)  That   s a lot of money back then, really. When Willard was converted to  administrative use, was there some controversy? Were some of the  Willard alum unhappy about that or did they just     No, we weren   t. We weren   t unhappy about it at all. We did want to  make a plaque. Well, actually, we all got together and donated, and  where our rooms were, we made it at a memorial for two of our friends  who had died of cancer. And they put some furniture there and a plaque  on the wall and dedicated that area where we used to all be.  I   ll have to go up there and look.  Yes, it   s on the wall.  What do you think about the new resident hall apartments and suites on  the OSU campus? Have you seen any of them?  Last year we came back for Homecoming, and we had to stay in one of  the dorms, one of the high-rises, and it was not very good. It wasn   t as  comfortable as ours were. There was no lavatory in the room, and it was  22  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  cold, and we couldn   t turn the air conditioner off so we had to get some  duct tape and tape up the vents so we wouldn   t freeze to death. (Laughs)  But it was fun.  Well, can you tell us a little bit of why the WOW women have stayed so  close through the years and continue to have reunions even fifty years  later? It   s incredible.  Well, we were such good friends in school. We all have so much in  common. Most of us were from small towns or farms or ranches, and we  were also very active in the Wesley Foundation, and that was a basis for  it. But every year at Christmas we would make the effort to send  Christmas cards and pictures, keep in touch that way. And we just  followed each other as our children grew. We   d have our reunions, and  our kids would be there. It was just a very close bunch. But I can say  probably Wesley Foundation was the basis for a lot of it because we had  that basis that we were all     It   s really incredible. I mean, fifty years later you all are still getting  together.  Well, we were all very active in our church and church work, and we  had a lot in common.  How many reunions have you participated in and where?  Well, let   s see. The first one I think maybe might have been ten years  after, and that was at  Quartz Mountain , but all of us came back for that,  and our kids were all really young, and we had a really good time. And  then the next one we met at one of the lodges up at Lake Eufaula, and  that was a lot of fun. In fact, we had two reunions up there. And then we  had a reunion at Virginia   s house in southern Colorado. We stayed in a  couple of lodges there about seven or eight years ago, I guess.  What do you do when you all get together?  Oh, we just laugh and look at pictures and gab. I mean, it   s just a riot.  It   s a riot. (Laughs)  When did you graduate?  I finished in    58.  What was your major again?  Business education.  23  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  So, you weren   t in home ec.  No, I wasn   t in home ec. (Laughs)  Everyone   s been in home ec.  I used to come home with my statistics notebook and look over at Janie,  and she   d be sitting there writing out the alphabet. (Laughter) I said,    Is  that the hardest class you have?     Can you share some highlights of your life after leaving OSU, and where  are you living now?  All right. When I first finished college I moved to Bartlesville and  worked for Phillips Petroleum. And then a couple of my friends who  graduated a year behind me, we decided we were going to be a little  more adventurous, so we moved to Denver and we rented an apartment  in Denver. There were three of us. We stayed in Denver or married. We  married roommates, and both of my oldest two children were born in  Denver. And then we moved back to Texas, and I   ve lived in Texas ever  since then. Lived in Denton about forty years.  Do you get back to Stillwater very much? Have you come back often to  Homecoming or football games?  Not real often. I did come back to an OU-Oklahoma State game when  Barry Sanders was our running back. I came back to one of those games,  and we almost beat OU that year. I think we lost by three points. But not  other than that, unless it   s something special like this.  Well, before we close, I   m just going to ask you a few general OSU  experience questions. Do you have any particular professors or classes  that stand out to you or that influenced you the most?  I remember one time when I was doing my student teaching. It was a  typing class, and I was supposed to give a demonstration on how to  thread a ribbon through a typewriter. (Laughs) I mean, like they do that  anymore. But I had all my props and everything, and I got up and  demonstrated to the class how you put the ribbon through and  everything, and after I finished, my teacher said,    That was a very good  job.    And I still remember her complimenting me on it. It meant a lot to  me.  You don   t remember her name?  No, sorry.  24  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Were there any student traditions or other activities of your era that  really stand out to you?  I think Theta Pond. We used to go from the Wesley Foundation over and  walk around Theta Pond. It was a beautiful, beautiful area around there.  Sitting up there in our room and watching the boys being thrown in the  pond when they got pinned or engaged, and being able to walk through  the gardens there with all the pretty flowers. And, like I say, the bells  tolling on the hour and then playing the music in the evening.  President Willham was president during your time at OSU. Do you  remember anything about him or anything that stands out about him as  far as being president?  I   m afraid not. We just had a president. That   s all I know. (Laughs)  You were on campus when OSU changed its name from Oklahoma  A M.  I was the first graduate, yes.  How do you feel the students reacted to those changes?  It was hard for us at first because we had been Aggies for three years. It  was our senior year that they changed it, so we had a little bit of  difficulty. We didn   t want to give up the Aggies, but we did.  Do you have anything else you   d like to share with us about OSU or  Willard? Any thoughts that we haven   t covered that on your way up here  from Texas that you thought about that you would really like to tell us?  Well, I can remember when I came to Stillwater, I had come from a  small town, and then we had moved out to the ranch. I can just  remember how accepting and how friendly the students were. We had a  dance over at the Student Union that was called   I can   t remember  exactly, but it was for new students to go to this dance. I remember  going over and how friendly everybody was and how nice. And I can  remember going and getting started in the Wesley Foundation and the  head of the Wesley Foundation. They had a man who was head of it, and  he came up to me after a vespers service one evening and asked me if I  wanted to be on the committee of Wesley Foundation. That   s what got  me started. I just felt so accepted, you know.  So, it   s a feeling that hasn   t left you?  It still hasn   t, and it never will leave me. Never. It   s just a special,  25  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  Bomar  Ahrberg  special place.  Well, Joni, I just want to thank you very much for participating in our  interview. It   s been a pleasure to meet you and hear your stories. You  have such great humor, and I know if we turned the camera off you  could probably tell us a few more.  (Laughs) I probably could   Thank you very much for joining us today. Before we leave, though, let  me ask you one more question.  Okay, sure.  Did you know a gentleman by the name of Bill Oden?  Bill Oden. He was in the Wesley Foundation. Bill Oden. I   m trying to  put a face with the name. I know the name. Tall, slender. Bill Oden. He  was president of Wesley Foundation my freshman year. Was he a Sigma  Chi? I think he was president of Sigma Chi, as well.  So, the Wesley Foundation had both men and women in their group. It  was co-ed.  Oh, yes. Greeks and Independents.  Okay. Thank you very much.  All right, thank you.  I appreciate it, Joni.  -------  -------
