 Finchum Today is September 9, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma State University. Today I am in Canton, Oklahoma, which is in Blaine County, and this is a part of our Cowboy in Every County project. And I am speaking with Keith Long, a 1965 graduate of Oklahoma State. Thank you for having me today.  Long That   s fine, glad that you could come.  Finchum Let   s begin with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Long I was actually born in Fairview, Oklahoma, in 1942, October the 22nd.  Finchum At home or in the hospital?  Long I was in the hospital. My folks actually lived west of Canton. But the hospital was in Fairview.  Finchum And that   s in     Long Major County.  Finchum    Major County. Not too far from here though?  Long Right.  Finchum Twenty miles or so.  Long About eighteen miles from here.  Finchum Were you an only child?  Long No, there was two brothers and a sister all older than me. 5  Finchum You   re the baby.  Long Yes.  Finchum Okay, and what did your parents do for a living?  Long At the time they were farmers.  Finchum In    42   so your dad wouldn   t have been in World War II.  Long No, he wasn   t. He missed it.  Finchum Being a farmer he might   ve missed it anyway.  Long Yeah, and when I was about five years old   it was before that. Not too long after I was born, the government started on the lake project out here. They bought my dad   s farm and uncles    farms that were in the riverbed, I guess you would call. We moved to Longdale, which is just north of here. Then when I was five years old my dad bought the drugstore down here at Canton. We moved down here.  Finchum What was it called? The drugstore?  Long Canton Drug.  Finchum So your home place was flooded? It   s under the lake now?  Long Yes. In fact, my dad took the government to the Supreme Court, because he didn   t feel he was getting enough money and got more money. Then he got out of farming, went to the drugstore business, because my oldest brother became a pharmacist. He eventually took over the drugstore.  Finchum Kind of worked out then, didn   t it? So the lake was probably a CCC project?  Long I   m not sure. I don   t know whether it was the CCC or not. Anyway, they started on the lake, bought the land up, and World War II hit and they quit working on it for a few years, until after the war. Then they resumed building the dam then.  Finchum Did they get to move their home? I mean actually physically move it?  Long No. But the house that they was living in was not flooded. That area was not flooded, but the farmland was.  Finchum Just the lower, river bottom as they call it. 6  Long Yeah, river bottom land. (Laughs) That   s what I was trying to think of a while ago.  Finchum So where did you go to elementary school?  Long My two brothers went all the time to Longdale and graduated. My oldest brother graduated up there. My other brother, who   s a little younger, he went to Longdale for eleven years. We moved down here and he completed his twelfth year down here. My sister, of course, started down here when she was about fourth grade or something. I started down here the first grade, so I went the whole time down at Canton.  Finchum Was it in one building or did they have two? Like elementary and     Long It was all one building at that time.  Finchum About how many were in your class?  Long I   m going to guess around twenty-some.  Finchum So the population in town would   ve been     Long The population was greater than it is now.  Finchum Was it?  Long We had close to, I think, 900. Now we   re down to 600, as far as city population goes.  Finchum In your childhood what was the primary economic base for the town?  Long Farming and U.S. Gypsum Plant over at Southern, six miles east of here.  Finchum And then today?  Long Same thing. We have the gypsum plant still in business over there, hiring, I don   t know, a couple hundred or so. Then, I guess, still farming.  Finchum Any tourists?  Long The lake, yes, brings in tourists.  Finchum Some anyway.  7  Long Yeah, I don   t know just how much. You can tell a difference because of the camping area. We had a tornado go through here a few years ago and they lost a lot of the campsites, I guess, the trees, mature trees and everything. That got all taken out, so it   s starting over out there now. Built new pads for the campsites and all that so tourist business has picked back up again.  Finchum I noticed a few things related to oil, coming into town.  Long Yes, we don   t here at Canton have many oilfield yards and stuff, the equipment and stuff. But the wind turbines have come in and provided a lot of jobs.  Finchum I noticed those, too. What   s the main thing that   s farmed, wheat? Or is it something else?  Long Wheat. That   s the main thing. There   s some have switched to canola, growing canola. You get a little bit of feed, but it   s mostly wheat and cattle.  Finchum So in the first through twelfth you were here. I noticed there was a theater in town. Was it alive and functioning when you were younger?  Long Yeah     Finchum The Grand?  Long    go to the show for ten cents, the younger kids. I think I was in, probably, high school when it closed down. Now it has been modernized, I guess you   d call it. They   ve changed the seats in it. We   ve got a group, the Grand Arts Council that have fixed it up and repaired the building. The only problem is we don   t have the people to direct. Like a theatre group to put on plays or anything. So there   s really not many functions in the theater.  Finchum At least it   s still standing.  Long Yeah, they keep it up.  Finchum So in elementary school and then into high school did you have a favorite subject?  Long Science. I didn   t really like school, (laughs) but yeah, I liked science.  Finchum How would you get there? Was it close enough to walk or did you ride a bus?  Long I had a long ways to go, I had one block.  8  Finchum So you walked. (Laughter) Would you get to go home for lunch or pack it?  Long We usually went home for lunch.  Finchum In high school were you involved with FFA or 4-H?  Long No, I didn   t. I participated in band, and we had our own science club, not related to school, that met at my house. But I wasn   t involved in the   oh, a little bit of sports, but not too much.  Finchum What instrument did you play in the band?  Long I started off with a cornet and switched to baritone, later.  Finchum Since they had a band they had enough students for football?  Long Yes, we had twelve-man teams. Eleven-man teams, I   m sorry. We had some pretty good teams back in those days.  Finchum Who was your primary rival?  Long Okeene I suppose.  Finchum Okeene, okay. That   s still in the same county.  Long Yes, just east of here eighteen miles.  Finchum In high school were you planning to go to college? Was it expected?  Long I never thought of anything different than going to college. I don   t know why. I wasn   t the brightest student because like I say I didn   t really like school. I just had my mind set that I would go to OSU.  Finchum Had your parents gone to college?  Long No.  Finchum But your older brother had, the one who was a pharmacist?  Long He was a pharmacist. My other brother, he took up accounting. My sister, she didn   t go to college. She just got married.  Finchum Did your two older brothers happen to go to OSU?  9  Long No. Well I take that back. My oldest brother, who become a pharmacist, went the first year or two to OSU and then switched to Weatherford and took up pharmacy.  Finchum So would you have visited him while he was there at OSU?  Long Not that I remember.  Finchum I   m just seeing if that played into your thinking of going there.  Long No, I don   t know. I just assumed I   d go there. I don   t think any other school in Oklahoma has an entomology department. I don   t know. I don   t think OU has an entomology department.  Finchum Probably not since OSU   s the land grant, and mostly ag.  Long So that   s why I went.  Finchum That was your major?  Long Yes.  Finchum Was it?  Long To start with.  Finchum You switched?  Long I went to college twice.  Finchum Okay, let   s talk a little bit about that then.  Long I got a degree in entomology, got out. Ran a pet shop for a while. Got drafted into the Army, went into the Army, spent a year in Vietnam, came back and went back to OSU. I didn   t quite get a degree in horticulture. I lacked a three-hour course that I couldn   t ever take. I would   ve got a degree, but I lacked three hours. I decided not to stay and do that.  Finchum A second bachelor   s or a masters?  Long Bachelor   s.  Finchum A second bachelor   s. So the    65 was when you got your first one?  Long Yes.  10  Finchum And then you came back after using the GI Bill when you came back.  Long They gave me twenty-four months of school.  Finchum Well shoot, we should figure out some way to get those three hours, not that it matters now.  Judy He was talking about his science club in high school. They were the first group in Canton High School to even have a science club, and he started all of that and went to the science contests and stuff.  Long Me and this other guy went to the, what do you call it, science fair? We did it on our own and went to state with an insect collection.  Finchum Okay, but you didn   t like science in school.  Long (Laughs) I just didn   t like school. But if she had let me, I   d probably kept going and still be going. She made me get out and get a job. (Laughter)  Finchum Your first job was with a pet store? A pet shop you said?  Long Yes.  Finchum Where was that?  Long Enid. I had worked part-time in a pet shop over at Stillwater. When I got out I decided to put in a pet shop.  Finchum Now they   re hard to find, aren   t they?  Long We had that for a year and I got drafted and so we sold it.  Finchum We should back up and say that the voice you heard a minute ago was Judy, right?  Long Yeah, that   s her name. That   s my wife...  Finchum That   s your wife.  Long    of fifty-three years.  Judy Fifty-three years.  Finchum So you met in high school?  Long Yes. 11  Judy We   ve known each other forever. (Laughter)  Finchum So you got married in    60   ?  Long In    63.  Finchum Before you got drafted.  Long Yes.  Finchum But before you graduated from OSU too.  Long I was still going to college.  Finchum So Judy, you would   ve moved down there with him to Stillwater at that time.  Judy I worked at Stillwater National Bank. I worked for the college for a while, doing the magazine. At that time Keith, like he said, he was going on to college. That was our plans. I wanted him to be a college professor. We loved OSU.  Finchum Where did you live when you first went? Before you got married, where did you live on campus?  Long Cordell Hall. Is it still there?  Finchum Barely, it   s going to come down sometime in the next year or so.  Long I lived there three years.  Finchum Okay, and then when you got married?  Long Then we lived over by the fire station, on Ramsey I think it was. Washington   no, that   s where the business was. The second time we was over there we ran a shop called Fads and Favors on Washington. Isn   t that the Strip?  Finchum Yes.  Long I managed that as I was going to school, for a guy. We did screen-printed t-shirts and sold favors to the sororities and fraternities for their parties.  Finchum That kept you pretty busy.  Long Yeah. 12  Judy Then I went back to work for Stillwater National Bank and did his bookkeeping for him.  Finchum Did you have a favorite professor while you were there?  Long Probably Dr. Brian. He was an entomology professor.  Finchum Getting a degree, this will show my ignorance, with insects you could   ve gotten a job as a cooperative extension person?  Long Yes.  Finchum With insects? Doing insect stuff.  Long I found that after all this time with entomology that the main jobs are finding ways to kill insects. (Laughs) And that didn   t interest me too much. I don   t know whether it was a waste of time, but I   ve identified a lot of insects for people and this and that. I just haven   t worked in the entomology field.  Finchum When you came back the second time and almost finished, then what did you do after that?  Judy We moved back...  Long    back here, didn   t we? Opened up a flower shop.  Judy And nursery.  Long And nursery. Dealt with plants, and flowers, and we eventually put a flower shop in at Fairview. Then we got out of that, and I went in the oil and gas business.  Finchum What a switch. What did you do for that?  Long I started out working out in the field as a gas line operator for a few years. Then they put me to work in the office. Had a local office, I guess you   d call it gas control. Then the company got bought out. Went to work for Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG). I worked at various places, Tulsa, El Reno, ended up in Oklahoma City, downtown, working in the ONG office down there. And retired from there.  Finchum Then came back here at that time?  Long Yes. I kept an apartment in Oklahoma City, because we didn   t want to move to the city. Judy and the kids stayed here. 13  Judy We used it as a townhouse. We loved it. (Laughs)  Long I kept the apartment and lived out here.  Finchum So to get from here to Oklahoma City takes about?  Long Hour and a half.  Finchum That   s not too bad.  Long I didn   t   like I say, I kept an apartment and went back and forth.  Finchum When did you retire?  Long Probably seven or eight years ago. I   m guessing about eight years ago.  Judy Keith probably didn   t tell you that he was president of the Entomology Club at Stillwater at OSU. Did you?  Long No. Served on the student council.  Finchum Was that an elected, the student council?  Long Yeah, College of Agriculture council.  Finchum So you just didn   t go to class, you were involved with other things?  Judy He was in the ROTC band. That   s why we came back.  Long I didn   t take the four years of ROTC.  Finchum Was it required at that time?  Long Two years was required.  Finchum So at the end of that were you commissioned? No, probably not...  Long No you had to take four years to get commissioned. I didn   t really plan on going to the service. (Laughs)  Finchum So you would   ve had classes in the Armory?  Long Yes.  14  Finchum It   s Architecture now. They had classes in there? Someone said they had a pool in the bottom of that. Do you remember that?  Long No. I don   t    remember.  Finchum I don   t know. Two or three other people have said that, but I don   t know for sure. So two years in and you played the     Long Baritone.  Finchum That kept you busy too. What would you do for fun? If you were doing activities such as that, what would you do? Would you go to dances or football games or     Long Came home on weekends to see her. (Laughs)  Finchum That counts.  Judy But we went to the games.  Long We went to some games. I got acquainted, of course, with the guys in the dorm. We   d go out on the weekends and stuff, play golf at the course up north of Stillwater.  Judy Of course money was tight, so the boys would get up real early. We   re talking four o   clock in the morning, wasn   t it?  Long We   d go out and play a round of golf before they ever opened up that way we didn   t have to pay. (Laughter)  Finchum Just daylight enough to find your ball, huh?  Judy We always wondered why he didn   t go professional, because he was an excellent golfer. They all loved     Long And we also   bunch of us had a bowling league. We bowled over there.  Finchum At the Student Union?  Long Sometimes at the Student Union. Then there was a bowling alley on the north side of Stillwater.  Finchum It   s still there. The one in the Student Union   s not though, it   s gone.  Long I haven   t been in the Union in a long time. We haven   t made it to as many ballgames as I   d like to. 15  Judy Keith has given up a lot for our family. He doesn   t talk about it, but both of our children are adopted and when we adopted Damon, he   s forty-one, and he was a baby. We   ve gained   a lot of his decisions have been made so that Damon and our daughter could have a better life.  Finchum That   s to be commended.  Judy He was one of the first for Oklahoma Natural Gas, he opened up their office downtown, for gas control. They even have a plaque with his name and stuff on it for him. (Laughs) See I   m telling off on him.  Finchum That   s okay.  Judy But he moved from Tulsa to ONG  in Oklahoma City  so that they could   they had never had a gas control like he set up for them there.  Long Tulsa, that was a pretty good drive.  Finchum From here it would be. Well at college had you had accounting classes or bookkeeping in order to be able to know how to do all that?  Long No.  Finchum Just taught yourself and some common sense in there.  Long Yeah, I guess.  Finchum That   s a long way from insects.  Long I kind of got out of the entomology.  Judy Tell her what your plan was though, why you went in to entomology and what we were going to do?  Long Collect insects from around the world. (Laughs) I kind of liked identifying insects, but I didn   t like just studying ways to kill them. When I was going to college I worked for a professor, Dr. Brian, in what was called the Bughouse. It was out west of the campus. You know when you come into Stillwater there were some big barns? North of that was what was called the insectary, the Bughouse.  Finchum I haven   t heard anyone talk about it, okay.  Long I guess it   s probably still there     16  Finchum It may be, I   ll have to check.  Long    but we raised insects.  Finchum Like what kind?  Long The big one that I worked on was cotton boll worms. Dr. Brian had a, I think, Cotton Growers Organization supplied him with money, funds, to do research on ways to kill the boll worm because that was a major problem with the cotton growers. I worked for him out there growing   we   d catch the moths, they   d lay the eggs in these containers, we   d take the little worms and we made an artificial food. We mixed it up ourselves. Mixed the food up, raised these boll worms up, and then just put a minute amount of insecticide on the worm to see the effects. I got to growing other insects on this artificial food, wrote up a paper and presented it to the Oklahoma Academy of Sciences. I liked that part. Also while I was there I was checking a field of cotton for another professor. I   d write down all the insects that I found in the cotton field. Check like one hundred plants and write down what all I found.  Finchum How many would you normally find in that?  Long Quite a few. (Laughs)  Finchum Not just aphids?  Long No.  Finchum That   s the extent of my  knowledge .  Long So we had a good time. Didn   t we, Judy?  Judy Uh-hmm.  Finchum Did they do anything with the butterflies? They   ve started the milkweed program again to get     Long Monarchs. Monarchs are   I just don   t see hardly any of them anymore. That   s a shame. I don   t grow any milkweed, but I need to and this is one of my plans for next year is getting some seed. We   ve got seven acres here.  Finchum You   ve got some room then.  Long The river goes right through here. We   ve got plenty of room to grow some. Right now we don   t have anything back there that   s livestock. We did have an old horse that finally died. 17  Judy The grandkids    pony, Bullseye.  Long We   ve had cattle and stuff like that. Right now we don   t have anything.  Finchum Just dabbled in it?  Long Uh-hmm.  Judy When we moved back to Canton, Keith has been president of the school board here at Canton, president of the     Long Chamber of Commerce.  Judy    Chamber of Commerce. He has been town mayor a couple of times. On the town board. So he   s not     Finchum Everybody knows your face then.  Long I   ve slowed down.  Finchum A little bit maybe?  Judy He   s been diagnosed with Parkinson   s.  Long Thanks to Vietnam.  Finchum It   s related to that?  Long Agent Orange.  Finchum Is it?  Long They say might of caused it.  Finchum And you were over there from     Judy Sixty-seven?  Long Sixty-eight, sixty-nine. Something like that. I don   t know for sure.  Judy He was in Officer Candidate School, and they were killing off the fire direction controls so much that they walked in and took his whole class from officer school and sent them to Vietnam.  Finchum What branch of the military? 18  Long Artillery. Army.  Finchum Army. So you saw a little combat.  Long I should   ve went into armor because we didn   t use tanks over there. (Laughter) I would never had gone.  Finchum And how long were you over there?  Long A year. Just served one term.  Finchum And then came back.  Long I got an early out to go back to school. I was actually only in the service about     Judy Two and a half. They called it two and a half years.  Long No, about twenty-two months instead of twenty-four months. I got out early to start, return back, you know when school started in the second semester.  Finchum How did you get to Vietnam? On a plane or by boat?  Long A plane.  Finchum A plane?  Long Yes.  Finchum Then how did you get back?  Long Plane.  Finchum That was a pretty tough year?  Long It wasn   t much fun, quite an experience though.  Finchum During that time period was when   no, maybe he   d already   President Kennedy was killed somewhere during that part of the    60s, wasn   t it?  Judy It was in    63. It was the year     Finchum So it was before.  Judy    we got married. 19  Finchum Okay.  Judy Because we had just   we were moving to Stillwater. I had just started working at the bank the morning that he was   the day that he was killed. That   s why I can always remember that.  Finchum So for the most part you consider Canton home? This is home?  Long Yes. Been here a long time.  Judy Keith   s parents farmed, and they had the drugstore and the pharmacy here in Canton. That was why Keith was able to have such a science club, because through the pharmacy he could order     Long    different chemicals.  Judy I think it   d be interesting for you to tell about you and Joe, with how you traded with the Oklahoma City Zoo.  Long I was always a snake collector.  Judy (Laughs) I knew that would bring the eyebrows up   Finchum Alive or dead?  Long Besides collecting insects I collected snakes. This friend of ours lived here and he also   basically him and I   s the ones who went to the science fair with our insect collection. And we collected snakes together.  Judy Both of their parents, the other boy that is good friends, his dad was a banker. Keith   s folks had the drugstore. They were busy people. The two boys were allowed to do just about whatever and keeping snakes in the home. (Laughs)  Long We found this place in Florida where we could order boa constrictors. Back then you didn   t go to the pet shop and get a snake. So we ordered these six-foot boa constrictors. Eighteen dollars was all they cost. We kept them and then we got to collecting native snakes. We become acquainted with Bob Jenni down at the Oklahoma City Zoo. He was the reptile man down there. We did some trading with him. We   d take him a bunch of native snakes and trade them for exotic snakes.  Finchum I   m assuming you never got bit?  20  Long Not by a poisonous one. I   ve been bit by many snakes, but nothing poisonous.  Finchum Not enough to keep you from doing it?  Long No. Snake bites aren   t bad except when they strike, you have a tendency to jerk your hand back. That rips it. But you wash it out and usually don   t get an infection. Like I say, I   ve handled rattlesnakes, but I   ve never been bitten by one.  Finchum Did your parents know you were getting these boas?  Long Yes.  Finchum They gave their blessing?  Long Yeah. (Laughs) Really my folks didn   t seem to mind too much. I kept them on the back porch and in the basement. In fact, I never did tell them, but I had two rattlesnakes get loose in the basement and I never did find them.  Finchum (Laughter) Maybe it   s good you didn   t tell them.  Long I didn   t want to tell them. (Laughs) My mother one time got me out of bed, there was a snake crawling across the dining room floor. She opened the broiler in the stove and there was one in there. So somehow they was getting from the basement to the house.  Finchum Getting loose, getting out of however you had them   cages or boxes.  Long Apparently the cages wasn   t too good.  Finchum You needed a cat in the house to take care of that.  Long Yeah. (Laughter)  Finchum Have you been to the Okeene Rattlesnake Festival?  Long Yes. I   ve never participated too much in it as far as   but we   ve gone several times. I   ve hunted snakes over there before. Not anymore though.  Judy No, not the way we move anymore. (Laughs)  Finchum So your idea of afternoon fun on a Saturday or Sunday growing up was going out to look for snakes?  21  Long Snakes and bugs. In fact, Grandma helped some. We   d go out at night, hang a sheet in the trees, put a bright light on it, and attract the insects to it.  Finchum And then see how many different kinds you had?  Judy Keith   s allowed me   I was always going to be a nurse. So this was my plan, that I was going to be a missionary nurse and he was going to collect the bugs and reptiles and stuff, and we were going to South America or somewhere and do that. That was the plan. In our school, and you know back then the girls were either supposed to get married or they weren   t supposed to be in science or any of this stuff. I wanted to take biology and our principal wouldn   t allow it. My parents had to come to school, and I and one other girl was allowed to take biology. Can you imagine that? Keith was in the class and that   s how we really got   we found we had a lot in common. (Laughter)  Finchum That would   ve been in the late    50s?  Long Yes.  Finchum When that was   interesting that they wouldn   t let you take     Judy They thought we wanted to take it because all the boys were taking it. (Laughter) I said    No, I want to dissect the frog and do all the fun stuff.     Finchum Being a nurse, you would think that that would be common sense. Speaking of bugs, this is off topic, but on my mailbox this week was a walking stick. I hadn   t seen one in thirty years.  Judy Tell her what was on our back deck yesterday.  Long Praying mantis.  Finchum Now I haven   t seen one of those in about thirty years. I don   t know, is Oklahoma in a migratory     Long I don   t know.  Finchum    this time of year?  Long I don   t hunt insects anymore, but I hadn   t really thought about it. But I haven   t seen a walking stick in a long time. Praying mantis   s I do, but walking sticks I don   t. We moved here a little over thirty years ago to this house. The soil is sandy. We   ve always had a lot of horny toads. We don   t have them anymore. I haven   t seen one in years.  22  Finchum The drought, maybe?  Long They say that it might be because people treat the ant dens. Horny toads feed mostly on ants. Anytime I see a red ant den, I treat it. We   ve got a lot of little black ants, but I try not to spray anything that will kill something like horny toads. They   re really thinned out. Where   d we see one in the road? Oh, it was up by the lake. There was one down this white rock road. We think we seen a horny toad in the road. If so, that   s the first one I   ve seen in quite a while.  Finchum You didn   t stop the car and get it?  Long No. I got on to her for not stopping.  Judy You don   t know how many times we   ve stopped for things. (Laughter)  Long We catch turtles and bring them home and turn them loose.  Judy He brings them here and marks them so he can know which turtles     Finchum If they come back?  Judy Yes, and they do.  Long I   ve seen this one three times this year. I catch snakes, or used to, I   d bring them home and turn them loose. (Laughs) She doesn   t like snakes.  Judy I have tolerated them for fifty-three years. (Laughter) The neighbors call if they have a snake. A friend of mine had a snake in her house. They call for the snake man to come.  Finchum Do you have a beehive?  Long No. I don   t mess with bees. (Laughs)  Finchum They   re considered an insect, so not those.  Long I don   t   we need bees, but I don   t really like them. Kind of like spiders. I got bit three times on the back by a brown recluse, and I haven   t liked spiders since. (Laughs)  Finchum While you were at OSU did you have any of these in your room? Any of your snakes or collections or whatever in your room.  Long No, I didn   t.  23  Judy Yes, you had your bugs.  Long I had a bug collection.  Finchum Were they alive or dead when you say    bug collection?     Long Dead.  Judy His roommate insisted on some of it.  Long I took them, mounted them a certain way.  Finchum Not just butterflies? All kinds of bugs?  Long All kinds.  Judy Until a few maybe two years, because they finally deteriorated, we couldn   t keep him from it. He had a collection of   those big ones that you     Long From South America.  Judy    from South America. The horned beetles and all of those. He donated a lot of his insect collections to our school.  Finchum Had you gotten those yourself or just ordered them?  Long The ones from South American I ordered.  Finchum If you travel     Long I haven   t been down there.  Finchum Have you traveled around the states and collected bugs as you went?  Long Yes. I even got some in Vietnam. The only way I could get them home was to put them in alcohol. It   s kind of hard to mount an insect after it   s been in alcohol.  Judy I received several packages that everybody thought he was sending me something nice from Vietnam. They didn   t realize, and when I opened them there was all the insects, and snakes, and things that he had brought together and sent home in his packages.  Long It was hard to get something to even mail them in. Sent you some silk though.  24  Judy Yes, you did do that.  Finchum Did you eat some of these too? I mean some people like different insects.  Long No, I   m not an insect eater. (Laughs)  Finchum You hear about them, you know chocolate covered grasshoppers or such. No? You just wanted to figure out what they were.  Long Yeah.  Finchum If you   d gone on for a PhD, you would   ve taught about bugs and snakes, insects?  Long Probably. That   s what I should   ve done was become a professor.  Finchum You   d still have to deal with killing them, I guess. Then you would be helping this mosquito...  Long Mosquito problem?  Finchum Yeah.  Judy He   s still interested in all of it. He always will be, I   m sure.  Finchum When they made the lake that would   ve brought in some different types of things to the area, too, as far as insects and such, wouldn   t it?  Long Uh-hmm. We can show you something that we found at the lake. Want to get the tooth?  Judy Where   s it at? Can I reach it?  Long In the cabinet drawer. In a stone basin out there just below the dam I found a mastodon tooth when I was in high school. I sent it to   my principal up here at the time, he gave me the address and stuff of the museum down at OU. I sent it down there to see what it was. It   s out of a mastodon.  Finchum And they sent it back?  Long Sent it back. People were surprised that I got it back from them. (Laughs) You find it?  Judy Yes, I just have trouble reaching it.  Finchum Neat  Wow. 25  Judy This is new.  Long I don   t know what it is.  Judy    that you bought.  Long Looks like petrified wood.  Judy Most homes, ours has bugs, insects. We still are involved.  Finchum That   s neat. You wonder where the rest of him is. The lake had some major impact on the town, too, I guess from the get-go, didn   t it? Then Oklahoma City   s taken some of the water from it. That   s caused some     Long When they built the lake, it was built for irrigation and flood control. Not for recreation. Over the years it got changed to recreation but at the time, the town of Enid had the rights to so much water out of it, Canton Lake. Enid sold it to Oklahoma City, their rights. I don   t know, they got so many acre feet of water, so they can take it at any time.  Finchum The town can   t do anything about it?  Long We have no control.  Judy Would you rather he hold it? (Holding preserved snake)  Finchum What is it?  Long A little bull snake.  Finchum I don   t think I could stand having it in my house live. (Laughter)  Judy Our youth minister   s wife has a little girl, she   s a little over a year just barely. He had it on top of the TV sitting on the cabinet there. She kept going to it, and her mother said    Oh, this is it     I don   t think I   m going to get to watch her anymore. (Laughter)  Finchum It   s good that someone doesn   t have any problems with it, but not me. We interviewed two eighty-year-olds that had been doing the rattlesnake, Okeene Rattlesnake thing, for fifty years. My colleague was brave enough to go in the pit. Not me. I   m just fine watching from the outside. I wasn   t expecting the noise from that many rattlers. It was loud.  Long You didn   t get in the pit with them?  26  Finchum No, no, no. I took pictures of her in the pit. On the sides of that building they have pictures of people where they   ve gotten bitten.  Long You can join the White Fang Club, they call it, if you get bit.  Finchum I think I   ll pass on that. (Laughter)  Long Somebody got bit just the other day, Felder?  Judy Tony Felder, Anthony Felder at Okeene.  Finchum He   s who we interviewed.  Long Anthony?  Finchum Yeah, he was supposed to be giving that up.  Long I think it was his boy that got bit     Judy I think it   s his son     Long ...the other day.  Judy    maybe that got bit.  Long I thought this was quite a find.  Finchum It is quite a find.  Long As far as I know they   ve never found any other out there.  Finchum So it was washed down the river or who knows how it came to be there.  Long It was just right below the dam.  Finchum I   m surprised that the archaeologists weren   t out swarming the place digging around to see if they could find more.  Long I know.  Judy Where the dam is built his parents had two farms there. They were still herding cattle when the water started building up. So probably it had been covered with water.  Long I can   t read this tag anymore.  27  Judy That was one that     Long Looks like petrified wood.  Finchum Do you remember graduation day from OSU?  Long Barely.  Finchum Was it in the arena or in the football field?  Long Football field.  Finchum Football stadium. Did your parents come?  Long Parents and brothers. They all came.  Finchum Everybody.  Long When did we graduate?  Judy You graduated actually in     Long We got out in January. I went four and a half years to graduate. I would   ve finished up in January, right?  Finchum Right.  Long When did we have graduation?  Judy You had graduation in the spring.  Finchum It wouldn   t have been outside if it was in January. So they may have just done it once a year at that time. Everybody came back and walked.  Judy They had it in the spring, at the end.  Long We had to go back over there for graduation. Been too long ago. (Laughs)  Judy It hasn   t been too long ago, but I don   t know where we put it. We have a picture with your mom, and dad, and Cletus, and Max, and us. We were laughing about the hats we all wore and the gloves.  Finchum That was the thing to do.  Judy We had a reception at Cordell Hall.  28  Long She remembers more than I do about it. (Laughs) I was just glad to graduate.  Finchum Did you spend much time in the library?  Long Yes, I did. A lot of time.  Finchum Good answer. Did you have a favorite spot?  Long I don   t remember where it was, what floor it was, third or fourth floor. I took a course there up on the fifth floor. Some kind of library course to help you achieve looking up stuff in the library. I remember that.  Finchum On the fifth floor?  Long I think it was. Isn   t that the top floor?  Finchum That   s the top. Now that top floor is half government documents and half math laboratory. Kids can come do math. It   s changed a lot since the    60s. The card catalog   s not there as you come   you know on that main second floor there was the card catalog. It   s not there.  Long It   s not there? It   s all on the computer now I suppose. We used to, when I was living in the dorm, we   d go over to the library about every night and study and go to the Student Union, have something to drink, and go back and study some more.  Finchum Usually Coca-Cola or     Long Yes.  Finchum    coffee? Coke?  Long Soft drinks.  Finchum Did you have a car when you were there?  Long Yes.  Finchum So you could come back and forth pretty easy?  Long I had a    55 Ford. Made many a trip back and forth to Canton to Stillwater.  Finchum Do you remember if you took one suitcase or two?  Long I don   t know.  29  Finchum Sure it wasn   t like what they come with today: TV, microwave, refrigerator.  Long No, we had a popcorn popper. That was our   we   d heat, make popcorn, or roast peanuts on it.  Judy You heated soup in it too, Virgil did.  Long Yeah. One guy I remember had a little aquarium in his room. We could sit there in Cordell, we was on the east side, center, and we could watch football without going to the stadium.  Finchum Be nice, and warm, and dry.  Long Yes, if the weather wasn   t too good, sit there and kind of watch the game you know.  Finchum What would you do for food? Other than that was there cafeteria in the dorm?  Long Yes, down in the basement. I guess you   d call it the cafeteria. My meals were   the folks paid for the meals with the room. So I had three meals a day, seven days a week.  Finchum Did you have to work while you were there or did your parents cover it?  Long My folks, fortunately, were able to cover it and I didn   t have to work.  Finchum Tuition, probably, was reasonable then too.  Long A whole lot cheaper. My grandson just started college down at Southwestern and there   s a whole lot of difference in price.  Finchum Are any of them interested in insects?  Long No.  Finchum Just you, okay.  Judy Our grandson is a history nut, but that comes from Keith too, because he likes that.  Long He   s into history.  Finchum Well did you have a class that you just about didn   t pass?  30  Long Yes, couple of them. Algebra, I never was good in. I said,    I was good in math until they got the alphabet in it.    (Laughs) I had an animal husbandry class, judging livestock. I didn   t do too good in that.  Judy The year we got married, in    63, they had a locker plant on Duck   what was that street? What   s the main street coming in? I can   t even think.  Long It was Washington.  Judy No, it ran east and     Long It was on the end of the     Judy But anyway, they had a huge bull, remember?  Long Fiberglass, advertisement.  Judy Go ahead and tell her.  Finchum What did you do with that bull?  Long The locker plant, my dad would give us beef. There was four of us kids. He   d buy a couple steers, have them butchered, and give us each a half of beef, every so often. Of course we didn   t have a deep freeze or anything, so we rented a space at the locker plant. They had this contest, they had this big old fiberglass steer out there, bull. You   re supposed to guess the weight and I won, so much meat.  Judy They said he had so much trouble judging and everything, they couldn   t figure out why he was the one that guessed the weight of it.  Long But it wasn   t alive. (Laughter)  Finchum And you don   t like math, so was it just a guess?  Long Just a guess, a lucky guess.  Finchum You would take the beef from here to Stillwater?  Long Yeah, put in a   you rented a drawer in a locker plant.  Finchum It   d be frozen here and it would stay froze enough to get it there?  Long Yes.  Finchum How long would that last you as a student? 31  Long This was all after I was married, living off campus.  Finchum So doing hamburgers, and steak, and such. So maybe half a year? Last you half of a year?  Long Quite a while.  Judy It would last us quite a while  Long There were only two of us.  Finchum Would they do chickens too or just beef?  Judy Just the beef.  Long They just bought beef. If we wanted chicken we had to buy it. (Laughter)  Finchum Did your grandparents   they grew up here in Canton area too?  Long My grandparents? My dad   s side of the family come from Newkirk  Oklahoma . My mother   s side come from this area.  Finchum Were they born in Oklahoma or had they come back for part of the run? Come in part of the run?  Long My mother   s side, as far as I know, were born here. My dad   s side was from Nebraska or somewhere up in there.  Finchum Where they were probably farmers too.  Long Yes.  Finchum I was trying to   your grandparents, did they still have a farm when you were little? Or  had part of the lake taken theirs?  Long They had   I hardly knew, I didn   t know either granddad. My grandmother on my dad   s side was living in Missouri. My other grandmother was up around Longdale.  Finchum Just wondered if they had chickens.  Long Yeah, they were farmers.  Finchum In high school did you work some for your dad at the pharmacy?  32  Long Not much.  Finchum Too busy getting insects and snakes, huh?  Long I guess I was pretty fortunate. I didn   t have to work out. Since my folks were both tied up in the drugstore, I spent a lot of time on the river.  Finchum Can you swim?  Long Not good, (laughs) but I spent a lot of time in the water, shallow water.  Judy It   s hard for him to get down to the river and stuff now.  Finchum Did you noodle?  Long No. I   m not going to stick my hand in there. (Laughs) I can   t see people doing that.  Finchum You   re not afraid of these but     Long Yes.  Finchum    you can see them though.  Long That   s right.  Finchum The other you can   t, I understand that.  Long They got teeth.  Finchum They don   t let go, from what I understand either, too easily.  Long No. I have better places to stick my hands. (Laughs) Do you get into that?  Finchum We   ve heard some people tell stories about noodling, yes. I will not do that either, no. As you transitioned from OSU to these other various jobs and into your  ONG , did people know you were an OSU grad?  Long Yes.  Finchum Did they? Have a few things orange in your closet?  Long Yes.  Finchum A few things?  33  Judy It was real fortunate, Canton   s colors are black and orange.  Finchum I noticed that, yes. The Tigers, which I think OSU was, Oklahoma A M, was the Tigers way back.  Long Were they?  Judy Yes.  Finchum That   s where the orange and black.  Judy Stillwater National Bank used to have a picture that hung in their lobby.  Long We   ve got   I get stuff for my birthday and Christmas, OSU related. Mugs and cups and flags and what have you.  Finchum When was the last time you were on campus?  Long Last year     Judy Last year we went to a game.  Long    ballgame.  Finchum Football, basketball?  Long Football.  Finchum I   ve been asking the alum if they know the alma mater. Do you happen to know it? I have to read it so, was just curious. A few have been able to say it, part of it, for us.  Judy Keith, with his Parkinson   s some of the memory is not as good as it used to be.  Long I wouldn   t be able to say it anyway.  Finchum Can you carry a tune? (Laughs)  Long Not very good. I   ve got a golf cart that I run around here and I   ve got a couple OSU flags on it. The kind you hook in your window, you know. You   ve see them.  Finchum You can tell, when you pull up by the road, that an OSU fan lives here.  34  Judy Flag and stuff. Some friends of ours, real good friends, they   re OU. If OSU is losing she will be on the phone calling and we don   t answer. And if OU is losing we call her and she won   t answer. (Laughter)  Long We try to make a game or two every year, but Judy is   she can   t walk too far. Usually have to park quite a ways so I don   t know if we   re going to make it this year or not.  Judy We may try. We   ve had a lot in our family and that has   my mother has been real ill and she just passed, and we   ve had to be caregivers. More than anything that has made our decisions of what we can and can   t do.  Long My sister   s husband didn   t go to college. He was a farmer, but he was a real strong OU fan. He had four kids. They all went to OSU. (Laughs)  Finchum He gave them a choice.  Long And their kids all went to OSU.  Judy The grandkids are headed to OSU.  Finchum Got quite a few OSU in your family.  Long My oldest brother, two of the kids went to OSU.  Finchum Into agriculture or something else?  Judy Engineering and     Long I don   t know what Melanie took up.  Judy Melanie   s was   I   m not sure either on her, but both of them went.  Finchum OU   s a little further, distance-wise, from here than OSU is. I guess Panhandle State would be closer? Maybe not, no.  Long Stillwater is ninety miles, basically.  Judy Panhandle I don   t think is much     Long I think it   s further.  Judy Yeah.  Finchum So Stillwater would be closer. It   s a pretty easy drive out  Highway  51.  35  Long Just straight down the road.  Finchum Would you go to Homecoming events?  Long We haven   t.  Judy But we did. Used to.  Long We have. We try to go to a game or two, but usually not Homecoming.  Finchum When you were there was Homecoming as big a deal as it is now?  Long Yeah.  Finchum Was it?  Long Matter of fact, I remember staying up all night working on the floats.  Finchum You were in a fraternity?  Long No, our dorm.  Finchum Your dorm did one? Okay, you were an independent then.  Long Yes.  Judy Very.  Finchum So you pomped? I think that   s what they call it. Isn   t it when you   re working on a float? Put the tissue in the chicken wire?  Long Push it in the   yeah. Stay up all night working on it.  Finchum And your grades suffered that week or two?  Long Probably. (Laughs) That was more important.  Judy Homecoming was a big event.  Finchum Being in ROTC, you would have to wear your uniform to class? Was that part of it or not?  Long No.  Finchum Didn   t have to? I wondered about that. You had an outfit that was for ROTC, didn   t you? 36  Long Yes.  Finchum You just didn   t have to     Long I don   t remember just what we wore it to but no, we didn   t have to wear it to class.  Finchum In the    60s, did you wear blue jeans or did you wear dressier type pants?  Long Dressed up.  Finchum Did you? Well then when you came back     Long Completely different.  Finchum Wear you blue jeans then? When you came back the second time? I think that   s curious, why is that? Why the change in that short amount of time.  Long I don   t know, but they look like heck nowadays.  Finchum Pajamas a lot of times, yes.  Judy There was even some classes the first attempt, the first time in college, that he wore ties and jackets to class.  Long Suits.  Judy Suits, yes.  Finchum Other people too? That   s what was expected?  Long I don   t know if it was expected, but that   s what most people dressed up.  Finchum Professors did too I bet?  Long Yes.  Finchum Not so much. They don   t all now, either.  Judy For Homecoming we all dressed to go to the events and stuff. It was entirely different when he came back.  Finchum Had a corsage     Judy Yes. 37  Finchum    for Homecoming? That was neat. Do you remember who the president was for the college when you were there? I   m not sure who it was in the early    60s. Bennett was probably already gone by then so I   m not sure.  Long I can   t remember for sure.  Finchum Could   ve been Willham.  Long I don   t recall.  Finchum I don   t either. You wouldn   t see them around campus too much, in your circles?  Long No. I didn   t socialize with him. (Laughs)  Finchum The Dairy Barn was there when you were there, where you could go get ice cream.  Long I remember the donuts and milk.  Finchum Okay, there you go. And that building was pretty close to the library wasn   t it?  Long Yes.  Finchum It   s not there anymore either.  Long I used to go by there and pick up a donut and a cup of milk.  Finchum Was the Hideaway pizza place there when you were?  Long I don   t believe it was.  Finchum Came after then.  Long I remember when I was over there, the first time I was over there, and some hamburger joint opened up like a McDonald   s, but it wasn   t. I don   t remember the name of it. You could get like fifteen cent hamburgers. I can   t remember the name of it.  Finchum It wasn   t Sonic.  Long No, it wasn   t none of these that you have today.  Finchum Only thing I can think of is Scotty   s or Jiffy   s. 38  Long I don   t recall the name. I know it just opened up and you   d drive in there and get some cheap hamburgers.  Judy He came back from Vietnam and we were running a store. It was called Fads and Favors. I was working at the bank and just before we decided to move back to Canton, Eskimo Joe   s, Stanley then, were getting their funding together and everything to start. I said,    We made a big mistake.    (Laughs)  Finchum Not buying into that.  Judy That   s what we were doing too. They were talking to the manager and stuff about starting that Eskimo Joe   s and doing silk screening and stuff. That was just beginning.  Finchum The t-shirts?  Judy Uh-hmm.  Finchum It   s still going strong.  Long Yep, big business.  Finchum Even the building itself has expanded some now. I haven   t been in it lately.  Long It   s always crowded, isn   t it?  Finchum Yes, it is. When students come back, forget it. When football starts, forget it even more.  Long Yeah, when we went over there for a ballgame or something, we   d go by there. We usually don   t even go in it   s so full.  Finchum That was the go-to place for a long time, still is. Was there a movie theater that you all would go to when you were there?  Long Yes.  Finchum Was it where Hideaway is or downtown?  Judy It was where Hideaway     Long It was north of the four-way stop downtown. I don   t know if you remember Katz.  Finchum Yes, I know where that was. 39  Long It was north of there on that highway.  Finchum Leachman?  Long I don   t remember what it was called.  Aggie   Finchum I don   t know. There   s like three from that time period and one of them was closer to campus, closer to where the Hideaway is.  Long We lived just a little ways from where the Hideaway is now.  Finchum Stillwater has changed a lot. It looks like Canton has changed some since your younger days. And a tornado came through you said?  Long Yeah, out at the lake. Luckily   well, the town had one back in    49.  Judy Fifty.  Long Somewhere in there one hit Canton itself, and then we had, they called it straight winds, but more like a tornado here at our house. We had a storage shed, metal storage shed down there. It landed up right here where those birdhouses are. Put a big three-trunked cottonwood tree in our swimming pool. We had this hundred-year-old barn that was here when we bought the place. We finally decided to save it, so we put a metal roof on it, orange colored as a matter of fact. And just got it done and it lifted that roof off in two pieces. Laid it up here by the house.  Judy Destroyed the barn.  Long Destroyed everything that was in the barn, so we just dug a hole and buried it all. A few years ago, what three or four years ago, one came through the lake. Traveled quite a ways before it got to the lake and kept going up towards Fairview. It just leveled the camping areas out at the lake.  Finchum Did you have a hidey-hole here? Did you have a shelter?  Judy We have a basement.  Finchum Yeah, okay. With no snakes? (Laughter)  Judy There   s not supposed to be anyway, not that I   m aware of.  Long No snakes.  Finchum Where do you have to go to get groceries today? 40  Long We   ve got a grocery store downtown.  Finchum Downtown has one?  Judy Barely, but we do have a grocery store. When Keith grew up here there was three     Long Three grocery stores.  Judy    grocery stores on Main Street. We had three or four clothing stores, two drugstores.  Long Two drugstores. I don   t know how many   four or five filling stations.  Finchum Was there a Five and Ten, like a Lays Five and Ten or whatever they are? Five and Ten store. Five and Dime? Whatever they call it.  Long Matter of fact, her folks had one.  Judy My folks ran it.  Finchum What was it called?  Judy It was called Nelson   s Variety Store. If you drive down Main Street they took off the front and there   s our name. They left it and it is Nelson   s Five and Ten.  Long Now it   s a     Judy It   s a This and That.  Judy ...This and That.  Long Antiques and     Judy New stuff. She   s just got everything in there.  Long    junk.  Finchum For it to be called a Five and Ten, you could get some things for five cents or ten cents, or whatever?  Judy Yes, and penny candy. Then Keith and I took that store over along with our two flower shops. (Laughs) Keith, we had a whole counter of penny candy.  41  Long Penny candy and candy in the bulk. Go ahead and get you a quarter-pound of peanut clusters or orange slices or you know. We sold it by the pound.  Finchum There were enough customers to keep it going?  Judy Oh yes. Because we sold     Long Hard to keep the candy. (Laughs)  Judy Yes, and we sold toys and we sold household goods, everything. It was a variety store.  Long Did you have an old Five and Dime where you grew up?  Finchum Yes, it was called Davis   , I remember.  Long Have you ever been to Branson?  Finchum No.  Long There   s a Five and Dime store there. Just like the old one.  Finchum I like to see the storefronts where you   ve got the two doors and then that glass windows in the middle. You can tell that was a Five and Dime. We got a dime for our allowance, that   s why I remember.  Judy That   s what   we did too.  Finchum We saved those up.  Long I remember back in the school days, we   d go to the bakery and get two donuts.  Judy Two donuts for a nickel.  Long We   d go to the drugstore and get a Coke for a nickel.  Finchum Did the drugstore have a soda fountain?  Long Yes. One of them did, ours.  Judy Keith was always the spoiled child, because every day after school he would come in for a milkshake and ice cream. To this day     Long I still like milkshakes. (Laughter)  42  Finchum Did you have an allowance or since they owned the drugstore, you didn   t have to pay?  Long I didn   t have to pay. I just went in and ordered. (Laughs)  Finchum Shimmy up and order, huh? Did you get an allowance anyway, for other things?  Long Yeah, I don   t remember how much.  Finchum When would you have gotten your car? When you were sixteen or when you got through high school or     Long I got it just before graduation.  Finchum That was part of your graduation gift?  Long I guess, so they could get me away to college. (Laughs)  Finchum So they wouldn   t have to take you back and forth.  Long It wasn   t very fancy. I had to paint it. It was kind of rusty.  Finchum How much age difference between you and your sister, the next one up?  Long Four years.  Finchum Four years, so she would   ve already been out of high school when you got there.  Long Yes, she got married. She graduated in May and got married June the first, seventeen years old.  Finchum And still married?  Long He   s passed away.  Finchum So right for her, I guess. It worked.  Long It worked. My oldest brother, I think he was thirteen years older that I was, and my other brother was eleven years older. They   ve both passed away.  Finchum I   m assuming that none of those three were interested in snakes and brought those home?  Long No. 43  Finchum No? So your mother wasn   t prepared for that.  Long No, I was different.  Finchum What did you end up doing with the boa?  Long It died. It got pneumonia. My folks weren   t quite into it as much as I was. So they didn   t provide me with a warm place to keep it.  Finchum How long did it grow? How big did it get?  Long Not   I didn   t have it too many months. Winter set in and it was unheated. We lost it and I   ve still got it in alcohol, just like that one.  Finchum It   s not in the house.  Long I can show it to you. (Laughter)  Finchum What would you feed it?  Long We got baby chickens.  Finchum It didn   t die of starvation, it just died of     Long No.  Finchum    didn   t like Oklahoma winter.  Long It got pneumonia. Too cold for it.  Finchum You just get the one or did your friend get one too?  Long I just had one.  Finchum But did the friend get one as well?  Long Yeah, his went the same way.  Finchum Did it? Okay.  Long Wasn   t prepared for keeping them warm.  Judy He had a reptile house. I mean he had taken up a small little building and fixed it up. But it just     44  Long He didn   t have that, though, when he had the six-foot boa constrictor.  Finchum It just came in the U.S. Post? Or did you have to go pick it up in  Oklahoma  City?  Long It came in on the train.  Judy You should tell them about getting to go to the Boy Scout     Long Jamboree? But yeah, it came on the train at the time. We had a train through here.  Finchum I saw the depot. When did that go out or stop?  Long I don   t know.  Finchum Long time ago.  Long Quite a while.  Finchum So it came in on the train, you just went and picked it up.  Long Yeah. Matter of fact, we got   1957, I was a Boy Scout. In 1957 they had a jamboree, national jamboree in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. I got to go to it. We rode the train from here to   I   ll hit the high points. We went to Kansas City, we went to Detroit, went to Chicago, went to Washington D.C., Philadelphia, New York City, into Canada, and all back. In going to the jamboree, nobody here had ever gone to one before. My buddy and I, we collected snakes, horny toads. We took them with us in cages.  Finchum Alive?  Long Alive.  Finchum Okay.  Long For trading purposes. We left on a train from Enid, Enid Depot. His cage come open over there at the depot, and all his snakes got out in the depot. (Laughs) So I had to catch all those. We took them up there to Valley Forge. We were at Valley Forge for about five days, I think. We traded snakes and stuff with kids from other parts of the country.  Judy They made the front page of the Enid Morning News. (Laughter)  Long Yeah, it was all his.  45  Judy And they blamed and said,    Keith Long from Canton, Oklahoma,    and they had pictures and everything. I said,    They haven   t even left the state and they were making headlines.    (Laughter)  Finchum So the snakes you brought back you   d never seen or you hadn   t had before?  Long Yeah, stuff like that. We took horny toads and a lot of those people had never seen a horny toad. You know what horny toads are?  Finchum I   m not sure I   d recognize the difference between just a regular frog and one.  Judy I think you would. They have little horns.  Finchum Then I don   t think I   ve seen one up close and personal.  Long Wish we could show you one, (laughs) but anyway     Finchum Would you keep these with you or would they have to go in with the luggage? Baggage?  Long Yeah, they had to go into baggage. I had a well-constructed cage for mine. I don   t remember what Joe had.  Finchum You didn   t take any of these with you to campus? You had already gotten rid of all of your snakes by that time?  Long Uh-hmm.  Finchum Your mother probably said she wasn   t keeping them?  Long Yeah, she wouldn   t have took care of them. (Laughs) Mother was pretty easy on me, but she didn   t care for them.  Judy She tolerated them.  Finchum Well growing up, was church an important part of your family life?  Long No. I went to church and Sunday school, but my folks didn   t.  Finchum Is the house that you grew up here in town still standing     Long Yes. Still there. It   s not in the best condition, but it   s still here. This old house was in pretty sad shape when we bought it.  Finchum Who had originally built it? Do you know? 46  Judy And that was interesting too, because we didn   t know it.  Long It   s a hundred years old.  Judy The man that built it     Long Was a pharmacist.  Judy And owned the first drugstore here in Canton, and we didn   t know that until we got the abstract and was reading. It was kind of strange. When we tore out walls and stuff we found pricelists from companies where they had bought stuff for the pharmacy and the drugstore. So we had all those.  Finchum Neat. Is it one of the bigger ones in town? Not too many two-stories in town?  Judy Actually, this is three stories and a basement.  Finchum Then it probably is the biggest one.  Judy It   s the tallest.  Long It   s the tallest. I don   t know if it   s the biggest house.  Finchum Evidently it was built to last.  Long This was an old farm, too, here. They had the old barn, chicken house. You know they used to have to back up to a chute to load cattle and stuff. That part   s still here. Anywhere you dig you   re liable to run into scrap metal and bottles.  Finchum Glass bottles?  Long I   ve got a collection of old glass bottles that I   ve saved. Just about anywhere you dig, you dig up something.  Finchum In Canton some Native Americans are around too?  Long Uh-hmm.  Finchum Would they go to school with you? High school and elementary school?  Long Yes. Back in my day you very seldom seen one graduate though. They quit school. Nowadays they do.  47  Finchum The population today you said was around     Long Six hundred.  Finchum    six hundred. Do most of those people live and work in the area here or do they do like you and commute?  Long I think most of them that live here, work here.  Judy They don   t actually work in Canton.  Long But around here.  Judy U.S. Gypsum Company and like our daughter works in Fairview.  Long We   ve got a pretty good sized casino out here.  Finchum Okay. I noticed the high school coming in was pretty decent sized too.  Long Yeah. The school used to be, what, three blocks south of here?  Judy Yes.  Long Three blocks south and a block east was where we went to school.  Finchum Are all twelve grades in this building down here? The new one?  Long Yes.  Judy All except for pre-k. Pre-k   s not down there.  Finchum There   s quite a bit of activity in town I think for a town this size.  Long Have you been in   been around Canton Lake?  Finchum No, I   m going to do that when I finish. I   m going to go up and take a look.  Long Yeah, you go out there. You   ll go by the casino going to the lake. You can stop and play the slots. (Laughter)  Finchum Not on state time I don   t, in a state vehicle. (Laughter)  Judy That   s not too good, is it? Our daughter works for     Long They got a good place to eat though.  48  Finchum Okay, sure.  Judy    she works for DHS  Department of Human Services  in child support payments. She has to go to court and stuff. She said,    It   s not real cool to take the state car and be where you shouldn   t be.    (Laughs)  Finchum If it has water in it now it should be nice to see.  Judy It   s real full.  Finchum A couple of years ago I remember there being reports that it was just way, way, way down.  Long Yeah.  Finchum There were some legal issues.  Long We was just lucky that it got filled back up as soon as it did. Ordinarily it would   ve taken many years to fill back up.  Judy With all the rains it really helped.  Finchum But there   s still legal issues, that  Canton  can   t claim a good chunk of it?  Long Oklahoma City can take it     Finchum Take whatever they want.  Long    anytime they want. There   s nothing   the government can   t even do anything, because they   ve sold the rights to it.  Judy That   s the reason the lake was built was for conservation and     Long Flood control...  Judy    flood control.  Long    and irrigation. Never used for irrigation. They said that if they did use the irrigation it   d all be down around Watonga because the ground   s too high here.  Finchum They didn   t think that through too much, did they?  Long No. Somebody didn   t do their planning.  49  Finchum It helped at the time I guess. Brought the economy and work into the town when it was being built.  Judy The lake has maintained Canton along with Southard.  Finchum It   s some fish capital.  Judy Walleye.  Finchum Walleye.  Long Walleye. They have a big Walleye tournament every year.  Finchum I   m not sure what kind of fish that is. I   ll have to go look it up.  Long It   s a good tasting fish.  Judy We were also, since we had the store at Stillwater, Keith and my parents had the variety store. They sold like white shirts and we were the first ones to come over and do silk screening with the Walleye Rodeo that we have. Keith did those for them, did the silk screening, made the screen. We printed off shirts and sold them for the Walleye Rodeo that they have. It was the first one.  Long Years ago.  Finchum So you have some artistic talent too?  Judy Not really.  Long No.  Judy (Laughs) We just choose the picture and work it in.  Long I had a friend that drew the picture.  Finchum Okay. So is it really a rodeo-rodeo?  Long No.  Judy Round them up at the lake. (Laughs)  Finchum Okay, not that kind of rodeo.  Long It   s just called a rodeo, but there   s no horses involved. (Laughs)  50  Finchum I thought there   s enough farms out this way that there might   ve been so that   s why I asked.  Judy We do have like the parade and it   s a weekend, four or five days. It brings thousands of people into Canton.  Finchum What time of year?  Long May. First part of May usually.  Judy That   s when they   re spawning and stuff, so that   s usually when they have it. There   s a fish or two, fish or two   we all contribute to it and they tag them. If it   s caught there   s a thousand dollars and five-hundred and so forth. So it   s quite a big event.  Finchum Do they get to be pretty big size, pound wise?  Long No. If you caught a ten-pounder, you   d be doing good. They   re a good flavor, you know, for a fish.  Finchum You said,    Round them up.    You still use a hook and line? (Laughter)  Long Yes.  Finchum That brings in business to the town.  Long That   s the whole purpose and it was started back many years ago.  Finchum And you have a Mexican restaurant downtown I noticed.  Long It   s real good.  Finchum Is it? Is there any other eatery there?  Long There   s McNabb   s Grill on Main Street next to, close to the grocery store. There   s the Overlook Caf   out at the dam. On the other side of the lake is Bairds  Lakeside Caf    out there. What else we got?  Judy The One Stop.  Long Oh, the One Stop, which is a quick shop at the west end of Canton. Has a grill open until three o   clock in the afternoon.  Finchum You   ve got choices then, without having to go to Watonga or Fairview. Probably not a great deal in those places either.  51  Judy Fairview   s not as good. I don   t think Fairview has as     Long We   ve probably got as much selection as they do. Now they   ve got Taco Mayo and Sonic.  Finchum Sonic, yes.  Long A Pizza Hut you know. They don   t have much other.  Finchum And a caf   in the bowling alley.  Judy Yes.  Long It   s good.  Judy It   s good. Once Keith retired, and of course his brothers, we have tried for all this time to meet with his brothers and sister once a month and we would go out for dinner that evening. That way we got to see each other and everything. We just haven   t been able to do that here lately. So we have found all the restaurants around close. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s good though. Mexican, most of the little towns have one nowadays. People were going into it so I figured it was good.  Long This one here is. I mean you go in there and you won   t know anybody. There   s so many people coming from other towns into this Mexican restaurant. It   s well known. How   d you come into town?  Finchum I came up 58 into town and stopped and took a few pictures.  Long Like I say, I don   t know about 51, whether it   s open up to traffic or not.  Finchum It   s a pretty drive coming up from, what, 270?  Long Watonga.  Finchum Whatever that is up 58. It   s pretty through there. Not completely flat but you   ve got a little bit of rolling.  Judy A little bit.  Finchum Which is pretty.  Long Yeah, this is not flat country right here. You go by Okeene and it is.  52  Finchum I cut through. I had never been to Roman Nose so I went by there. Couldn   t see much. There   s a lake there too, evidently, and a golf course.  Long It   s a heck of a golf course too. (Laughs)  Finchum It looked like it was up and down, up and down.  Judy They say,    Do not reach into the hole to get your  ball .     Long Rattlesnakes down there.  Judy It   s really bad. There   s a lot of them down there.  Finchum So I take it you   ve played it?  Long Yes.  Finchum Got any hole- in-ones?  Long No.  Finchum Not at all? Not yet?  Long Not yet.  Finchum Is that the closest golf course to you?  Long There   s one in Okeene and it   s not much. Then the Fairview Country Club used to be. Went out of business and some guys have got it going again. I haven   t been up to it since they got it opened up again.  Judy It   s the closest because it   s just     Long It   s on the north side of the lake.  Judy    it   s just on the north side of the lake there.  Long It was real nice, but like I say it   s been closed for years.  Judy Just got it back.  Finchum You didn   t have a lot of free time to get to play.  Long No, I haven   t played in a long time really. I got a new set of clubs; I need to. I   ve gathered up a bunch of old balls. I go back here by that tree and just sail them back in the pasture. (Laughs) Her brother and I did that once years ago. 53  We didn   t even look for the balls, we just left them. (Laughs) The old ones, bad shape, not ones you   d play with you know.  Judy He won   t take me golfing after the last.  Long She doesn   t watch her ball. She don   t know where it goes. (Laughter)  Finchum You didn   t go play with him at Lakeview when you were in Stillwater?  Judy No.  Finchum Not at four a.m. in the morning?  Judy Not at four a.m., no.  Finchum Did you all share clubs or did everyone that went have their own?  Long Everybody had clubs.  Finchum You had to walk it, if they weren   t open.  Long We always walked. I very seldom rented a cart. I   ve got a cart now, but I don   t have a way to take it. I don   t have a trailer. I have to borrow my son-in-law   s I guess.  Finchum Well, have you experienced some quakes? We   ve had one recently in Stillwater so wondered in the gas and oil business you would   ve paid attention too.  Long That last one up by Pawnee     Finchum Five point six.  Long    they   ve upped it     Finchum Oh, have they?  Long    to a five point eight.  Finchum Wow, I didn   t know that.  Long That was in the paper. They upgraded it to the strongest Oklahoma   s ever had. We felt it good here.  Finchum We felt it. The telephone poles were doing this. (Gestures) I was out walking when it happened. You could hear it and then feel it. 54  Long We were upstairs and it just     Finchum I   d say it vibrated pretty much in a three-story   you would   ve felt it.  Long I checked   I haven   t found any cracks, which surprises me because our foundation is hundred-year-old brick and mortar. That old mortar is not good cement anymore. But so far     Judy We had some guys come and fix the   to do the ceiling.  Long I   m thinking about getting some earthquake insurance though. Lady told me the other day it   d probably just add sixty dollars to my premium.  Finchum For three months or     Long For a year.  Finchum That   s well worth it for that. This house is probably built   probably has solid oak wood in it.  Long It   s pretty solid and hard.  Finchum Blackjacks or whatever was grown out here.  Long Oak.  Judy Was built   at one time at Carlton, which is just east and south of Canton just a little bit here.  Long No town there no more.  Judy They used to have a sawmill and the lumber used in this was cut out there and dated and everything on it.  Finchum You know a lot about this. It has history. If the walls could talk you   d learn a little bit more.  Judy Yes. We try to keep old stuff. I like it. Keith does as long as it works. (Laughter)  Long This house had a central heating unit, coal fired. We found the ductwork and stuff. No furnace you know, and it   s coal. There was old coal chute on the west side of the house to go underneath. Sent the coal down there.  Finchum It probably came in on the train, coal? 55  Long Probably.   Chiming   Judy That   ll be on film won   t it?  Finchum It   s pretty. So what   s your fondest memory of OSU? Of your time there?  Long Fondest memory? I don   t know. I told Judy just a while back, I said    I lived in the dorm for three years, became well acquainted with some of the boys, you know. After we got married I never did go back and see them.     Judy I don   t know why.  Long I don   t know either. We were good friends, never had any contact with them again.  Finchum Or since?  Long Or since. So I don   t know what happened to them, where they ended up and all that. My roommate now, he was from Canton, so I see him every day now. The other guys from various towns     Judy We did have contact with the one that has the nursery over at Tahlequah.  Long That   s true but     Judy He was able to help us when you     Long    I really haven   t kept track of him either. He didn   t live in the dorm. I just     Judy He had a nursery in Tahlequah.  Long    become acquainted with him in our class, because he was in horticulture too. The guys in the dorm itself, after I moved out and Virgil moved out, we just lost contact. I don   t know why.  Finchum They may have gotten girlfriends and gotten tied up with them too.  Judy Out of all of the ones that started college with Keith, when Keith did, he and his roommate were the only two that graduated from OSU. The rest of them all dropped out.  56  Long Out of our high school class. There was about seven or eight of us went over there to school. Everybody else quit.  Finchum Any idea why?  Long No. One of them, who was my roommate the first year, he got to DJing for the campus radio station and forgot to go to class. (Laughter) The others, I don   t know. One or two of them joined the service. I don   t know whether they ever went back. Some of them probably went back to school eventually and some didn   t.  Finchum Life happens and takes you different directions.  Long Uh-hmm. But I regret not following up with the other guys who I played golf with, bowled with.  Finchum With the internet nowadays you could probably find them with a little bit of work.  Judy Yes, we can find them.  Long If I remember their names.  Judy We were in charge of the all-school, here at Canton, reunion this year. You can find anybody.  Finchum You can. Women are a little bit harder if they   ve married, you know..  Long Changed their names.  Finchum Then it   s harder to find. But you look long enough you   ll find them. Which is scary in itself I think, all that to be out there.  Long Come back from Vietnam, one of the guys over there, he was a   had been there just a short time when I got there. Then when I got sent home   actually, I guess I was ahead of him, but I didn   t go to my unit in Vietnam when I first got there. I was what they called TDY to another unit, temporary. When I got to my regular unit this guy was there and he said, you know, I was going to be after him because he was already there. He had a shorter time than me. But it came out that I had a shorter time than him. So when we got out of the service, I got out first and was sent to Fort Hood, Texas. Short time. He was stationed down there too, but then we lost contact once we got out of the service. One night, middle of the night, he calls. He was from California. He called in the middle of the night, just talked and then never did communicate anymore. Always wondered what happened to him. 57  Judy He had a lot of problems, though, from Vietnam. Keith was considered the old man of the unit. He was one of the older ones.  Long Don   t even know why I got drafted.  Judy He was almost too old.  Long Married, college degree and these other guys younger, not married, no college and they didn   t get drafted.  Finchum They didn   t want your bug knowledge?  Long No.  Finchum I don   t know.  Long Anyway, we made it through.  Finchum Made it through. And you came back and went to Fort Hood and discharged from Fort Hood?  Long Yeah. I had a few months left. Sent us to Fort Hood, what, three or four months?  Judy About.  Finchum Where were you during   you had stayed here?  Judy When he went to Fort Hood, when he came home, I moved to Fort Hood.  Long She stayed here while I was in the service.  Judy We had been in Enid with the pet shop, but I was working for First National Bank in Enid. I had to move back home and help my folks. That   s what I said, it   s always been a family crisis, and we came and took care of it.  Long How   d I get picked?  Finchum For this? Someone nominated you, but I can   t tell you who that was. They asked me not to.  Long Somebody that could   ve done it instead of me     Judy You   re thinking of Virgil  Aren   t you?  58  Long    but I got picked.  Judy You   re thinking that Virgil wouldn   t do it. (Laughter)  Finchum You   ve done well. It   s not been hard, has it?  Long No.  Finchum We can finish. I mean if there   s not anything else you want to add, we   ll close out.  Long I don   t know. I think we went all through my life.  Finchum My last question I usually ask people is how they want to be remembered. When history is written about you, what do you want people to remember about you?  Long I don   t know.  Finchum Good golfer, good snake catcher.  Judy I can tell you what people say about him in town.  Finchum Okay.  Judy       If you want a job done and done right call Keith Long to do it.       He had that in high school, because he was in Scouts, he has also been on the council for the Boy Scouts, he was mayor, has been president of the school board, president at the Chamber of Commerce, he   s a deacon in our church, he   s worked with youth groups. He still is, whether he wants to or not. (Laughter) Still involved in our school.  Long Not too much, I   ve cut back.  Finchum And a good work ethic.  Long I think the younger ones need to take over, but they   re not.  Finchum Ease out and someone will have to.  Long I don   t know. I   m ready to let them have it.  Finchum Well, I appreciate you taking time to spend with me this afternoon. It   s been great. Thank you.  Long Yeah, appreciate the chance, I guess. 59  Finchum And Go Pokes   Long Go Pokes.  -------  -------
