 Gill  Totusek  Today is November 21, 2008. My name is Jerry Gill. I   m interviewing  Robert Totusek and we   re in his residence in Oklahoma City. This  interview is part of the O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Bob, you   ve had a long and distinguished  career at Oklahoma State University. Well maybe more than  distinguished. Can you first share some information on your  background?  Okay. I was born in Garber, Oklahoma and grew up, so to speak, on a  farm near Garber, Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl and Depression days.  Sometimes people say they didn   t know they were poor because  everybody else was poor. I knew we were poor  (Laughter) I could tell  that the banker   s kids and the druggist   s kids  and the doctor   s kids  and  so on were not as poor as we were. But we were real fortunate. We did  live on a farm and that   s one advantage farmers had during this era.  They could grow enough food so they didn   t go hungry. We had a huge  garden and we had animals. We not only had ample food for ourselves,  every Saturday my folks would go to town, take the cream and eggs to  sell to get money to buy groceries, but they also did a food route. There  were people in Garber who actually, not only were they unemployed, but  they didn   t have food to eat. So every Saturday, we delivered food to a  number of families there. So we were poor, but we were more fortunate  than a lot of people.  Had food anyway?  And had food.  What year did you graduate from Garber High School?  1944.  6  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Are there any activities that you remember from your high school days?  Well I was very active in 4-H Club and FFA, and both of those  organizations did a lot for my personal development. I didn   t play any  sports because we lived six miles from town and I didn   t relish the idea  of walking home six miles after workouts.  The bus wouldn   t wait for you?  The bus wouldn   t wait. (Laughter)  Did you hold any local or state offices in FFA or 4-H?  I held local offices in my high school class and FFA   president, vice  president and was vice president of the Oklahoma FFA from the  Northwest district.  So you graduated in 1944, were you able to go straight on to college  from there?  I volunteered for the Army Air Guard in March of my senior year   that  was 1944. During the summer I was just waiting to be called, working  on our farm and my  Vocational Agriculture  teacher came by and said,     What are you going to do this fall?    I said,    Well, I   m just waiting to be  called.       Do you know when you   re going to be called?       No.       Get  yourself down to Stillwater, Oklahoma and enroll.    And I did. That was  good advice because who knows if I would have gone to college if I  hadn   t gotten the taste of it. I went that semester and half of the next  semester; was actually a year after I volunteered that I got called up.  So Uncle Sam needed you after all?  There was a big delay in calling people up at that time because the air  corps had plenty of pilots and even after I got called up, they still didn   t  have any room in the flight schools. I didn   t know when I signed up,  they could have kept me in for ten years and I wouldn   t have known it.  But the agreement was supposedly, they said, if we did not get to  complete pilot training before the war ended, we would be immediately  discharged. So my tenure in the service was about eight months.  Congratulations  (Laughter) So the story was, your instructor influenced  you to come to Oklahoma State University, and his name was?  Benton Thomason. He   s still living in Alva, Oklahoma and in a couple  of weeks I   m going to visit him again. He must be about 96. A huge  influence on my life. As you know, in everybody   s life there are people  7  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  who influence your life, and outside my parents, he had probably the  most influence on my early life.  So do you remember a little bit about your undergraduate experience?  I   m not thinking your academics experience so much but your activities?  Well non-academics   when we moved about a year and a half ago, I  was going through a lot of stuff and I ran across my old high school  yearbook. And you know how it   s customary to get other students to  sign it and get teachers to sign it. One of my favorite teachers was Nell  Barber. She just died about a month ago, but she had written in my  annual. For most students these teachers will write,    It   s been great  having you as a student. I know that you   ll be a great success in life,     and that sort of thing. This is what she wrote in mine,    You are a  challenge, my friend.    (Laughter) I think the translation is,    You have  been a big trouble maker      Not an opportunity but a challenge. What were some of the student  hangouts, some hot places on campus and off campus in the 1940s?  Swim   s Campus Shop on Knoblock, just across the street from Joe   s.  So what was so hot about Swim   s?  Well, you could get a coke for a nickel and they had a dance floor.  What else could you ask for?  That   s right  (Laughter)  I guess campus was a little different. What were some of the places that  you frequented on campus? The Student Union wasn   t there yet.  No, it wasn   t. It was just being completed, I guess. It hadn   t been  completed when I was a student. When I came back on the faculty it had  just been completed in 1952. Does that sound right?  I believe it was the 1950s. Going back to academics, you majored in  what subject?  Animal Husbandry, which is now Animal Science.  Do you remember some of your professors?  I remember some of my professors very well. I roomed for a couple of  years at one of my professor   s house. They had four rooms upstairs and  8  Gill  Totusek  Gill  they rented out to eight boys. Hilton Briggs, he later became President of  South Dakota State University, he was a big influence in my life.  Another professor I had was Jim Whatley. He later became Dean of  Agriculture. I took a genetics course under Dr. Whatley my last year in  school. He was such a good teacher. He just laid everything out so  clearly that I was somewhat mesmerized and beyond that I didn   t think I  needed to take any notes because everything was so clear. On each of  our exams there were always two or three questions I couldn   t recall, so  I would make in the low 90s.  Since I planned to go to graduate school at that point, grades were  important because I wanted to get some scholarships. So coming into  final exam time, I went to Dr. Whatley and said,    What do I have to  make on the final exam to get an A in the course?    He got out his book  and did a little figuring and he said,    A 100.    (Laughter) So I got notes  from E.J. Turman and in his notes was every word that Dr. Whatley had  said, and there were the answers to the questions I missed, so I was  ready for that final exam. Got my paper back, 99. As promised, I got a  B. Well that was in 1947.  Now fast forward to 1997, 50 years later. I was visiting with a recent  graduate, Julie McMahan, from Arkansas and Dr. Hilton Briggs that I  mentioned a moment ago. Julie was interested in learning something  about the faculty members in years previous that had such a reputation  and she said,    How about Dr. Whatley? What kind of guy was he?    and  I said,    Well he was an outstanding researcher, nationally renowned. He  was an excellent teacher.    And then I told her that story. Here was  Hilton Briggs just doubled over with laughter. He said,    Let me tell you  the rest of the story     and he said,    Jim Whatley and I had offices that  were joined together and after he finished grading your paper, he came  in and told me what the background was and he said,    You know  Totsuek made 100 on his exam, but he   s lazy. He didn   t even take notes  in my class. He needs to be stimulated to work a little harder so I   m  going to give him a 99.    But just by sure happenstance, I heard the rest  of that story 50 years later  (Laughter)  How did you feel?  Well, I felt better. I never did worry too much about it because I thought,     Well, I should have worked a little harder.     There are some characters that I hear stories about, some professors  that you may remember like  Dr. Carl P.     Hog    Thompson, Fuzzy   Leslie Eugene  Hazen. Can you share some stories about these two  individuals and others you can think of?  9  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  I didn   t have a course under Fuzzy Hazen. I had my Ag Engineering  under    Pappy     James Arthur  Dilts who was another character at that  time. When people began to doze off in an afternoon class   he was  crippled and carried a cane that he laid on his desk   about half the class  was asleep and he would whack that cane on the desk and everybody  would jump. Wouldn   t go to sleep during that period anyway  Hog  Thompson was a great story teller and as you probably know, in his later  years he was actually assigned to the President   s Office as an  Ambassador of Goodwill. He would go out into the state and make a lot  of good speeches. He loved to tell stories and he was really good at  telling them. One of his big things, he always had philosophy in his  speeches and stories, and one of his big things was,    Tell people now if  you appreciate them. Tell them now. Don   t wait till tomorrow, it may be  too late.    And then he illustrated that with the statement,    Flowers on  the grave are like alimony on a cold night.     Do you remember any of the Fuzzyisms? Is that what they   d call some of  Fuzzy Hazen   s sayings were Fuzzyisms?  My biggest recollection about Fuzzy Hazen is that he was totally for  efficiency. I didn   t have a class under him or I   d remember more. But he  was about total efficiency and his contention was that front doors in  houses were a waste of time. They were unnecessary because you  always parked in the back, at least at that time, and company came in the  back door, so he didn   t have a front door in his house on North  Washington Street.  Was Al Darlow dean when you were a student?  He actually was the department head who hired me for the faculty in  1952.  Did he become dean later?  About a year later he became dean.  When you were a student  at OSU  he was a professor?  He was the head of the department when I was there, of Animal  Husbandry.  What do you remember learning from him? I   ve heard some good stories  about him.  He was a real interesting fellow. He had high expectations of people. He  was very frank. For example, Glen Bratcher was named department head  10  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  after Al was destined to go to the dean   s office. Glen said to me,    I want  you to coach the judging team.    I said,    Well, I   m not sure that I can do  that adequately    because Glen had been my coach and I had such high  regard for him, I knew I could not do it in the way he did it. He said,     Well, go talk to Dr. Darlow.    So I went in and told him that Mr.  Bratcher wanted me to coach the livestock judging team and he said,     Well, I don   t know how much encouragement I can give you.    He said,     Now there wasn   t any question in my mind that when I asked Glen  Bratcher to be the coach that he could do it. But I   m just not sure about  you.    (Laughter) So that was a challenge. I immediately was motivated  to take the job  And for a little while I wasn   t sure I had done the right  thing, but eventually  I knew I had made the right decision.   You graduated in 1948?  1949.  And then you did your graduate work at Purdue?  Yes.  Can you share a little bit about your experience?  Well, it was a great experience and my major professor was    Mac     Beeson, W.M. Beeson, who was a graduate of OSU. He   d been on the  judging team and that year at Chicago our team won the national contest  and I wasn   t just real sure at that point. I wasn   t definitely sure that I was  going to do graduate work. I was holding that option open. He was there  when we were having our picture made and he immediately offered me  an assistantship so I decided, on the spot, that I wanted to go to Purdue.  He was really an outstanding researcher and teacher.  You were on the national championship livestock judging team?  Yes.  That was your senior year?  Yes.  Any other years that you won the national championship while you were  there?  Well, we won at Fort Worth. That was where all the teams in the country  can participate. Chicago at that time was called the International because  there would be teams there from Canada, as well.  11  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  You got the assistantship to Purdue and you taught as you were doing  graduate work?  Yes. After a year and a half, I got an instructorship which helped a good  deal,  financially . (Laughter) I taught then while working on my degree.  What did you specialize in?  Nutrition.  So animal nutrition, particularly cattle?  Yes. At that time it was across the board, but later on I specialized in   beef  cattle, right.  So is there a story about how you got back from Purdue to Oklahoma  State? Because after you finished your doctorate did you come directly  back to Oklahoma State?  Yes. I guess the bottom line was I got offered a job and I had such a high  regard for OSU in the Animal Science Department that I didn   t hesitate.  You said this was when Dr. Darlow was department head and invited  you back?  Yes.  What were the classes that you were teaching when you first came back  to Oklahoma State?  I started out teaching the introductory Animal Science course, and then  gradually progressed to several other courses at the sophomore level and  the junior level and the senior level. In total by the time I had finished  my teaching career there, I had taught 14 different courses, including  some seminar courses and orientation courses.  Can you reflect back on what the department and the college was like in  the early 1950s? There was a lot of retirement going on. Seemed like  there was a lot of change, a lot of new professors coming in the early  1950s. What do you remember about the college at that time?  Well, the College of Agriculture that I   m familiar with and Animal  Science Department had some really outstanding faculty members that  went on to other places. Doyle Chambers, for example, went to LSU as  Vice Chancellor, Hilton Briggs went to South Dakota State eventually as  President and Bill Pope went to Texas A M and was Dean at New  12  Gill  Totusek  Mexico State after that. So really good instructors.  One of my favorite stories about the teachers during that era came from  Frank Robson. Must have been the early 1980s, actually, I ran into Frank  somewhere and I don   t know if he   d been back to OSU since he   d  graduated. He probably had been, but he hadn   t been back to Animal  Science. So he started asking me about people,    How about Jim  Hillier?       Well, he   s retired.       How about Lowell Walters?       Well, he   s  retired.       How about Bill Pope?       Well he   s Dean at New Mexico.        How about Doyle Chambers?       He   s at LSU.     We finished the list and he looked me in to the eye and he said,    You   re  the only SOB left here that I know     Only he didn   t abbreviate.  (Laughter) So I thought I better explain to him that we had a lot of really  good, young faculty members. Didn   t sink in at all, he thought things  had gone to pot. So I said,    Frank, why don   t you come to Stillwater and  spend a day with me.    He did and I toured him around our facilities,  went by the offices and introduced him to faculty members, and he left  here that day convinced that the department had not gone to the dogs. So  I got to thinking, there may be more Frank Robsons out there. So I  started what I called    VIP Days    and I would invite not only graduates  but others, many of them leaders in the industry, to come in and spend a  day and show them what we were doing and introduce them to faculty  members. It turned out to be a real productive endeavor in terms of  letting people know what was going on.  Bob, who were some of the alumni that you were closely connected to  over the years? I know there   s been many but are there some that stand  out in your mind?  That would be real difficult to narrow down to a few. I   ve been fortunate  in the era in which I was on the faculty to know earlier graduates and all  of the graduates during my tenure there and many of the graduates since  I was on the faculty because I   ve maintained some relationships, do have  some contact with students. I actually knew graduates for 100 years  while projecting forward, will be 100 years. For example, I knew some  graduates in the early teens, 1913 was the earliest graduate that I knew  of and he was still in his productive years late in his career. But  obviously the ones in the teens, the 1920s and 1930s, many of them I  knew and worked with. Then going forward, of course, I either taught or  was in administration for 38 years, so saw about 5,000 students go  through during that era.  And then 18 years since I   ve retired I   ve known students. I know some  of the freshman there now. They   ll graduate, some of them in 2012 and  some of them later. But you see there   s a span there of 100 years. I   ve  13  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  been extremely fortunate in knowing a lot of graduates. And the ones  which stand out in my mind would take me a little time.  My understanding, you were very active, perhaps like some professors,  not necessarily in your college, but across campus, you were very active  in external relations in terms of activities with alumni and people in the  industry. Can you share some of the things you did and some of the  interactions you had?  That   s a good question because one of the things that I always admired  about the Animal Science Department, and it goes back 100 years  actually, was the great rapport that the department had with off-campus  people   graduates and people in the industry. A good relationship, good  rapport. I   ve been to a lot of other states where that isn   t true, or wasn   t  true. In some states that I   ve gone to, you could talk to people out in the  state and they did not know any Animal Science faculty. You could talk  to the faculty members and they weren   t acquainted with many  producers. But in the Animal Science Department  at OSU , not only the  people officially in extension, but everyone on the faculty had  interaction, still do today, with the clientele off campus. Even the basic  researchers have many occasions to go out in the state and speak or help  solve some producer   s problems. So I   ve always cherished that  component of our department.  Beyond that, another thing that I really have admired about the  department, again, this is as time elapses for 100 years, the department  has been very well balanced between extension and research and  teaching. Some departments have a real good reputation for one or the  other of the three, but our department has been extremely well balanced.  Just as an example of that, at one time when I was department head, we  had six Regents Professors in the department, two from extension, two  from research and two from teaching.  You came back in 1952. When did you become department head in  Animal Science?  1976. Retired in 1990.  Wow, so how many years was that? Am I counting right, about 14 years  or so?  As department head.  As I recall, it   s probably true today, but over the years, Animal  Husbandry/Animal Science has been the largest department in terms of  enrollment in the college of agriculture and has a strong national  14  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  reputation.  And it   s surprising; people would automatically think of engineering or  accounting or whatever. Back in the early days of the University, of  course it was logical that the Ag departments be strong because it was  the biggest industry at that time. But more recently, that has surprised  many people. We have currently about 700 students and interestingly  enough they come typically from 35 to 38 states. This year, for example,  the livestock judging team is seven members from seven different states.  I want to come back to the judging team in a minute. What were some of  your goals when you were department head that you had, the kind of  vision you had of the department? Can you share some of those?  My primary goal was to not do too much damage.  To do no harm?  To do no harm and to maintain a high level of excellence that I  perceived throughout my association with OSU. But I did, I think,  initiate some innovative programs and that   s not always easy. You  know, faculty members have a tendency to be conservative, and I was. I  didn   t have many problems in my own mind when I was department  head, but one of the things that, being the impatient person that I am,  what really bothered me was that when a new idea developed, maybe it  would take a year or two to develop and to gain acceptance from the  faculty. Because the worst thing you could do was implement something  without faculty agreement. But it   s easy to see, something new may  work and it may not.  What were some of those initiatives and innovations that you   re  referring to?  When I became department head, we had three options in the  department   science, production    maybe we just had two. But we  gradually started adding more options until we had about ten. We would  create a business option, for example, because we were in an era when  business was becoming increasingly important. So that option would  include a lot of courses in the College of Business Administration and  Agricultural Economics. We developed a science option where the  emphasis was on science, especially important for those going to  graduate school. We had one we called livestock promotions which  involved courses taken from Ag Communications and Journalism to  appeal to those students who wanted to get into things such as writing,  and radio and television work, serving with breed associations and that  sort of thing. Developed a food option, and of course established a pre-  15  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  veterinary medicine option. And so this allowed students to concentrate  in the area of their interest.  In your tenure, you reestablished the horse program in Animal Science;  can you tell us a little bit about that?  Well that   s another thing that wasn   t real easy because horses are not  food animals and our department for many years had been geared  towards food animals. But in Oklahoma we have more horses   and did  then   per square mile than any state in the country. And in terms of  economic impact, horses were only behind beef cattle. They were ahead  of dairy, they were ahead of wheat, and anything else you want to  mention. So it seemed logical   and we had a lot of students who were  interested in horses because they came off of ranches and many did not  come off of ranches but wanted to learn more about horses. So it looked  obvious that we needed a horse program, but again that   s one of those  things that took a little incubation. At that time, I was fortunate in having  Frank Baker as Dean and he shared the same opinion that we needed a  horse program.  Was there any connection with the Equine program at the Vet Med  college?  No, except that our faculty members worked with the people in  Veterinary Medicine, closely but more on research than teaching.  Something that strikes me as pretty innovative, you were talking about  the new options that you included in Animal Science majors. You were  having to reach across not only departmental, but college lines. Did you  need support from the dean on that?  No, the dean was very receptive. Frank Baker was Dean when I became  department head.  Speaking of deans, can you share a little bit of your insight? You worked  with how many different deans? It may take both hands to count them, of  course. Can you tell us a little bit about some of the deans you   ve  worked with?  Al Darlow, of course we   ve mentioned, and when I joined the faculty, it  was Dean  Warren  Blizzard who was dean. And then after Darlow, it  would have been Jim Whatley and Frank Baker and Charles Browning  and    sometimes senility is an inconvenience  A fellow who came from  Texas Tech.  Sam Curl, but he became Dean after I retired.   What do you remember about some of the strengths that each of the  16  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  different deans brought to it? Of course Blizzard was sort of a legend at  OSU there for years.  Yes, and due to an automobile accident, he wasn   t real active at that  time. Most of the work was picked up by the associates, and so I didn   t  really get real well acquainted with him. A couple of interesting things  about W. L. Blizzard, he was always known as Dean Blizzard, he was  Animal Science department head when the Animal Husbandry Building  was constructed in 1922. Well in subsequent years, people would come  into the animal husbandry building and wonder why the door knobs  were so low   just remarkably low. Well the reason was that Dean  Blizzard was a man of small stature, about 5   4 and so he made the door  knobs at a height that was convenient for him. (Laughter)  And here   s another interesting story about Dean Blizzard, again this was  when he was department head. A German chap from Waukomis that still  had a German accent came over to see W. L. Blizzard. The secretary  took him into the office and he looked the dean over and he said,    Vell,  vell, vell, so this is the famous Blizzard. It vasn   t a big storm, vas it?     And the report from the secretary was that that upset Mr. Blizzard.  What do you remember about Dean Darlow?  He was very enjoyable to work with because he was very mission  oriented and he was very frank and you always knew what the goals  were and where you stood.  I want to ask you again about Dean Blizzard. In his earlier years, he  was a famous coach for a livestock judging team and they won for many  years. You served as one of the judging team members that won a  national championship, but then as a faculty member you were a coach  for twelve years.  No, eight years.  It just seemed like twelve  Out of those eight years, you won something  like ten national competitions, I recall?  I doubt it was that many, but we were fortunate to win several. And it  wasn   t hard to do given the caliber of students we had. We never entered  a contest but what I thought, if I had done a good job of coaching, we  should win the contest.  Do you remember some of the members names on the team?  Oh, some of these guys went on to great success, in fact, they all did in  17  Gill  Totusek  one way or another. On that first team, I had people like John McKnight  who was a cattleman. He became president of the American Hereford  Association and president of the American Brangus  Breeders   Association. Ronnie Blackwell, who became a CEO of the American  Quarter Horse Association, the biggest breed association in the world,  and his editor was Audie Rackley who was also on the judging team.  And just a little while later, on a subsequent team, I had Eddie Kimbrell  and I always held him up as a good example. He came off of a poor hill  farm in Mountain View, Oklahoma, I think, 80 acres. On Sunday  mornings   there were four boys in the family   they went to church on  their tractor. Their dad had built a little box to put on the back of the  tractor and two of the boys rode on the hood and they went to church.  They went on a tractor because they didn   t own an automobile. So Eddie  came to school and made his own way all the way, all the way. And that  was true of a lot of kids during the 1950s and 1960s especially, and that  continues on today. He eventually became the second in command in the  U.S. Department of Agriculture.  We could talk about success stories of a similar kind all day. One of the  fellows I had on a team was a fellow by the name of Tom Reece. He was  in ROTC when he was in school. He held down three jobs. He was the  ninth of 13 kids from Mooreland, Oklahoma. He was called into service  because he took advanced ROTC, went into the Air Force. When he  retired, he retired as a two-star general, and his last assignment was  Commanding General of the North American Defense Command. So  they didn   t always stay in agriculture, but they succeeded at whatever  endeavor they chose.  Bob, obviously, I think you   re being a little modest, and your coaching  was good too, but you had some outstanding kids. Did you kind of prep  these kids? Did you look for good students coming through? How did  you select them during your tenure?  Well it was an open deal. Anybody who wanted to come out for the  livestock judging team could come out. They worked all day Saturday,  starting after the International, which had been the second Saturday after  Thanksgiving. I typically had 60 or 70 kids come out. Most of them  would usually stay until the Christmas workouts, which involved about a  week of workouts except Christmas day, sometimes ten days. That  would cull the group usually down to about 30 and most of those would  usually stay with it. Keep in mind that in the early days, I only used one  team as most people did. In other words I would select seven team  members to go to the first contest in Denver, might change one or two at  the next contest, but typically I didn   t involve more than ten for the  whole year. But most of those 30 would keep coming out because of the  18  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  experience they thought they were getting.  In later years I took two  entirely different teams to the first two contests, to give more students  the experience.   What do you feel like was key to your success in coaching?  That   s easy. Good students.  Kind of like coaching really good athletes?  Outstanding students and that continues today. There have been some  changes. I mentioned 60 people would typically come out for the team  then but today it   s more like 12 or 15 because I guess students have  more diversions now, more distractions, and maybe that   s not fair.  Maybe they get involved in more things, but it   s really a huge  commitment to go out for that judging team. You have to maintain your  regular classes, but you   re going every Saturday, a lot of times in the  evening and you miss the football games and basketball games during  that period and it runs for a year, from the spring until fall. So it takes a  special kind of student. Number one they   ve got to be capable or they   re  not going to succeed, but they also have to have a tremendous sense of  dedication and work ethic.  Another subject, your research, it yielded almost 200 publications?  I don   t recall the number, but quite a few, again because I had good  graduate students and I had the luxury of having access to facilities that  allowed me, in my case, to have a lot of research cattle. Cattle are  difficult to do research with because they require so much land and we  were fortunate to not only have about 10,000 acres at Lake Carl  Blackwell, but also about 6,800 acres at Fort Reno which we had sole  access to during those years for research. So I had the luxury of having a  lot of cattle, and that allowed for me to do a lot of research.  What about funding for research? Did you get university grants or  college funding? Did you get money from the industry?  At that time, there was not a lot of funding from the federal agencies and  there weren   t too many grants of any kind. I did get some grants from  industry, pharmaceutical companies, from breed organizations and  cattlemen organizations, but it wasn   t high dollar type grants  as we  have today .  Did you have release time for any of your research or was it just on your  own time?  19  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  I mentioned it took a huge commitment on the part of the students. It  also did on the part of the coach because that was essentially  extracurricular activity. You got no credit for the Saturday workouts and  sometimes the Sunday afternoon workouts. You got no credit for the  travel which made it challenging because you not only had to arrange for  time away before you left, but then catch up when you got back. But I  did quite a few things that were more or less extracurricular. At one  time, I was advisor to about 100 students, in charge of student  employment in the department which involved about 100 students, in  charge of job placement, so I kept real busy. It was a challenge to do  research.  It was easier after I quit coaching.   So your research, your teaching mode wasn   t more to do research.  No, actually you got credit for the organized research. You got credit for  teaching, you got credit for extension. But there was no additional credit  for these extracurricular  activities .  You were the judging team coach, working with about 100 students for  student employment, advising about another 100, and then doing  research and teaching. Wow   That   s why I said I was fortunate to have really good graduate students  because they had to carry a lot of the research.  That   s incredible, Bob. You   re being modest. What was the nature of  your publications? Obviously in Animal Science, but are there any  specialty areas that you published primarily?  One of the areas I did a lot of research on was cattle type. We were in an  era where cattle were changing type from cattle that were too small  rapidly going to cattle that ultimately became too big. We were going  from cattle that in many cases did not produce enough milk to get real  high growth rate in calves, to cattle that gave a lot of milk. So I did a lot  of research involving cattle of different sizes and different milk  production potentials to, kind of, define what was an efficient, profitable  type. Involved in this scenario were a couple of national beef cattle  conferences, we did in the 1980s that brought about 800 people to  campus nationwide. So that was one of the research emphases.  Was foraging in any of your Animal Science, range management, any of  that?  Yes. Part of my research was evaluating various supplements that  enabled the cattle to best utilize their forage on the range. And again we  had tremendous range resources at Lake Carl Blackwell and Fort Reno.  20  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Bob, while you were still there, the Spirit Rider concept, do you  remember some of the evolution of that? It came out of the College of  Agriculture, I think maybe even out of your department. What was  Eddy   s last name, he was active in that      Findley, Eddie Findley , he was in Ag Education. He was really the  driving force, faculty wise, for the evolvement of that rider. In our  department, we were involved by virtue of sometimes providing the  horse and the facilities to stall the horse and assistance of that kind.  What do you remember of that? That   s become a huge fan favorite now  for a few sporting events, particularly football. What do you remember  about the inception? Did you hear some early conversations about that?  Well I remember this about the Spirit Rider. At the point when the  bronze was created that is located there between the Wrestling Hall of  Fame and Gallagher Iba, there was a lot of reservation on campus about  the appropriateness of that sort of mascot, if you will, in an era where  things had become more sophisticated. (Laughter)  We talked a little bit earlier about some of the deans you worked with.  Not only the deans but some of the faculty members you worked with  through years. Maybe some administrators you worked with, presidents  you worked with, vice presidents you worked with. Any of them stand out  in your mind over your lengthy career at OSU?  I guess I enjoyed working for all of the deans in different ways. We did  have some good deans, some good presidents. When I joined the faculty,  I guess Dr. Bennett was on leave with the Point Four Program and now  Al Darlow during some of those years was vice president. That may  have been after Dr. Willham became president, but I enjoyed working  under all of the presidents.  What do you remember about Dr. Willham? He came out of an ag  background.  Yes, he did. I didn   t have a course under him, I was just a year or two  late to have a course under him. But the thing I remember about him,  when I enrolled, at that time, he was enrolling every student that came  into agriculture, he was Vice Dean. And it is well known of course that  he had a tremendous memory. I could repeat this story a hundred times,  but I had one student by the name of Ray Billingsley who Dr. Willham  enrolled. Three months later Ray had some cattle on the Wichita Stock  Yards. Dr. Willham had a layover there and came out to the Stock Yards  just as a matter of interest. Ray saw him coming down the alley, he was  in his dirty overalls, but he said,    I   m not going to embarrass Dr.  21  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Willham by even acknowledging that I know him.    Well as he got close,  Dr. Willham said,    Well hello Ray. How are things in Waynoka?     (Laughter) I asked him once,    You always mention a person   s  hometown when you mention their name. Looks like to me that just  makes twice as many things to remember.    He said,    No that helps me  with the connection.    Invariably he always knew.  Great guy.  Yeah, tremendous. I can tell you a story about his son Richard. The first  year I joined the faculty, he was taking the junior courses. Glen Bratcher  taught one of these courses, an animal evaluation course or judging  course, if you will. But he was gone so much and I was his assistant that  I actually handled the class that semester. At the end of the semester,  Glen said,    Go ahead and make out the grades.    He said,    This is the  way I would do it. You can do it however you want to. This is kind of an  unusual course because it   s more difficult to assess the students and it   s  a course that is kind of difficult for some students. I give As, Bs and Cs  unless somebody doesn   t attend class or really goofs up. This is the way  I assign the grades. I rank them in numerical order, highest to lowest.     He said,    As you go down through there, you   ll find a big gap, a big  spread; that   s where I draw the line. People below that line are Bs. And  I   ll draw another line about another third of the way down separating the  Bs from the Cs. I don   t have any names with those grades, I just have the  ranking. Then I put the names back to those scores and make out their  grades, that way I   m not influenced by the student.    Well I did that, and  the first name under that A list was Richard Willham.  First one? High B.  First one. So I said, I better take this to Glen. I took the grades to him  and I said,    You   d better look at these.    He said,    Did you do the grades  like I do?    and I said,    Yes.    He said,    Well then that   s okay.    So the  next semester Richard Willham got a B in the second semester of that  same course. So I always took the blame for the only two Bs he made as  an undergraduate and I felt bad about it. I never did tell him what  actually evolved on that until about four or five years ago, if you can  believe that.  But then the rest of the story is, a couple of years ago, Joe Whiteman  was in the hospital. I was visiting him there and pretty soon he said,     You know, I never told anybody this story. I had Dick Willham in the  second semester of junior judging and when I made out the grades, he  had a B. (Laughter) And I thought well, you know, he   s son of the  president, I better take another look at this.    And then he said,    I thought  I better be true to my principles.    So he gave him a B. But all that time, I  22  Gill  Totusek  just assumed that I did the same thing the second semester, you know.  So then I had to go back to Mr. Willham that I just took half the blame.  (Laughter)  Over the years, you   ve got to have a lot of special memories. Do any of  them stand out in your mind?  Well, of course I was blessed to work with good students and good  fellow faculty members and good clientele, but I also had the good  fortune of being able to travel and meet a lot of people all over the  country. For example, on one occasion I was at an Angus field day out at  J.C. Penney   s farm. He not only had stores but he also had Guernsey  dairy cattle and Angus cattle, and his Angus place was on the Hudson  River. I went there to speak at that field day and Mr. Penney was there,  he was about 93 at the time. Very vigorous, booming voice. While the  rest of us used a P.A. system he disdained that. During the course of the  day I had a chance to visit with him several times. He told me he had  over 3,000 stores and I said,    Mr. Penney, with 3,000 stores, what   s your  biggest problem?    He said,    My young managers.    I said    What?    and  he said,    They   re resistant to change.    I said,    What?    He said,    Yeah,  my young managers are the most resistant to change.    That blew my  mind.  So I went back home and thought about that and I found it in our own  faculty, that was the situation to some extent, and then I realized why.  The older faculty members were secure, they had tenure, they had a lot  of experience to fall back on and they might think,    This might fit in.  This might be good.    But the young faculty members, they didn   t have  tenure, they didn   t have that experience and they were hesitant to take a  risk. I noticed that the most resistant to change on campus were the  students. I found that in the departmental clubs. If something had been  going on for 40 years, it might have died but they didn   t want to bury it.  So that really precipitated new perspectives. Old people are always  thought of as resistant to change, that   s not always true.  Let me mention another off campus person that was interesting. I was in  Georgia. I talked to the Georgia Cattlemen Association. They were  meeting in Augusta and the night before they had a reception. I was  going through the hors d'oeuvres line and a fellow next to me nudged me  and he said,    That   s Ms. Lillian sitting over there.    I said,    Who?    He  said,    Ms. Lillian, Jimmy Carter   s mother.    I said    Okay.    I wasn   t  aware of the politics thing so much at that time. When I finished the hors  d'oeuvres line I looked over there and she motioned at me, so I went  over there and she said,    Have a seat.    We visited and pretty soon she  said,    You   re not from around here are you?    I said,    Well no. How did  you decide that?    She said,    I noticed you only took one helping of each  23  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  hors d'oeuvres.    (Laughter) So we visited some more and she looked at  me and she said,    You   re Republican aren   t you?    I kind of sheepishly  admitted that I was and I said,    How can you tell?    She said,    I could  see it in your eyes.    I again was kind of apologetic and she said,    Oh  that   s okay. I like republicans. Jimmy doesn   t, but I do.    (Laughter)  What were some significant events in the life of the college and  university that you recall in your half century, nearly, with the college?  Not achievements or accomplishments, just events or campus activities.  One of the most significant years during my tenure there was in1957  when the first Sputnik orbited the earth and there was a sudden intense  move towards more science. OAMC became OSU. Animal Husbandry  became Animal Science and that same situation was apparent all across  the country.  What did you think about the name change? From Oklahoma A M to  Oklahoma State University?  I didn   t have any reservations about that at all.  Did some of the old Aggies disdain that new title a little bit?  That   s right. I could appreciate the necessity for increased emphasis on  the basic sciences, so I thought it was very appropriate. The same with  our name change in the department. The only reservation I had about the  name change in the department was Animal Science, but animal science  is so much more than science. It   s business, it   s production and  management. That   s the only reservation I had about that name change.  Bob, how would you hope people remember you? Of all the activities  you did and all the things, how do you hope people remember Bob  Totusek?  Well going back to my early comments, I hope they didn   t think I did  too much damage and at least maintained the level of the department  because it is a good department. I was extremely blessed to work for a  great university and a great department. I   m one of those fortunate  people and I didn   t realize how few there are in this country of loving to  go into work every day.  What parts of your job gave you the most satisfaction?  Working with people. Students, faculty members, grad students, staff  members, and the clientele off campus.  24  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Just working with people?  That   s what made the job fun. The challenges you could get along with  for the privilege of working with all these great people.  Some people really say,    Let me do my teaching, let me do my research.  I don   t want to mess with relationships.    What makes you feel the way  you do about that? I see the smile in your eyes, that you really enjoy  working with people. What makes you enjoy that?  I think it   s a privilege for every faculty member to work for people in  Oklahoma. And to do that, they need to know what the problems are in  animal agriculture in Oklahoma and have a hand in solving those  problems. Now the alternative in the science area for example, is for a  person to only worry about the research that he or she is doing and not  worry about what applies to Oklahoma. My contention is, for a large  part, the tax payers of Oklahoma pay our salary as faculty members, and  so our first obligation should be to them. And that doesn   t mean you  slight your own area of expertise, you   re just aware of the bigger picture.  Your first allegiance isn   t necessarily to the discipline, but your first  responsibility was to the people of Oklahoma. Were there any special  memories you have   you must have so many but were there any a-ha  experiences that you had?  I   m sorry I   m not doing a very good job of sorting those out because  there have been so many. I   ll mention one staff member in our  department. He   s manager of our Swine Education and Research Center,  Kim Brock. I had the privilege of hiring Kim and my thought at that  time, and I still think that way, that he could have done anything that he  aspired to. And I mean, no ceiling. Dean, I was thinking in academia,  especially dean, college president, he had that kind of ability. For several  years I really tried to get Kim to take graduate courses to work on that  MS and PhD. He took a few, but he wasn   t real enthusiastic about it.  Finally I said,    Well wait a minute, you   re always telling students in  seminars that the most important thing in life is to do what you like.  Nothing else is close.    And here   s a guy doing exactly what he likes.  Leave him alone. He   s the best in the country at what he does.  How have you seen your field of Animal Science change over the years  from the time you got into the profession to now? What major changes  have you seen or experienced?  A gradual change in more emphasis on science and admittedly, science  was evolving during that time. It wasn   t a matter of ignoring it but it was  just a matter of it beginning to evolve. For example, the first PhD  25  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  awarded at Oklahoma State University was in Animal Science in about  1948, the first PhD. That   s a reflection, of course, of research and  science. And some of our early faculty members like Jim Whatley and  Hilton Briggs came on in the later part of the 1930s and they were  instrumental in establishing research programs. So it wasn   t a matter of  ignoring the basics, it was just a matter of them evolving as the  department grew and progressed. Also the same is true of business.  There hadn   t been much emphasis on business in the early years but it  gradually became apparent that the students needed more business. For  example, I suggested this to our faculty and sometimes it   s slow to get  faculty to change. But we implemented requiring two courses in  accounting and implemented the business option. So those are some of  the changes that evolved over time.  What do you see in the future for the College of Agriculture at  Oklahoma State University?  Well, I think it   s got a tremendous future for obvious reasons. People  have to eat. It   s that simple. It   s always a challenge. Agriculture is  criticized a good deal, one thing, for being the recipient of some  subsidies, so to speak. I   m against subsidies. I was in New Zealand a  couple of times, for example. One of those times was when everything  was heavily subsidized. There was talk of stopping subsidies at that time  and it happened. But the livestock producers in New Zealand, especially  the sheep producers   they   re big in sheep   were just scared to death.  Next time I went back, it had happened and they had developed a lot  stronger market for their lambs than when they had subsidies, because  they had to promote their product, they had to produce a product that  appealed to the consumer. They were just a lot better off. So I   m against  subsidies.  But one of the reasons, probably, for some subsidies in agriculture here  is because many other countries in the world market have subsidies for  agriculture, many times real big. And the other thing, of course, from a  pragmatic stand point, agriculture is the only industry where you buy  retail and sell wholesale. With an abundance of food, there is much less  leverage for agriculture to command high prices. Agricultural production  has always been a tough, tough business. But again, people need to eat  and in the future there   d probably be a better place in agriculture.  I like the bumper sticker that says,    You   re never further away from  agriculture than your next meal.    (Laughter)  That   s right.  I always thought that was appropriate. Well it   s story time. You just  26  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  have a wealth of knowledge and stories. Some of them you probably  can   t tell, some of then you can. Can you share some stories and  experiences in the years?  Well as I said, I was blessed to work at a great university for a great  department. We talked about having more students than any department  in the University. Would you let me just mention two or three things that  are the reason for that? Of course the department has had a good  reputation over the years, especially in teaching. The teaching faculty in  our department has always had a close personal relationship with  students and people hear about that not only on campus but all over the  country, and so they appreciate that. I mentioned that we have students  typically from 35 to 38 states and that reputation as a good teaching  faculty is a factor, but also there were a couple more. We still have  animals in the department and that may sound kind of strange, but it   s  important because students like to work with animals if they   re  interested in animals. We have the luxury at OSU of having access to  resources that allows us to have animals. Many departments around the  country don   t have animals or very few animals. So that attracts  students.  Another thing is that we still have a number of judging teams     competitive judging teams that have a good reputation. A lot of kids  want to continue judging because they see the benefits in it. So a lot of  students from all over the country come to OSU for that reason. And  we   ve had students, I think, from every state in the country   Vermont  was the last one, other than Alaska and Hawaii. By the same token, we  have graduates that disperse all over the country and the world. A few  years ago we kind of checked this out, and at that time we had graduates  in every state except Alaska   we weren   t aware of one in Alaska   and  16 other countries.  Let   s hear the Rhode Island story.  Well, for a long time we didn   t have a student from Rhode Island. All of  a sudden Howard Tucker shows up. Howard   s from Slocom, Rhode  Island which is just west of Providence. His dad had 1,000 acres of rich  potato land and Howard hated potatoes so he wanted to come  somewhere where hogs were important because he loved hogs. He was a  very unique individual. In class at first I thought he was just disruptive,  because every two or three minutes up went Howard   s hand, he had a  question. And I gradually realized how important he was compared to  some other students because he brought out an opportunity to put an  emphasis on certain points. So I grew to really appreciate Howard. But  after he graduated, he moved back home. His dad wouldn   t have any  part of having hogs on his potato farm and he wouldn   t loan him any  27  Gill  Totusek  money to go outside. So Howard got a loan, rented an 80-acre farm and  started producing hogs on a small basis.  Anyway after about three years after he graduated, I visited him there.  We were sitting in his living room and as usual Howard was very  talkative, and all of a sudden he stopped and just stared out into space  for a couple of minutes and I didn   t know what was going on and finally  he said,    I   m going to tell you.    He said,    I don   t think they   ll take my  degree away from me at this point, so I   m going to tell you.    Well  Howard   s job for the Block and Bridle Rodeo that year was to take care  of the buggy horse which was kept at the beef barn and each evening he  would take that buggy horse and go down to the arena and hook up the  buggy and do some practice rounds around the arena. On this one  occasion, he got the horse and was on his way to the arena and he  remembered he had forgotten his billfold. He lived in Drummond Hall  across the street from the beef barn. So he went up to the dorm. A guy  came outside and Howard said,    Hey buddy, will you hold my horse for  just a couple of minutes? I left my billfold upstairs.    The fellow said,     Well I don   t have time.    But he said,    Why don   t you just take your  horse with you? There   s nobody else around here.     Howard said,    I don   t know what possessed me. But I took the horse  inside with this guy   s help, got on the elevator, pressed 8, which was my  floor, and the elevator stopped on 7 because somebody had pushed the  button.    The doors opened up and I said,    Going up?    and this guy just  about panicked and said,    Not now     Howard went on up to eight and  the doors opened, and actually this was a little different than the story  you   ve heard before. He thought,    Oh my gosh, what am I doing? What  am I doing?    He didn   t even take the horse off. He just pushed the first  floor  button  and went down and he was fortunate there still wasn   t  anybody around. He got the horse back outside and he said it was really  tough for one person to go through two double doors with a horse   (Laughter) He got the horse outside the door; no sooner had he gotten  there this police car pulled up and stopped and Howard thought,    This is  the end of my time at OSU. I won   t get a degree. My dad   s not going to  be happy.    The policeman rolled the window down and said,    Fellow,  would you please get your horse away from the dorm? We don   t like  them that close to the dorm.    (Laughter)  You have got to have a lot of good stories like that, Bob   Oh, there are a lot of good ones  The thing that impressed me about so  many of our students back in the 1950s and continuing on to later years  and as I mentioned earlier, it   s still true today, a lot of students in  Animal Science go through without any help, period. We   re blessed in  the department of having a lot of livestock units and a lot of laboratories,  28  Gill  Totusek  and so about 100 students can work in the laboratory or work and live at  one of the livestock units with no rent and sometimes a capability of  food preparation, a temporary stove and a microwave and a little  refrigerator, so they can make it through by working in the summer time   at an off-campus job to save some money for the school year .  I learned early on not to ever give up on a student. One particular year,  there was a student who worked at the beef barn and he would almost  make his grades each year, but not quite, so he would be put on  probation. He would go out and work and get some more money and  sometimes make his grades to stay in but maybe he wouldn   t, it was off  and on. I think it took him seven years to get that degree. Didn   t know  what in the world he would do, but he disappeared at graduation time.  Didn   t come by for help or anything. And at the same time, there was  another young man, I   m not going to mention their names, who I  thought was just about that close to being an outlaw. He never did get in  trouble with the law, but always a rebel, you know. Kind of hard to  manage. Didn   t know what he would develop into. Didn   t know where  he   d go; again he didn   t come by.  About five years later, I was down in Jackson, Mississippi for some  meetings and they had a trade show there. I started down through that  trade show and a fellow hollered at me and said,    Hey Dr. Totusek   We   ve got one of your students that   s just doing a heck of a job.        Yeah? What   s his name?    He mentioned the first guy that I mentioned.  So the light came on, you know. I hadn   t gone 50 steps and another  fellow did the same thing,    Hey Dr. Totusek, we   ve got one of your  graduates that   s just outstanding. Got a good work ethic, very  productive.       What   s his name?    It was the second guy that I mentioned.  (Laughter) So I learned to never give up on  students .  Did you ever find out anymore about those two guys?  Well they   re both still doing very well. And you know, we tend to think  when we   re in the classroom, we tend to revere those people who make  A   s. We kind of hold them up as the epitome, because it not only means  that they're smart, but they benefited from our teaching so we feel good  about them. But I   ve noticed so many students who maybe were 2.5  students and I can mention several that just barely got over that 2.0 that  just made outstanding citizens and really successful professionals. So  over the years I began to view this thing of grades differently. Of course,  we always appreciated students with good grades, especially if they  wanted to go on to grad school, but I knew there was a place for a lot of  them. And the thing that really impressed me during the 1950s and  1960s, I started to say awhile ago, I got sidetracked, so many of those  kids came off of poor farms and made their own way through school.  29  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Totusek  Gill  Had one or two jobs, sometimes three, no scholarships. The only help  they had was working for the department, which was important.  That   s been the way with some of our significant donors. Sometimes it   s  surprising how they turn out. Bob, again you   ve got such a span,  anything we haven   t covered? Some things you   d like to share?  One of my favorite grade stories involves me, so I hesitate to tell it, but  it was interesting to me at the time. My major professor looked at my  transcript and thought I was a prime candidate for the fast track of some  kind. So he put me in an organic chemistry course that only chemical  engineers and chemists took. I didn   t know a soul in there, but this   instructor  came in the first day of class and,    Here   s the book we are  using. I wrote it. There   s no need for me to lecture because you can read  it in the book. Here   s the scenario: we have lecture Tuesdays and  Thursdays. On Tuesdays I   ll answer questions for 20 minutes and then  we   ll have a quiz for the rest of the hour. On Thursdays, we   ll have an  hour exam.    That was every week, and I wasn   t a chemist. I worked  really hard. It wasn   t unusual to stay up until two or three o   clock  in the  morning  working. I couldn   t make much above a 50; I never made a  grade over a 60, and you know what I was thinking.  Glen Bratcher came by in the fall that semester and said,    Well how are  you doing?    and I said,    Well I   m doing okay except in organic  chemistry. I   m flunking it.    Well the next spring I went back to OSU  and I ran into Glen and he said,    How did you come out in that organic  chemistry course?    and I sheepishly said,    Well I got an A in it.    He  said,    I   m never going to believe anything you say again.    Here   s the  scenario. I didn   t know anybody else in that class, and he graded on a  curve, and I actually ended up with the highest grade in that class  because I was so scared, and another thing contributed to my A. We had  to identify two unknowns in there and I was not a good lab man. I didn   t  care much for lab at all. We had two unknowns which means you had a  little vial of compound material and you have to identify it in a series of  chemical tests and write down what it is. It could be salt just as a simple  example. Again, I put in a lot of long weekends and I got both of mine, I  was the only one that got them both. That shows you what fear will do   Fear and ignorance. I was ignorant as to what was going on.  That   s a good story. What would you share with your colleagues in the  department in the college? What suggestions would you have from  experience   what would you pass along?  Work hard and be ethical in everything you do.  Anything else?  30  Totusek  Gill  I   ll think of some more things tomorrow. Can I come back? (Laughter)  We talked about our students coming from many states. We also had  graduates that go into many states. Maybe I mentioned that before, but  we   ve always had a good demand for our graduates and I think one  reason is because our previous graduates have done such a good job that  people take note of that and come to us. A lot of people take note that  many of our graduates don   t end up in animal agriculture. We have a lot  of course that do, in animal production and research and the food  industry and so on. We also have quite a few graduates that go into  veterinary medicine and surprisingly, quite a few that go into medicine.  There have been times that we had graduates that couldn   t get into vet  medicine but could get into med school and it   s because they have a  good background of science   chemistry and biology, genetics, nutrition  and so on.  But we also have quite a few students that go to law school. And that   s  interesting. One reason is because a law degree will allow them to  practice anywhere; if they want to go back to their hometown they can  do that, so we encourage a lot of them to do that. Another thing is that  we have some courses that I think help people to prepare to go into any  field. Courses that cause students to think. In our judging courses, for  example, they learn to observe, gather facts, evaluate those facts and  make a decision in a very short time, and then also in a very short time,  like two minutes in a case of oral reasons, defend their placing. I   ve had  a number of people who have gone to law school who told me that that  was a real asset to them. It was also a real asset to any manager activity  so we have people in life insurance business, you name it, and they  credit a lot of their success many times to these courses.  A case in point, about five years ago, a young man who graduated in the  1980s looked me up, made a special point to track me down. He said,     The most important educational activity I had to prepare me for law  school was those judging courses I took. There   s very little difference  between a two minute set of oral reasons and a closing argument in the  court room.    This guy was the assistant district attorney in one of the  metropolitan areas in Oklahoma. So I think there are some unique things  that have allowed us to enjoy a good job market for our graduates.  Those are good points, I   m glad you made them.  -------  -------
