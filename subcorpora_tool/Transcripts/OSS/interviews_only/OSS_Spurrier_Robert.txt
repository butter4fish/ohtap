 Finchum Today is February 3, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum and along with me  is Dr. Charles Abramson. Today, we are in Old Central on the OSU campus  to talk with Dr. Robert Spurrier, former director of OSU   s Honor College.  Thank you for having us today.  Spurrier Oh you   re welcome.  Finchum Our topic for the day, a little bit later, will be Phi Beta Kappa. We   ll start by  learning a little bit about you first, beginning with when and where you were  born.  Spurrier Okay. I was born in Kansas City, Missouri, that part of the state we  pronounce it Missour-uh, not Missour-ie, in 1944.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Spurrier My dad was a lawyer and my mom was a court reporter.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Spurrier One younger brother.  Finchum So were you the boss of the family?  Spurrier Right. (Laughs) I probably aspired to that goal. I   m not sure I ever got there.  Finchum Where did you go to elementary school?  Spurrier Elementary school in Butler, Missouri. We moved there, I guess, when I was  in kindergarten. Small town about an hour south of Kansas City. For a long  time I knew the population, because for one decade in the census it was  5  3,333 so it wasn   t too hard to remember. Butler Elementary School was  about three houses down the block from us so it was a real small town.  Finchum Would you go home for lunch?  Spurrier Yes, most of the time I did.  Finchum And one through eight or one through six?  Spurrier That was one through eight in those days.  Finchum Have a favorite subject?  Spurrier Probably whatever I was studying at the time. That was before any of them  got too tough.  Finchum About how many were in your class?  Spurrier Oh, I would imagine probably around   you mean the entire class of people  my age?  Finchum Yes.  Spurrier In high school it was around sixty. So it probably would   ve been broken up  into smaller classes in grade school.  Finchum What was the name of high school?  Spurrier Butler High School. They   re really creative there.  Finchum And you graduated when?  Spurrier  In  1962.  Finchum And did you have a favorite subject once you got into high school?  Spurrier Again, I had a range. Probably American history, math, science. You could  mention more and I thoroughly enjoyed most of them.  Finchum Did you have an idea at that point of what you wanted to do career wise?  Spurrier No, but my father did. He thought I should be a lawyer.  Finchum And how did you get out of that?  6  Spurrier Well, I went to the University of Missouri in Columbia, got a bachelor   s  degree, went into law school, and got there. I realized my first semester I  had a natural ability. It came very easily to me, but it wasn   t something I  wanted to do the rest of my life. I called the political science department to  see if they had any money lying around and if I could get back in graduate  school the second semester. My old advisor said they could find something  and after reading the story of the return of the prodigal son and how that got  worked out, it was from there on pretty much a straight line to graduate  school, the doctorate program out in California, and then back here to teach.  Finchum How did you break the news to your father?  Spurrier Over the Christmas break, because in those days you actually came back  after Christmas for a couple of weeks of classes and took finals. I actually  decided before I took my law school finals that I was going to change gears.  I wanted to do well of course, but I don   t think the pressure was on me as  much as it was for my fellow students, but I was blessed and did really well.  Got out of town quickly.  Finchum Was it on the quarter system?  Spurrier Semester. Semester started much later than it does now in the fall.  Finchum So you graduated with your doctorate in 19     Spurrier Seventy-two.  Finchum Let   s back up. Were you a member of Phi Beta Kappa when you were an  undergraduate?  Spurrier Undergraduate at Mizzou? Yes.  Finchum How did you become aware that was even an option or going to happen?  Spurrier I think I had heard of it before, because one of my almost major professors  in political science was active in the Phi Beta Kappa chapter. It was simply  someone at some point said,    You   ve been elected. Do you accept?    And so  forth. It was kind of out of the blue in that sense. I sort of hoped I would be,  because I knew about the class rank we had, things like that, several of us. It  was that   just like I said it just sort of showed up,    Here you are.     Finchum Were your parents pleased?  Spurrier I think so.  Finchum Aware of how significant?  7  Spurrier That I don   t know, to be honest with you.  Finchum But you knew it then.  Spurrier I knew at that time and that it was a big deal in Arts and Sciences.  Finchum Did that come into play in grad school?  Spurrier Not for my master   s because I went to undergraduate there so it was just  kind of a known quantity. Graduate school for the doctorate program was  one of the strangest things. I went through ROTC. Back in those days in a  land grant school males had to take ROTC for two years. That was  mandatory. It was part of the Morrill Act so you had to do that. It was the  time of the Vietnam War. I figured I   m going to have to wind up over there  probably anyway, so I might as well do the second two years of ROTC,  which will get you a commission if you   re going in as an officer. Of course I  had an appointment with the Judge Advocate General Corps when I was in  law school and of course that sort of had to change when I told them I didn   t  want to go to law school. But they let me shift over to a master   s in political  science and that was not a problem.  Then the rules were you could go for one advanced degree and then on  active duty, for three years in this case, and then whatever they   ve given you  after that. So the Army, in its own dutiful way, sent me a piece of paper  much like the thing you were having me sign a minute ago.    This will  certify that blank is completing his medical residency in this hospital,     which didn   t seem to fit what I was doing. There was a phone number,  somewhere I found, for Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana. That was where  the paperwork people were. I   d talked to the lady there a time or two over a  couple of years. Called the Fort there and she apparently was out to lunch, or  who knows where she was, so I get the commanding general, who   s in  charge of all the offices in this academic delay program all over the country.  He said,    Oh we messed up. We   ll send you the right form. What are you  going to do after you get your master   s?    I said,    Well Sir,    I knew enough  to do that,    Go on active duty and go back and get a doctorate.       That kind  of sounds dumb. Why don   t you get the doctorate first?    I said,    Well Sir,  my understanding is the rules say you can only have one advanced degree.     He said,    They do, but I can make an exception to that. You get yourself  accepted to a doctorate program, and I   ll grant a waiver, and you can get  your doctorate first.     So I went rushing, as you might imagine, up to the political science  department at the University of Missouri and said,    Okay, where do I go  guys?    One of them said,    You go to Princeton.    The other guy says,    No,  8  you go to the University of California in Santa Barbara because the top guy  in what you want to do just went there from the University of Chicago.    I  had no great desire to go back East and the cold and all that good stuff,  Santa Barbara sounded sort of nice. The guy that was there I was kind of  familiar with. The guy telling me to go to Santa Barbara had a Princeton  doctorate. Princeton was not what they used to be, as far as he was  concerned, in political science.  Okay. So I applied to UC Santa Barbara. I had not taken the graduate record  exam, and they said,    Well write letters for your stuff and send it out there.     And lo and behold, I was accepted, given a teaching assistantship. A month  later, maybe, I got a letter that said,    You can   t have the teaching  assistantship. We found a fellowship for you.    I never applied for this.     We   re just going to give you the free money instead.    So I show up out  there whenever and off we go. Just one of those things. I think the Lord  must have had a plan, because I had no way to put that one together, even  with scheming or plotting no way I possibly could have. Went up there and  once I got my doctorate, I applied and got a job back here. Jobs were nice.  Just was thoroughly happy for the next forty-two years at OSU.  Meanwhile the Vietnam War is over and I go for active duty, for training,  one summer in Arizona, and then   because I   d been on paper so long I ran  out of military obligation. They had no need at that time for junior officers.  I   m a captain by now in the Army Reserves, but that was the end of my  military career. I was there for a summer and on paper susceptible to being  called anytime they wanted to for that six-year period.  Finchum Almost GI Bill in reverse.  Spurrier Sort of, yeah. Somebody else paid for it, not the federal government.  Somebody in California was paying for it.  Finchum Did you get married along the way somewhere?  Spurrier I was married up there and unfortunately divorced, and then remarried back  in Oklahoma.  Finchum OSU was your first academic job after your PhD?  Spurrier Right. They hired me and put up with me ever since.  Finchum Did you apply for other places?  Spurrier I did a couple of other places. I wanted a school that would emphasize  teaching, not just research and stuff, so that was most what I was looking  for. In those days you just sent letters out to any place that the placement  9  folks out in California thought there might be a job. Not nearly as organized  as it is now. This is the one that came through with a visit and offer pretty  quickly. I didn   t have to worry about the others.  Finchum When you were growing up in Missouri, were you aware of Oklahoma  State?  Spurrier Not really until I was in college. They had a good baseball team even back  in those days, and they would come up and play in football. I had a great-aunt  and uncle who lived in Muskogee, so we were down here from time to  time. At least I had been in and around Oklahoma.  Finchum And you ended up back in the middle of the country.  Spurrier Absolutely. I got back here as fast I could from California. I know some  people out there just love it, but it was way too fast a pace of life for me.  Finchum Nice weather though.  Spurrier Yeah, if you don   t mind having one season. I kind of missed the  thunderstorms in the spring, and the snow in the winter. It was tough to have  a campus with its own beach and mountains a few miles in behind. Someone  had to go to school there. (Laughs)  Finchum Who was the president of OSU when you came here?  Spurrier Bob Kamm was president way back when. I believe he was   yeah, he was  the first one I remember, so I think he was then.  Finchum That was    72. Had they already applied for round one for Phi Beta Kappa?  Spurrier I believe so, and I believe what happened, there was some flap in the  sociology department and we wound up on AAUP  American Association of  University Professors  censure. Even though I think that was resolved, or  was eventually, one of the Phi Beta Kappa rules in those days was that they  would not grant a chapter to any institution on AAUP censure. I think that  probably changed later, but that was at least the issue on that one. Couldn   t  even apply then.  Then we got ready to apply and had a new president. Another rule they had  they would not visit a campus in the first x number of years in a new  presidency. So out we go on that one, couldn   t make it that time.  Somewhere, the rumor mill was, we   d been told we looked really good, but  we have to go through all these hoops.  10  Then we had a site visit, probably somewhere in the    70s. I was the faculty  coordinator person, kind of like Perry  Gethner  was, and we were  successful. They sent three visitors out from very small eastern private  schools. To say there was not a fit with what we were trying to do and what  they were expecting was probably as a safe thing. So they recommended  against our being granted a chapter. Then, Charles, you can probably help  me on this. We applied a couple times after that, but didn   t even make the  cut...  Abramson That   s right.  Spurrier    for a visit by the people from Phi Beta Kappa. Let   s see, it was President  Halligan, I think it was, that invited John Churchill to come out and meet  with faculty and students to get a better feel for things. Then they had the  application that was, a couple of years later   it may have been more than a  couple. They had that application that was successful, we got the visiting  team. I   m told that at that time Phi Beta Kappa   s attitude toward land grant  schools was much different than it was back in the    70s. There had been a  number of other schools that   like Texas Tech, places like that that were  granted chapters.  Finchum How did you get involved with the effort?  Spurrier The first time around I got sort of drafted by George Gries, the dean of Arts  and Sciences, as I recall. I   m not quite sure why. Maybe I was gullible and  would take on something, but then nothing much happened as far as a visit  until the one which we were successful. We did some paperwork a time or  two, and then I was fully involved in Honors, so my part of it began to be  less broad Arts and Sciences and more focusing on the Honors operations.  Finchum When you first came they were, of course, aware that you were Phi Beta  Kappa?  Spurrier Yes, I   d assume so.  Finchum Do you know how many of  faculty  were needed?  Spurrier I do not. There were enough to get us into the site visit category. I don   t  know what the minimum number was or minimum percentage was in those  days.  Finchum What was your role, what was the main thing you did in those various  applications?  Spurrier The first one was just kind of coordinate, draw things together, set up the  meetings, all of the logistical stuff you did, and help with the paperwork  11  package you have to send in. I really can   t recall the specifics. I   m sure  somebody else was doing all the data gathering. Then after that as I said, I  became more focused on the Honors part of the operation in Arts and  Sciences. I moved into that role in    88, I believe, 1988.  Finchum There was a relationship, though, between the Honors program getting up  and running here and the application being successful, wasn   t there? I mean  some kind of connection.  Spurrier Phi Beta Kappa   s certainly has always been, as I understand, favorably  disposed, set up, in certain programs, honors programs, particularly in larger  schools. Exactly how much it was related I suppose Dean Stringer may have  a better guess at the overall historical thinking since he was on the Board of  Regents. I know we   ve always pitched it as part of the deal, at least the  times I   d been involved.  Finchum I think I was reading somewhere that the renovation, getting that up and  running, helped move the application forward.  Spurrier That I don   t know, what their thinking was on their end, but certainly it was  something we could showcase, that the university had made a major  commitment of funds to a facility for the Honors College. Of course by that  time Honors was much bigger than just for Arts and Sciences students. It  was university wide.  Finchum Was there any point where they were going to say,    Okay, we   ve done  enough. They said no. We   re stopping, we   re not trying again.   ?  Spurrier No, I don   t think so. I think there were enough people who were committed  to try. We did have some faculty back in the    70s and even later who were  adamantly opposed to it, because they didn   t believe the University valued  their part of the curriculum sufficiently. So they literally were writing letters  to the national office opposing OSU   s application.  Finchum Campaigning against you.  Spurrier Pretty much. That, as far as I know, did not happen this last time. I know it  happened back in the earlier ones.  Finchum Do you recall the day that you got the news that it had passed? Been  approved?  Spurrier Yeah, I was down at the national meeting. I was one of the ones they took  down to Florida. We went to the national meeting there, big conference  hotel and stuff. This time we were voted on the spot, we were not in the  room, but we were told shortly thereafter. By that time, it was pretty obvious  12  that things were   everybody was telling us that things were going our way.  And they had changed the rules also that you could not object from the floor  and pontificate against somebody   s application without first having raised it  and giving them a chance to respond and all this stuff. It had to be in writing  I believe, Charles can correct me. It was much more difficult for somebody  to pop up and try to torpedo something. I guess at least by some peoples     memory that had been known to happen before.  Finchum Did the group celebrate?  Spurrier Got in a plane and headed right back to Stillwater, but we were quite happy.  Then we had some sort of an event here, but I honestly can   t recall what it  was but a little affair.  Finchum Let   s back up a little bit. When you were inducted, do you have any  memories from that particular ceremony?  Spurrier None. (Laughs)To be perfectly honest with you, I do not. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you get, is it a key?  Spurrier A key and that was pretty much it, a certificate and stuff.  Abramson Do you remember the secret handshake?  Spurrier Oh, no. Vaguely, I know there was one. I do remember that. They   ve even  wiped that out now, as far as being in any secret. I   m sure I forgot that a  long time ago, Charles. (Laughs)  Finchum Do you have a role in it today?  Spurrier Not today. I was semi-drafted to be on the executive committee for the last  year I was here, before I retired in 2014. So tried to help out a little bit there.  I really didn   t have that much to do and the other guys and gal were doing  the heavy lifting I think.  Finchum But you got to stay long enough to get it.  Spurrier I did and through our persistence. It was one of the high points, I think, of  my career at OSU was to see that finally granted.  Finchum Along the way, too, did you have students that were under you that received  a nomination to be in it?  Spurrier Just the last year or so because that   s the only time they would   ve had a  chance. There were dozens and dozens in my humble opinion that should   ve  13  been inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa, but of course we didn   t have a  chapter. The quality for Phi Beta Kappa, absolutely.  Finchum When you   re involved with honors students you would expect that to be the  case. I understand Tulsa got theirs before us.  Spurrier Yes, Tulsa and OU both had them for quite a while before we got one.  Finchum Would they go to bat for you and for OSU?  Spurrier I believe both of them did. When we were in Florida they were both in favor  of it. They came over for the chapter induction, whatever they called it,  when they grant the chapter. We had it in the Old Central Assembly Hall.  Representatives from OU and TU were here, participated in that and of  course we appreciated that.  Finchum You attended the first induction ceremony here on campus?  Spurrier Right.  Finchum Any special memories from that day?  Spurrier Just a part of me said it   s about time. (Laughs) A lot of fun. I think perhaps  students today don   t appreciate the significance of Phi Beta Kappa the way  they would back when I was in school. First of all there are so many of the  quote,    honor societies   , out there now trying to get money out of the  students. Before long they have such a plethora of them claiming to be  honor societies. A lot of times the students   and some of them are inviting  students as young as sophomores. By the time they get to Phi Beta Kappa  it   s just one more of these people coming along, and I would have students  ask me,    Is this going to be really an important one, or not?    I know the  ones here in the Honors College, the majority of them were, I was trying to  help get the word out to them that    Yes this is definitely a big deal. You  don   t want to not accept this one.     Finchum They pay a fee to join?  Spurrier Yes, but I believe our chapter has some money if they can   t afford it. I  believe there was one young man the first year, literally just couldn   t afford  it. Somehow the chapter came up with the funds to take care of him. It   s not  a huge amount, it   s a one-time thing. It   s not every year coming back for  more money from you.  Finchum The induction ceremony was in this building?  14  Spurrier In the Assembly Hall, which is the large ornate room on the top floor of Old  Central.  Finchum And the significance of having it there?  Spurrier This is the original building so this would   ve been   the cream of the crop of  Oklahoma would   ve been, and Oklahoma Territory in those days too, they  would   ve been in that room. First graduating class of OSU   the graduates  went across that little platform in there, so it was just historical continuity. It  was great.  Finchum That   s pretty neat.  Spurrier It was.  Finchum Someone was thinking, to do it there?  Spurrier Yeah, I think, I   m not sure whose idea it was. I remember we all just kind of  stumbled on it at once.  Abramson Most people in the room, you and Perry and some others,    This is the place  we   ll have it.     Finchum Well, the people who attend, is it just the students or can their families come  if they want?  Spurrier Families can certainly come. The faculty here that are Phi Beta Kappa  members are invited and the majority of those showed up, for the first one at  least. Also when we had the team here visiting OSU, reviewing us, we had a  dinner for the Phi Beta Kappa faculty. We had a huge turnout for that. They  were   the visitors were quite surprised at the large turnout compared to  most places they go. That was a good sign that the faculty were supportive  as well.  Abramson Yeah. It was at the Alumni Center.  Spurrier Right.  Finchum Were there any hurdles that the committee had you address from the site  visit?  Spurrier I think most of it was in the paperwork stage. They were really specific on  what you had to have lined up and everything. I think one of the committee  members were very much involved and concerned about Native Americans  at the University and stuff. Fortunately, OSU, I think, had the record of the  most Native American graduates, but also in Honors that   s by far the largest  15  non-Caucasian population and so when we got to Florida for the   he was  sort of our person making a sales pitch, the spokesperson from the review  team speaking to the assembled group. He was going on and on about  Native Americans and I thought,    Okay. You   ve ridden this hobby horse  enough probably    but I looked around the room and there was an awful lot  of heads nodding up and down that this was a good thing. So he knew his  audience a lot better than I did. What they didn   t need to know a lot of them  were blonde, blue-eyed Cherokee. He didn   t have the facts quite set up with  what was in his mind. It was interesting just to see that.  Finchum What a process it was.  Spurrier It was, it was an intriguing process and not nearly so brutal as it was in years  past. I guess the last couple go arounds they had   the committee   s  recommendation, I think, carried more weight than it probably did ten,  twenty years ago. Anybody would feel free to try and blow everything up on  the floor during the discussion. They voted, this time, on computers so it  wasn   t each one could stand up and vote and try to talk it down and stuff.  That was a possibility, at least in the past.  Finchum So it had to win by a certain percentage? Do you know what the vote count  was?  Spurrier Oh, Charles check me on this. I want to say it was a two-thirds majority, but  it had to be three-quarters of the chapters represented. It was some double  super-majority, but I can   t remember if it was two-thirds or three-quarters.  Finchum Didn   t have to be unanimous.  Spurrier No, but it did have to be more than a simple majority. Both numbers in that  room voting and also of all the chapters, maybe all the other chapters  nationally, not just the ones in the room. Again, it   s been a while since. If  you asked me at the time I could   ve told you.  Abramson But I believe we passed with flying colors.  Spurrier Yes, I believe we were told that.  Finchum And the significance of having one on campus?  Spurrier Just a national affirmation of the quality of undergraduate education of  liberal arts and sciences. Only about 10 percent, I think it is, of all colleges  and universities have Phi Beta Kappa chapters. That puts you in a nice  category.  Finchum I understand along the way the library had some deficiencies.  16  Spurrier I think that was one of the things, right. One time they thought the  humanities weren   t getting their share of the pie. At least that was back in  the    70s that was one of the concerns.  Abramson The sports scandal.  Spurrier Yes, and the sports    problems we ran into back in those days and after that.  Dexter Manley testifying in Congress that   many people thought he got a  degree when he couldn   t read. He didn   t get a degree, but how he got as far  as he did was enough of a scandal in terms of credit hours. Yeah, that didn   t  help us in those days.  Finchum And teaching, student load, teacher-student load?  Spurrier It   s certainly lighter than it was in those days in most departments. Not so  sure in foreign languages they   d give you that given their teaching load they  have over there. It probably has changed. It certainly has changed in the  social sciences.  Finchum And having a foreign language is one of the requirements for membership?  Spurrier We have it as one. Is that required, Charles? Or strongly recommended?  Abramson Yes.  Finchum Which one did you speak?  Spurrier Spanish, after a fashion, way back then. I would hate to be quizzed on that  all these years later. (Laughs)  Finchum Moving forward, what do you see? This developing here on campus more  or     Spurrier Phi Beta Kappa?  Finchum Yes.  Spurrier I really don   t know, because I   m out of touch pretty much. I   m teaching this  year just because Keith Garbutt, the new Honors  College  dean, needed  somebody to teach a couple of courses I used to teach. This is kind of a short  term, one time, I   m not sure. The nice thing is I don   t have to worry about  the administrative stuff or any of that anymore. I   m perfectly happy to let  somebody else worry about it. Unfortunately, some of the things   one of  the things I really miss is advising students and being in close contact with  them as they   re getting ready to move on out of here. That   s the kind of  17  thing that if I were here I   m sure I   d be active in trying to promote the Phi  Beta Kappa chapter, but living in Edmond it   s a little hard to do on any kind  of a regular basis.  Finchum Have any other institutions asked for help in pushing their applications  forward that you are aware of?  Spurrier I don   t know, and I would not be aware of it. I   ve been out of pocket.  Finchum The biggest hurdle?  Spurrier The most recent one was getting all the data pulled together in a coherent  way. Marv Keener, he helped some on that I think. The folks over in the  Arts and Sciences    dean   s office and then Institutional Research were just  fantastic in pulling all sorts of stuff together.  Abramson Bruce Crauder.  Spurrier Yeah, Bruce was really instrumental.  Finchum And having computers nowadays would help with that.  Spurrier It helped. And the honors stuff we had records going back for a long ways.  Others did too, but some of it you just had to start pulling out of the  databases the Institutional Research has and that Bruce could get his hands  on for Arts and Sciences.  Finchum Did those naysayers that campaigned against it come back around and get  on board at some point?  Spurrier There were two of them I remember being most vociferous. One had passed  away so there was no opposition there, at least that we were aware of. The  other one came around, I guess, at last. He certainly didn   t oppose.  Abramson I   m not sure it   s the same one we   re thinking about, but I wrote him a letter.  You know we had the site visit and you don   t want to have problems.  Everybody wants to be on the same page, and everything worked out fine.  Spurrier Seemed to me he showed up to the faculty dinner and everything went   it  seemed to go smoothly. I don   t know what had happened, but something had  happened in the meantime to make things better as far as     Finchum Just time passing maybe?  Spurrier I just don   t know.  18  Finchum In process thirty-something years. I mean this had been going twenty-four  years or something like that.  Abramson I remember I was sitting at one of the tables and someone was complaining  to one of the site visitors about the differences in male and female salaries  here. That was just totally wrong because they were comparing   in that  salary range they included the salary of the department head, which is  maybe two to three times more than anyone else. It was not a valid  comparison. Once that was pointed out then it was better.  Spurrier You kind of wish people would raise that with the committee beforehand so  they can resolve it. Then on the other hand it probably made it seem like it  was a legitimate open thing, if you   re on the committee coming in. I know  sometimes when I did external reviews in the honors program, Honors  College, you get a little suspicious if everybody sings to the same tune and  doesn   t have at least some little bit of differences. On the other hand, every  school has one or two of these folks who are never pleased with anything  and they usually spot them pretty quickly. We were blessed to have almost  everybody, as far as I know, pulling along and were broadly across the  institution. It wasn   t just about the liberal arts and sciences.  Finchum Well it came through several presidents during that time, from 1972 until it  was awarded, and President Hargis was all for it.  Spurrier Right.  Finchum Was President Hargis a member?  Spurrier No. He was a business major I think as an undergraduate. This is just liberal  arts and sciences.  Abramson Liberal arts.  Finchum Honorary member, maybe.  Spurrier He is now.  Finchum That would make sense.  Spurrier Yeah. We had kind of a certain number you could do the first year, to  induct. So Dean Stringer was one, Burns Hargis, and Trish Houston  Prawl ,  who had been active outside of the University and been very supportive. In  fact she was working on having an endowed chair over in English  Houston-  Truax-Wentz Professorship . It was kind of part of a package as I recall. I   m  drawing a blank on a couple of the other people. Was Bob Graalman one of  the first batch?  19  Abramson Don   t know.  Finchum We can look it up.  Spurrier I   ll claim old age. My memory is not     Abramson What I remember about that is that I almost knocked Dean Stringer down.  Spurrier Probably not a good idea.  Abramson I was the one in charge of bringing him to the podium.  Spurrier Did he talk about the mortgage they burned that night?  Abramson He did.  Spurrier Okay, good.  Finchum We had hoped that they   d saved a copy before they burned it, but we don   t  know if they did or not.  Abramson I don   t think they did.  Spurrier I don   t know. He claimed he had the original one.  Finchum It would   ve been neat to have.  Spurrier Gone up in smoke.  Finchum So you remember that ceremony?  Spurrier Yeah. That was kind of after the hype was over.  Finchum Was that planned or just kind of     Spurrier Oh no. That was part of the deal.  Finchum To burn it?  Spurrier He made the president at the time give him this thing, and he would burn it  at the time it was paid off by getting a chapter. It was part of it.  Finchum How much   I mean do you have any idea how much the mortgage was?  20  Spurrier Oh no. It was just,    I   m going to keep this and this is a promissory note. We  are going to get one sometime.     Finchum Symbolic.  Spurrier I believe that was it, yes.  Finchum It is expensive     Spurrier Yeah, application fees, stuff drawing things together, and how many of us  flew down to Florida? Probably six or seven maybe?  Abramson Six or seven.  Spurrier They chartered a plane for that, twin engine plane to go down there and  back. Fastest way to get there and back as far as the transit from the airport  and so on. We can just walk out, hop on, have a car waiting on you at the  other end, but I think that that kind of gesture is the thing the president had  done. Also, I think he went back to the Phi Beta Kappa headquarters and  with the application and all that. It made it obvious from the very top that  there was a real commitment to it.  Finchum And you believe they would keep going if they hadn   t got it in    12? They  would   ve tried again?  Spurrier I hope so. I assume so. I think having several of us on the ground in Florida  helped because a couple questions did come up and we were able to pull up  online degree sheets and stuff.    No, that   s not what that means.    People  from our committee can then take that back to the people raising the  questions. We didn   t have a chance to talk with   they can take that  information back and different aspects of things.  Finchum So even that part was a multi-step   where they would ask questions and  figure it out, come back?  Spurrier Right. They would have   people once they got there could ask the  Committee on Qualifications, I believe it   s called   give them questions and  then they would   if they didn   t already know the answer, I suspect most of  them they did. A couple of them popped up. One was I think,    Could you  get a degree with almost no math?    or something. Somebody looked up a  degree sheet and didn   t have a clue. It just didn   t look like it to them. So  once we talked them through our gen ed (general education) requirements  they   I think that was math, that took care of that.  Abramson As Perry  Gethner  mentioned in the last interview, it certainly helped that  one of the members had an OSU connection. I think his father went to OSU.  21  Spurrier They also had one of their national luminaries, which was apparently a good  friend of Bob Sternberg who was the provost then, which probably didn   t  hurt either. Maybe this time the stars were lined up a little better than they  were in    72.  Finchum We   ve been through it long enough.  Spurrier I will say we   re a stronger school than we were in    72. Certainly in liberal  arts and sciences. So to that extent I think   it was not we got in just by  beating the door long enough. We met their criteria.  Abramson And the work that Bob Graalman was doing with the scholar development.  Spurrier Absolutely.  Abramson It made a big difference as well.  Finchum Well it seems to have pulled from the University, the whole process, more  people involved and more attention.  Spurrier I hope so.  Finchum There   s probably still people that aren   t aware.  Spurrier I would imagine in the other colleges, with the exception of Business where  you have economics, I mean be a business student and get your economics  major through Arts and Sciences. In fact, that   s what mine was. Political  science at Missouri was   they were housed in the business building. For  some reason their degree went through Arts and Sciences. At least some  aspects of it. They would know. I mean Ron Moomaw, as I recall, was over  in Economics before he retired, was Phi Beta Kappa. He was supportive. If  you go to Engineering, or Agricultural, and so on there   s no particular  reason they would know unless some faculty member over there went that  route in school like Ron had an undergraduate economics degree, a liberal  arts area in college when he got that undergraduate degree. I think the  chance of just assuming everybody can understand what Phi Beta Kappa is  would be like me understanding what the top honorary is in Agriculture. I   m  not going to know that necessarily.  Finchum It   s primarily arts and sciences.  Spurrier They define it as liberal arts and sciences. But not everything that   s in Arts  and Sciences here will count for that. Journalism for example, does not  count as a liberal arts degree as far as Phi Beta Kappa   s concerned. So no  22  matter how stellar some journalism student is, we cannot induct them into  Phi Beta Kappa.  Finchum No exceptions to the rule.  Spurrier No. These are the majors they will accept. Period.  Abramson As far as recognition, if you like watching older movies,    30s,    40s,    50s, Phi  Beta Kappa   s mentioned quite a bit. Quite a bit in those movies. Take The  Thin Man series for example, the detective series, it   s mentioned in there  almost every time.  Spurrier I had missed that.  Abramson He   s Phi Beta Kappa. If you look at some peoples    tombstones around those  times, same thing, Phi Beta Kappa on the tombstone.  Spurrier I think that   s gone out of fashion, probably. (Laughs)  Abramson Yeah, it   s gone out of fashion.  Spurrier In fact, I think even back in the    70s when, after that, because I vaguely  recall, Phi Beta Kappa was having some difficulty convincing people to  accept membership. That became an increasing problem. Part of it probably  was the    60s and rebelling against any kind of hierarchy or people being     thinking they   re better, who knows what. Then also this proliferation of  other types of honor societies probably has hurt. I remember reading  somewhere, it was in the popular perhaps, what before would   ve been the     30s or something, people would   ve rushed to sign up. There was a much  greater resistance rate to accepting the election of Phi Beta Kappa. We even  had some that we invited that chose not to accept it, no matter what we do  trying to explain to them that this is really a pretty big deal.  Finchum And money wasn   t the reason why they said no?  Spurrier No, I don   t think so. And we had some students in Honors that didn   t want  any of this sort of stuff.  Abramson I   m sure anyone on the executive committee would gladly pay for some  students.  Finchum If they say no now and decide later that they wanted to, is it retro? Can they  go back?  Abramson That   s what we were talking about now.  23  Spurrier I don   t know.  Finchum And there   s no rules in the charter that says   or in the main national  association     Spurrier I   m sure they   ve got something somewhere.  Abramson I think they leave it up to us and at this point we   re still deciding that, but it  looks like it   s going to lean towards we   ll ask them again, because it is Phi  Beta Kappa.  Spurrier They qualify. It would just be a matter that they didn   t accept it.  Finchum Did you put it on   leave it on your resume through the years?  Spurrier Sure.  Finchum Did you? Did you too, Charles?  Abramson Yes.  Finchum Maybe some of it was there were fewer students back then.  Spurrier It would   ve been about the same percentage back then, by their rules. Senior  classes have gotten larger, I   m sure, over the years. I think in those days it  was 5 percent of the top juniors and 10 percent of the top seniors. As far as I  know we didn   t induct any juniors, did we?  Abramson Not as far as I know.  Spurrier But that   s an option. It   d be much more selective in the seniors than the  juniors.  Abramson It may have been one or two.  Spurrier That I just honestly don   t remember.  Finchum So once you got the nod that okay, yes you   ve been awarded this, then what  do you come back and start to do? What are some of the things     Spurrier I got to watch Perry  Gethner  work with the registrar, and sort through   it  was easy to find the grade point averages, but then you have to go back and  look at curriculum. I   m sure Perry or maybe Charles you already have as  well, you have to have so many hours of the some foreign language and so  on and so forth. It   s not just grade point. It   s a broad liberal arts curriculum,  arts and sciences curriculum.  24  Finchum But to set up the chapter were there other steps in that process?  Spurrier We had to submit the various things we were going to do to qualify students,  to be sure it was acceptable to the national office. We had to send that in as I  recall.  Abramson It was a lot of paperwork.  Spurrier Paperwork. Even though you   re in now, you have to show you   re  conforming to the national policies for selecting students. Same thing for the  honorary members and stuff. They have strict limits on how many you can  have per year. As I recall they didn   t have any particular academic  requirements, but they really tightened that number down. After the first  year, that   s pretty small. First year was five, wasn   t it? Five or six.  Abramson I think now it   s two.  Spurrier That sounds   somewhere in that range.  Finchum And then you had to elect officers for the chapter?  Spurrier That wasn   t too hard. I don   t think too many people were beating down the  door wanting to be an officer. I think people just sort of     Finchum Volunteered.  Spurrier Yeah, or some people who obviously are taken at leading things. Made  perfect sense for them to wind up in those different positions. Still trying to  figure out how I managed to get brought in to this executive committee for a  year. While I did some paperwork and stuff behind the scenes, I don   t think  I did that much compared to Perry and some of the others, Charles and so  on, who were really slaving away.  Finchum Ultimately a team effort though.  Spurrier Oh yeah, I think, sure. From top down, I think, at that time.  Abramson One of the things I did was find out how many faculty were Phi Beta Kappa.  Everyone I talked to was surprised that OSU did not have a Phi Beta Kappa  chapter.  Spurrier It says something about the visibility of them. There are Phi Beta Kappa,  they are here, and they don   t know we don   t have one. Then for whatever  reason it wasn   t on their radar screen, why don   t we have one.  25  Abramson It was basically assumed.  Finchum Not a question to ask in an interview process when you   re coming to work.  Spurrier Probably not. In fact, I   m sure it was a challenge to track down how many  faculty are Phi Beta Kappa because a lot of department heads are not going  to know.  Abramson I contacted everybody, every faculty member. Actually, we   re doing it again  because now we have to update it.  Spurrier Sure, as people retire and then people come on board.  Abramson That   s right.  Finchum Just send out a bulk email?  Abramson I try to do personal emails.  Finchum You do?  Abramson Yeah. I never respond to a bulk email. You want me to do something, you  ask me personally.  Spurrier Makes perfect sense to me.  Finchum Sure.  Abramson I   m old fashioned that way. We even had a couple of husband and wife Phi  Beta Kappa   s. That was exciting to find out.  Spurrier Charles, I figured you   d use a quill pen and parchment.  Abramson Not anymore, (laughs) but I still have no cell phone. No cell phone.  Spurrier I got a flip phone only because my wife made me do it. (Laughter)  Abramson But I think Bob would say, like I will, that it   s really one of the proudest  accomplishments that we have     Spurrier I think so. Absolutely.  Abramson    helping to bring this here after such a long effort by previous people.  Finchum To fortitude, to keep trying.  26  Abramson I do remember the discussion   I don   t know if you were there. If this  application had failed, there really was a potential in the room not to try for  a while.  Spurrier The only meeting like that I remember was a faculty meeting. I remember  there was one over in Gunderson somewhere. I think we had a meeting that  some people were a little down at the mouth, why bother again. But you  may be right. That very well could have been.  Abramson Because you wonder what more can OSU do. Especially in that last  application.  Finchum It   s interesting that you mentioned land grants weren   t involved with them  earlier.  Spurrier Apparently that   s what   again, what I was told. That   s been many years  ago, but it was just very much the small private liberal arts school. I  remember Helga Harriman was on the faculty then. I think it was Helga, but  don   t want to get blamed for quoting her on this, but some of the small  schools that had Phi Beta Kappa chapters probably wouldn   t come close to  qualifying   some of them were just about to close their doors because of  financial problem and stuff, yet they were the ones kind of setting the rules  for the new folks and looking down their noses at the larger state schools.  I   m hoping that was a minority type thing like we had some that were  opposed to our having a chapter for whatever their axe was to grind. We had  a few like that, but if that group could control the qualifications committee,  if they happened to be dominant sometime, it makes a big difference in who  gets in or has a chance to get in.  Finchum Were there other institutions trying that same year? I   m assuming     Spurrier There were seven more admitted. One got blown up because of an athletics  scandal. I can   t remember exactly what it was, but they withdrew their  application, I think, on advice that this wasn   t going to fly.  Abramson The timing was something like just before the meeting or something. It was  incredible.  Spurrier Just a short time. That can always happen to anybody, you have some  scandal blow up. I don   t know what happens if your president resigns two  weeks before you go in, whether that counts or not, or even if that rule is  even enforced anymore. Gets hit by a truck, you could just get blown out of  the water for no reason of your own doing. Once you get there you know  you   ve been through a process. Of course it   s not a cakewalk. You have to  demonstrate to them that you meet the standards they say you have to have.  27  Finchum Those have been in place a long time, over a hundred years or close to. No,  over a hundred years, isn   t it? It   s pushing 140?  Spurrier For Phi Beta Kappa? More than 200 right now, 1776 I think is when the first  chapter was.  Finchum Two-hundred and forty then. Do my math. (Laughs)  Spurrier I   m not a math person either. I never would have fought you.  Finchum Any other questions, Charles?  Abramson No. It was a pleasure.  Spurrier Thanks for the opportunity to visit a little bit about it and just kind of  looking back over the history of this whole effort to get it and also just how  OSU has changed over the years.  Finchum Can you think of something that we should   ve asked that we haven   t?  Spurrier Not really, you folks have been pretty thorough I think. If I stop talking I  won   t dig myself any holes, so that   s probably just as well.  Finchum This building itself represents a lot, so it   s nice to do the interview here. And  your connection with this building too.  Spurrier That was another high point for me, as you might imagine, just getting Old  Central for the Honors College home. That was quite the statement on the  part of the administration and the amount of money they were willing to put  in to this to bring it up to modern code and everything. It   s a good deal of  money, and it   s become really a showpiece for Honors. I think the Phi Beta  Kappa committee, they were really impressed. They kept saying,    Look at  that building you got over there,    in a very positive way.  Abramson The installation ceremony was here as we talked about. Anybody who was  there would never forget it, that ceremony that was done here, the music and  everything was very, very nice.  Spurrier It really was. Part of it they told us what we were going to do. The other  parts we didn   t particularly need their approval, to make it more of a pageant  than an event.  Abramson I think the first student induction ceremony was in the Student Union  Ballroom because there were so many.  28  Spurrier Yeah, there were so many we couldn   t possibly fit them in here. Between  them, and families, and faculty and everything.  Finchum Leaves an impression on them.  Spurrier It does.  Finchum And on those who witnessed it. So you retired in 20     Spurrier Summer of 2014.  Finchum What have you been doing since?  Spurrier For the first year I learned I can do absolutely nothing with the best of them.  I was thoroughly happy. My wife was threatening to form a support group  for the spouses of recently retired folks. So I said,    Let me see if Keith   Garbutt  needs somebody to teach a couple of classes. I can come over a  couple of days a week.    He was very gracious and made that work out. For a  while anyway I   m enjoying teaching. Whether the students are enjoying it,  that   s something else.  Finchum Your classes are in this building?  Spurrier Yes. He was able to get me set up over here. It   s a great old building.  Teaching over here   s a lot of fun.  Finchum So you can come home again.  Spurrier At least twice a week. (Laughter)  Finchum Where do you consider home since you   re from Missouri?  Spurrier Oklahoma. Been here since    72. I think I   ve probably settled in.  Finchum Well, if there   s nothing else, we   ll say thank you very much for talking with  us.  Spurrier It   s been a real pleasure visiting with both of you.  Abramson Thanks.  -------  -------
