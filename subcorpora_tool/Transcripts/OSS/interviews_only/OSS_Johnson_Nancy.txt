 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, April 21, 2016, and I   m interviewing veterinarian Nancy Johnson for the O-State Stories interview series sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. This is also a CEC  Cowboys in Every County  interview. Nancy, you did your undergraduate work at Vassar and MIT. You went back to school, and in your mid-thirties you got your vet med degree. I understand you worked both with mixed animals, large and small, but then you   ve focused on small animals since, companion animals, and you   re about to sell your practice  I look forward to hearing more about your life and career and your OSU memories. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me. Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Johnson I was born about nine miles from Canada on the Iron Range of Virginia, Minnesota. It was very cold up there. My parents stayed two years and headed for California, so I grew up in California, mostly on the beach. (Laughs)  Little Thunder Any brothers or sisters?  Johnson I had one brother who passed away about seven years ago.  Little Thunder And what did your folks do for a living?  Johnson My father, he ran a tile-laying business. He did most of the swimming pools and bathrooms and things in Hollywood Hills for the stars in the 1950s.  Little Thunder Wow   Johnson And my mother was a beautician and owned five beauty shops.  Little Thunder What was it like growing up in   were you in LA, or what part of California?  5  Johnson Santa Monica, and Dorsey High School was in Crenshaw area, which is where Rodeo Drive is, which is pretty famous.  Little Thunder Wow, yes  What was it like growing up there?  Johnson The    60s and    50s were kind of a very interesting time, you know. I lived through the Watts riots, where all the restaurants had armed police and guns in the middle of the restaurants. Our school was, we were a mixed neighborhood, which in general was wonderful. The students got along well. Probably 85 percent of my school was non-white, and 95 percent of my school went to college. It was a very cosmopolitan mixed background and a lot of freedom. (Laughter) We didn   t have cell phones. I can remember at twelve, biking to the beach, twelve miles to the beach on a bike, and none of our parents ever worried about us. I guess they just thought we   d come home.  Little Thunder How fun  So that was one of your primary activities for fun was going to the beach.  Johnson Oh, yeah, California and the beach life was the big thing.  Little Thunder Right. What was your favorite subject in school?  Johnson I was always interested in chemistry and biology.  Little Thunder Was there anything that kind of pointed towards your eventual career as a vet?  Johnson I knew from the time I was five years old I was going to be a veterinarian. I brought every dog and cat home that I could find, and my mother has pictures of me riding horses, strapped in at eighteen months old, and pictures of me at nine months dropping cookies out of my carriage with the dogs following us. I   ve always been dragging things home. That   s just me. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Did either of your parents go to college?  Johnson My mother went to college, yeah.  Little Thunder After you graduated high school, what did you do?  Johnson I went straight on to college.  Little Thunder At Vassar first?  Johnson Yeah, I went to Vassar. 6  Little Thunder Studying science?  Johnson Chemistry, math minor and child study minor. I had four minors.  Little Thunder Then from there to MIT. Were you thinking of veterinary med already or were you just   .  Johnson Yes, I always was going to be a veterinarian, but I got married. I transferred to MIT, where my husband got his degrees...  Little Thunder I see, okay.  Johnson    so I went to school there.  Little Thunder What year did you start veterinary medicine at OSU?  Johnson Good lord, I think 1980. That   s a long time ago. (Laughter)  Little Thunder What was   how did you land here in Oklahoma?  Johnson We came here so I could go to veterinary school. My husband took a job at OSU so I could come to veterinary school.  Little Thunder Why did you   so you picked OSU first, yourself, before your husband even applied for a job here?  Johnson He got offers from OU and OSU because of the field he was in, in electronics. We had looked around, and I could afford to go to OSU. I had looked at Tufts, but it was a  30,000 deposit. We didn   t have that kind of money, so we came here.  Little Thunder And you shared an interesting story that, I think, your daughter started at the same time or a year after you?  Johnson No, my oldest daughter, Dr. Carolynne Cash, just graduated from veterinary school, like, maybe four or five years after me.  Little Thunder After you, yeah, so almost simultaneous studies. What were some of the challenges you encountered in the vet med school?  Johnson Well, I had three children, and we ran a goat dairy, (it was ours because we had 125 on the milk line) and my husband was a professor. Some of the challenges were staying awake through the classes the first year. (Laughs)  Little Thunder That   s a very, yeah    7  Johnson If you ask me if I   d ever do that again, I wouldn   t.  Little Thunder    heavy workload.  Johnson We went out of the goat dairy business by the second year, which made life a lot simpler. Other challenges were I had a baby during veterinary school, which didn   t mean to do, and I had to have an emergency C-section. I missed six weeks of school because my baby had to be on heart monitors and stuff. I have to say that OSU let me graduate, take all my testing, get my license, and come back and do my last six weeks of equine after I was licensed. Probably no other school would be that kind.  Little Thunder Wow.  Johnson So actually, I had kind of a few challenges.  Little Thunder Some good support there.  Johnson OSU was very kind to me. They knew I   d be back. They knew I wouldn   t lie about it.  Little Thunder Now, were you living in the Chandler area when you had the goat farm and everything     Johnson No, we lived in Tryon.  Little Thunder    and your husband was teaching?  Johnson We lived in Tryon, which is not far from here. It   s closer. Yeah, it   s about fourteen miles closer to Stillwater.  Little Thunder Who were some professors who stood out for you at the time?  Johnson Well, Dr.  Richard  Corstvet was one of my favorite professors, and he was one of my interviewees.  Little Thunder What did you like about him?  Johnson I don   t know. He just was a very straight shooter, and he seemed like a really nice guy. Then   oh, golly, I   m getting so old I   m forgetting names. When I had the rough time, Dr. Fox stood up for me a lot. I have to say, after I had my baby and things were so stressful, I was kind of emotionally unstable. If anybody gave me a real hard review at the school, I would be really hard. I worked for Dr. Fox and Helen Jordan. I still see Helen a lot.  8  Little Thunder As a graduate assistant, you   re saying?  Johnson In research. To make extra money, I did some projects for Dr. Fox, and I did some projects for Helen. As an undergraduate, I won several of the awards for parasitology, which I was interested in. I can   t remember her name; there was a pathologist. Dr.  Sydney  Ewing was one of my favorite doctors, and then there was a woman in that department that I was very fond of. I   m sorry I can   t remember her name right now, but she was one of the first women to go to veterinary school. I think she went back   she was back East when she went to veterinary school. She used to visit about some of the rough times she had (there was only two girls in the class) and how they were picked on. I visited with her a lot. It was mostly the people in parasitology and pathology department; those were my favorite people. Pathology would   ve been what I would   ve done if I was younger and could   ve stayed, but I couldn   t stay and do more years. I had to become a veterinarian. I mean, I love what I did, but pathology would   ve been what I would   ve done if I   d started at twenty     Little Thunder I see.  Johnson    because I like the science of it and the research.  Little Thunder Was that what the OSU vet med school was known for at that point, was the   .  Johnson I think they were pretty well known for their research, especially with ticks and things, but it wasn   t just their research. I find finding out why the animal died is very interesting. That would   ve been a whole other four years, and I couldn   t do it.  Little Thunder Right. What were your most challenging classes?  Johnson Oh, dear, anatomy. (Laughter) My best friend was the youngest person in the class, and I was the oldest person. After the first anatomy test, at which I stood there the whole time   I   m not kidding. I stood there, like, frozen. I couldn   t even hardly move. I failed it terribly. She said that she was going to get me a bottle of whiskey and put it in my thing, and we   d have a drink before we went in. Poor Dr.  Jonathan  Friend and (what was the other guy   s name?)  Duane  Peterson, they helped me get through. By the third time we had a test, I actually could walk from place to place. I don   t know why it just petrified me  I was petrified. I   d go in there, and I   d go,    Oh, I don   t know what nerve that is.    (Laughter) I remember one time   . They have a chart. They   d cut the cow in half, and it   d just be holes, you know. I remember I wrote on the test that,    If you cut the cow in half, I can guarantee you I can   t put it back together and save its life, so I think this is nonsense.    I don   t think they really thought that was funny, but I thought the chart was 9  ridiculous. I   m not very good at   geometry was not my best subject, so when they do things like that, I have trouble seeing   .  Little Thunder Right, the spatial.  Johnson Yeah, I have trouble with that. That wouldn   t be my forte, so I found that hard. I got through it. I think I got a B, finally, after a few shots of whiskey and a lot of encouragement. (Laughs)  Little Thunder What buildings did you have your classes in?  Johnson Oh, it was the old Classroom Building. I guess that   s what they...yeah, mostly. Then the old hospital, yeah.  Little Thunder What was the environment on the campus like, outside of the vet med program, or did you even have time to explore it?  Johnson I was too busy with children at home, my family. I really didn   t   the only time I ever did anything really with the class was on the senior trip, and we had a good time. In general, I wasn   t going out on weekends and stuff with the class. It was not possible. As a matter of fact, one of my classmates, Diane Dickerson, her mother and my husband were carpooling to the university. She has Shepherd   s Cross in Claremore. We   re still great friends. Matter of fact, I helped sponsor her mission trips to Africa and different places. They   re some of our oldest friends because we carpooled before we went to veterinary school together. We   d let my husband and her mom drive, and we   d study anatomy and stuff in the backseat, flashcards. I still made, like Becky King and different people, friends that I still consider good friends, but I didn   t really have time to socialize much out of my family because I was older.  Little Thunder Right, and probably even with your husband teaching there, you didn   t get a chance to go to sporting events too much or anything like that.  Johnson No. My husband   s a hockey player, so he   s not too into football and basketball.  Little Thunder Okay, he   s not into those.  Johnson We took part in the sporting events more when our kids went to college and played in the band and stuff like that. Then we went to football games to watch the kids and stuff.  Little Thunder When you had time, was there a place on campus that you liked to go to study or hang out when you had extra time?  10  Johnson I think I just spent time in the library when I had time.  Little Thunder And what was the library like in those days?  Johnson It was a nice, musky library, (Laughter) not very exciting. Mostly, you were pretty busy all day in those days. I mean, there wasn   t a whole lot of time after class to do much. You ended up going home and studying mostly because it was a pretty long day.  Little Thunder Right. How about some of the events like Homecoming? I don   t know if your husband had to   .  Johnson The only thing my husband had to go to is he had a lot of graduate (PhD and master   s) students, so he went to all that stuff.  Little Thunder The graduations and things.  Johnson Yeah, but I didn   t always accompany him because he   d go to the hoodings. We have gone several years, even with our grandchildren, to the Homecoming because the kids like that. We   ve done the Homecoming several times and threatened the grandchildren they couldn   t go unless they got potty trained and stuff like that. It worked  (Laughter)    You can   t go to Homecoming in diapers.    It works.  Little Thunder Well, the town of Stillwater has changed quite a bit since you got your degree. Do you have any thoughts on some of those changes?  Johnson I   ve never actually lived in Stillwater.     We did a buy a house this last year, which we have rented out to some friends    kids. You can see the front door of the veterinary school from our new house.  Little Thunder Oh, you can? Okay   Johnson Yes, and my husband wonders why we didn   t buy that when I went to veterinary school. We bought it from a friend, and of our seven grandchildren, I   m sure at least four will be going to OSU. One goes next year, so we bought a house to have a place for the kids to live.  Little Thunder Well, how neat   Johnson We   ve got it rented out now and probably for next year. Then the next year we   ll probably have our grandchildren start to stay in it. I love the town  I   ve gone to Total Health after I had a knee replacement. Helen and several people in Oak Creek want me to buy a unit there. I keep telling them,    I know it would be great except I   m just not ready to give up my home right now.    We think that   s a great idea, the community living and being close to 11  everything, because we   ve always been sponsors of the arts. We   ve always had season tickets to the Seretean Center and the theater because we   re big   .  Little Thunder Okay. So you do do that?  Johnson Yeah, we   ve always done that. My husband   s always been in the choir, the Community Singers, this last year when he retired. We   re a lot into music and arts more than sports. We love OSU. I mean, we love Stillwater, and I think it   s a great place to live.  Little Thunder How did you celebrate your graduation day?  Johnson I think we just had the whole family together and had dinner (that was a lot of people) and probably slept for the week afterwards. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Right, slept in  (Laughter) So what happened after graduation? What was the first job you got?  Johnson Okay. Dr.  Francis  Beloncik, who was in the second graduating class at OSU, I had worked for him for a summer, and he wrote my letter of recommendation to OSU. Before I graduated, he invited me to become part of his practice, so I already had a job when I graduated. I worked with him and Dr. Stone for, I think, about two years.  Little Thunder And his practice was in   .  Johnson In Chandler. Matter of fact, it   s Chandler Animal Clinic. It   s considered a centennial practice.  Little Thunder But you had a couple of interesting interviews, you mentioned to me, when you were applying for jobs.  Johnson Well, yes, you have to consider the time. Both of my interviews, the people at the interviews, not all the people but some of the people, asked me more about how I was going to take care of my children and my husband, not really why I wanted to be a veterinarian. I thought I   d really messed up both interviews because at one of them, I kind of got a little angry and asked them why were they asking me if my children were going to starve, and what business was it of theirs how I took care of my family. I told them I   d come to be a veterinarian, and I thought that they would be more interested in why I wanted to do that. But the same part of that kind of psychology was very current then because when I went to open my own practice   and I did a very good job of a prospectus and studied Lincoln County.  12  After I left Dr. Beloncik   s practice and I was going to set up my own practice, I submitted that to the bank. They were willing to give me the loan as long as my husband signed for it. My husband was so livid because being from California, he was raised that women could do anything, and his mother was a business person. I said,    Well, we   re just going to cosign it because I need the money.    He said,    I hope they know if you die, I can   t run a veterinary practice.    It was just the times that women   . I was actually the first woman to start a business in Chandler without her husband being in business with her. My husband wasn   t really in business with me. He wasn   t a veterinarian. It was the times. When I was in school, it was really common for, like   I remember we were working bulls and things.  The girls would get all upset because the male veterinarians, especially the older men, would want to protect them from being underneath the bull and stuff like that. They   d get all upset, and I said,    Well, you do realize they have girls at home that are your age that are their daughters. They   re not too concerned if one of the men get kicked in the face. They   re only treating you like their daughter; they   re not trying to be disrespectful.    I spent a lot of my time quieting younger girls down, saying,    You know, give them a little space. It   s hard for them to get used to girls are going to be sitting under bulls and taking semen and stuff.    I just took it as, you know, things were changing, but it takes time for people to change.  Little Thunder Having that maturity was helpful.  Johnson Well, I was a lot older. (Laughter) You want to save your fights for important things. Get the money and prove yourself. Now I can get a loan any place on my signature because I   ve proven myself, but at that time I was an unknown quantity, and I was a woman.  Little Thunder What was the ratio (I   m curious) of women to men in your graduating class?  Johnson You know, I don   t know. I think it was about a third women, but I don   t think it   . Now it   s half and half or sixty-forty, men, or less. We need more men in veterinary medicine, I think. We need more men in teaching, too. The number of women is up, which is not bad except that I think that it   s good to have male influences on teaching and stuff, too, for children. I don   t know.  Little Thunder Now, when you got your loan from the bank, had you applied with another bank? Was that your first application that was successful?  Johnson Yes.  Little Thunder Because you knew how to approach it.  13  Johnson It wasn   t a problem except when I went in business, the interest rate was seventeen-and-a-half percent at that time. I worked the first year for the bank until I could get a small business loan. They say you can get a small business loan, but you have to have a year of proof that you have a business. Then they dropped it to eight-and-a-half percent. I worked the first year to pay the bank, essentially. I made no money.  Little Thunder That is tough. Did you have one employee or   .  Johnson I had me, and somebody for twenty hours a week. I worked nine months without a day off. I worked every day because that   s how you start a business.  Little Thunder Right. How did you go about building your client base?  Johnson I did a little advertising in the paper, but I spoke at any place they   d let me speak. I visited all the schools. Third grade was my grade that I thought was easiest to talk to, and we   d bring animals and talk to them and send things home. It   s kind of interesting because I have this new veterinarian that started two and a half years ago when I had my knee surgery. She   s been working for me full-time and is probably going to buy my practice this year. I told her two and a half years ago, I said,    Well, it takes about three years to get established.    In other words   she wants to do equine. It was cute. A couple weeks ago, she said to me,    I cannot believe it   s been two and a half years, and all of a sudden I   m doing all this equine. I guess you were right.    I find it a little amusing that the young people, they don   t   . Having experience in businesses is worthwhile, but it took me three years to really make any money at my practice. I couldn   t have been in practice without my husband making enough money for our family. We lived on his income, and we invested everything in the practice that I made back in the practice. It was a long haul. Now it   s successful. The first three years were just hard work and being there all the time, but I was younger. (Laughs) It worked out okay.  Little Thunder Do you remember the most difficult moment you had in one of those first three years?  Johnson No, I just know that you gain experience. Well, my daughter is going to be director of one of the humane societies, starting next month in Tulsa. Probably my daughter, Dr. Cash, and myself, our biggest problem is I wanted to be a veterinarian. I didn   t actually know you made any money doing it. I just always wanted to be a veterinarian, and I still love to take care of puppies and nurse animals. It   s just what I like to do. The first year, I lost a lot of money because I let people charge, so getting tougher was hard for me. I   ve never been able to get really tough. I   ve never been able. I know they tell you,    Oh, you   ve got to turn them down. You   ve got to let them 14  die.    I   ve never been able to do that. I don   t donate a lot of money to the Humane Society and stuff like that, but I have been the humane society in Chandler, Oklahoma, because we don   t have one. That   s been okay because my husband, we made enough money. I didn   t make a killing, but we made enough money.  I guess I   ve been lucky to be able to do that for people, but I did have to learn to draw the line on, you know, people because a lot of people will take advantage of that. That was the hardest   . The other thing was you get   at first there were some, you know, things. They   d come in; it was a female veterinarian. I was probably the first veterinarian in the county who was a female. I know that my husband was away the day before my birthday in February. We had a terrible snowstorm, and I was called out to do a C-section on a cow. I had to leave my children at home alone, which was hard because we   re on a farm and we only had a wood stove. It was really a bad storm, and my husband wasn   t home. I did go out in my   and I had a Cummins diesel truck. I went out, and I cut this cow open and got this huge calf out. Dr. Beloncik could swing the thing over his head. Like, he was six foot four.  I dragged it over to a fence and beat on it, but it was the typical, old farm. This man, he must   ve been eighty-five. His wife was dead. I drove up to where the heifer cow was, and there was to your knees in baling wire and bags of old feed. I had to have the, you know, the headlights on the cow. He didn   t have a stanchion, and I finally got the calf and everything done. He got so excited that he   d take the flashlight off when I was trying to sew her up. Then he had to go have coffee. I think it took me four and a half hours to get home by the time I sewed her up because I didn   t have any help. It was typical 1930 veterinary medicine, I think. When I got home, my husband was relieved to see me, and I was glad to be there. By the next day, every coffee shop in Lincoln County knew that I had saved this calf, and I was a woman. It was kind of funny.  Little Thunder That was a good PR boost.  Johnson It was, but it was hard  That   s the hardest thing was for me to do C-sections because the hand strength. I was already almost forty, so I preferred that Dr. Beloncik and Dr. Stone did the C-sections. (Laughter) I still remember that night because I looked in that barn, and I thought,    Oh, my God, he hasn   t cleaned this out in forty years.    It was really funny  (Laughter)  Little Thunder That   s a great story.  Johnson It was funny. I always tell people what they should get when they go to veterinary school is they   . Now they use computers, but I think   . I wish I   d done this because I always tell everybody James Herriot in England has 15  nothing on Lincoln County for stories. I wish I   d kept a journal not only of veterinary school but of my practice. When I first started practicing, I had people that signed their name with an X because they couldn   t read and write.  Little Thunder Wow.  Johnson Yeah, it   s changed, but   . I had people that did not have internal bathrooms yet. They still had outhouses. I mean, the way things have changed and how veterinary medicine has changed   . It amazed me the first time anybody would spend three or four hundred dollars on their dog. Now they come in, and that   s kind of routine. The way it   s changed in the last thirty-some years, it   s just amazing.  Little Thunder What are some of the challenges that, you know, just the scale, like going from delivering a calf by C-section to treating a very small cat or dog?  Johnson Oh, I don   t know. That wasn   t a real problem. We got so busy with small animal because, well, first of all, a lot of the vets in the area were doing both. People that have small animal, if their animal is really sick, they don   t like to know that you   re gone and doing large animal while their animal   s in the clinic. So in the early   90s, I made the decision that we   d stop doing large animal because I couldn   t be both places at once. My practice wasn   t really big enough to have two full-time veterinarians, and my daughter started working for me. She went to veterinary school, and she was practicing in the Dallas area. Then she came home, and I knew she was coming home because she was planning on having children. She came home to have children and be a veterinarian, so she worked with me. We were more one-and-a-half-vet practices because she was having children all the time. We specialized in small animal. I think it   s hard to do both unless you have two or three people because, you know, small animal people, the animal is really their child. It   d be like telling me,    Well, we   ll be in the hospital, but we   ll be gone for four hours.    It doesn   t work out very well, I don   t think.  Little Thunder Yeah, and that was a   I   ve heard that, that   those communication skills are so important because that   s practically a family member.  Johnson Well, it is. The best clients, they   re family members because the people that they   re just dogs to, they don   t bring them in until they   re really sick or they were hit by a car last week, and now they   re worried about them. If they   re family members, they call you as soon as anything happens, and they bring them in. They make your best clients. We   ve done a lot of rescue, too. We averaged about 125 animals a year that we rescued and helped. I worked with several small rescues. Tiny Tails was one of my favorites. You did dogs under twenty-five pounds, so we did a lot of work for her. She   d bring 16  in, I don   t know, probably five to eight spays and neuters a week that she   d rescue from different places in Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas. Then they would take them to Petco in Edmond and adopt them out. We did a lot of rescue through small rescues, the private, because we don   t have a humane society in Lincoln County, and we don   t have a dog pound.  Little Thunder That   s one of the challenges of working in a rural area, I imagine.  Johnson Yeah, it is. We did a lot of that work because I think it   s important. I also think being part of the community   s really important. My kids went to school here, and we supported things. We particularly supported, like, the reading programs and the arts programs because everybody else supported the sports all the time. We did do some sports, but   . We had a local arts council, which I was president of for six years. Then I was on the state arts council, and I   ve been on the museum board and helped build the museum and the public theater     Little Thunder Here in Chandler?  Johnson    yeah, the public theater here. I   ve done a lot of that kind of thing, so I think it   s real important to take part in the community and support what you believe in.     People from three states and seventeen cities come to my clinic.  Little Thunder Wow  That   s a real compliment.  Johnson Yeah   and I always laugh because I got a long letter from a kid (because I   ve been in business so long) that his dog had seizures. He lived in Dallas then, and he   d been to the neurologist there and everybody. He wrote me this long letter because he   s sure Dr. Johnson could cure the dog, and it was so cute. I said,    You know, I think you   ve been to the best.    It was odd because it was a bird dog, and it was a big dog. Usually the seizures are in your little dogs. I remember he called me, and he said,    Nancy, I   m coming home to see Dad, and I want you to put my dog to sleep,    I   m going to cry,    so I can bury it on the farm.    Being in a small town, you get really attached to the people and their dogs. I   ve kept dogs alive, until a kid could get home from college, on dialysis so he could say goodbye to his dog.  Little Thunder That   s an important   .  Johnson I think you   re more than a veterinarian. I hate it when they show movies where they act like the veterinarian just puts the dog to sleep. That Marley and Me or whatever? I hated that movie  Why couldn   t they just show them walking off in the sunset? Why did they have to act like the veterinarian was so cold and just put the dog to sleep? I mean, I   ve helped people bury dogs. Their veterinarian is part of their family here. So anyhow, sorry, but it upsets 17  me because in a small town   . I   ve had people when their wives die, they bring their dog in every other day with some complaint because they   re so lonesome because they were married for forty years. They come to the veterinarian, and you   re like a therapist because they won   t go to their doctor. We got to the point where we were teaching that poor man how to cook because she   d done everything for him for all his life, and when she died, he was lost. I mean, they don   t feel about the veterinarian the way they feel about their family doctor or dentist.  Little Thunder No, it   s a much closer relationship.  Johnson They think I can talk to animals. (Laughs) I mean, I   ve had the experience   . When I was in the ER in California with my oldest son on New Year   s Eve, when the doctor there found out I was a veterinarian, he was sure I could understand was wrong with my son because it was just telepathy. It turned out I was right. It was a pre-flu syndrome. He wasn   t having a heart condition. This kid was convinced, once he found out I was a veterinarian, that I could just touch my son and I knew what was wrong. (Laughs) I   ve found being a veterinarian is kind of hilarious to a certain extent because they think you are some kind of voodoo doctor. I think it   s the best profession in the world, and I don   t know if I   ve made   . My daughter   s an ER doctor, so she makes probably six times the money I make. She   s retired from that and gone into barometric pressure. She   s double-boarded now because after fifteen years in the ER, passing people on and not knowing, always, the results, now she   s doing barometric pressure, where sometimes it takes her two years to heal your mother   s problem because, you know, she   s going to lose her hand because of diabetes or something.  She   s enjoying it so much more because she gets to see the results. Veterinary medicine, I   ve been allowed to do   I think the best thing is I   ve been allowed to do some of the craziest things. I think one of my favorite times was when a little dog came in. It was about fourteen weeks old. It was hit by a car, and I could tell it had diaphragmatic hernia. I tried to put it up to OSU, but it was going to be a couple thousand dollars. I said,    Okay, our gas anesthesia   s not working, but Francis and I will try to do this. If you got 250 dollars, we   ll go for it.    So we did. I used to laugh. I said it was like a MASH unit. So my technician breathed for the dog, and every time she breathed, I   d get spattered with juice. We sewed the little dog up, and it went home the next day. We got the hernia fixed in the lung, you know, in the diaphragm. Then a week or so later when he came in to get the stitches out of the chest and all, he was in there, and in the room next door there was another man. He said,    What do you mean you fixed the diaphragmatic hernia? My dog had one, and I went to OSU. It was two thousand dollars. I had to put it to sleep      18  I said,    Well, you know, I might not have been able to fix yours. This was just lucky.    I   d been able to do things like say,    Okay, give me a hundred dollars   .    The other time I can remember, (I would like to write a book) when my daughter was going to OSU and she was a third-year student, we had this cat came in that was obvious it had gotten kicked by the back legs of a jackrabbit. All its guts were in a bag. I mean, there was nothing. I said to the lady,    Well, you got a hundred dollars? I   ll give it a try. My daughter   s a student, and we need to learn about this. It   s going to dehisce about two or three times. It   s going to be a mess.    We put a lot more than a hundred dollars into this cat, okay? Well, anyhow, it did dehisce, but he lived. This was a barn cat, which now became their cat called C-note. Lived to be seventeen years old, so we made our money back over the next years giving shots and worming.  Carolynne got a lot of experience getting that all cleaned up, sewing it up, and then knowing in five to seven days, because it   s impossible to get it totally clean, come back and resew it up. We had a relationship with that family and that cat for seventeen years. Obviously, I didn   t make any money, but my daughter got a lot of experience, and we made good friends with the people. That   s how the practice grew. We had a lot of experiences like,    Well, we   ll try it  It might not live, but we   ll give it a chance. We   re not going to put your animal to sleep,    and you can   t do that in any other kind of medicine. You can   t say to somebody,    Well, let me put a pipe on your kid   s arm and see if it works.    (Laughter)     Every day was different. Every day was challenging. I   m sure we   ve done some very unorthodox things.  Little Thunder What   s the most unorthodox animal you   ve ever treated?  Johnson Oh, this was really funny. After Dr. Beloncik retired, and Dr. Stone took over his practice, I gave Frank a key to my clinic. He would come in, and he could do anything you wanted. Like if he wanted to have a   he has nine children and all these grandchildren. I just said,    If you want to do something to their animals, you just come do it.    One day he was in there, and I don   t know whether he was just visiting because he was getting old and he   d fall asleep in one of the exam rooms most of the time. We were friends. I had two people helping me by that time: a receptionist and another lady, and we had a groomer. Somebody came in with a big python, this huge snake, two people carrying this gigantic snake. It came in, and I looked around. They   d all left by the back door  They were all afraid of snakes  (Laughter) I was the only person in that clinic. I said to them,    I really can   t handle this snake, and I think it   s egg-bound.    I did send it to OSU, and it was egg-bound. I found out that nobody that worked for me was going to have anything to do with snakes. They were gone  I still remember that. It was like,    Where did they all go?    (Laughter)  19  Little Thunder Now, egg-bound means that   .  Johnson Yeah, it couldn   t pass its eggs. I can remember that was so funny. It was like   it was fun.  Little Thunder That would be scary.  Johnson Then the other bad thing that happened, because Frank wasn   t good about wearing gloves, he was doing some cattle work. He palpated a cow down in Sparks,  Oklahoma , because she was showing tenesmus and stuff. Well, it turned out everybody there had to take rabies shots because it was a rabid cow.  Little Thunder Oh, wow  I didn   t even know that could happen.  Johnson Oh, yeah, any mammal can   . Probably a skunk or something bit her that was rabid. That was one of the times I remember being kind of frightened for everybody because everybody that was at that site, including Frank   . He didn   t take the shots. He said he wasn   t going to do it. He didn   t get rabies, thank God. He died of something else. We have had positive rabies come into our clinic, so that   s kind of scary.  Little Thunder Is there a surgery that you feel like you   ve gotten especially good at over the years?  Johnson Well, obviously spaying and neutering a lot of things because we averaged about seven to nine surgeries a day, most of the time. I   m pretty good at removing eyeballs, unfortunately, because my daughter didn   t like to do that. Was pretty good at anal gland, and I got pretty good at small-dog knees. Now, if you had a big dog and it was an endurance dog, I would send it to somebody because   . That didn   t always work, either. I always felt like if you were using it for field trials, you know, a dog that weighs forty-five pounds or something and you   re going to use it for field trials, I would refer that out. The little ten- and five-pound Chihuahuas, I got pretty good at that because I did a lot of knees, unfortunately, a lot of hips, resection of hips because that   s what has to come off when they get hit by a car. I   ve done a lot of taking off hips. Yeah, just kind of general. I refer to eye doctors on most things like, you know   . I have sewn up corneas when the people couldn   t go anyplace because they couldn   t afford it. It has worked, but I try to send them either to OSU or Dr.  Virginia  Schultz in the city. I try to refer because I consider myself a general practitioner, but I also won   t kill an animal if people are willing to try.  I have a dog that   oh, this dog was   this is years ago. Tripod just died; she was eighteen. The lady was a nurse, so she thought she could treat the dog. She didn   t bring her in right away. It   s the only dog I ever saw with 20  gangrene. She didn   t start the right antibiotics soon enough, and I ended up, three surgeries later, taking everything off of the side. There wasn   t even a bone left up here because it was all gangrene. They ended up calling the dog Tripod because she only had three legs. It took, like, four surgeries, and, oh, she was hospital a lot. I thought it was terrible. I said,    Well, I have to charge you a thousand dollars.    I don   t think I made any money on that thousand dollars, either. Janet was a nurse, and they were working-hard people. That was probably one of the most challenging things. My husband even remembers going in on Sunday. I said,    We got to take the whole shoulder off,    so he helped me because I said   . It was horrible. I never smelled gaseous gangrene. That   s the only time I   ve ever smelled it. It was really gross.  I   ve done some things that I was amazed they turned out okay, but I always gave it a try, you know. I always tried. We   ve done big tumors, and removed spleens, and all sorts of stuff that it took me a while to get it done, but, you know, I have a good book I can read. (Laughter) Being out in a rural area thirty years ago or twenty years ago was pretty challenging. I think that   s what makes it fun, though, because it   s not the same every day. Every day is, you never know what   s going to happen. It can be anything. It   d be sort of like   Diane   s going to Africa this year, and I sent her a bunch of stuff to take. Maybe one year I   ll go with her. She   s training seventy vet assistants in this African nation because the whole nation has seven veterinarians. She   s going to train them so at least they can be in the villages and help the animals. They may not be able to save all their lives, but at least there   ll be somebody there that can help. There   s such a need of veterinarians all over the world. Well, doctors, and water, and all sorts of things all over the world, people need. Our world needs a lot of help.  Little Thunder That   s very true. Now, you are taking care of some puppies right now, and you just periodically do that. You   ve brought home animals, I imagine, too. Ended up with   .  Johnson Well, when I was first in practice, my clinic was fourteen miles from my farm, so there was a lot of things that would get poisoned, like with strychnine or something. I   d have to take them home and put them in the bathtub because I couldn   t go back and forth in the winter all night long. Those things I   d bring home. This dog died, and it was my dog. W lost her. We still don   t know why because the C-section went well, but she probably wouldn   t have been able to nurse the puppies anyway. She had too many, (she had seven) and she only weighed five pounds. I have raised puppies for other people, though, when, like, their dog got sick and they were sick or something. There are times, especially Christmastime, when you have fifteen puppies you   re helping people with that, when the last one dies, you   re not too sad. (Laughs) I always get bronchitis because when you get up every three hours at my age, you always get bronchitis before the puppies 21  are weaned. I   ve never put anything to sleep if I thought we could save it. One of my technicians is going to take them two nights this week and give me a rest. If you do it all the time, it   s impossible. It   s like having triplets at home.  Little Thunder Oh, exactly. You just can   t   .  Johnson Yeah, it   s difficult. That   s one of, probably, the hardest times to practice. My son had endocarditis and was in the hospital for months, and then when he came home, he had to change antibiotics every six hours on his IV. He was here, so if you came in, I would say,    Keep your cat right there  I   m going home to change an IV.    I mean, that was five and a half months of my life because I was the only vet at the practice then, when I was just bumping into walls because I was up all night and working all day. So there have been some challenges related to the family and being a veterinarian.  Little Thunder No kidding. No kidding. So what do you think of the new veterinary building?  Johnson I think it   s wonderful.  Little Thunder Have you toured it and everything?  Johnson Yeah. Matter of fact, Dr.  Jean  Sander, she asked me if I wanted to be on their new, some board. I felt bad that I turned her down, but this is my husband   s first year of retirement, and I   m trying to retire. We want to travel a little bit, and we are seventy. I   ve had some   I   m healthy except for my bones are giving out on me. I have a new knee and a new hand, and now I need a new back. I felt bad letting her down because I would love   . I told her, maybe next year, after. We   re going to do some traveling this year, and I don   t really want to   . If I tell you I   m going to do something, I could have pneumonia and be in a wheelchair, and I   ll show up at the meeting and do it. I just have never   you know, every time I   ve served on a committee, I do it. I don   t want to be tied down to anything this year. I think we have a wonderful new dean, and I think the school   s doing really well. I love the school.  Little Thunder And your husband retired from OSU?  Johnson Yeah, he was there for thirty-three years.  Little Thunder Wow.  Johnson Yeah, he just retired last June.  Little Thunder So how many of your children have attended OSU? 22  Johnson All of them.  Little Thunder All of them.  Johnson Yeah, my daughter, oldest daughter, went to OSU and then came back and went to vet school. My next daughter went to OSU and then went to OU and became a medical doctor. My oldest son went to OSU and went into engineering, and my youngest son graduated with a general science degree. He just finished. Now he   s in pediatric ultrasound, and he   s had a really hard time. He was a premature baby, and he   s almost died two or three times. He   s had open heart surgery twice. He would   ve probably been a medical doctor except he couldn   t do the rigors of that much   . He did ultrasound. That was pretty hard after school because he just is not as strong because his heart is not as good as the other kids, so he   s doing ultrasound, pediatric ultrasound. He   s happy. They   re all busy.  Little Thunder All have that medical interest that, yeah.  Johnson Yeah, all of them are pretty medically-oriented, except for the oldest one. He   s got his own software business now.  Little Thunder Are the people that you know aware of your OSU connection?  Johnson Oh, yeah, I think most everybody knows I went to OSU.  Little Thunder What advice would you give to students today at OSU, and maybe even vet med students?  Johnson Eat better and exercise. I was amazed at how poorly students ate, even when I went to school. They   d go have a coke and a chocolate bar at lunchtime. I   m surprised they haven   t all died of pancreatitis. I don   t think the kids take enough time to exercise and eat well. I know they   re kids, but it just   . Really, just eating well, exercising, and taking time to, you know   . I   m not a drinker or a smoker. I mean, when I was coming up in the   60s, I would get to parties, and they   d have pot in California. I   d turn around and say,    Take me home,    because I wanted to be a veterinarian and I didn   t want to get arrested. I think, in general, Americans need to eat better and take time to exercise, and I think they should write a journal. I guess they could do it on their tablet. I wish I   d written a journal because I met some of the funniest people and the most interesting   .  Little Thunder While you were going to school?  Johnson Yes, while I was going to school and was a veterinarian. So many interesting things have happened. I know that the girl that   s taking over for 23  me, she just loves my practice and everybody that works for me. I know when I had my hand surgery, Dr.  Bill  Mitchell from Tulsa came and my daughter came. I   ve had several surgeries, and I had never closed my practice. I   d never met the man, but he called me and said anytime I need a veterinarian   . He   d never been in such a nice practice where everybody just liked each other. Well, we treat each other like a family. We take care of each other. That hurricane that came through here   I mean, the tornado that came through, two of my workers lost their homes. We let them off for two weeks, and Francis and I were the only person in our clinic for two weeks. We were working fourteen-hour days, and finally one day I said,    Put a sign on the door. We   re going to lunch. Even Jesus had to eat     I mean, we were taking dogs off the street that roamed up. I had a Pyrenees for four weeks before somebody came from Sparks and said,    Did you see my dog?    I said,    Yeah, he   s out back.    I mean, it was just   .  We treat each other like family, and I think that   s the secret about a veterinary business, or any business, or going to school with people. It   s just treat them how you treat a family member; be considerate of them. I   ve never lost a worker for any real bad reasons, in general. I don   t know. I have people that worked for me for twenty-eight years. They   re still working for me, and they   re going to work for the next girl until they retire. I mean, it   s been like a big family. I know that big practices are different. We   ve gone to meetings where, after the meeting, my technicians will say,    Oh, when you left they were asking us all these questions. We finally just looked at them and said,    Well, we don   t know what to tell you. We like each other         (Laughs) They   re all fighting in these practices, and they go,    We just like each other  We take care of each other.    I   ve had a really good experience being a veterinarian, and I   ve had people   . Coming back in storms and stuff, one night I saw the lights on, and I knew it was a dairy farm. I stopped in, and his wife made me some coffee because I   d pulled a calf and I was so sleepy I didn   t think I was going to make it home. I knocked on the door.    Well, come on in  Do you need a cup of coffee?    I said,    I need something  I   m going to not make it home in this snowstorm.    I like rural practice, and I like being part of the peoples    lives. I guess that   ll change over the years. I guess people will get more, you know, indifferent and isolated, but I hope not because that   s what really makes it fun, knowing the people.  Little Thunder Yeah, maybe not. We   ll hope not.  Johnson I don   t think in the rural areas you get that way too much because you just know them. There   s not that many of us out here. (Laughter) I love what I did. I would continue to do it if I was stronger, but it   s time for me to quit because of my back and stuff.  Little Thunder Right. Well, what advice would you give to OSU faculty or administrators? 24  Johnson Gee, I don   t know because I don   t know what they   re going through. I have no idea. I don   t know what the interview process and everything   s like. I think the most important thing is somebody that really wants to be a veterinarian. I don   t think I   m the smartest person that ever went to OSU. I think I   m a good veterinarian; I don   t think I   m a star veterinarian. I have no ego involved with it, so when you bring your animal in and I tell you,    You need to go see Dr. Schultz up at the university,    that I have no problem referring people because I consider myself a general practitioner. I don   t consider myself a specialist. All   s I know is that   s that only thing I ever wanted to do. When we got married, my husband promised me that we would move wherever I wanted to go to veterinary school, so he went through five degrees at MIT. Then we were in California, and then he got an offer out here so I could go to veterinary school.  We   ve been married for fifty years, and your commitments, keeping your commitments through thick and thin is what I recommend to everybody. I guess looking for the kids that have a commitment because if they want to do it, they   re going to be good at it. Veterinary medicine, like any medicine   ER doctor, it   s a commitment. It   s hard work. I mean, there   s not enough money to pay somebody to be an ER doctor in the United States, either. You   ve got to really want to help people. I think it   s just looking for those kids that really want to be a veterinarian, and then you happen to make money. That   s nice too. I don   t know. I think they should somehow get the cost down. It took us seventeen years of our marriage to pay off our debts. We had to pay off all our loans, and we just didn   t have a new car or anything. I mean, we lived with that, but I guess kids nowadays expect more stuff early. We didn   t get our first new car until we were married, like, twenty-five years. I don   t know. Maybe expectations are different.  I know that Rebecca, who   s going to hopefully join our practice when she graduates, she   s just really a   . I think she got just voted the Kind Doctor of the Year in senior class, and she is that sweet. I mean, that   s what I look for in somebody to come join the practice: somebody that worries about the animals and the people. That   s what I   m looking for because we   re all going to be good at different things, you know. Everybody   s trainable, but it   s if you like people. If you don   t like people, you shouldn   t be a veterinarian. I mean, I   ve had people throw files at me. I   ve had people accuse me of getting their dog off the street, was hit by a car, to make money. I   m like,    No, the lady brought it in because you weren   t around, and the dog got hit by a car. I didn   t go get your dog     You   re going to run into all sorts of people, and you got to have a sense of humor and realize that, unfortunately, not all people are working with a full deck of cards. (Laughter) It   s kind of like it could be a good sitcom, is what it could be. I   d still do it again. I mean, I loved every minute of it.  25  Little Thunder Well, it seems like a lot of OSU students and alumni are pretty loyal to the school. What do you think it is about OSU that sparks that kind of loyalty?  Johnson Well, I don   t know. I think it   s just a nice atmosphere at OSU. The town is not too big.     I know that Dr. Fox and different people helped me and actually took me in and kind of cuddled me. There was a couple of times after my son, who was on a monitor at home   and I had a girl who didn   t speak English taking care of him from Dominican Republic. I was very stressed, and they would say it was going to be all right. I just think that the whole university is set up to help the kids get through. If they have anxiety and stuff, I know that we just   . People from the mental health and the student health came and talked to the professors    group last time we had a meeting, and telling about how much outreach they have to help the kids if they   re having too much anxiety.  They need to take advantage of all that because there probably is more stress in our society. I   ve always found that the people at OSU were always nice to   . I mean, they didn   t have to let me graduate. They didn   t have to let me take all my tests because I hadn   t really finished my coursework, but they knew I   d come back and fulfill my commitments. They trusted me. I think that kind of trust in the students is helpful.     I just enjoyed the school; it   s a nice atmosphere. Of course, we love all the theater and stuff, too, you know. We support all that stuff. There   s all the music and stuff, too. I wish the kids would take more advantage of live theater and live music. They don   t go as much as I   d like to see them go, but I   m not into this stuff.  Little Thunder Right. (Laughs)  Johnson I   m not into the computer stuff.  Little Thunder Is there anything else you   d like to talk about or cover that we didn   t cover today?  Johnson I   ve had a lot of experiences. I just wish I   d kept a log because I could write a heck of a book if I could remember stuff better.  Little Thunder You still have that opportunity. (Laughter) I think maybe you should.  Johnson No, it   s been   we   ve had some really funny experiences     Little Thunder And some wonderful stories.  Johnson    and some really wonderful results, taking chances that, you know, people would let us take the chance. I don   t know if we made any money on that stuff, but it didn   t matter.  26  Little Thunder You saved the animal.  Johnson Yeah, most of the time the animal lived, which always amazed me, you know. The hardest thing, I think, is when you   re a veterinarian is times I   ve sent animals home because they think I can save it. I mean really, badly hit animals, like their legs are squashed or something, and they don   t want to take the leg off. Sometimes I   ve had to send animals home with all the care instructions so that I know they   d bring it back in twenty-four hours, and they   d realize it needs to be put to sleep. Put it on painkillers and show them how much trouble it   s going to be to try to take care of a leg that   s going to be necrotic. So I think being a veterinarian is a little bit like being a psychologist. I guess one of the things I   d tell the school is maybe they need   it   s not exactly the business courses. It   s the empathy for the people related to the animal. I don   t know to explain that except sometimes I think that people really can   t afford to do the things they need to do. Somehow you have to be empathetic to the fact that not everybody can do everything for their animal, especially when you have people come in and they don   t have all their teeth. They don   t have a lot of money.  They love their animals, though. I   ve always taken into consideration the love of the animal and what I could do for it. Maybe it wasn   t the best medicine, but it made it well. It wasn   t like there could have been a better procedure, (there   s no way they could do that) but the animal would be comfortable and out of pain and could live a few more years. Most people just want you take care of the animal the best you can, so I guess there   s some psychology, the empathy of the peoples    feelings. I don   t know how to say that. I don   t know if we got a lot of that in school, but I think that   s a matter of experience, maybe. I think it   s really important in veterinary medicine because I have people that their children have all moved away, their grandchildren aren   t close, they   re in their   80s, and their little dog is their life. It   s their whole life to have their dog be well enough to sleep with them and go places with them. I think veterinary medicine   s really important in that manner. Yeah, I love being a veterinarian. Do it again if I was young.  Little Thunder Well, thank you very much for your time today.  Johnson Thank you.  -------  -------
