Neurohr  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  Matthews  Neurohr  I   m Karen Neurohr, a librarian at the OSU Library. Today is Saturday,  October 21, 2006, and I   m at the ConocoPhillips Alumni Center with  two of the OSU alumni, Mr. B. J. Smith, who graduated in 1955, and Mr.  Paul Matthews, who graduated in 1954, and they   re here to record their  stories for our project titled O-STATE Stories, an oral history project of  the OSU Library. We appreciate you coming here today so that we can  hear your stories. Well, today is Homecoming for Oklahoma State  University, and let   s start with Homecoming. What were Homecoming  events like when you were students here?  Well, they were very similar to this in many ways, but the big difference  was that living groups had   usually had a house decoration and a float.  Having viewed the parade today, there were very few floats and the  living groups, the sororities and fraternities are matching up, and I didn   t  see many house decorations on independent housing or dormitory  housing, and they used to each have a display or some kind of house  decoration.  We lived in Bennett Hall. We often had both a float and a house  decoration in Bennett. We were there the first year it opened, the fall of     50. We started together. I finished a year later because I missed a  semester with rheumatic fever; it threw me behind. We went to high  school together as a matter of fact.  Oh, you did?  We were in high school class together, yes. Same graduating class.  Forty-nine of us.  Forty-nine of you? Well, what made you decide to come to Oklahoma  5  Smith  Neurohr  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  State University?  Well, I wanted to take art and I had actually never set foot on campus  because I just figured the only art school was at OU  University of  Oklahoma  and because I   d been there numerous times   Boy   s State,  speech tournaments and what not. And the principal of the high school  came around trying to see where we were planning on going to school  and I said,    Well, I guess I   ll go to OU because that   s the only art  school,    and he said,    This is not true. A M has one and they have a  very good professor, nationally-known   internationally-known, Doel  Reed.    So I had never set foot here but I decided this is where I wanted  to come, so I applied and was accepted before I actually saw the campus.  Mr. Matthews, what made you decide to come to OSU?  Well, I think both my parents liked this school. Both my parents went to  Southwest Missouri State, which is now called Missouri State  University, and they were our first opponent this year  2006 football  season . In graduating high school in Guymon, there was an inclination  to remain in northern Oklahoma. There were more OSU graduates in the  area than there were OU, and I just never cared for OU (Laughter) to be  quite frank.  I later went to graduate school there after the service, and I said I was  doing missionary work to the south. (Laughter)  Well, let   s talk a little bit about what life was like for you as students. I   d  like to know what you wore when you went to classes. What did people  wear?  All right. Typically, I wore a dress shirt with a pullover sweater, slacks,  never jeans, and not walking shoes, but regular leather shoes, you know,  nice looking shoes. The girls on campus all wore skirts and you could  see their legs, which was nice. (Laughter) And in fact, I had one  professor, he   d always have the women sit up front and he   d say,    Now  pull your skirts up, at least up to your knees as you   re sitting in the front  of my class.    We guys would sit in the back. But anyway, they dressed  better. We   ll put it that way. And later ROTC  Reserve Officers     Training Corps  was required of all freshmen and sophomores   Land  Grant colleges at the time   so everybody was in ROTC, and you wore  your uniform three days a week I believe it was.  Yes, two of those were drill days.  Drill days and then when   if we went into advanced ROTC   as most of  us did, both B. J. and I did   we were commissioned second lieutenants  6  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  Matthews  Smith  on graduation. We wore our uniform about four out of five days. So that  helped, too, in your clothing but students were a little dressier. I mean,  that four out of five days you had a tie on for most of the day and in your  classes.  And going to church without a coat and tie on was almost unheard of.  Now they come in tank tops and flip flops. (Laughter) Much different.  One big difference was   I forgot the exact figures, it   s something like  one girl for every five and a half or six boys on campus     Something like that, yeah.  I think now there are more girls on campus than boys.  And that was difficult in the dormitory because they only had one  telephone for every hallway, and it was almost impossible to find the  phone to call out. No cell phones, of course, and I worked the  switchboard in Bennett Hall and it was hard to even get calls in. So it  was easier to walk across campus and call the girl down if she was in a  dormitory or sorority house than try to make a telephone call and find  out about a date.  And they kept us separated. The boys lived in Bennett, Cordell, Hanner  and Thatcher, and the girls in Willard, Murray, North Murray and Stout.  So there was an isolation across campus to keep us apart. (Laughter)  And the girls had hours and they had to be in.  Did you not have hours that you had to be in the boys    dorms?  No.  I don   t think so.  No, the boys didn   t. The girls did.  So were there ways to get around the hours that the girls had to be  back?  Not really. They were pretty strict. No, my wife   s sorority   they had to  be in at ten o   clock. If you happened to be on the porch, the house  mother would start flashing the light meaning that the girls better get in  there pretty quick. Then they stayed out till midnight on weekends, but  that was the latest.  There was a girl at Willard, I think they closed the door at 10:30 and she  was saying goodnight to her boyfriend at 10:30 and they locked the door  7  Neurohr  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  and she had to plead to get back in. Then she was reported to the Dean  of Women for being late. (Laughter)  Well, what were sports like here at OSU when you were students?  You want to take that?  Well, as students we got tickets to all the football games and all the  wrestling matches and most of the sports. And we got every other  basketball, either even or odd games. It was automatically part of your  tuition.  Yeah, the football was not very good. We had what they called the    thin  thirty.    J. B. Whitworth was the coach and he tried to muster as many as  thirty guys to get out on the field. But they played both ways then. They  didn   t have defensive and offensive teams. They didn   t have any face  masks, by the way, either so there was never a face mask penalty while  we were in college. (Laughs) And there was a track inside the stadium.  The stadium only seated about twenty-five to thirty thousand at most at  that time. It was called Lewis Field at the time, and later on it was, too.  The basketball arena, Gallagher Hall, was   you always had to get over  there early. The student section would fill up pretty quickly and usually  we   d get there an hour and a half before a ballgame if you wanted to get  a seat. And they had good basketball teams, good wrestling. They were  the predominant sports at the time.  And there was no restriction   Gallagher was much smaller. They didn   t  restrict people sitting in the aisles or standing, so they would squeeze  nine thousand into a six thousand seat arena before they started  enforcing the fire codes.  And wrestling was full, and they aren   t anymore. Wrestling matches  were just as full as basketball games. You really had to seek an early  start if you wanted to see either a wrestling match or a basketball game.  Were the athletes treated the same as the other students?  Well, Bennett Hall was   the northwest wing was the athletic wing, and  there were two serving lines in the cafeteria. You didn   t have a choice.  You went through and they heaped on your tray whatever you were  eating that day, but their side, I was gonna say, for building strength,  they got steaks and things that we didn   t get. We got mystery meat on  our side. (Laughter)  One thing different about basketball   the players were all white. There  were no black basketball players.  8  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Nor football players either.  And the college was still segregated by when I graduated 1954. We had  one class, one or two classes where a black student would come in, and  they were in graduate school   only in graduate school. So that was quite  different.  In my senior year, we had some on campus,    54 and    55. That was after  the Topeka v. Board of Education.  Yeah. Topeka v. Board of Education. That decision had been made after  I graduated.  But in Bennett Hall, they put the few blacks up on the top floor so  there   a redneck wouldn   t object to sharing a bathroom with somebody.  In the classrooms, they sat amongst us or what not, whereas at OU they  were segregated. They put those screens around them. They were in the  same room, but they were segregated in the classrooms, which we never  did. People said,    When are they,    that got a lot of national publicity and  people said,    When are you going to integrate at A M?    And I said,     We already had. We just don   t put those screens around them, their  desks and whatnot        There were some foreign students on campus, but not very many. It was  pretty much an Oklahoma-based student body. Most everybody that you  met had graduated from an Oklahoma high school.  We had a big Ethiopian group because     Well, there were some.  Our president  Dr. Bennett  was  appointed Assistant Secretary of State  in charge of President Truman   s Point Four Program  and we  OSU  had  a branch in Ethiopia so there were two floors in Bennett that were all  Ethiopian.  Henry G. Bennett was the president when we started, and he was killed,  you know, in a plane crash in Tehran, Iran, and I went to his memorial  service   you may have, too. Senator Robert S. Kerr read the eulogies. It  was rather impressive. The field house was filled with people. And his  house was where the Bennett Memorial Chapel is now.  Yeah, he was my Sunday School teacher that first year. The next year he  was involved with Point Four and out of the country most of the time,  but   the first time I saw him on Sunday, it was like,    Who   s that little     ole funny-looking man looks like a bulldog?    They said,    That   s the  9  Neurohr  Matthews  Neurohr  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  president of the university. He   s your Sunday School teacher.     (Laughter)  Well, what was the political party system like on campus when you were  here?  Well, I was very active as a Young Republican. I was president of the  Young Republicans club for a couple of years and I grew up a  Republican, and we were the larger club. We were larger than the Young  Democrats. A very conservative campus politically. But I was also an  Independent. I was active in the Independent party. That was at that  time, we had two campus political parties. Now I understand there   s  more. The Representative party, they called it, they represented the  Greeks, all the sororities and fraternities. The Independent party, they  represented town students, those living in dorms that were unaffiliated  with a Greek organization. And we held primaries, primary elections     and then we had nominations and if you met the nomination, you ran for  the student senate or board of publications or whatever student office  that you wanted to pursue.  What did your campaigning consist of?  Well, we put out a slate of candidates. You know, largely it was  dependent upon each candidate to do their own, but the party helped  some. We would put together a slate and we   d take our candidates  around. We would call the resident in charge of, say, Willard Hall or  Murray Hall, and say,    We   d like for the girls to assemble at 10:30,    and  we were to bring our slate of candidates over, those that were gonna run  for student senate, whatever. Each of the colleges had a nominee, like  veterinary medicine, home economics at the time, education, arts and  sciences and so on. And we   d go over and we   d introduce our slate as  the president of the political party you represented, you   d introduce your  slate. And my wife tells me that the Greeks did   she was a sorority gal,  the Greeks did the same thing. They had a Representative party they  took around and they could be more sure of who they got to vote though.  They could say,    Listen, you   ve got to get out and vote. We   re gonna  give you a demerit if you don   t go down there.    Now we couldn   t do  that. We didn   t have that kind of leverage, but it was getting better by  the time. I   m not crediting myself, but I think we were getting more  Independent candidates and better candidates. B. J. has a different view  probably.  Well, I was involved. He made sure I voted so... (Laughter)  So you all knew each other when you were students here?  10  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Neurohr  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Yes, and then     We were roommates the first year, yes.     high school. Guymon was orange and black Tigers, so we didn   t have  to change colors when we came down.  Kept the same colors.  Used to be Tigers here, originally. One thing different I noticed when we  lived in Bennett Hall, very few people had cars like there was behind  this ball parking lot with cars parked facing the south end of the building  and then the other row on the other side, and they were never full. When  I came back to visit in    57 after I got out of the service, there was  parking lots everywhere and everybody seemed to have a car, at least  one car. Back then, you walked over to the girls    dorm, picked up your  date and walked her downtown to the Leachman Theater, then walked  her back home before 10:30 or whatever.  If it rained, you   d have to take a cab, but they were pretty cheap then.  And campus jobs paid fifty cents an hour. I think in the art department,  B. J. got me over to pose for an art class, and I think they paid seventy-five  cents.  That was good money.  Got to keep my clothes on though. (Laughter) Fortunate for the students  that I did.  Mr. Smith, you graduated in    55 and your degree was in what?  In art. It wasn   t specialized, just a   studio art they call it now, but I went  to graduate school and I majored in painting.  And then after you finished graduate school, what did you do?  I went to Berkeley for a couple of years and then came back. Then there  was two years of service and then graduate school and then Berkeley for  a couple of years, and I came back and worked at the   what was then  the Oklahoma Arts Center at the fairgrounds. It   s now moved downtown  and it   s called the Oklahoma City Art Museum. I came back here in the  fall of    65.  And what was your role here?  Well, they hired me   they wanted to start   pretty much galleries so  11  Neurohr  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  Neurohr  Smith  Neurohr  Matthews  since I had been working at a museum in Oklahoma City, that was my  assignment, I guess, to start a gallery, and I taught one or two classes a  semester, but my main job was the gallery.  So you started the gallery that   s currently here now?  Yeah, well, then the art department was on the top floor of Whitehurst.  The third floor was geography, I think it was, and the first two floors  was administration, and we had a small gallery up there by the elevator  that we called Whitehurst Art Gallery. Then we moved over to the     what was then Gardiner, and it was Gardiner Art Gallery. Then when  they changed it to the Bartlett Center after it was remodeled, they kept  the gallery name the same.  Was it challenging trying to get that started here?  Yes, finances being one and I did everything by myself. They   ve got  committees now, but I had to book the shows and unpack and hang the  shows, and try to squeeze as much as I could into our little budget. I  changed shows once a month, we had a new show, and shows for the  summer.  And he has a B. J. Smith conference room in the Bartlett Hall over there.  He   s the only member of our class that has a conference room named  after him.  How did you publicize the shows?  I sent press releases myself to all the newspapers in Oklahoma and some  neighboring states, like the Wichita Beacon or whatever, and tried to get  as much as I could in The O   Colly, particularly the student shows. We  had two student shows, one in the fall and one in the spring and I tried to  get them over and I tried to get photographers from the NewsPress to  come down and take pictures and I was always hassling people to get  something in the papers.  Mr. Matthews, what was your degree in?  My degree was in political science, with a minor in history and  economics, and I worked for about thirty-four years as a legislative  lobbyist. I decided I didn   t want to go to law school, and I worked the  state legislatures of Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma for thirty-four  years, and at times Illinois, Arkansas and New Mexico. I worked for an  organization based in Washington, D.C., called the Highway Users  Federation. This was a coalition of national groups like the American  Petroleum Institute and the motor vehicle manufacturers, tire  12  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  manufacturers, the American Automobile Association, trucking  associations, and other various associations such as the American Farm  Bureau Federation, the National Grange and National Auto Dealers  Association that relied primarily on trucks to move their product.  Our mission was to work state legislatures to see that laws were passed  earmarking all highway users taxes, motorist taxes, gasoline taxes, and  registration fees and the like, to roads and highways and bridges, not  diverted off to prisons and education and welfare and a variety of  others   and Oklahoma was one of those states that did some bit of  diverting. But it was an interesting career and I enjoyed just learning the  political processes of each state. My job was to work primarily with the  trade association managers, and they were also lobbyists in most cases     like the manager of the Missouri Trucking Association and he was part  of my Missouri Highway Users Federation, and I served as sort of the  ex-officio executive director of each of these state groups. I was their  meeting planner. I helped organize their coalitions and held the meetings  during the year, and then we had a regional meeting every year for at  least four states and that was fine, enjoyable, and I   m still doing some  work for the Oklahoma Highway Users Federation since I live in  Oklahoma City, and the organization didn   t seem like it could get along  on   other than my help, so I give most of my time away now.  What were the campus buildings like when you were here? The Student  Union   was it     It was brand new and, I think, our third year they started the library.  When we first   well, the year before we came, Washington Street went  through the middle of the campus and there was a lot of protest it being  closed, it being the main artery north and south. So the concrete had  been removed but there was this little muddy ditch in front of the  Student Union which is now formal gardens. And there were a lot of  Quonsets on campus between Hanner and Thatcher, a lot of Quonsets  left over from the military days, I mean, up on the   what do you call it?  Veterans    Village.  The Vet Village was up on the hill where student housing is now. It was  temporary frames they got from the army.  Were they still using those buildings when you were here?  Yes. I had classes up on the hill, those were those military     Bennett Hall didn   t have a cafeteria yet when we moved in.  13  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  It wasn   t supposed to be opened that year. We had a jump in enrollment  and they opened up so we had to walk over near where the library is  now, to a temporary frame building where they had a cafeteria for us.  Yeah. But the library   you know, the old library was essentially right  where the alumni center is. That was a much smaller facility. In fact, we  watched the campus power station destroyed where the library is and we  watched them knock down the large chimney     It was where the Classroom Building is.  Yeah, okay. You   re right. Where the Classroom Building was, you   re  right.  They roped it off and they said at a certain time they were gonna blast  that chimney, and we went to watch it fall. And they had started the  library and had the steel girders, and one guy had crawled up one of the  girders to watch it and got hit with a brick that flew across and knocked  him off of that thing. He had his picture in the paper being revived.  But the campus was, of course, we   re talking about a campus of about  nine thousand students as against what twenty thousand some now   so  about half the size in student population. Most of the students from out  of town lived in dormitories but they could and there were a lot of in  town students also. But it was a pretty self-contained campus and, as  B. J. said, you know, if you had a date, you didn   t think anything about  walking your date to the downtown theater. It was called the Leachman  Theater at that time.  Furniture store now.  Yeah. Oh, is that what it is? Okay. And there was a place called Brooks  upstairs there at campus corner across from what The Hideaway is now,  and that was   but that was kind of   it lost its patronage when the  Student Union opened up because most of them preferred to go to the  union to get a Coke or cup of coffee or whatever.  There was a lounge on every floor back then. It   s mostly offices now,  but the fourth floor had that outdoor area. They had dances out there at  night and sometimes bands, and the lounge they called the   I think it  was called the Marine Lounge on that fourth floor.  And the music was   of course, that was before rock. We had the big  band sound of the    30s,    40s into the    50s. Bands like Guy Lombardo  and Xavier Cugat and Ralph Flannigan played for the junior/senior prom  but it was good dancing, and I still prefer that music. (Laughter)  14  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  And in addition to athletic events, we got tickets to the allied arts, free  tickets. Our  48 a semester tuition that we paid back then     Our freshman year,  48 a semester bought you all the hours you wanted  to take plus your football tickets and half your basketball and half your  wrestling     And allied arts.     and your allied arts.  It went up to  75 and I said,    They   re pricing out of everybody   s range.  People will start dropping out of school if they keep raising tuition.     (Laughter)  Did you have to buy a meal card separately then or     Well, in the dorm the meals were included.  The meals were included, too?  You just went through the line and got what they were serving that day.  And we mentioned half would eat or not. I found out early on that when  students were enrolling, you could walk down the line and say,    Are you  interested in   do you like basketball?       Not very well.       Would you  like to sell your ticket to me?    Oh, maybe ten dollars will bring you the  other half of your ticket or maybe the same thing with wrestling. They  were always available and they were pretty cheap in terms of amount of  money.  Yeah, I had tickets for the first, third and fifth games. Second, fourth and  sixth were the even games and had to check the schedule to see what  you wanted   had the best selection of opponents.  Yeah. We were in the Missouri Valley Conference back then.  Who was your big rival?  OU.  OU was the big rival, yeah.  In basketball, I guess it was St. Louis.  Yeah, St. Louis, Bradley, Drake, Creighton and Wichita State were then  15  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews   in the Missouri Valley Conference .  We had originally been a charter member of the southwest conference,  then we pulled out to join the Missouri Valley to be with OU and  Kansas, and then they pulled out and started the Big Six.  And Kansas   we played Kansas every year.  Yeah.  Even though we were in a different conference, we played KU   University of Kansas . That was a big game   Henry Iba and Phog  Allen had a big rivalry going and, like you said, St. Louis U with Eddie  Hickey. Oh, DePaul. We played DePaul University of Chicago because  we had played DePaul in the Red Cross game in 1945 after we won the  National Championship, NCAA, they had the NIT, National Invitation  Champion, and the NCAA champion play each other in New York, and  we won it. That   s when Bob Kurland went against George Mikan, the  first two seven-footers, so they carried that on through our experience  here, and those were big rivalries. Good turnout though. Gallagher Hall  was full for both wrestling and basketball.  Living in the dormitory, did you feel like that was a good experience  overall? Did you really form a close bond and have lots of fun activities  outside of class with the people in the dorm?  Yeah. Yeah. The people that lived in Bennett Hall, we still see  occasionally.  We had lunch yesterday   we had a fella in Bennett Hall that lives in  Honolulu, and he comes back every summer and we met in downtown  Oklahoma City here just a couple of weeks ago and had four or five or  six of us to get together and reminisce about, you know   we get  together pretty frequently, yeah.  The good    ole days. (Laughter)  Well, when you were students here, too, the university was getting ready  to change the name. Do you remember very much about that? Was that  a big deal to the students at all?  It was changed in    57. I   ve got two diplomas. One says A M from    55,  and they gave me another one that says Oklahoma State.  Yeah, well I got a second diploma. I joined the Alumni Association right  after graduation, and they sent me a new diploma after it was renamed  16  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Smith  Matthews  Neurohr  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Oklahoma State University, and it says,    Originally conferred at  Oklahoma A M College May 1954,    so I have both diplomas even  though I only have one degree from here.  And back then   well I first came back in    65. Fall classes didn   t start till  after Labor Day and then went a week or two past Christmas.  Right, yeah.  Now it starts in early August.  That was a big change because we went on Christmas vacation but it  really was a work session because the semester didn   t end until you  came back from Christmas vacation. You went to Christmas vacation,  came back, you got three more weeks about, and then came the end of  the semester. So it   s a much nicer arrangement now, but we didn   t start  as early. We started after Labor Day and classes went until the first of  June.  A lot of students objected because they signed contracts to work through  Labor Day in the summer and they couldn   t do that when they changed  the opening dates.  Summer jobs.  Yeah, most of us had summer jobs that we were dependent upon to get  us through the school year.  Did you have spring break when you were students?  No, we didn   t have spring break.  We had a long weekend for Easter     That was all.     which they can   t do now. (Laughter)  Yeah, and that was it. No fall break.  It was called Christmas break, not winter break.  Well, we had maybe a couple of days at Thanksgiving. I don   t recall     We got off, I think, end of class on Wednesday, and had Thursday and  Friday and the weekend.  17  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Matthews  But it wasn   t like it is now in terms of breaks through the year, and I  envy the students now that can finish the semester before going home  for Christmas because I always had some kind of a term project     Yeah.     that I had to complete over the Christmas season, so that kind of  interfered with some other social activities.  I always carried books home. I didn   t always read them, but     (Laughter)  Mr. Smith, were there any professors or classes in particular that you  have a real fondness for?  Humanities was required. I don   t think they have it now, but Dr. Bailey  was my favorite teacher. I took every class of his I could. He was, I  guess you   d call it a mentor, and in the Art Department, Dale McKinney  was one of my favorites. Neither one are around now, but I have a lot of  good memories of Dr. Bailey and his teaching. He would come in very  dramatically and tell us about some novel we were reading and act out  that character or what not.  Do you remember any books in particular that you had to read when you  were     We read just about everything being as, you know, two semesters you  had to take and get all the classics, Faulkner and stuff like they probably  don   t read today.  And how full were the classes usually?  In humanities, there was a lecture one day a week and then you had the  classes three days a week. We had the lecture in the old Williams Hall,  what was that called, Prairie Playhouse?  Prairie Playhouse.  And it was always full.  That   s just south of where the Seretean Center is now.  You know, I had a very favorite. My advisor, Dr. Guy Donnell, he was a  professor of political science, always wore a bow tie. That   s another  thing, you never saw a professor in other than a coat and tie, and  certainly not Guy Donnell, he called himself a    Harry Byrd Democrat,     18  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  meaning very conservative, but he would like to gather students to have  coffee together over at the Student Union. He liked to get some of his  students together, especially when he was their advisor, and he was  always trying to get me into sociology and psychology. I preferred  history and economics, so he was always trying to broaden my interests,  I guess, but he wasn   t altogether successful but he was a great guy.  And in the history area, I guess Sidney Brown probably was one of my  favorites, and I still see him. He later unfortunately transferred to OU  and finished. He retired as a history professor there, but he was a great  guy. He came on campus about 1952, not a whole lot older than  his  students . He had just gotten his doctoral degree at the University of  Wisconsin and I had English history class with him and we had about  fourteen or fifteen in the class I guess, and I liked it because you knew  you were gonna be called on every single class. He grouped us around  sort of a semi-circle and you knew that the assignment, whatever it was,  you   d better be prepared because you were gonna be called upon and I  liked that. I liked frequent grades rather than dependence on a final  exam. But those were two guys that I really enjoyed. But I enjoyed most  of my professors here. Very different group.  When I was a student here, the Art Department was in the attic of  Morrill Hall, and it was an attic. It didn   t have any windows and there  were the concrete beams that came down. If you forgot and raised up  under one of those, you   d crack your head. They had ceramics and the  messier classes down in Quonsets by Thatcher. Then when I came back  in    65, they had moved it to the fourth floor of Whitehurst before we  finally got a permanent home in the Bartlett Center.  We had a lot of   and as he said, I had a lot of classes in Quonset huts  and they weren   t always real warm or they were too warm. The heat  regulation was difficult in those buildings, and we really felt   when we  went in the military, we felt like we were very much at home because  we   d (Laughter) gone to college in such buildings. But it was, and of  course, we had military science classes in Quonsets generally, too.  After big victories in football, they would either give us or we   d demand  a walkout the next Monday.  Oh yeah. And there were walkouts, yeah.  One time they wouldn   t give us one. I forget what game we had won,  and the students were running around trying to get the other students to  leave their classes and protest in front of the library.  Explain that a little bit. What do you mean by a walkout?  19  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  Neurohr  Smith  No classes on Monday     They didn   t declare a holiday, but if we won a big game, the students  would all group together and demonstrate on the campus     I was in a Quonset one time and they came by and they were running  sticks up and down the side of the Quonset trying to disrupt. The  professor finally gave up and said,    We   ll leave. I can   t compete with  that noise outside.     And the administrators usually gave in, and they had several panty  raids   excuse the description. I didn   t really participate in those. I don   t  know about you.  The first one I didn   t know about till the next day. I slept through the  whole thing. They said that students were running around hollering and  coming back, and I slept through it all. Didn   t even know. The next day I  heard about it, but when I came back in    65, for a few years we had the  streakers    night down on the strip. (Laughter)  And if you went steady, you were typically thrown into Theta Pond. I  was thrown into Theta Pond and unfortunately hit a rock and cut my  shoulder. It was probably a good thing because they were gonna make  me go over to the sorority house and sing to the Kappa Deltas in my  underwear, well I was spared that because I had blood all over my back.  They took me back, and it wasn   t much of a cut but it worked to my  benefit.  I was thrown in my senior year just because I   d never been thrown in  and everybody just thought I should go in before I graduated. (Laughter)  I   ve got pictures of it. Someone carried a camera along and took pictures  of them carrying me down the street in my underwear and throwing me  in.  I notice that you   re both wearing a ring on your hand today. You might  hold those up for the camera. Are those your class rings?  Yes. Mine says    55.  And, if you could, just describe what   s on your ring. I think   did you  select what symbols would be put on there?  Well, mine says    55 and it has the Union, which is real worn. This side  says BFA, Bachelor of Fine Arts, and has the old crest with the wheat  shock, the plow and the gear, which is still on   above the windows on  the old part of Gallagher Iba.  20  Matthews  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  Neurohr  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Mine is essentially the same. The Student Union is pretty well worn off  that side. As I said, the symbol at the time was a plow and a wheat  shock, and mine says BA    54 and, of course, the date of 1891 when  Oklahoma A M College was founded. I had a fiftieth anniversary two  years ago here and a fella who was also from the class of    54 asked me if  there was any chance that I   d sell this ring, and I said,    Well, no way at  all.    And in fact I said   he had a hand twice the size of mine. I said,    I  don   t know how you   d get one, you know, but undoubtedly somebody  would make that.    I asked the Alumni Association here one time and  they said no, they didn   t have any in stock, but Balfour or somebody  probably has some kind of a design. I don   t know, but it was unique and  it   s still serviceable at least. I wear it every day.  Do you wear it everyday?  I wear mine for good luck in football games. (Laughter) I didn   t wear  mine as much because my hand got fatter as well as my body did after I  graduated so I had it enlarged about   oh, probably ten years ago, so I  started wearing it again.  He did more manual labor than I did I guess. My hands remained pretty  small.  Well, what do you   obviously you   ve come back for Homecoming, you  come to reunions and things like that, so what do you think it is about  OSU that brings people like yourselves back and that makes you  maintain that connection with the university?  As the current theme is, we   re    orange forever    I guess. (Laughter)  You   ve got a lot of good memories, you come back hoping to see some  people you used to know.  Right. Yeah, we enjoyed ourselves here, and four of the better years of  my life were here. I even came back for Homecoming when my wife  and I lived in Wisconsin. That was a pretty good little trip. We came  down and spent two or three days and it was fun to get together with  people we knew and see the games. But after we moved back to  Oklahoma City, of course, I come back to Homecoming every year and  my wife comes back occasionally. Most years she comes back and she  maintains a very close relationship with her sorority here, more so than I  think we do. I think fraternity and sorority membership brings people  back together a little more than a dormitory life does, in terms of getting  back on a reunion type of thing, but we get together informally with  people we knew in college and we do this about every summer.  Our freshman year that summer was when the Korean War started so   I  21  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  was reading the only sure deferment was ROTC because you had to take  the first two years. But a lot of people were transferring to schools that  had ROTC and Panhandle State got ROTC because they were losing so  many students. Truman had declared it to be a national emergency, so  being in college wasn   t an automatic deferment like it was in Vietnam.  And interestingly, and you won   t remember this, but President Truman  fired General MacArthur as the commander and chief, and there was  quite a demonstration on campus in opposition to that, and I was among  the demonstrators, I recall. But I found it was   that Truman should not  have gotten rid of MacArthur at the time, but generally speaking though  it was a pretty peaceful feel   there wasn   t agitation. There weren   t a lot  of people  demonstrating  around, like there were in the    60s certainly.  Or violent.  No, there wasn   t any violence     No burning buildings        no threats of bombing of any kind. Well, there were no drugs. I didn   t  know any   in four years here. I never knew of anybody that took any  kind of drugs. Now, there were some   in fact, there were a lot of people  that smoked, more so than now. Oklahoma was dry then. There  wasn   t   there were no alcoholic   3.2 beer, that was the only beverage  that was sold of an alcoholic nature so that was one thing in the  dormitories, they very closely monitored people bringing liquor into the  dormitory, and you   d see posted occasionally a number by a telephone  and generally that was a bootlegger   s number because that was the only  way that that liquor could be purchased. There were no liquor stores in  Stillwater.  You had to drive to Kansas.  Yeah, or drive out somewhere, but anyway   from that standpoint, there  really wasn   t any. And most of the hair styles were short among men.  We wear our hair about like we did when we were in college and, you  know, students were generally pretty neat but you didn   t see any of these  hippie types roaming around campus. If there had been, they   d have  probably been thrown in Theta Pond.  The big controversial haircut when we were here was the ducktail. You  had a flat top with long hair on the side that went back and sort of  looked like a duck tail. It looked like   that got you, you know   your  parents upset and what not. I got my first flat top here because I couldn   t  get it to lie down so I decided I   d let it stand up. The little barbershop  22  Neurohr  Matthews  Smith  Neurohr  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Neurohr  Matthews  where I got it done the first time is still here. There was a white stucco  building across from Joe   s was the barbershop. And it gets harder and  harder to find people to do flat tops, but sometimes people call this a  crew cut. A crew cut is rounded back here and squared in the front. If  it   s squared all over, it   s called a flat top. If it   s short all over, it   s a  butch but no one knows those differences anymore. (Laughter)  I didn   t know. (Laughs) Did you have family members who came to  OSU? Is that a tradition in your family at all?  Well, my youngest son came here initially because he promised his dad  he   d graduate from OSU and he did, but he graduated from Ohio State  University in Columbus, Ohio. Couldn   t get his major here. He decided  he wanted to get a major in audio recording engineering, and Ohio State  was one of three schools that offered it, and we could afford it and we let  him go up there. The other son started in a small liberal arts college in  Illinois, went in the service, got married, divorced and then came back  out and finished an accounting degree at Southern Illinois University.  He   s now a CPA in St. Louis. The younger son that went to Ohio State  fortunately married a Texas girl and lives in Dallas so he   s a little closer  than we expected him to be.  My brothers  Lindell A. Smith, the oldest, went to NYC School of  Interior Design, and middle brother George went to the University of  Denver. I am the youngest.  and I were the first in my family to go to  college, and my older brothers went in through the GI Bill. When I came  here, it was in    50.  Are there any other stories that you want to share with us today for the  interview? Anything else you   d like to tell us?  Well, you know, I   d have to think a minute about that.  Something that   s G-rated, I guess. (Laughter)  Well, I think you know generally it was a nice experience. We were  reasonably well behaved. I played in the ROTC band for two years. That  way I didn   t have to clean a rifle each week. You got to wear white  leggings and a white helmet. And the ROTC band was about as big as  the college band at the time. We played for a couple of football games in  fact.  What instrument did you play?  I played a clarinet, and I had played a clarinet in Guymon High School.  B. J. was the editor of our newspaper in high school and I was a sports  23  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  Smith  Matthews  editor. I worked for him. He was my boss. (Laughter)  The ROTC was in where architecture is now. That was still the old gym  back then, but that west side was where their offices were. There were  Quonsets on both sides. There   s one over there.  But the big difference is in the students. I think the most noticeable thing  that you could say from the decade of the 2000   s against the decades of  the early 1950   s is how the student body looked. If you could take a  picture of the people walking across campus, you   d say,    My gosh, this  is kind of a military school, isn   t it?    The women students were very  neatly dressed   they were   and but   today, not to say that they look  bad by any means   but having been on campus frequently, they aren   t  as neat in the way they looked in the 1950s.  I know coming back and being on the faculty, when I was a student, you  didn   t question your grade. If the instructor gave you a    D,    you feel like  you deserved it. Then after I came back, they got in the student rights  thing and people started protesting grades and taking you to committees  to review what the grade you   d given them and all this, and student  evaluations was a big change in student attitude toward faculty when I  came back.  You know, I wasn   t exposed to that. I   m glad I didn   t have to give  anybody any grades. (Laughter)  What advice would you give to students of today or to future students?  I   d say pursue a course that you want to work in the rest of your life.  You ought to work in something you like and enjoy. There   s no  percentage in being in a field in which you feel it   s a burden to go to  work every day. Certainly both of us   I mean, we worked in areas that  we really enjoyed and got to pursue it.  With being in art, I was one of the few whose parents supported   a lot  of people had their parents say,    I   m not gonna pay for you   you   re  wasting your time getting a degree in painting.    And dad told me one  time, he said,    I don   t know how you   ll ever earn a living, but do what  you want to do.    And I found out later when he was a young man, he  wanted to be an artist but his dad got him an apprenticeship in a machine  shop so he could earn a real living, and I found out his   he had an uncle  on the Smith side that his dad got him a job at the railroad and kept him  from being a painter, so I was the first one that was allowed to pursue  what I wanted to do.  But there are a lot of majors available, and I think maybe that students  24  Smith  Matthews  Neurohr  should pursue   they should look to see what is available or some areas  that they may not have thought of, their parents may not have thought of,  and they should pursue it.  When I was teaching   like I said, they used to   they probably should  take a year off between high school and college to get that out of their  system before they come here and party the first semester and flunk out  and have to start over. It is usually their first time away from home. As  far as advice, I would tell them to do what you want to do and be  serious. I knew students when I was a student that would change their  major their senior year. They   d decide they didn   t want to work in this  field so they switched to another area they liked and discovered they  liked better. Okay. Well, I don   t know if that   s any good or not.  I hope we covered what you wanted.  Thank you for your time today...  -------  -------
