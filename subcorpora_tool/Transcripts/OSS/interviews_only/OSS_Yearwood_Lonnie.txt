 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University Library. Today is Wednesday, April 20, 2016. I   m in Colony, Oklahoma, Washita County, to interview Lonnie Yearwood as part of our Cowboys in Every County Oral History Project. Lonnie, thank you for sitting down with us today.  Yearwood Thank you.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s begin by learning a little bit more of where we are, here in Colony. Can you tell me a little bit about the area?  Yearwood Sure. Colony started in 1886 when my great-grandfather brought about thirty Arapaho Indians here for settlement to learn how to farm and, I guess you could say, become white men. They were some of the   they were kind of called coffee coolers at Darlington  Agency . They were some of the worst that were drinking and gambling and not doing what the agency wanted them to do. When he came, the people at the agency said,    Well, when their rations run out, that   ll be it. They   ll be back at the agency,    but it didn   t turn out that way. My great-grandfather was able to get them established down here, and then the Cheyenne Indians came later. I think probably at the peak, there were about five hundred that came down here and made a go of it, more or less. From 1886 to 1892, it was just them. Then in 1892, the Cheyenne and Arapaho Reservation opened for settlement. The Indians went from being the only population, essentially the only population here, to being about one in ten. It was a massive change for them. The town kind of flourished during that period. My great-grandfather, they built a school in 1892, and it opened in 1893. He was superintendent, and he stayed in that position until 1905 and then became, like, an assistant farmer. He kind of had his ups and downs at times.      In 1905, he stepped down as superintendent and then asked to remain as the assistant farmer to teach the Indians agriculture. He did that until 1911 and then went to the Absentee Shawnee  Tribe  for two years, from 1911 to 1913. He retired at 1915. He served as a Union soldier during the Civil War. 5  He was under General Sherman and was a part of Sherman   s march to the sea. After retiring in 1915, he wrote stories and made speeches and made money that way. Then in 1920, I guess it   s probably Department of Interior graciously let him come back to work for seven months in 1920. That allowed him to get a pension, so that was really nice. Then he remained living in Colony until he passed away in 1928. The town was still going pretty well and really did okay until, well, probably until  1927  when they closed the agency. They closed the school  in 1932 . Then the town sort of went down and, of course, has never recovered. There are about a hundred and fifty people that live here today.  Nykolaiszyn Did he have any children?  Yearwood They had actually eleven, and four died  before  age three.  The age of the four children ranged from three months to two years, eight months.  The seven that lived, two of those still have descendants today. I   m from his youngest daughter, Lena. She was a longtime telephone operator here. The other one that has descendants is Harry, and he went back to Illinois, back to the East. There were two others that had some kids, but they   . Like my uncle Jed had a son that died at about age three, I think. My uncle Neatha had a son and daughter. Neither married, so didn   t have children. The son was killed during World War II.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your parents.  Yearwood Well  My dad was a farmer, and he went to work for the ASCS  Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service , which is the Federal Agricultural   I can   t really say the name, recall it, but they kind of regulated farmers, telling what they could plant and what their prices would be and stuff like this for the goods. My mother was pretty much a housewife and then, of course, worked on the farm. She grew up in Colony and pretty much spent her entire life here. Well, I say that. When my dad transferred, well, he went to Cordell, and we moved to Cordell for   I was just there for five years before I graduated from high school. They lived there until Dad retired, and then they came back to the farm and lived on the farm northeast of Colony until both of them passed away, except my dad. When he got really ill, he went to live with my older sister and actually passed away in Ponca City.  Nykolaiszyn And what year were you born?  Yearwood I was born in 1949, Hinton, Oklahoma. I had a twin sister. I was born before her. The interesting   I have an older sister, Glenda. When they went to the hospital, I was born first. Dad went down and told my grandparents, his parents and my mom   s parents, that he had a boy. Then he goes back up, and Connie is born, my twin sister. He goes back down, and, course, he   s so 6  excited and everything. He tells them,    I   ve got a boy and a girl,    and they don   t realize what he   s saying. They say,    Yeah, we know. We know.    He says,    No, no, I mean I have a boy and a girl.    They said,    We know that     He finally made it through,    No, I mean a boy and two girls. I got a boy and a girl today     It was only then that they understood what he was saying.  Nykolaiszyn And so there were three children?  Yearwood Yes.  Nykolaiszyn So in your early years, your youth, did you grow up on the farm?  Yearwood Yes.  Nykolaiszyn Okay. So I   m guessing you had a fair amount of farm chores?  Yearwood Yes.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me about your farm chores.  Yearwood I could actually milk a cow, (Laughter) which is not as easy as one would think. It takes a little bit of practice. We were just like on a quarter section, but we had all sorts of animals. We had several sets of ducks that were named Jack and Jill. I don   t know why we always named them Jack and Jill, but that   s the way it went. Dogs and cats and, course, cattle, and we grew up working on the farm. Even after we moved to Cordell, my parents would get us up when it was dark, and we would drive from Cordell to Colony to move the irrigation pipe. When we started out, we were thinking,    My gosh, when we get there, it   s going to be too dark to see the pipe. What are we going to do?    When we got there, we could always see it. The water, of course, was icy cold. We   d move the pipe and then go back to Cordell and get ready to go to school. We did that for all our high school years. They didn   t purchase a wheel movement until after we left. We told them about it (Laughter) because we could have gotten it earlier.  Nykolaiszyn Going to school, your high school years in Cordell, were there subjects you were really drawn to?  Yearwood I was kind of strong in math, and I started out as a math major at OSU. I did all right until I got to linear algebra. It just didn   t click, so I switched to accounting. I went and did a vocational test. Like the first two out of the top three were in accounting, so I switched to accounting.  Nykolaiszyn Were your sights always set on college, or were you thinking other things?  7  Yearwood I was always going to go to college. I was valedictorian of my class, and it was just more or less assumed that I would go there. When I looked at schools, I decided on OSU because I had an uncle that went there in the 1950s. Really liked him, and he really liked OSU. For that reason, I decided to go there.  Nykolaiszyn Did you visit at all beforehand?  Yearwood At this point, I really can   t remember. I got a scholarship. I can   t really remember whether I did or not.  Nykolaiszyn Okay.  Yearwood If I did, I don   t recall that.  Nykolaiszyn So you graduate from Cordell High. You   re getting ready to go to OSU. How did you get there?  Yearwood I had a car.  Nykolaiszyn What kind of car?  Yearwood Mercury Monterey (Laughter) that worked pretty well except for the times it caught on fire. (Laughter) There was a wiring problem. A couple of times I got stranded. That wasn   t much fun. One time, I used a blanket to try to put the fire out with, and, of course, I lost the blanket. It wasn   t as bad as my neighbor. This was in, gosh, junior year maybe. I had a roommate from Oklahoma City, and he drove this little Rambler. I can   t remember what happened to his father. His father was long gone, so he was raised by his mother. This Rambler was just in horrible condition, and he would drive it from Oklahoma City to Stillwater. When he got there, he would get out, and he would put this dishpan underneath the engine to catch the oil. When the weekend would come that he was going home, he would pull the dishpan out and pour the oil in the engine and go to Oklahoma City. I presume that when he got to Oklahoma City, he put the dishpan underneath the engine, caught the oil, poured it back in before he came back. That   s what he did. It worked, but I   m sure the car eventually quit on him.  Nykolaiszyn What year did you graduate high school?  Yearwood I graduated from high school in 1967.  Nykolaiszyn Okay, and you headed straight to OSU after you graduated?  Yearwood Yes.  8  Nykolaiszyn So your freshman year, where did you live on campus?  Yearwood Freshman year I was in Cordell Hall. I came from Cordell and went into Cordell Hall, which was really nice. It was so close to campus, and I had a class in the building just south of Cordell Hall. I believe it was biology. I could get up at seven twenty and make class, be in class by seven thirty. It was pretty nice.  Nykolaiszyn So you mentioned you changed your major from math to accounting. When you   re going to school during those early years, any classes stand out in your mind?  Yearwood Well, the one thing, OSU had an orientation, and that was really good. The first year there was pretty difficult. What they told us at the orientation was,    Before you decide whether you like it or not, go make the first year.    I did, and toward the end of the first year it was kind of, it became like,    Oh, I kind of like this.    Then I, of course, came back. When I first started out, Cordell Hall was really crowded, and I didn   t get a roommate until several weeks later. I was first put into a corner room with two upperclassmen. As the people dropped out and rooms opened up, then I got a roommate. Just had to live with one person, rather than two, because those rooms were made for two people, not three. I don   t know.  Nykolaiszyn Did you have a job that first year?  Yearwood I pretty much worked all the way through. Maybe I didn   t. One summer I didn   t, but I would usually get a job at the university. I would work in the cafeteria or something like that. One year I decided to branch out and work in the livestock barn. My job was to clean out the calf pens in the morning. The odor was just unreal because they had spent all the time eating and pissing and pooping. I remember one time, too, there was this large pen that had a cow in it. She had a hole in the side of her about this big. When she would exhale in the cold weather, you had a cloud that would come out of the deal. Even though I grew up on the farm, I was really uneasy about cleaning that pen because it was so strange. It was like,    Gosh, are you okay?    (Laughs) She just stood there. I don   t know what they were doing to her, but I mean it was a massive hole in the side of her.  When I would get through, after spending several hours in there, my clothes would pick up such an odor that when I got back to the dorm, I either had to wash them or do something else with them. What I did was I wired them to a hanger, and I hung them outside the dorm window. (Laughs) It was a lot easier that way than taking them down to the laundry every time. The classes that stood out, of course, I liked my accounting classes, and I really liked Walter James. He was an accounting professor there. There were several really good ones. Of course, they had Wilton Anderson. Now, I did 9  not get him, but I got  Milton  Usry and  Gary Michael  Crooch and  Richard  Flaherty, who kind of stand out. They were really good. Then economics, I really liked economics, and I can   t remember the professor   s name. I had him one summer. He authored the book that he was teaching from, but I really loved that course.  Nykolaiszyn Well, what did you do for fun?  Yearwood I wasn   t really a party-type guy, so I wasn   t out partying all the time. I was pretty serious. I   m still kind of that way. I spent most of my time studying. That was kind of hard at times because I   d try to avoid it, too, so you kind of wrestle with yourself.  Nykolaiszyn Where were some of your favorite places to study?  Yearwood I tried them all, (Laughter) all floors of the library, all floors of the Student Union, the Colvin Center, of course my dorm, study areas in the dorm, all of them. When I couldn   t study in one, I   d move to another. I can   t say that any was a favorite. I lived on campus most every semester until I got to be a junior or senior and into graduate school.  Nykolaiszyn Always in Cordell or   .  Yearwood In Stillwater.  Nykolaiszyn Did you live in another dorm outside of Cordell before you moved off campus?  Yearwood Yes, yes.  Nykolaiszyn Where   d you moved to?  Yearwood I was in Willham. I think I was in Kerr   Kerr-Drummond maybe once. Willham for a year or so, and then moved off campus with a couple guys. We were in an apartment for one semester, and then we moved to a house for one semester. That didn   t turn out so well. We were unhappy with the apartment manager, and that   s why we left there. Then we got this house that was off campus. It was one of those houses that   s not really maintained well, but it   s a cash cow to the owner. That was where I caught the house on fire. What I did there was I got up one morning and put some bacon in the skillet and was frying it. The house had such an odor that we had scented candles. We had them sitting on the dining room table, just outside the kitchen. I lit two or three of them to get the scent going, then went out and got the newspaper. At some point came back in, and I spread the newspaper out   unthinkingly over the candles.  10  The newspaper caught fire. I can   t remember where I went, whether I went back into the kitchen, but I heard this cracking and popping. I got to thinking. I was standing at the stove and it was like,    Wait a minute. That   s not quite coming from the skillet.    I looked out through the doorway, and the top of the table was on fire. (Laughs) The newspaper was burning, and I was like,    Ah     I couldn   t think what to do, so I grabbed the tablecloth that was on there and wadded it up and made a run for the door. Well, there were holes in it, so as I was going to the door, I was dropping things that were burning. I burned the top of the table; I burned the carpet in several places. I think I burned a textbook   . We didn   t tell the owner at that time, but then the semester ended. I said,    By the way, there   s some burn marks on the table and in the carpet. You can have my deposit.    He kept it.  Nykolaiszyn What did your roommates think?  Yearwood Well   . (Laughter) We had other issues with this house. When the wind would get up, the pilot on the furnace would burn out. It was not a good experience, and never did get rid of the odor in the house. We found a petrified hamburger in there when we moved in.  Nykolaiszyn Oh, my goodness.  Yearwood It wasn   t good, but it was a large house  We all had separate bedrooms, but one semester was enough. We didn   t want to do it again.  Nykolaiszyn On campus, what was the political climate like?  Yearwood I graduated in    71 with a bachelor   s,    72 with a master   s, so you   re talking about the tail end of the    60s. It was pretty unsettled. I even remember (and that would   ve been, like, my first year there) when Martin Luther King was assassinated and going to something in memory of him. It was strange. You kind of look back and   . I wasn   t a radical or anything, out there leading or anything, but it was a very unsettled period.  Nykolaiszyn You   re moving through your degree program, and you   re studying accounting. Any ideas of what you want to go on and do? Did you take part in any internships or   .  Yearwood Well, I was, I think, really fearful of going to work and going out on my own. I wasn   t really ready for it. That probably was a driving force for me staying another year and getting my master   s because I wasn   t sure what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go. I   m still working on that today. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Your graduation for your undergraduate degree, did you walk? Did you attend a commencement? 11  Yearwood I attended the commencement.  Nykolaiszyn Did your parents come on up?  Yearwood Yes, yes.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me what you remember from that time.  Yearwood It was not like they do it today. It was the entire university, and we were in Lewis Field. They more or less just had speakers, and I believe that was it. They didn   t do names or anything like that. I like how they do it now much better, where they do it by school.  Nykolaiszyn Oh, yeah.  Yearwood When I was there, it was everybody. We did that on my bachelor   s. It was sort of like,    Meh,    so master   s, I don   t think we did anything. (Laughs) We just left.  Nykolaiszyn You went straight in for your master   s degree, just kind of delaying college a little bit longer, right?  Yearwood Avoiding going to work.  Nykolaiszyn Sure, sure. What happened then after you graduated?  Yearwood After I graduated, I went to work for Arthur Andersen for a little bit. It didn   t really work out, and then I went to work for a small company   . Yeah, I   m trying to think. Then I ended up going to work for the State of Oklahoma, and that   s where I ended up staying.  Nykolaiszyn What did you do for the State?  Yearwood I was in both accounting, budgeting, and auditing. I ended up in the audit for the last couple decades of the time I was there. We had contracts with a large number of non-profit programs, and I would go out and audit them and audit, also, our state agencies.  Nykolaiszyn So you retired from the State?  Yearwood I retired from that.  Nykolaiszyn What year did you retire?  Yearwood I retired in 2007. 12  Nykolaiszyn Okay, so I   m guessing during the period you worked for the State, you were not living in this area.  Yearwood That   s correct.  Nykolaiszyn What city were you in?  Yearwood I was living in Oklahoma City.  Nykolaiszyn Okay. So here we are today in Colony. How   d you get back to Colony?  Yearwood We were living, actually, living in Edmond. We were in Oklahoma City for most of the time I worked, but near the   . It would   ve been    97 we moved to Edmond, so I guess the last ten years I was in Edmond. It   s because of the building here in Colony, the parsonage that I showed you that   s catty-corner to this house. It was built in 1897. It was part of the Reformed Church   s mission to the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians. I wanted the house because of its history. I tried to buy it from the owners, but they were wanting more than what I was willing to pay for it. Then the house sold in, I believe, I   m going to say, like, 2005. I thought,    Well, that   s   .    They got what they wanted, which I wasn   t willing to pay. I thought,    Well, that   s it. I   ll never get it now.     The person who bought it made some improvements on it and then put it up for sale. I think she was asking, like, 90,000, and so I convinced my wife that   . I said,    Let   s offer sixty. They won   t take it, and I   ll be satisfied.    We offered sixty, and she took it. Course by then, we were still living in Edmond. My sister, who lives on the family farm northeast of here, was wanting me to come back here. We had a house, so we did. We ended up selling our house in Edmond, the bottom of the housing market, and came down here. It was a change. We were used to having everything at our fingertips, and then down here it   s fifteen miles to Weatherford, which is still   . I mean, you have some stuff there, but it   s still not like the City or Edmond.  Nykolaiszyn How has Colony changed through the years?  Yearwood Colony really has not changed much. I think they lost the school, the high school, in 1968, then the elementary school. They had the elementary school for a few years, and I can   t remember when it closed. Since then, there   s really been not much. When I was here as a child, it was, of course, down from what it was previously. We had a grocery store and a barber shop, a drug store. I think there was a laundry. Today we have a caf  . I think it was a caf   in the old days and an auto repair and stuff like that, gas station. 13  Today, you have a caf   and a post office and the water department, and that   s it. It is smaller.  Nykolaiszyn What   s left today on the old Indian school land?  Yearwood The only thing left over there now is the water tower. All the other buildings have mostly been destroyed by fire. There was one   the boys    dormitory burned in  1971 ; the classroom building in 1990, I believe. Then the last building, the mess hall, went in 2011 when we had a wildfire south of here that almost got the south part of the town. At the time, we were living in the parsonage, and we evacuated. Our yard caught on fire several times, but they were able to put it out. Pretty close.  Nykolaiszyn Today, you   re pretty active in the town even though you   re in retirement sort of?  Yearwood Right, I   m saying that I need to go back to work so I can catch up. (Laughter) I   m the mayor, and I   m also an elder in the Presbyterian Church, and then also a volunteer for the county historical society. There   s never a shortage of things to do. We   re taking on, the town is taking on some buildings. We   re hoping to save the buildings and open a museum that would show the history of the town and also the history of the Indians that came here. The Cheyenne Arapaho visited us a week ago to look at the unnamed Indian cemetery south of here and indicated that they might work with us on the museum. We   re at the ground floor right now. I   m hopeful that something will happen, but that all remains to be seen.  Nykolaiszyn Well, tell me how you met your wife.  Yearwood I went to work for the State Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, and she worked there. We became acquainted there, and we were both working for the same boss. Then we started dating and decided to get married. Then we popped into our boss    office one day, and he had no idea anything was going on because we were very discreet. Said,    We   re getting married.    (Laughs) He   s like,    Oh     Which wasn   t a problem since neither one of us was over the other one, and it was okay. We got married, she continued doing her job, and I continued doing mine.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your children.  Yearwood I have three children. Andrew   s the oldest, and we had him in 1983. It took us five years before we could get to the second one because he almost did us in. He was really a good kid, but kids take a lot of time. Then my daughter Emily was born in 1988. My last daughter, Connie, was born in 1990, and she   s named after my twin sister. Andrew was a National Merit Scholar at Edmond Memorial, which was really nice because we didn   t have to pay for 14  his education at OSU. That was paid for all the way through. He majored in engineering and did really well. He   s in engineering today. This week is in Florida, and I understand he   s giving some presentations down there in some kind of engineering conference. He has a really good, sharp mind. My daughter Emily went to OSU Technical Institute in Oklahoma City to become a vet tech, and she was really, really good at it. She kind of reached the upper limit on pay, and that wasn   t as much as she wanted or wants or needs. She has gone back to   she is actually going to UCO, but she   s going to college to get an accounting degree to become a CPA like me. Of course, I   m thinking, like,    Well, didn   t she see all the struggles I had?    (Laughs)  I guess not, but she   s going into it. I   m not the really good capitalist, and she   s more like that. She   s got the time management skills I don   t have, and she   s looking at it like,    Well, if I go into accounting, I can make some money.    I think she   s going to do much better. She actually has an internship with an accounting firm, and they seem really happy with her. She has a lot of personal skills, people skills that I just don   t have, so she   s a good mixer. My youngest daughter, Connie, all of our kids had an interest in animals, but she and Emily really got interested in horses because of my sister, Connie. Today, I own the horse that Emily did own, but Connie works with horses full time since graduating from vet school at OSU. She   s completing her year of internship at Oakridge  Equine Hospital  in Edmond, and she   s getting ready to go to California for another internship out there. We   re hoping that she comes back from there. I think they probably chose OSU because I did, and I chose it because my uncle did. They, I think, have no regrets that they enjoyed their time there, and they got a very good education.  Nykolaiszyn Have you visited Stillwater much since you   ve graduated?  Yearwood Not an awful lot. Some of that is, driving is really difficult for me. I have narcolepsy and take medication for that. Strangely enough, I kind of developed that when I was at OSU. It was a bit of a chore for me to make the drive from Cordell (that   s where my parents were still living) to Stillwater. I had times where I just simply had to pull off the road. One morning I got up after eight hours    sleep, and climbed in the car, and went to Ponca City to visit my older sister, Glenda, and fell asleep, and took out a telephone pole.  Nykolaiszyn Wow.  Yearwood It   s been a little bit of a problem. The medication I take helps me, but driving still is exhausting.  Nykolaiszyn Do you try to stay connected to the university in any way?  15  Yearwood Well, I make contributions, monetary contributions. (Laughs) I didn   t really stay connected with the people I met during there. I   m kind of a loner in a way, but I did try to find my first roommate I had in Cordell Hall. He lived in Enid, and I simply could not find him at all and gave up. I was really surprised because the name just was not showing up. Then last year, he found me on Facebook, so that was pretty neat. We   re not really establishing a relationship because he has moved to Florida. His child and grandchild are down there, but I still see posts from him on Facebook.  Nykolaiszyn Looking back at your time at OSU, how did it have an impact on your life moving forward, or did it?  Yearwood Well, certainly it had an impact because it determined where I worked and what I did. I think the education I got there, I probably didn   t really appreciate it as well as I should have, I guess, in the sense that (I don   t know if it sounds egotistical or not) I probably knew more than graduates from other schools but wasn   t always aware of it. I was very happy with, pretty much, with all the professors I got there. There were a couple that weren   t really great, but most of them were very good.  Nykolaiszyn We   re close to other universities in the area, relatively speaking. Do you run into many OSU grads in this part of Oklahoma?  Yearwood Yes, here in Colony we have the Weichels. I believe Keith and both of his sons graduated from OSU: Zach, who recently graduated, he got a degree in, I think, agricultural science. Jeremy, his brother, got a degree in engineering, and Keith, the father, I think also in engineering. Interesting, Jeremy, after he got his engineering degree, he went to work for an engineering firm and   .  Ida Yearwood That   s not Jeremy; that   s Justin.  Yearwood Justin?  I. Yearwood Yeah.  Yearwood Are you sure?  I. Yearwood Yes.  Yearwood Justin graduated from OSU, also?  I. Yearwood Yes.  Yearwood Justin is a cousin. I   m still not sure she   s right, (Laughs) but anyhow, I   ll go with Justin. He went to work on Monday for an engineering company, and, 16  of course, he grew up on the farm. They   re big in cattle; they ride horses all the time. In fact, Jeremy runs a feedlot today   Justin. Justin runs a feedlot today. He went to work on Monday, and then by Friday he, I guess, went to his boss, and said,    Look, I   m sorry but I   m giving my two weeks    notice. This really isn   t me,    the engineering field. He didn   t want to sit behind a desk. Told them he was quitting and giving his two weeks    notice. They told him,    You   ve only been here a week, so you really don   t need to give us two weeks    notice.    (Laughs) That was it, and then he went back to the farm, the ranch. That   s what he   s been doing since.  Nykolaiszyn We notice when we talk to alumni that they   re very loyal to OSU. What do you think sparks that loyalty?  Yearwood I   m not sure. I know my uncle was rabid. He was nuts. (Laughs) If they didn   t do well in the football game, he would just go ballistic. I   m not that way. My wife is more of a sports fan than I am. She   s really pro-OSU. She   s also pro-OU but I think probably favors OSU more on account of me. Of course, I always want to see them win. I think I learned, like   well, because I used to get depressed if they lost. Then I got to thinking one day,    I really don   t know anybody on the team, so should I really be getting depressed?    So I kind of backed off, and I can take it now. I like to see them win, but if they lose, eh.  Nykolaiszyn It   s not the end of the world.  Yearwood It   s not the end of the world. I don   t know; it   s hard to say. Yeah, the loyalty, I don   t know. It just happens. That   s all I can say. Like I say, I make my annual contribution to OSU.  Nykolaiszyn We   ve kind of did the quick tour through your family life and your time at OSU. Is there anything else I   m missing? Is there anything you want to revisit or talk about before we end today?  Yearwood I guess I could go with my work in the cafeteria.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk about your work in the cafeteria.  Yearwood There was also something else, too, but I wasn   t a part of it. The first thing I did was when I was working in Willham. That was an experience. I think dorms were pretty new back then. I lived on the twelfth floor. I   m not even sure what it was, but the college students were   I guess you go through those periods, particularly when you get close to finals. Students kind of act out, and the students would mess with those elevators and break them. There were several mornings when I would get up, and all four elevators would be broken. They would pull the doors open between floors and close them back, and eventually they would just stop working. I would go down twelve 17  floors, have breakfast, go back up twelve flights of stairs, get my books, brush my teeth, wash my face, and go to class down twelve flights of stairs. One semester, when I was working in the cafeteria, there was some kind of budgetary crisis. We were called into the kitchen by the manager. He was saying that we needed to be cost conscious, not be wasteful, and there was there with him several pans of bread that had mold on them. He said,    Now, we can do certain things such as this,    and he would break the mold off the bread and put the good part back.  Said,    We can take this and use it as something else.    We listened and went about our business. Then the next day, I was working at the mid-meal at noon, and along this one row   we had these large, massive, stainless steel vats that were full of soup. I think there were two of them. Next, just south of them, there were a couple of stainless steel sinks. As I was working, I saw that somebody had spilled something on the floor near there, so I went and got this mop out of the stainless steel sink that was in cleaning chemical. Rinsed it out, put it on the floor, mopped up whatever was on the floor. Course, it was hurry-hurry when they open the line. It was sometimes like chaos. Anyhow, when I kind of got stuff mopped up, then I picked the mop up, and I put it into what I thought was the sink. It wasn   t. It was the large vat of soup. Then I started thinking about the meeting that we had the day before, thinking,    Oh, my gosh, if we have to pour out sixty gallons of soup, I   m going to lose my job     (Laughs) I didn   t really know.  I was watching this stuff float off the mop, and so instinctively I just pulled it out very quickly and put it back on the floor. I was looking to see if anybody noticed what I had done. Nobody had noticed, so I kept the mop on the floor for a few seconds, trying to figure out what to do. What I did was I picked the mop up, and I put it back into the sink and rinsed it out, and finished cleaning up the mess on the floor, and then put the mop back in the sink, and went about my business. We served the soup. For the next week, I kept watching the college newspaper to see if there was any reports of illness at Willham, and there weren   t. Hopefully nobody got ill, but if they did, I   m sorry. (Laughs) If I had it to do over again, I would do it differently. One other event I did there, and I don   t know whether it was pressure from exams or what it was, but there was a period there where the dorms were new. The grass around them wasn   t in yet. I happened to be just above the sidewalk, a little off to the side, just the prime place for dropping water balloons. There was a period there when several students did that. One day, I saw somebody coming.  The thrill of it is that you drop it, and there   s this few seconds there when you know that this person   s going to be surprised, but he   s not surprised yet because he doesn   t know what   s coming. You   re not dropping it   you   re dropping it to the side. You   re not trying to hit him or anything like that. One of those days where I went,    Well, I   m just going to do it.    I opened the 18  window, and I had this water balloon. I saw somebody coming, so I let it sail. Course, you   re watching it, and then once it hits, then you pull your head back in so they can   t see where it came from. It hit. What I really hadn   t thought about was that we   d had a rain, and so it hit mud. When it hit mud, it just splattered it. A couple of minutes after that, there was somebody getting off the elevator, and he was mad. He was screaming at the top of his voice. I could hear something like,    They   ve ruined my suit     I realized that,    Oh, that was a light-colored suit.    Well, it was a white-colored suit. He was mad, and I had realized that I had done it. There wasn   t any way I was going to talk to him, not in the state of mind he was in. He would   ve thrown me out the window, I think. (Laughs) That was the last balloon I ever tossed. (Laughs) That did it for me  I never said anything to him, but I guess if it gets back to him now, I   ll buy him a suit. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn Wow   Yearwood Yeah, you do some things and   .  Nykolaiszyn They still do.  Yearwood They still do. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn They still do. On that note, any advice for students in college today? What would you tell them?  Yearwood I was pretty serious. I would say, like, you don   t really know how fortunate you are. It is hard. There   s a lot of pressure, but I think once you get past it, you look back and realize,    Hey, that was all right     It   s sort of like the kids we had, in a way. Some days were really long, and we were looking for things to do. Now they   re gone. Look back, and it   s like,    Wow, that was fast.    That   s kind of the way it is; it goes fast. It   s hard work, but I would just say work hard and enjoy it.  Nykolaiszyn Anything else you   d like to add?  Yearwood Like any more stories I shouldn   t? (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn This is your chance to come clean   Yearwood My uncle who went there, he was more of a people person. He came out of the service, so he was older, too. He was, like, vice president of the Interfraternity Council.     His mother raised him, and they didn   t have anything, really. While he was at OSU, he was a member of a fraternity, but he did not have much money. He was telling me that what he did was, like, he bought three pairs of pants and three jackets separately, and then he would mix them. That way it appeared that he had more suits than he 19  actually had. He was telling me about, he had a date with this girl that he had really been trying to date for some time, and she finally agreed to go out with him. They were going to go to a movie. The problem he had with his car was it had no reverse. When they got to the movie theater, there was some pull-in parking spaces that you backed out of. Well, of course, he had to pass them up. He was trying to keep her from knowing that his car didn   t have a reverse. He circled the block several times before he finally found a parallel parking place or something that he could park in, and they could come out and leave.  Nykolaiszyn A different time.  Yearwood Yes, a different time, but he was the reason I went to OSU.  Nykolaiszyn What did he go on to do?  Yearwood He had a number of different jobs.     He was, I think, a life insurance salesman at one time, and he was also a book cover salesman. Near the end of the life, closer to the end of his life, he was, like, operator of several liquor stores. He had a more interesting life than I do, more outgoing.  Nykolaiszyn What   s next on the agenda for you? What are looking forward to in the next couple of years?  Yearwood Yes, trying to get caught up on stuff. That   s the biggest thing   and I need time management skills. I plan on seeing what we can do with the museum here and working with the tribe. Hopefully, we can do some stuff here that will make people want to come here and visit. We do have people who come here and look, but we just need to make some things for them to look at. We have people who have artifacts that can be displayed, but we need to have a place to display them. That   s kind of the goal. My other goal is to, the parsonage over there, I want to get it listed on the national historical register. I   ve been planning on doing that for the last five or six years and haven   t found time yet. You have to do a lot of research. The research I need to do, I need to go back to Yale University because the people who lived in that parsonage   Mary, her husband died in 1913. They moved there in 1897, and Mary stayed there until 1931 or 1932. They donated their papers to Yale University, so I   m hopeful that the stuff can either be shipped out here or I can go back there and look at it. I need to do that in order to do the nomination or whatever it is to get it listed.  Nykolaiszyn Your plate is full.  Yearwood Then the museum at Cordell needs a lot of stuff, so I hope to do some stuff over there, too. We need to catalog the collection, redo the basement, a whole bunch of things. I need more time and energy. 20  Nykolaiszyn Retirement   s not so much retirement. (Laughs)  Yearwood Right, seems like working.  Nykolaiszyn Well, Lonnie, thank you so much for sharing some memories of your time at OSU and, of course, the history, a little bit of the history here in Colony, Oklahoma. We really appreciate it.  Yearwood Thank you. Enjoyed it.  -------  -------  Postscript  In the two years following this interview, Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Yvonne Kauger, a Colony native, has further demonstrated her civic investment in the town. In addition to her Gallery of the Plains Indian, she has had a second building restored: the Art Graham Cottage which showcases Indian art, Colony artifacts, and early 1900s furniture. Other contributions include supporting the painting of public murals and supporting public lectures, just to name a few.
