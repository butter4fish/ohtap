 Gill, and today is March 2, 2009. I   m visiting with Dr.  Melvin Tolson in his home in Norman, Oklahoma. This interview is part  of the O-State Stories Project for the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program of the OSU library. Dr. Tolson, I appreciate you taking time to  visit with us today.  Thank you.  To start off, could you share a little about your early life   about where  you grew up, a little bit about your family?  I was born in my mother   s home in Charlottesville, Virginia, in June of  1923 while my father had come down that summer to Wiley College in  Marshall, Texas, where he was going to be a teacher of English. My  mother brought me down that fall to Marshall, and I grew up there. As I  said, my father taught at Wiley College, and Wiley was right across the  street and down the street from elementary and high schools, so it was a  school atmosphere in which one found it very easy to go to school.  Another thing is that although Marshall was a small town of  approximately 10,000 or 12,000 people, there were three colleges     small colleges, of course   in that town. Wiley was what was at that time  a Methodist Episcopal   now it   s United Methodist supported. There  was another college, Bishop College, which was supported by the  Baptist Church. And there was a white college, East Texas College, a  state college, which is still there. Bishop College moved to Dallas in the  fifties and finally went out of existence, but Wiley and East Texas State  are still in Marshall, Texas. The high school, which I attended, was right  across the street from Wiley College. Since integration, the high school  has ceased to exist and its buildings are now a part of Wiley College. So  it was quite an atmosphere to grow up in, a small town with three  colleges.  6  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Sounds like a really educational environment for you.  Yes. And so I finished Wiley in 1942. I taught in a rural elementary  school for one year. In Wiley I had majored in philosophy and English. I  taught in this rural school one year, and after that I went to what was  then Gammon Theological Seminary, which was supported by the  Methodist Episcopal church. It is no longer in existence. It is now  incorporated into the Interdenominational Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia,  but I finished there. I was going to be either a professor of philosophy or  a chaplain in the armed forces.  What did you major in at Gammon College?  No, no. Gammon was a theological seminary, so there was a generalized  curriculum in philosophy and theology. You did not major in   it wasn   t  like a regular college where one majors in science or arts or things of  that sort. Everyone took the same general courses. So when I came out  of Gammon, I got a job as assistant chaplain and professor of English at  Prairie View A M College, which is close to Houston, Texas. At Prairie  View I was asked, because I had had a course in French, I was asked to  teach a course in French one semester and I consented. I enjoyed it so  much that I asked for other courses, and gradually my emphasis changed  from English to French. In 1949, I decided that it was time to get my  master   s degree, and 1949 was also the year that Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher  had succeeded in having the courts integrate the school systems in  Oklahoma.  What was her name again?  Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher. She was a student of my father   s at Langston  University. I failed to mention that my father left Wiley in 1947 and  came to Langston University. She was a student of his, and he mentored  her. She is historically important as the woman who brought the suit that  Attorney Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP succeeded in winning  before the supreme court to integrate the schools. So that year of 1949,  five of us went and enrolled in what was then Oklahoma A M. There  were two women and three men, and we commuted from Langston,  where we all lived. At the end of the first semester, one of the men and  the two women decided that they did not wish to continue, so for the  second semester, only Phail Wynn and myself continued, and we  finished the course and got our degrees in May.  May of 1950?  Yes.  7  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Fall of 1949 to Spring     To May of 1950, yes.  Did you major in French there?  My major there was French with an English minor. The department was  not very strong in French, and you had to have a minor, so I minored in  English.  Let me ask you, Dr. Tolson, what or who influenced you to enroll at  Oklahoma State University?  Well as I said, I came up in 1949. I wasn   t sure where I would be going  to graduate school. I knew it was time for me to get a master   s. After all,  I got my BA in 1942, I got my BD in 1946, and it was now three years  later and I   m teaching in a field in which I do not have a degree. I felt  that it was time to get a master   s, so my father and I talked about it, and  as I said, it was the year that the schools in Oklahoma had been opened  by the Supreme Court decision, brought about by the efforts of Ada Lois  Sipuel Fisher and her attorney for the NAACP, Thurgood Marshall. So  my father called the dean   s office at Oklahoma A M and asked. The  dean said yes, so that   s the reason I could stay at home and commute to  A M.  Do you remember anything about your enrollment process?  There was nothing except you just went and signed up. Or perhaps you  asked that question thinking that there must have been something  special. There was nothing special; we just went. The dean said just  come on over and sign up, and that   s what we did. We were in different  fields. I don   t remember the fields of the five others. But there was no  problem at all. We went to class. It was just as though the school had  been open all the time.  Well going in, Dr. Tolson, were you concerned about the reception  you   d get, say from white students?  No, I wasn   t concerned about it particularly. I thought about it, but there  was no reason to be concerned because all that occurred was that several  students became friendly, asked if they could help me, and ... I could  remember that we decided, because we didn   t know anything about the  campus, we decided to have lunch   we were invited by the principal of  the Negro public school to have lunch at their cafeteria, which we did. It  was a few blocks from A M campus. Then finally, as I said, the second  semester, three of the five dropped out. And one day, I decided I didn   t  8  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  feel like walking down to the black school to have lunch. I didn   t want  anything but a sandwich, so I went into the caf   restaurant. They had one  on the campus there at A M at that time.  Was the new Student Union building open at that time?  No, the new Student Union building had not yet been finished as I recall,  because this was a small caf   restaurant, separately like a trailer, like a  small caf   on campus. It was not yet the one that later was incorporated  into the union building.  Was that Pop McGruder   s place?  I just don   t recall. So I went in and ordered a hamburger and Coke, and  they gave me one. There was no problem. There was never any problem.  Never any problem. Never any words of aspersion, racial words, racist  expressions, nothing. The only time (laughs) it might have come up was  when one or two white students, as I passed, asked each other whether I  was a black man.  As it was January and cold, I was covered up except  for my face.  I can remember, there were three or four students, and one  said,    Is that a Negro?    and one of the others said,    No, he must be an  Indian. They don   t have the Negroes going here yet.    But there was  never anything really disagreeable that occurred.  And your classroom experience was not anything different from     Oh, classmates were just like classmates. Yes, several of them I studied  with. The teachers were fine. One of the deans   I forget which one     one of the deans of the university one day happened to be near me on  Campus Corner and asked me how I was getting along. I told him,     Fine.    He said,    Well if you have any problems, come to me.    I said,     Yes, I haven   t had any.    And I never had any.  Do you remember any of your professors on campus? Do you recall any  of them that had a special influence on you? Any of your teachers or  professors?  No. The head of the French studies area at that time, whose name  unfortunately I   ve forgotten, was very friendly to me and advised me to  study later in France if possible. He himself visited Europe almost yearly  and finally retired, finally went to live in Brussels, where he passed  away. I   m sorry, I can   t recall his name, but at this age I   m lucky if I can  recall my own.  Were you engaged in any activities outside of the classroom?  9  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  No, there were no activities. There was no French Club at that time. I  don   t know whether there was at OU, but at A M that was not the  emphasis, so there were no other activities, no. We went to school, went  to class, and came back to Langston.  During the day did you have any favorite hangouts on campus where  you   d go?  No, because we just went for classes. We   d sit in the library and study  and whatnot. I was trying to do as well as possible in my studies,  because it was the first time that I had had advanced studies in French  and I wanted to do well. And plus, I was also taking advanced studies in  English literature, and so there was nothing I did really that whole year  but study.  Well how did you do? Were your grades pretty good?  Oh yes, they were excellent. They were excellent, yes.  You talked about driving back and forth to Langston, the five of the  students     Yes.  Did you get a chance to have conversations? Were the others     experiences fairly similar to yours?  Yes. I don   t know. That is, the one person that I drove back and forth  most frequently with was Phail Wynn. Phail was in, I believe,  mechanical engineering, although I may be wrong. I just don   t recall.  The others had class schedules that   we seldom went over together. But  all of the second semester, Phail and I went over together, and when our  classes did not correspond, I would go over on the bus, which passed by  Langston. It   s about twenty miles. And so Phail and I would talk, and  Phail was having no problems either.  And was that the Greyhound bus line that you were riding on?  I guess.  Were there any problems with blacks riding on the bus or anything?  Oh no, no, no. I don   t remember at that time   now I remember, I  believe, that segregation existed in the bus station, because when I  would go to the bus station in ... We didn   t have a bus station of course  in Langston. When I would get off at the one in Stillwater, I would go to  10  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  the  colored  section. I think at that time you still had a  colored  and   white  section.  Anything specifically that you recall that was special in your memory of  your student experience at Oklahoma State?  No, nothing in particular. Going to school at Oklahoma State was pretty  much like going to school anywhere else, except that I was there  infrequently   just for the classes   and there was nothing ... But I didn   t  expect anything except class activity, you see. Since I wasn   t there, I  don   t know what the social life might have been.  You and Phail Wynn, as you indicated, you were the first African  American graduates of Oklahoma State University. Did you think of this  as historically significant at the time?  No. We just went. I remember in the fall of    49, when Langston had its  homecoming, Ada Lois Sipuel   I don   t think she was Fisher then, but  Ada Lois Sipuel   who as I said, had been a student of my father   s, my  father had mentored her at Langston. Ada Lois came by our apartment,  my mother and father   s apartment, during homecoming, and that   s when  I met her. I knew about her, because from the newspaper accounts of the  attempt to integrate the school system, I knew about her. So we met, and  she asked me what I was doing there at Langston, and I told her that I  was attending Oklahoma A M with four other blacks. She said,     Really?    She said,    I haven   t seen anything about it in the papers.    I  said,    Well so far as I know it hasn   t appeared in the papers.    There was  no big to-do about it; we just did it.  Well looking back on it now, do you feel a special sense of pride?  No. I   m glad I did it. I think perhaps if I were much younger I might, but  to me, it was not significant in the way that Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher   s  work was significant. I didn   t go to court, you see. I didn   t hire a lawyer.  All I did was go over there, go to the registrar   s office, register for  classes, go and be advised and I started going to class. So I realize it was  a first time, but it didn   t seem ... As I said, there was no publicity about  it. After awhile it was just all in a day   s work, so to speak.  What do you remember about your commencement exercises?  Nothing except that I got my degree. I was told later, and I don   t know  whether the story is apocryphal, whether it is untrue or not, the  commencement address was given by the governor of the state at that  time, and I don   t remember, again, what his name was.  Governor Roy  Turner  But 1950, I just don   t recall. Anyway, I was told later in the  11  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  summer by somebody that when I walked across the stage and got my  diploma, the governor reached over to the president and said,    Pretty  dark for an Indian, isn   t he?    (Laughs) There was no way that they could  have known that Phail Wynn, in cap and gown, was a Negro, because he  looked like an Indian. Now it wasn   t that he particularly looked like an  Indian, but his color was not such as would have made him stand out  from the other Indians in the graduating class, you see. But mine was. I  don   t know whether that story is true or not, but it   s interesting.  Can you share some highlights of your educational career and  experiences after you left Oklahoma State?  Well I went back to Prairie View to teach after I left there. Then in 1955,  that is five years later, I succeeded in getting a Fulbright Fellowship to  study at the University of Paris. As I said, my professor at Oklahoma  A M had suggested several times,    You should study in France,    and  then I felt also that any person teaching a foreign language should have  visited the country of the language that he is speaking. So I took a year,  1955-56, and studied at the University of Paris, popularly called the  Sorbonne, and took an advanced diploma in contemporary literature.  I knew that I was going to go on, and one of the things that I have not  mentioned is that one of the great benefits of having Melvin B. Tolson  Sr. as a father was that, although he did not have a doctorate, he  encouraged his children. He had three sons and a daughter, and he  encouraged his children to go on and get their PhD. And the reason he  did so, he said, was not because we would necessarily be any smarter     after all we knew PhD   s who were not   and although he just had a  master   s degree, he was writing and being published and whatnot, and  we knew that if you wanted to contribute like that you didn   t have to  have a PhD. But he encouraged us to do that because he said we would  have job security.  Did all four of the kids     Yes. Well there were three boys, as I said, and a girl. I took the PhD in  French with a minor in Spanish. I studied at the University of Mexico  one summer to get my Spanish up to par so that I could take graduate  courses. My brother Arthur, who survives, took his doctorate at OU in  history, and he still teaches history in Southern University in Baton  Rouge. My younger brother, who passed away, took his degree in  biochemistry at Georgetown University in D.C. and worked for the  National Institute of Health until his death. My sister took a master   s  degree at OU in library science and then later took another master   s  degree in history. I remember asking her why she didn   t go on and get  the PhD in library science. She said that was a field in which once you  12  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  got the master   s, there really wasn   t that much more to learn, so that  many of the people who had a PhD in it had a master   s in other fields,  and many of the people who had a master   s in it went on and got  master   s in or PhD   s in other fields. So she had completed, at the time of  her death   she was the first of the four children to die   she had  completed a master   s of history at Howard University where she was  one of the directors of the library of the Dental and Medical School.  So my father encouraged all four of his children. In fact my mother was  extraordinary, because she came from a generation in which very few  women, black or white, had gone to and had finished high school. My  mother had not. She had done one year in high school. As we children  were growing up in Marshall, Texas, my mother had an example with  the wives of other college professors who had gotten their college  degrees there at Wiley while their husbands were teaching. Well my  mother, as I said, had not finished high school. My mother went back as  a sophomore in high school in Marshall, Texas, did the three years, then  came up and did the four years at Wiley College. She and I marched  down the aisle for the bachelor   s degree together to a standing ovation.  And later when my father came to Langston, she commuted to A M  and took a master   s at Oklahoma State.  So what year did she finish her master   s?  I forgot now. Nineteen sixty, about the middle    60s, somewhere there.  That   s a great story. So education was very much valued in your family.  Oh yes. My father (laughs), my father   s existence was the intellect. Our  table discussions, our discussions, were about ideas, political and social  currents in the world. He was always regarded as a left-leaning thinker,  and he was an excellent orator and speaker. In fact he won prizes when  he was in school. The earliest picture that I have of my father is from his  high school yearbook   luckily they had one   in which he was the class  poet and wrote a long poem. We have a copy of it. Later, he finished at  Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. There   s also a Lincoln University in  Missouri, but the Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, he went to school  there, and he was on the debate team and was in public speaking there  and wrote poetry. He had written poetry since before he was a teenager;  it was just a natural talent that he had. So when he came to Wiley he  started the debate team, which was featured in the movie, The Great  Debaters. He kept writing, and particularly when debate died with the  Second World War, he concentrated more on his writing, and he was  named Poet Laureate of the Republic of Liberia and wrote a poem called  Libretto for the Republic of Liberia in honor of that occasion and went  there for the second inauguration of President  William  Tubman. I  13  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  believe that was in 1955-6, the year that I was studying, because he  came through Paris. I was able to show him around and also to take him  over to see an old writer friend of his, Richard Wright, the author of  Native Son, who had transferred his life, like so many Americans at that  time, to Paris.  Dr. Tolson, again on your father, was he one of the coaches on that  debate team?  He was the coach.  He was the coach of the debate team, the one that they made the movie  about?  Yes.  Can you share a little bit about that?  Well as I said, he started the debate team when he went to Wiley. They  debated all over the South and parts of the North and the Midwest. They  were the first team to debate white universities. They debated Oklahoma  City University, and in 1935, they won the national championship from  the University of California at I forget which one. Not San Diego.  Anyway, in the movie they made it Harvard University. That would sell  more tickets of course than     But nonetheless, this was the national championship.  This was the national championship, yes, in 1935. And they came back  to Wiley, but this is the thing. Debate was popular at that time, because  remember you had no television, so debates attracted full houses. In fact  there were some debates that they even charged admission.  What actor portrayed your father in the movie?  Denzel Washington.  So Denzel Washington was your father. Was that pretty neat for you?  Yes. And the idea came from an interview that I had several years ago in  American Legacy magazine. I don   t know who got the idea for the  movie, but it was produced and made by Harpo, by Oprah Winfrey   s   production company .  Did anyone contact you about your father on behalf of the movie?  14  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Oh yes, before the movie, before the script. They had me come down  about 2000, at least once in 2006 or 2007, to Marshall, Texas. They had  me come down. They also had the only woman debater that was on  Dad   s team, who was portrayed by a young woman in the movie. They  had her come up from Houston. Henrietta Bell Wells. She had debated  only one year with the team because she was a working student and  would have to hire somebody in her place. Plus at that time when the  team went on tours, which it frequently did, if you were a young lady,  you had to have a chaperone. So she was only on the team one year, but  in the movie they put her on the championship team there. But she was a  very good speaker, and Henrietta just died last year at the age of ninety-five.  But the other debaters ... There were other debaters. The one who  became best known was J.  James  Leonard Farmer Junior, the founder  of CORE Organization  Congress of Racial Equality . But there were  others who became active in the Civil Rights Movement.  Did the movie accurately portray the events of the debate?  Well, yes and no. As I said, it was the wrong team. There were three  men, and not two men and a woman, but if you are going to have a  romantic triangle, you have to have woman on the team. Plus they made  it Harvard University and not the University of California, so they  played around with the facts, but they kept close.  Did Denzel Washington fairly accurately portray your father?  Well that would be   I would say he did a good portrayal, an excellent  portrayal of my father, but of course he   s nothing like my father. Denzel  is my height. My father was 5   5   , although he had the energy of a man  6   5   .  Pretty fiery, was he?  Oh yes  Yes, fiery. Well, he was a poet from his youth, and he was the  son and nephew of two preachers, two active preachers.  Were they Methodist preachers?  Yes. Well, they were both Methodist preachers although not the same  Methodist. My grandfather was a Methodist Episcopal, my granduncle  was one of the other Methodist churches. I forgot, but I didn   t know him  well.  So you came back and got your doctorate at the University of  Oklahoma?  15  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  University of Oklahoma.  And then did you go to work for the university after you graduated from  OU?  Well I came up to the University of Oklahoma in summer of 1958, just  for the summer. I did that because I wanted to see whether I liked it and  whether it liked me, because I didn   t want to do the way some graduate  students have done. You take the whole year off, get there, and find out  you don   t like the place. So it turned out that I did like the place. And it  turned out that I studied with the head of the department   it was in  Spanish   who offered me a graduate assistantship. So I went back to  Prairie View, taught a full year, and then took leave to come to OU in  1959 to study for the doctorate in French. As I said, the doctorate at that  time ... My master   s had been in French and English. The doctorate  could not be in French and English. The doctorate had to be in French  and Spanish. I had only studied some Spanish independently and had  been to Mexico several times from Texas ... I decided that since I could  not get credit for taking undergraduate courses, I had better go down to  Mexico and stuff myself with Spanish.  So I went down to the University of Mexico and studied for the summer  of 1960 and really concentrated on learning as much Spanish as  possible   so much so that several times I denied being able to speak  English in order to concentrate. So I came back then and did my work in  French and Spanish. In 1961, the head of the department asked me to  stay  on the faculty . And, as I said, at that time my father was teaching  at Langston University and I talked it over, naturally, with my father and  mother. They said,    Well if you don   t like it, you can always leave.    So  I resigned from Prairie View and accepted the position at OU as the first  black professor. Although there was a previous black, Mrs. Henderson,  who was here one   I have forgotten now   one semester? I don   t recall.  Did you get tenured as a professor at OU?  Oh yes.  So you were the first African American tenured professor at the  University of Oklahoma?  I don   t know, because I was the first, then there was another professor  who later left, and then there was a third professor, Dr. Henderson, so I  don   t know which of us got tenured first. You didn   t think about it, you  know?  But you were one of the top three, early on?  16  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Yes, oh yes. Well I wouldn   t be here if I hadn   t got tenure.  Absolutely. Well can you share some highlights of your time at the  University of Oklahoma? Some recognitions or awards that were special  to you during your career?  Oh, I don   t know, I   ve got several awards for teaching. A Regents award  for teaching, I don   t know what     Well Dr. Tolson, peeking at the wall here behind you, it looks like you   ve  gotten several recognitions from the University of Oklahoma in  appreciation from the Black Student Association for three decades of  service, and then I see your Commemorative Lifetime Excellence Award  presented here right behind you.  I don   t know     You don   t keep score, huh? (Laughs)  No, no you don   t. You   re glad to get them, once you get them, then they  go up on the wall and that   s the end of that.  So when did you retire? In what year?  I retired in 1992. I became an exchange professor for a program at a  university in France for one year, and I decided that that was a good cap  on my career, and so when I came back, I retired fully in    92. Then my  interests were turning to broader subjects than just French language and  literature. I wanted to do something else.  What were some of those interests? Do you mind sharing some of them?  Well the principal interests have been the history of the black diaspora,  not only on the Atlantic side, but also the history of the black diaspora  on the eastern coast of Africa with Islamic countries. We often are not  aware, of course, that black slavery existed in Islamic countries six or  seven centuries before America was discovered. So it has been a sort of  worldwide history of the black diaspora and of countries such as Brazil,  in which there is a large black population, and how blacks are treated in  various countries of the world that interests me now.  Well have you been to the OSU campus recently? Did you maintain any  of your contacts, relationships with Oklahoma State University through  the years?  No. The student association invited me up about two years ago to honor  17  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  me as the first graduate, but other than that I   ve had no contact, no.  I think it was the OSU Black Alumni Association and the student  association together, I think recognized you together as a trailblazer. It  was awarded a couple years ago.  Yes.  Did you feel pretty special about that? Did you have a good time?  Yes, I had a good time.  Did you maintain relationships with Phail Wynn or any of the other  black students through the years?  No, after Phail and I finished, we went our separate ways and I did not  know what happened to him. In fact, I was surprised on hearing that he  had passed. And I don   t know why, I don   t know what the cause of his  death was. I saw his son. His son came here as a student part-time, and I  met him. But Phail and I did not maintain contact, and so I understand  now, if I recall, that his widow has moved to the East Coast to be with  Phail Junior. That was the information I received. Whether it was  accurate or not, I cannot say.  Did Phail live in Oklahoma most of his life?  Yes.  What did he do? Do you know what job he had?  As I said, Phail was in mechanical engineering, so I took it for granted  that he was in a high school mechanical arts teaching career. But I don   t  know because, as I said, after we finished, we finished.  We haven   t talked about your personal family. Did you ever have a  family?  No, no.  You never did?  No, I   ve been single all my life.  Single and happy, huh?  Single and happy, yes.  18  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  So you have one brother still living?  Yes, one brother is still living, and although he   s just a little more than a  year younger than I, he   s still teaching full-time.  Wow.  Yes.  Where is he teaching?  He teaches at Southern University in Baton Rouge, which is one of the  historical black universities. He started teaching there when he received  his doctorate from OU, which was about 1964-65, somewhere right in  there. So he has been teaching at Southern now for over forty years; in  fact they gave him a forty-year certificate about two years ago.  Your father then finished his teaching career at Langston?  No, my father taught at Langston until 1965 and retired and went to  teach at Tuskegee University, but he taught there only one year,    65-   66,  and he died in 1966 of cancer.  Dr. Tolson, you   ve seen a lot of years of higher education, starting back  in the    40s to now through 2009. Are you pleased with how African  Americans have been able to integrate into the system and move  through? Do you feel it   s going in the right direction now?  Oh yes. Of course, I wish it had been done more rapidly, but it   s in the  right direction, of course. One of the things that has been gratifying has  been to see the growing presence of blacks in all aspects of education,  but also in the financial and commercial life of the United States. You  can barely pick up a newspaper now and look at the business section  without seeing a black CEO or CFA or C-something.  Would your dad have been proud to know about Barack Obama   s  election? Would that have excited him?  Oh God, of course. Not only my father. Can you imagine    No, you  can   t imagine what black Americans who were freed in slavery would  have said, you can   t imagine, about such an event.  Dr. Tolson, I   ve visited a little bit with Dr. Earl Mitchell at Oklahoma  State University, who we talked about earlier was the first black tenured  professor at Oklahoma State University. I   ll be visiting with Dr. Patricia  Bell, who you may know is the Head of the Sociology Department at  19  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Oklahoma State University and is an African American woman. I   ve  picked up in some of the conversations that there were some challenges  in terms of tenure and recognition professionally. Did you have any of  that here at the University of Oklahoma during your time?  No. I don   t know   you see, I did not apply. I don   t know whether these  two did. You see, I was asked to join the faculty, and so I never had any  ... It was just like working at a black university so far as I was  concerned. There were no problems, there were no questions. As I said,  it was the head of the department at that time who asked me, after he had  talked it over with other principal members of the department, you see,  so that it was a done deal.  So in terms of your promotion and tenure, it was all no problem at all  for you.  No problem at all.  You   ve lived a life of significance, Dr. Tolson, impacting thousands of  lives in your teaching     No, no     I know you   re humble, but looking back, how do you hope people will  remember Dr. Melvin Tolson?  You know, the person whom I would be most concerned about their  remembering is the person about whom I can have less concern about  their remembering, and that is my father. To me, I haven   t done anything  particularly significant compared to what he did, you see. And I must  say too at the age of eighty-five and a half, I don   t particularly care how  I   m remembered.  Looking back at your life, what do you feel like were your significant  contributions or accomplishments?  None, except that I supposedly influenced some students who have  written to me through the years, that have told me, which surprised me,  but other than that it has been a normal life. You see, as I said, my father  was a college professor from 1923 to 1966, and he was an amazing  person: a writer, author, poet, speaker, campaigner for civil rights. He  used to go around and raise money for Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher when they  were having the fight there. He was known; he was a fiery speaker in  high schools and churches and graduations. In fact, there was a  Methodist minister   s group on the East Coast that used to have him  come out and give a week of talks and lectures at their ministerial  20  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  Tolson  Gill  conferences there. He was a fabulous speaker. Unfortunately, we have a  few, two or three tapes of him, but none at his fiery stage. And also  because of his experiences with the debate teams in the    20s and    30s,  there were racial experiences that he had that we really wish we could  put on paper, but my father would not record them.  Speaking of, were you involved in any of the Civil Rights Movement?  No. I walked one or two times, but no, I did not have leadership  qualities. I could be a member of the group, but to lead the group, no.  Dr. Tolson, you   re a pretty humble individual but I   ll summarize a  couple of things     Well no, I don   t call it being humble, I call it being honest.  But you   re pretty special. I want you to know, to Oklahoma State  University as our first African American graduate     But you see, this is the thing though   anybody who, like Phail and  myself, who had stayed the course, would have been special. You see, it  wasn   t that this was Abraham Lincoln who came to this post. It was just  that I was looking for a place to go to school. My father called over and  asked the dean if space was available for a black. Well, yes. And why  was it available? Because Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher had already opened up  the system. There was nothing special.  But you walked through the door     But the door was already open   (Laughs) That   s good.  You see, it   d be different if I had been the one, like Ada Lois, who  pushed at the door. She is the one. You see?  I do.  Yes.  Dr. Tolson, is there anything that you   d like to comment on that we  haven   t covered? In your career or     No, I   d better get my medication now.  Well I appreciate very much your taking the time to visit with us.  21  Tolson  Gill  Thank you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
