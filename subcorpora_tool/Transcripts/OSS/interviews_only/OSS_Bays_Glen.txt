 Finchum Today is June 23, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma  State University, and today I   m in Stillwater  Payne County, Oklahoma  to  speak with Glen Bays. This is part of our Cowboy in Every County project,  so thank you for having me today.  Bays Glad to.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Bays I was born here in Stillwater, in a house that   s still standing on a street not  very far from us. That was August 12, 1931.  Finchum Coming up on a birthday.  Bays (Laughs) Yeah.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Bays They farmed in Noble County, but near the Payne County line. We were  often in Stillwater, but business was done in Perry  Oklahoma . We didn   t  own the property. We had eighty acres that my dad rented, but then he also  had to farm other plots that helped keep us going.  Finchum What did he grow?  Bays We had milk cows, and he began a milk route that he could pick up milk  from other farmers and bring in to Stillwater. We milked a lot of cows.  (Laughs)  Finchum Some of your chores plus others, huh?  Bays Yes.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Bays I have a brother three years younger than I am. He lives here in Stillwater,  Marvin, and he lives on the west side of town. He and I were always  involved with looking after the milk herd and so forth. Since I was a little bit  older than him, I was supposed to be in charge, but we managed to get  through it. (Laughs)  Finchum Supposed to be in charge. He didn   t always listen?  Bays No, he didn   t always listen. In many instances, I would have to be right out  in the open and say that he was smarter than I was about something, about  how to handle an electric fence and that kind of thing. (Laughs)  Finchum Where did you go to elementary school?  Bays Well, there was a schoolhouse at the intersection of a road that goes down to  Lake McMurtry now, and I think it   s called McMurtry Road. Then, when it  got down just before entering the McMurtry area, the grounds, there was a  road that turned to the right and went off toward Perry. Well, on that corner  was a rural schoolhouse. My mother was a schoolteacher. Except for about  two or three years, early in my schooling, I went a year or so to one teacher  and a year or so to another, and then those people left. My mother, who was  a trained schoolteacher here from OSU, she took over the school. She was  my teacher and all the rest of us until I got out of the eighth grade. (Laughs)  Finchum Kind of interesting to have your mother as your teacher?  Bays Yes, it was, and she treated everybody the same. (Laughs) You had to do  what she wanted.  Finchum It was grades one through eight in one building?  Bays Yes, one building.  Finchum How many were in your class?  Bays Probably about only four or five, probably maybe about fifteen kids in all.  That was how we went through school.  Finchum How would you get there?  Bays Walk. There were no buses. We, most of the time, walked across pastures  instead of staying on roads. Sometimes you would stay on roads when there  was a lot of high grass or something that snakes might be in. We   d stay to  the roads, or if it was really cold wintertime and we had to walk back and  forth, we stayed on the roads. Sometimes kids would get too cold and drop  out and somebody would have to come get them. I remember that happened  to me once. We didn   t have any school buses then.  Finchum About how far was it from your house to the school, roughly?  Bays Something about like two miles?  Finchum One way?  Bays Yes.  Finchum That would get cold. You said your mother graduated from OAMC   Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College . Do you know what year?  Bays Unfortunately, I can   t say what year.  Finchum Okay. What decade? (Laughs)  Bays I   m sorry. I don   t know quite what to say.  Finchum Was she married at the time, or was it before she married?  Bays No, she married after she got out and started teaching school, which was in  Noble County and at that school that I attended. She was my teacher for  several years, and the way she met my father was when we would have  school pie events. Everybody would come, bring their pies, and they   d get  different partners. That   s how my mother and my dad met, and we became a  family.  Finchum What was her maiden name?  Bays Stagner, S-T-A-G-N-E-R.  Finchum Okay, first name?  Bays Myrtle, M-Y-R-T-L-E.  Finchum What was your dad   s first name?  Bays Willfred, W-I-L-L-F-R-E-D, and I don   t think he ever went to school. That  didn   t mean that he was stupid, but I don   t think, to my knowledge, I never  knew about him going to school. He was a member of a fairly large family,  Bays family. There were numerous of his brothers and sisters. I think he was  one who did not choose to go to school.  Finchum It   s not for everybody. (Laughter)  Bays He wasn   t dumb.  Finchum Do you remember the name of that school, the rural school?  Bays Oakhill District 74.  Finchum Once you finished the eighth grade, then, where did you go?  Bays I finished the eighth grade, and my mother insisted that it was time for us to  move into Stillwater, because she had had too much bad luck with my older  sister, who was three years older than I. She had been living with my  mother   s sister, Iva Rusko, here in Stillwater. My sister was boarding with  her aunt, Iva, but they didn   t get along. My sister didn   t obey her aunt very  well, and she dated people that my mom didn   t want her to date. Then, Mom  prevailed on my dad to move to Stillwater. That was how we got into  Stillwater.  Finchum High school would   ve been Stillwater High?  Bays Pardon?  Finchum High school would   ve been Stillwater High School?  Bays Yes, yes. I found that sort of rough going at the moment of beginning entry  because the treatment   at that time, the high school was where the old  building is now that   s used as a meeting place. That   s where I started to  school, but being from the country and not part of the town, the bullies kept  us from entering certain doors. You could only enter one door if you were  from the country. You got roughed up if you didn   t do that, so that was my  start at high school in Stillwater. It happened later on that through my dad   s  work with hauling milk from the country to the creameries in town, he  needed my help and bought me a small pickup truck that I, before school,  went out and picked up Grade A milk on farms and brought in to the  Stillwater Creamery. Then, I went to school. Having my pickup shot me up  in fame, because kids didn   t have cars then. (Laughs) Anybody wanted a  ride, they asked me for a ride. I   d take them for a ride. Then, pretty soon, I  was pretty popular. (Laughter) That   s how it worked out.  Finchum Little things, huh? How early would you have to get up to do the milk work  before school?  Bays You had to be on your route a little bit after sunup and get it done. It wasn   t  a long route. It was the preferred Grade A milk, so I only had about three  farms to stop at and pick up the milk and get it in before, you had to be  quick, before it could clabber or something. Then, I was ready to go to  school.  Finchum Before refrigeration, I guess, if you think about it that way.  Bays Yes, that   s right.  Finchum Where was the creamery?  Bays You know where the old post office is now?  Husband Street  The creamery  was in the block just south of where the old library is now. I don   t remember  exactly what   s in that area now, but it was between there and the Stillwater  News Press.  Finchum I think it   s a vacant lot right now.  Bays Yeah, it kind of is, isn   t it?  Finchum Okay, that   s good to know. When did you graduate from high school? What  year?  Bays  In  1945.  Finchum What was your favorite subject?  Bays English and writing. I wasn   t any good at sums. I kind of liked to steer clear  of those, but I liked to write. Even at one time, I placed third in a statewide  essay contest in my English class. That was kind of a high point for me.  Finchum What were your plans upon graduation?  Bays I planned to go on to college, but right at that time, the Korean War broke  out. I had become a member of the local Combat Engineers    Battalion of the  National Guard, the 45th Division. Immediately, on the day the war broke  out, which I think was just about now fifty years ago, we were mobilized  and sent, I mean, all the guys in two different groups, combat engineers that  I was in and infantry that other guys were in, we were all called into active  service and sent for training, and then sent overseas. That was a big change.  (Laughs)  Finchum Barely eighteen, I guess.  Bays Yeah, my outfit was sent to, first to northern Japan to do more training  before entering Korea and also to try to keep the Russians from overrunning  northern Japan. We were there for about six or seven months before they  transferred us to Korea, and Korea was a real trial. The worst of the fighting  had sort of gone soft. They hadn   t quit, but especially in the wintertime,  nobody liked to get out there and fight because it was very, very cold.  My work, being in an engineer battalion, was to operate what we   d call a  road grader and to maintain roads so that Army vehicles could go over them.  We had two people who did that, myself and another soldier from  Minnesota. He and I were in the same two-man tent. I slept while he  worked, and he slept while I worked. That was my job through the  wintertime, and the wintertime in Korea can be extremely cold.  There were numerous times that I was pretty nervous because often, they  would shine a bright searchlight on me to show where I ought to go with my  grader to shape up the airstrips that the air pilots used when they were doing  reconnaissance. I did that at night. You had this great big light shining on  you, and you know you   re always within that glow. Every so often,  somebody   d throw a rock at you or something. They didn   t really try to do  away with me, because that would mean that they   d get a lot of fire down on  them.  Finchum Still at the back of your mind the whole time.  Bays Yeah, you always think,    I wonder how this is going to work out.    (Laughs)  Finchum How long were you there?  Bays Let   s see, nearly two years, and then came back home. I don   t know exactly  the time now, but it was   I   m sorry I can   t say the year.  Finchum If you went in in    45, it was probably    47,    48-ish, somewhere in there.  Bays Yeah, that   d be that.  Finchum How did you get back? Did they fly you back or put you on a slow boat or  what?  Bays Yeah, it was a slow boat. We came back on a ship, and the same way we  went over. Then I was let go. Didn   t have to stay anymore unless I wanted  to, and I was ready to   I stayed a few months with the National Guard here,  but after that, I was interested in going to college.  Finchum Where did you choose to go to college?  Bays Right here. (Laughs)  Finchum Right here. Was that because your mother had gone there, or because it was  convenient?  Bays It was because, I guess, I expected to go there. Also, back home, I had  begun, I had met Betty. We were seeing each other, and she was just here  starting to school. We kind of started school together and been together for  all this time. (Laughs)  Finchum How did you meet her?  Bays I had a motorcycle when I came back. The first thing I wanted to do when I  came back was to buy a motorcycle, and I did. A picture of me on the  motorcycle is back there in another room. I offered rides to Betty on the  motorcycle, which when her mother found out, who lived in Duncan,  Oklahoma   oh, I know how it happened. She had an uncle who was an  Oklahoma highway patrolman. He sometimes worked Stillwater, and he sent  word back to Betty   s folks in Duncan.    You better get that girl off that  motorcycle right away before she gets hurt.    That ended that, (laughs) but I  kept the motorcycle for a while. (Laughter)  Finchum When did you get married?  Bays In 1952.  Finchum You were still in college at that time?  Bays Oh yeah.  Finchum Where did you all live as a married couple?  Bays We had apartments various places, you know, where we could afford to live.  Of course, then, I could work for my dad by driving a truck for him and  make some money. I also worked part-time at the OSU Library to make a  little more. Betty worked in the Library too. That   s how we got through. I  had the GI Bill, of course, and allowed us to even buy a car and drive it. It  was a pretty good life.  Finchum The library was just being built at that time. The current one was built in the     50s.  Bays I don   t know. It was built in the    50s, I guess, because what I   m  remembering is that I was one of the early workers in the library, and so was  Betty.  Finchum Okay.  Bays I don   t remember exactly what year, but   .  Finchum I want to think it was    52-ish, right in there somewhere, somewhere in there.  Bays Yeah, okay. That   d be about right.  Finchum What was your job in the library?  Bays Mostly to mind the doors and see that people didn   t walk out with books,  unless they had checked them out.  Finchum What was Betty   s?  Bays Oh, she mostly worked in other areas, I think, putting books back on shelves  and things like that.  Finchum Was there a dress code?  Bays No, I don   t remember one. Is there now?  Finchum No, I just wondered. You see pictures and it   s mostly dresses for women, no  pants, in the early days.  Bays I don   t think we had those, no. (Laughs)  Finchum What did you major in?  Bays Journalism.  Finchum Did you have a favorite professor?  Bays Oh yeah, that was my profession, journalism, after I came back and studied  there. They had a very small journalism, you couldn   t call it a school. It was  kind of like a little add-on over here, but we had an excellent professor that I  followed a lot. Don   t ask me his name right now. I can   t think of it.  Finchum It   ll come to you. (Laughs)  Bays Anyway, I decided,    Okay, I   m going to do this.    Then I was hired by  the   I don   t know what it   s called today, but it   s the Oklahoma A M  magazine.  Finchum The O   Colly? The O   Colly newspaper, student newspaper?  Bays No, it wasn   t newspaper. It was put out by the university, but it was for a  much wider audience, those people who had already left school and so on. I  was an assistant editor of that. There was a main editor and I was the  assistant editor for a few years, while I was going to school.  Finchum I think there   s a State magazine now that goes out.  Bays That   s probably about the same thing. Journalism turned out to be my  calling, and I stayed in it. After graduation, we went to the Muskogee  Phoenix newspaper in Muskogee  Oklahoma  where I was the chief person  to decide what went into the morning newspaper. I worked at night with  other people. We had reporters, but I was the man at the desk who decided  how the paper looked and what all went in it and so on.  I  worked at that  job for about two years, but then I decided I wanted to get more education. I  gave it up and moved to Evanston, Illinois, where I entered the School of  Journalism at Northwestern University and got a master   s degree in  journalism and was under one of the reigning names in journalism, at that  time, who was in the school.  Finchum Who was that?  Bays Yeah, I knew you were going to ask me. (Laughter) I   ll have to get that one  later, but he was really a fine guy. I was pretty much a country cousin when  I went up there. He used to take us out into the city to interview people. I  found out,    Hey, this is altogether different (laughs) than it was back in  Oklahoma,    but came out of it all right. That was how I got my degree in  journalism, and then just kind of, sort of went on from there.  Finchum Where did you go to work after you got your master   s? Just take me through  your career.  Bays For the National Livestock Producer magazine in Chicago, which was a  monthly magazine that went out to, as it said, livestock producers who liked  to have that magazine. I was its reporter for something like two years, I  guess, before I decided that I didn   t want to settle down in the Chicago  suburb and ride the train into town every day to go to a high-rise in the  center of Chicago. That wasn   t really for me, so I decided to do something  else. The something else was quite different. Right now I   ll have to get a  grasp on it and tell you a little later, I guess, what we did.  We decided over a period of a few months that what I really wanted to do  was to go back overseas, but under the overhang of the church. I wanted to  be a religious writer and follow that for my profession from then on. Sure  enough,  I  was picked up by the Presbyterian Church, USA, and put into  their area of doing that sort of thing. To this day I   m still a member of the  Presbyterian Church, USA, and also I am not a real, what you would call, I  don   t think, somebody that they refer to a great deal, but my name is known.  I feel fine about that.  Finchum Where did they send you overseas?  Bays Yeah, the first place was   we went to   boy, my brain   s getting slower.  Finchum Well, if you can   t think of it, where was the place you spent the most time  overseas, if that   s easier?  Bays I   m sorry, but I   m really helpless right at this stage. I   m going to have to  review it. I   m sorry.  Finchum That   s okay. Brad had mentioned New Guinea     Bays Well, we didn   t go to New Guinea straight.  Finchum    and South Africa.  Bays We first went to central Africa. I guess that   s the way we went. Yeah, we  went to the Mindolo Ecumenical Center in Zambia or what was then still  Northern Rhodesia and had not become Zambia yet. I was invited to come to  the Africa Writing Center and teach writing at that, which was kind of like a  small college there that had a number of different programs that it ran. Betty  worked as a person who knew something about home economics, in that  area, with women. We were on the verge of lots of people migrating from  the country into the city. They didn   t know really how to live and so on, so  she had a lot of home economics skills. They had a women   s training center,  and then, they had this Africa Writing Center that took in people who  wanted to be writers from wherever they got ahold of us. We even brought  one guy in from one of the European countries. He wasn   t an African, but he  came to study there anyway.  We had Africans from all various places. They would come for training and  from anywhere from six weeks to six months at a time, to find their way to  do journalism the way it ought to be done. They would be from different  backgrounds, so there was a lot of kind of molding and melting together  there. We ordinarily run the six-month programs and then graduate them.  Then, I would go out and do the shorter courses in various parts of Africa.   I  got around a lot of Africa that way. I would go to a small college for  instance and do something there a while, and then, go to another one, and so  forth and so on. The people didn   t have to come into a different place, so  that went on for four years.  By then, Betty and I didn   t have any natural children, but prior to going  overseas, we adopted a son from an orphanage. He was just a baby.  He   turned out to be a highly intelligent fellow.  We  named him John Stillman  Bays because Stillman was Betty   s maiden name. He turned out to be the  greatest disappointment of our lives in that he did not follow the road we  wanted him to follow.  He  took another road, and finally drank himself to  death at the age of fifty and left a widow and a daughter. Unfortunately, the  mother has not allowed us to see the daughter, and she   s now eighteen years  old. I find that pretty hard to stomach, but there   s not much we can do about  it.  Anyway, while we were in that school, we also adopted a nine-year-old girl  out of an orphanage in Kitwe  Zambia  where we were living then. She was  there because her family had broken down. Alcoholism was the cause. I  think she was eight years old. She turned out to be very keen, that is, alert  and knowledgeable, interested in things, but she was supposed to live in an  orphanage. She had two brothers and at least one sister, but they didn   t  know each other then. Today, she lives in Decatur, Alabama. She teaches  school there. She   s sixty-some years old. She has two children, a son and a  daughter. The son is married, doesn   t have any children. The daughter is a  little older. She   s thirty, but she has never married and continues to live at  home. That   s how that worked out. Of course, our son, he just simply fell  over and died one day when he was living in, I don   t know, somewhere in  one of the middle states. He   s buried out here, his remains, cremated, in the  little cemetery out by Lake Blackwell.  Finchum Did either one of them go to OSU?  Bays No, he went to the, one of the universities in   what was the state? He liked  to live in one of the states in the middle of the country. He liked to be there.  He had friends there. In other words, he had drinking buddies. Okay,    We   ll  support you in school there,    but then I could never get his attention. He  died at the age of fifty, leaving a small daughter, and we   ve never been able  to visit.  Finchum Maybe, since she   s eighteen, she can soon make her own decisions.  Bays I would hope she will.  Finchum While you were in Africa teaching, did any of those students come over  here?  Bays Oh, they blossomed quickly because we gave them lots of, I think, self-assurance.     You can do this. There   s no doubt.    They would come from  very far, different places. When they left, they left knowing they could do  things. That was some of the best experience I ever had was through those  several years of encouraging young people, and not only young men. At that  time, African girls were not considered worth educating, but we said,    Wait  a minute. We think we can educate the girls just as well as anybody.    It was  remarkable how when we took in a class of, let   s say, four or five young  women along with the six or eight or ten men, pretty soon the women were  outdistancing the men. The men were lazy, and the girls were running all  over them. (Laughs)  Finchum Taking advantage of the opportunity.  Bays Well, yeah  Of course, that made me just thrilled to pieces because those  girls were so capable. There wasn   t any reason why they couldn   t do it.  They had just been told they couldn   t do it. When they came in and got  assignments, those assignments, when they finished them, were much better  than the men were doing. I   d say,    What   s wrong with you guys? You   re  getting run all over here     (Laughs) That would get them going a little bit.  Finchum Sounds like that was a good fit for the two of you.  Bays Yeah, it was. Betty was excellent in her role, because she had been home  economics-trained here. She worked at the women   s training center teaching  the women how to get along best in the growing city complex. It worked out  very well.  Finchum Did you stay overseas during your entire career or come back?  Bays We were there four years in that setting, and then we came back to this  country. The reason I came back was because I was not the head authority.  The head authority over the school did not really go the direction that I  wanted to go. The people who ran the whole setup said,    Well, he   s our  man,    so I threw in the towel and came back home. I didn   t want to be  somewhere where I couldn   t do things that I knew needed to be done and  never would be done under him. I gave that up and came back home.  Finchum Came back to Stillwater or just to somewhere else in the states?  Bays Let   s see. I wish my brain were more attuned to what I did.  Finchum You   re doing good.  Bays You   re going to have to let me have a little more time on that one.  Finchum That   s okay. When you retired, you chose to come back here, or were you  already here in Stillwater?  Bays I chose to come back here, which may not have been the best choice. Betty  has never really liked it that well. I thought it would be good for us, but it  hasn   t turned out to be that way. She went to school here too, but has not  found it to be the   now, she has done some very, very capable work here in  that   see, I   m an ordained Presbyterian minister. I   ve had a lot of   what I  came back for, after coming back from overseas, I started ministering to  churches, so we   ve been in lots of different churches.  She decided that she would work in women   s ministry and so forth. Then,  all of a sudden the presbytery, which is a group of churches that all worked  together, all of a sudden they made her the, what   s called the stated clerk.  That   s the person who is in charge of everything that happens. She worked  several years as the stated clerk of Cimarron Presbytery, which is composed  of about seven or eight Presbyterian churches. She was always very  esteemed in that position.  She  treated everybody very fairly, because you  need somebody at the top who treats people fairly. She made herself quite a  distinction in her understanding of how you operate a church or a  megachurch, something like that. She became quite well suited for that. That  was one of her most outstanding performances. Very, very smart about it.  Finchum When you came back to Stillwater, it was coming home for you. Do you  remember what year you came back, or how long you   ve been back? It was  after you retired, so it had to be after you were sixty-five-ish?  Bays I   m trying to think where I was, where I came back from   I can   t think  where my last place was before returning here. I think I just, what I did was,  in effect, retired from the ministry. That was it. I just retired from the  ministry and moved back to here. Now, that didn   t stop me from still  participating in church affairs, but it took me out of pulpit work. I didn   t  mind that because I had had a lot of pulpit work. Some of it works very well,  and some of it doesn   t. I was all right at being retired, and I   ve been retired  ever since.  Finchum Stillwater had changed quite a bit from college days until you came back?  Bays Yeah, it   s very different from what it was when we were here going to  school. For instance, all around us students are living, students in this house,  students in that house, students across the street.  There   s  a whole gob of  students down here. I   m rather disappointed to see how they   re doing. I  shouldn   t judge too harshly, but a lot of them don   t give me the impression  of really knowing where they   re going, maybe are not quite ready to go  there. (Laughs) I don   t know. Maybe that   s unfair. I don   t know, but I think  we used to have to work harder at it, maybe, than some are working at it  today.  Finchum Well, you worked for your dad to pay tuition, plus GI Bill.  Bays Yeah.  Finchum Where would you go on dates? What places would you go to eat, for  example, that might still be here? Was Shorty   s still here?  Bays It probably was, but I can   t tell you.  Finchum I don   t know if it was or not, either.  Bays Okay. By and large, we don   t eat out as much, probably, as we should and  as much as Betty would like to see. (Laughs)  Finchum Back in the college days, you probably didn   t eat out much, either.  Bays No, we didn   t really.  Finchum Go to movies then?  Bays We must   ve, but I   m drawing a blank on that. The difference between  myself and going to movies and things like that is I would rather be involved  with people who are trying to make the world a better place. I spend all of  my time engaged in trying to improve the life of people in the United States,  and I correspond with a whole lot of different people. I   m always behind and  trying to keep up with those I want to keep up with. I really appreciate them.  I donate as much money as I possibly can to their causes, and that   s where  my interest lies.  I really don   t dare take you back to my workroom and let you look in there.  You might faint, but I just have to work with any, in other words, I get,  sometimes I get fifteen and twenty letters a day from people who hope that I  will support their cause. Well, I can support some causes, but I can   t support  fifteen or twenty a day by any means. I do what I can. We always get a big  mail delivery every day. We don   t get any from Republicans, (laughs)  because I   m not a Republican, but I get all of these appeals from Democrats  who are, most of them are trying to get back into their jobs or keep their  jobs.  Finchum Do you spend time writing letters and stuff, using your journalism skills?  Bays I do more than that. I actually send them money, but it   s not much money. I  mean, twenty dollars is a big sum, but still you can   t do that very often  without feeling it. I get letters every day. There are probably half a dozen  letters up there today asking for money. You just have to sort out the ones  that you can deal with and let the rest of it go. My name is very widely  known, very, very widely known. Not that I   m important, but it   s because     If you want a little help, that guy might help you.    That   s it. That   s about it.  I don   t go to any big conflabs. I don   t make any decisions, but I sure get a  lot of requests.  Finchum Small things can be big things to other people. (Laughs)  Bays Yeah. I hope I haven   t taken you far   .  Finchum No, you   re doing great work. How do you show or do you show OSU pride?  Do you have an orange room? Do you have anything orange?  Bays No, I don   t have any. Well, I do. I have an orange cap, like a stocking cap  that I wear when it   s cold. In fact, I have two of them.  Finchum Do you go on campus much?  Bays Rarely. I   m probably way too much involved in my own doings and not  sensitive enough to what   s happening elsewhere, but I just don   t have the  time to deal with other things. I just deal with what I can here at home.  Finchum You probably wouldn   t have been able to get where you got without your  degree from, initial degree from OSU, at that time it was Oklahoma A M.  Bays Yeah.  Finchum The name didn   t change until after you were graduated  in  like    58,    57,  somewhere through there. Did your brother go to OSU?  Bays Yes. I don   t know what degree he has for sure, but his was in, had to do with  oil exploration. He   s been in the oil, worldwide oil exploration business.  Finchum The Student Union was just brand new at the time you were there, too. Did  you go to dances?  Bays No.  Finchum Play Bridge?  Bays No. (Laughter)  Finchum Go to football games, basketball games?  Bays We went to some basketball games, I guess, back years ago, and some  football games, but we don   t go to either one now.  Finchum It   s a whole different environment now then it was then.  Bays Right. Yeah.  Finchum Been a pretty good life?  Bays We   ve had a pretty good life.  Finchum Is  your wife  the one that does the music or is that yours?  Bays Oh, I   m not a musician.  Finchum Someone plays the piano, or organ, I guess.  Bays Oh, she   s a very good organist. Yeah, she   s an organist and pianist, yeah,  very accomplished, yeah. She doesn   t do much with it anymore, but she has  been able to. Whenever she appeared at a church, she usually did the organ  or the piano.  Finchum Did she have brothers and sisters?  Bays She had two sisters. One died within the last month. She   s three years older,  I think, or about two years older than Betty and lived in Washington state.  Then, there   s another sister that lives in northern Illinois right up near  the   what   s the next state to the north? Anyway, she   s the wife of a farmer  and is about seven years Betty   s junior, but they are really close. These two  sisters are really close even though they   re, I mean, they can talk on the hour  over the phone, easily.  Finchum You and your brother could too?  Bays Unfortunately, my brother and I don   t believe in the same things. That   s not  something new. He is pretty much always decided to keep his distance from  me and run his own show. Now, he   s very, very intelligent. He   s had lots of  important positions in the oil discovery industry. He   s far more self-assured  of his knowledge than I am, but we rarely discuss matters because we are  totally opposite when it comes to politics. There   s no point in even raising  the word because it won   t lead to anything good.  Finchum That   s being smart just to leave it alone, then.  Bays Yes.  Finchum A long way from that rural school out on Lake McMurtry, isn   t it?  Bays (Laughs) Yeah, sure is.  Finchum Is there anything else you want to add before we close?  Bays Well, I hope I have given you something that   s worthwhile, and I appreciate  your interest very much. Thank you.  Finchum Thank you for having me.  -------  -------
