 Sherman and today is October 15, 2009. I   m visiting  with Marilynn McAfee here in Stillwater, Oklahoma during the 2009  Homecoming celebration. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories  project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. I want to  thank you for your time today and personally welcome you back to  Stillwater.  Thank you.  We   re just going to begin by asking you some questions about your  background, like where you grew up and whatnot. Can you tell me a  little bit about where you   re from, where you grew up, and  your life   before you came to OSU?  Yes, I was born and reared in Rush Springs, Oklahoma   that   s in  southern Grady County. I attended all my school days there, graduated  from high school in 1955. I am from a family of five children. I am the  middle of those five and I am the first to attend college. I came to OSU  then in 1955. I became most acquainted with it. I had a friend that was  two years older than myself. She came to OSU and she kind of took me  under her wing and would invite me up for weekends. I just loved it and  so from then on I said,    I am going to Oklahoma A   M,    so that was  my goal.  So you were the first one in your family to attend college?  Yes.  And was it expectant of you to come to college?  No, it was not. In fact, my older two sisters had married pretty quickly  out of high school and started their homes. But I just said,    I want to go  5  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  to Oklahoma A   M.    So I started saving money for my tuition and my  mother was very helpful in that. She took a job outside the home and  whatever she could do to help with some of that. Altogether we did it.  What was it about OSU or Oklahoma A   M that you fell in love with?  Well, number one  was  the campus. Then, I would stay in the dorm  with my friend and she lived in Willard Hall. I could see that the girls  were very friendly even though here I was a high school student, they  were very friendly and so I thought, that   s what I want to do. I majored  in, then, it was home economics. I loved that in high school and my  degree was in Clothing and Textiles, and that   s what I loved. So that was  a good fit for me.  Being that clothing and textiles was your background, did you ever show  at the county fair level doing that kind of projects?  No, I did not. Other than style shows in high school, things like that,  FHA, I did not ever show at the county fair.  Who was your friend that brought you up to OSU? What was her name?  Her name was Loretta Gibbs.  And she was two years older than you?  Yes.  What year did you enroll?  1955.  What was the campus like back then, compared to now?  Well, of course, then I thought it was huge. (Laughter) But that was  okay. We walked, I was used to walking. I did not have a car in high  school and did not bring a car to college. That wasn   t real important. Not  many of the girls did have cars that they brought to college, so we all  just learned to walk. There were the three major women   s dormitories:  Willard, Murray, and Stout. There were still a lot of Quonset huts,  particularly for the biology and chemistry labs and art labs. Those are  gone now and thank goodness. (Laughter) The Student Union has been  added, too. I   m sure there are a lot of differences; more student housing,  the dormitories, more buildings have been either remodeled or new ones  have been built.  6  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  What years did you live in Willard?  1955 through 1959.  So all four years there?  Yes. The first three years I lived on the top floor of Willard, Willard  Four. And then because my roommates had graduated, I decided I  wanted to move down. Because they often put freshmen up on the higher  floors. I moved down to Willard Two and that is the group that we have  these reunions.  Did you specifically ask or request to be placed in Willard?  Yes, because that   s where my friend lived.  You had impressions of Willard Hall before you actually came into the  hall.  Yes.  Can you describe what kind of feelings and emotions  you had ?  I remember the weekend my parents brought me up and left me, I  thought,    Oh goodness, I   m all alone up here.    But people just make you  feel welcome. They went out of their way. There were a lot of things to  make that happen. It was not difficult to make friends. There were plenty  of people to point you in the right direction to get to the right class that  first week. I also sought employment and I did some work at the desk  down in Willard. It was set up much differently than it is now. And you  meet people through different ways.  What were your roommates like? Did you get along with them?  The first year, my roommate was from Bartlesville and I did not know  her at all, but she decided to get married. So then the second semester, I  believe that is when there was a girl who came in from OU that was  transferring. She lived with me the second semester and that went really,  really well. Then the second year, I   m trying to remember who my  roommate was then, but the third year it was girls that I knew. We just  kind of changed around as graduation took place. Then the fourth year, I  knew the girl that was looking for a roommate down on Two and I  already knew who she was and I knew those girls, so that went really  well just to mix in Willard Two.  That   s good. You had good experiences with your roommates.  7  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Oh, yes.  Can you describe your dorm room? Nowadays you get these suite  apartments that have a living area, have two separate bedrooms. Can  you now describe your dorm room?  Very different. I was used to always sharing a room in my home because  I had sisters. We had one window, no air conditioning. School did not  begin until after Labor Day but September was very, very warm. Very,  very warm. And then there were two single beds, we had two chests, and  we had two very small closets. If you did not bring your poodle skirts  from high school with your crinoline petticoats, you were okay. You  could get your clothing in those. But many of the girls had to make  clotheslines in their rooms to hang their clothing on because they just  weren   t large enough. We had one lavatory. The bathrooms, of course,  you had one large one on each wing. And you had one telephone each.  Did you bring much stuff up when you initially moved in?  I knew basically to bring the necessities, other than my clothing. I think I  had a radio, I cannot even remember that. But you didn   t have to bring a  lot of things then really. Pictures.  Where would you do your laundry then?  Well, the laundry was downstairs in the basement. You had to take it  down and sometimes you just had to wait and do yours. You really  needed to stay down with it to transfer it from the washing machine to  the dryer, or if you didn   t someone else would do that for you.  (Laughter)  Was it paid laundry? Did you have to pay for it?  I don   t think it was at that time.  Getting back to the non-air conditioning, how did you manage to cool  off in the dorm rooms?  Well, the window was open. But I think we probably just became  acclimated to it.  What was the room like in the winter time?  Oh, it was plenty warm because there were heating elements along the  floor, if I recall. We did each have a desk also. It was plenty warm.  There was never a problem there.  8  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  Some of those old buildings can be drafty, especially up on the top floor.  Now, can you share some of your experiences with the floor phone as  they would call it?  Well, usually there would be one or two girls that had the most calls and  they would just sit or even lie in the hallway talking and talking and  talking. When the phone rang, anyone could go out and answer it and  then you just yelled out who it was for. I recall if you wanted to make a  long-distance call or if you received one from your parents or home,  which really that was very rare, you only did it in case of emergencies  and what, there were two pay telephone booths downstairs off the room.  Those are what you used for long-distance.  So you managed to communicate with your parents by letter writing  then?  By letters mostly. You always hoped when you received one there  would be money in it.  Of course. You talked about having a common shower and restroom  area, how did you feel about that?  That was fine. It was always large enough you never really had to wait.  There were enough showers and enough commodes that you never really  had to wait. And they were kept clean. We had housekeepers that every  day came and cleaned.  Did you ever feel that you got enough privacy living in the dorm?  I think that was never really an issue at that time because you learned  that there wasn   t a whole lot of privacy. You just learned to live with  that.  So it was easy for gossip to spread?  Oh sure, if you want to gossip, that   s always easy to spread if you want  to gossip. We knew what went on in the dormitory in other words, what  were the happenings you wanted to avoid. There was always chatter.  You knew what was going on.  Who was dating who and whatnot.  Yeah.  Being a member of Willard Hall, did you have many interactions with  other women dormitories on campus?  9  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  Through your classes you learned. I had many friends who were in  sororities that I met through classes and that type of thing. Then after the  latter part of my freshman year I became employed for the bookstore in  the Student Union.  What was that like, to work for the bookstore?  Well, I thought it was wonderful because it was a job that I needed to  help. And you got to see everybody on campus at sometime. Almost  every student came through that bookstore, which it was different then  than it is today. I got to meet a lot of people or just know who they were.  There was always a lot of action.  Where was the bookstore at that time?  It would be the northwest corner of the first floor of the Student Union.  That whole wing was the bookstore and where you bought all the  supplies. All the engineering supplies were in another group.  Art supplies, too?  Art supplies and engineering.  Did you get a discount by working there?  No, no I didn   t. Usually you would put in for used books if they were  available, but no, we did not get discounts.  Being at Willard, was it considered to be a popular or prestigious hall at  that time?  Well, Willard was the oldest dormitory and it was just the most central  to campus. I don   t think probably it was prestigious or more popular.  Stout was very popular, Murray too. They were probably about the  same.  Was there a difference between the women   s halls? The type of girls that  lived in each of them or were they considered the same, of the same  mold?  From what I can remember or observe, it just seemed to be about the  same. I do think Willard had more women athletes. Back then it was  intramural sports, particularly in basketball, and they usually did very  well in that competition.  Did you participate in any of them?  10  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  In the beginning I did, in basketball because I played basketball in high  school.  Can you describe that for me?  I didn   t play for very long because once I started working, I did not  really have that  much  time to put into it. But it was just another way to  get to interact with the girls. Most of them came from a small town  because there was not basketball in the large schools at that time. I was  from a small town, so we knew how to play. (Laughs) It was not real  structured, but it was neat, just competition.  Where did you play?  I   m trying to remember, there was a place     Was it in the Armory?  That   s where some of the games were, but practices were not in the  Armory and I   m trying to remember exactly if those were   I can   t even  remember where they were.  Now, was the term WOW: Women of Willard popular? Was it used back  in the    50s?  I don   t recall that it was. I don   t recall that.  Do you remember when you first used that term? Or do you even use  that term?  I   m not sure I use that WOW: Women of Willard. We just kind of  always talked Willard Two, Willard Four   oh you   re from Willard  Four, you   re on two, you were on three. It was more identifiable that  way.  Did the floors have nicknames sometimes given to them?  Not that I recall.  I   m going to talk about some of the traditions of Willard Hall. Do you  remember hearing the term Willard Beach?  No.  What about some of the Christmas traditions? Did you have any?  11  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Well, downstairs in the main floors, it   s always very lovely, the living  rooms and reception rooms. There was always a tree. We did things  more in groups. I know this group that I   m with, we had our own  Christmas parties in the room and we would dress up for those or  whatever and fix our popcorn and have our own. That   s what I recall.  Did you exchange gifts?  I think we did, but I can   t remember the gifts I would   ve received.  Did Willard Hall participate in Homecoming events?  Yes, but usually more through a house decoration. We never did have  floats.  What about any of the contests?  What type of contests?  Like singing, variety, any of those type things, skits?  One year in Varsity Revue. I do believe Willard Hall did, but I was not  in that.  It was just mainly the decorations?  Yes.  Can you describe some of those decorations for me?  I was not involved in doing it. They usually were not as elaborate  because budget-wise there was not ever anything upfront in the  beginning. I think that   s where it was different than perhaps the  sororities and things like that, which they   re budgeted. And Willard  Hall, so it was like you kind of came up with an additional gift or  something to make those decorations.  Were there any traditions when a Willard girl would get engaged?  Oh, yes. Oh yes, particularly if it was a fraternity guy. You know, you  got pinned and they sang. The fraternity fellows would come to Theta  Pond and on the lawn of Willard, which it was beautiful, it was always  very manicured. And then the girl could go out on the balcony. You had  to have permission to do that because the house mothers, after 10:30 that  was locked down. So you had to have permission   it was usually after  10:30   to go out on the big front porch that your beau or fianc   then  12  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  would pin you. And then they could toss him in Theta Pond.  (Laughs) Oh, how convenient, right there.  Yeah.  Did women back then get a lavaliere from a fraternity guy?  Not that I recall.  A lavaliere is basically a necklace with the letters on it.  No, it was just his pin. I still have my husband   s pin.  What fraternity was he in?  Kappa Sig.  Wow, you still have it?  Yes.  Were you engaged before  you graduated ? Did that happen to you then  that he came out and sang for you or was that     I was a senior.  Can you describe that for us?  (Laughs) Well, you   re just very elated, you   re in love. And this is the  one. He was actually in graduate school at the time so he was not living  in the Kappa Sig house. But they came and sang and I knew they would  so permission had to be given. Now, they did not toss him in. (Laughter)  I think because he was one of the upper-classmen. None of that, none of  that. But that was very, very special.  Did you meet him on campus?  Basically we were on campus. A girl, let   s see, Shirley lived in Stout   Hall , but she and I had lived together. Four of us who were in Clothing  and Textiles and Merchandising had lived in Dallas together the  previous summer doing an internship. She got married then the next  year, and her husband was a fraternity  brother  of my husband. He  noticed that she knew me and he said,    Can you introduce me to her?     So that   s the way it happened.  13  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  What   s his name?  Ron. Ronald.  Okay. McAfee?  Yes.  That   s kind of neat that you were sung to. Some of those traditions  should come back, I think. Getting back to other Willard Hall traditions,  did you help with collecting the scrapbooks or did you help put together  scrapbooks?  No, I did not. I did not.  Let   s go into some dormitory rules. You had a house mother; what was  her role?  Mrs. Pope. She was always there during the day and she lived there  actually. There was a small apartment for the house mother. Then there  was the main dorm counselor, Mary Margaret Newby, and she also had  quarters. Then we had the night mother, which she would come on duty  at 8:00  PM  and stay until about 7:00 the next morning. The rules were  as a freshman you had to be in at 8:00 or 8:30. And to be out of there  you had to really sign out and have a very, very good reason,  permission. Upperclassmen could stay out till 10:30   that was juniors  and above. But basically the doors locked at 8:00 and then those that  were coming in at 10:30 had to ring the bell and be let in by the night  mother. You were just very respectful of the dormitory, really.  Other rules: weekends we could be out till 12:00 or 12:30, everybody  could. To leave the campus, of course that was just a policy, you had to  have permission from your parents at home, kind of a blanket  permission that they kept on file that said that you would be allowed to  check out to go out of town. At the same time, a card was filled out then  and sent to your parents if you did check out so that by Monday or  Tuesday they knew that you had been out of town. I forget, just rules,  rules, rules. It was very, very different. For instance, no boys were  allowed on the floors. If your brother or your dad came on a weekend,  you had to go ahead and say,    Man on floor     so everybody could dart  and get inside their rooms. (Laughter) It was very different.  Were there penalties for coming in late past curfew?  I believe there were. I cannot tell you what they were because I never  ever did that. There were girls that did that and I cannot tell you what  14  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  their penalties were.  Was there a dress code in the hall?  To go to meals you always had dresses. On weekends, we could wear  jeans and rollers in our hair, like on Saturdays. But on Sunday noon, you  were to dress like you had been to church. At that time on the entire  campus, it was not considered okay to wear trousers on campus, but on  Saturdays you could. In the Student Union it was not okay for women to  wear trousers other than maybe on Saturday if you wanted to sashay  through there. But basically, it was dresses, skirts.  I heard there was a sort of dress code for the library. Was that the case?  I cannot tell you for sure. I would think on weekends it would probably  have been a little bit more relaxed as the campus seemed to relax  everything a little bit for weekends.  Could you be seen giving public displays of affection? Giving hugs or a  kiss or anything like that?  In the dormitory?  Yeah, in the dorm.  That would usually happen on the steps before you came in, your  goodnight kiss, and sometimes on the long porch that faced south. That  was a huge porch that had benches. But not really in the dormitory  inside did we see that.  Because no men were basically allowed inside.  Oh, they could come into the living area and wait certain hours and I  don   t know if it was all during the day if they could or something like  that, but not above the first floor.  Were there similar rules in place for the men   s dormitories?  Not really like ours. Certainly not that checking out on the weekend. I  think that probably there might have been a curfew for the freshmen  men, but I don   t really believe there was.  Did your future husband live in graduate student housing when he was  here?  No, I think his first year he lived in a dormitory and then he pledged and  15  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  was in the Kappa Sig house, then the last year he and another Kappa Sig  rented a small little house not real far from campus.  Getting back to your dorm mother, what do you remember about her?  Oh, she was very, very strict. Very, very strict. I can   t remember which  team it was, if it was Kansas or what team that we beat, and there was  going to be a panty raid. And she stood at the door as they were beating  to get in and she says,    We just waxed the floors today.    (Laughter)  Were there other special hall events and activities that you remember?  There always was something near the first of the year, a kind of get-acquainted  type thing. But there were about 400 women in that hall and  so to get everybody together at the same time, those things I can   t  remember as well.  You   ve maintained a bond with members of the second floor of Willard.  Why is that bond so special to you? And can you describe for me some  aspects of that bond?  Well, if you just stay in touch with people and you know what   s going  on in their lives, although they may be strewn across the country or out  of the country at times, you knew when their children were born, how  many they had, or where their next assignment wherever they were  working would be. I think it was about the ten-year reunion was the first  one that I   and by then, most of us had our children. They were little.  But we just stayed in contact. And where there are some people that I  recall even more so than even high school people, we stayed in contact  and made it a point to get together every five, ten years.  How often do you get together?  It   s been more often in recent years. But I would say more like ten years.  But it was probably eight years ago we got together in Colorado. Then  three years ago at the Big XII Tournament in Oklahoma City. And then  purposely we did the 50-year reunion.  And when was that 50-year reunion?  This year. This is our 50th graduation year.  Because some members aren   t members of the class of    59, right?  Very few that are here this weekend are not   either their husband     most of the women, with probably the exception of two or three, are    59  16  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  graduates.  How many reunions have you participated in?  Maybe four for sure that I can think of.  Do you think your Willard experience added to your OSU experience?  Oh, very definitely it did. Just the fact that these girls here today I met  them at Willard. And to stay in contact with them and just relationships,  the friendship, we have a lot in common.  Is this group strewn about all over the country or just mainly in  Oklahoma?  Virginia, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, I think those are the  main ones here this time.  So what did you do after  graduation ?  Well, I married that summer. And because Ron was in the advanced  ROTC and had gotten a delay until he finished his Master   s degree, then  we went straight to the Air Force. That was in California for three years.  Our children were born there. We came back to Oklahoma   no, we  came back then to the University of Texas in Austin. We were there two  years while he completed a PhD and I worked during that time. Then we  came back to Oklahoma in 1964 and basically we   ve been in Oklahoma  since 1964.  Where in Oklahoma?  Oklahoma City and then Bethany and Edmond.  Now are you retired?  Sort of. I have been always basically a homemaker. I have done a lot of  volunteer work and I   ve had jobs in between but not career-type jobs. I  have been a homemaker and I am very, very satisfied with that. My  husband retired from one job, he   s retired from two different jobs. But  we are franchising some Sonic Drive-In restaurants and so those you  don   t really retire from, you either sell them or what. But we   re still very  involved in those.  Now, one last question. What   s so unique about Oklahoma State  University that creates such a bond with its alumni?  17  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Sherman  McAfee  Well, it   s kind of like the theme for Homecoming, which is    Branded for  Life.    I find that true with most graduates and the support of athletics,  you do that because you   re a graduate; you either went there or you  graduated from there. And it   s kind of like home. We   ve stayed very  involved in athletics, so we   re on campus a lot.  So you consider yourself a cowgirl then?  Cowgirl or Cowboy. (Laughs)  Not an Aggie?  No, because it changed right in the middle, see. That changed in 1957  right before the junior year. I and my husband were OSU graduates.  Is there anything that you would like to add that we haven   t discussed?  Well, other than just to say that maybe one doesn   t realize it in the  beginning, but it really has shaped my life from when I started till the  end because of staying involved with it. It has always been a part   our  two sons are also graduates. With my husband also having a degree from  the University of Texas, we just say,    In our family, our blood runs  orange.     So what happens on October 31  OSU vs. UT game ?  Our blood runs orange. Bright orange.  (Laughter) Bright orange. Good, good, good. Alright, I just want to  thank you for being with us today.  Thank you.  -------  -------
