 Gill. Today is January 22, 2009. I   m visiting with  Floyd Wood in his home in Lawton, Oklahoma. This interview is for the  O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Congratulations first of all, Mr. Wood, on your hundredth  birthday today.  Thank you.  Pretty special day?  It sure is.  I understand you were recognized earlier this morning by Willard Scott  on the nationally televised Today program. Is that the first time you   ve  ever seen yourself on TV?  Yes.  Well, what   d you think? Was it pretty exciting for you?  Yeah, to be a hundred.  One question that probably comes to mind, you   ve been asked this, how  did you live so long? Have you got good family genes or what do you  attribute it to?  I just live a clean life, I guess. Working hard.  You were born in Hochatown in McCurtain County in Southeastern  Oklahoma?  Yeah.  6  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Can you share some information about your early life, about your family  in Oklahoma before you moved to New Mexico?  I attended grade school at Hochatown until I was in the 7th grade, then  we moved to New Mexico because my dad wanted to get in a higher  climate. He had TB. I went to high school three years in Estancia and  one year in Albuquerque. My eighth grade in Mountainair, New Mexico.  Going back to Oklahoma, what did your father do for a living?  He was a farmer. We had a black land farm on Mountain Fork River to  raise big white elephant corn. Ears of corn about a foot long or more.  That   s some beautiful country along there, isn   t it?  Yeah. Did a lot of fishing.  Did you enjoy that growing up? As a young man fishing and hiking and  walking in the mountains?  I remember my dad getting up in the tree and shooting the fish. Shooting  under the fish and killing   and I   d wade in and get them out of the river,  Mountain Fork River.  Did you help out on the farm growing up?  Yeah. A lot of pulling Johnson grass and hoeing and planting corn.  Did you ever work behind a team of horses?  Yeah.  So you moved to Estancia, New Mexico and you graduated from high  school there?  Yeah.  Can you share a little bit about your high school experiences? Some of  the things you did in school?  Well, I played basketball. I was on the basketball team there. There were  16 in our graduating class. School was just small. We had a good school.  I understand your father died when you were still in high school, when  you were 17. Is that right?  7  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Yeah, he died in Albuquerque at the sanatorium there.  Did you help out with some of the family chores?  Yeah. I had quite a few feeding chores to do and other things.  Did you live on a farm there too, on an acreage in New Mexico?  Yeah.  How did you get back to Oklahoma State University, actually Oklahoma  A M then, from New Mexico? Is there a story there?  I graduated from Estancia High School in 1928. I caught a ride back to  Oklahoma and worked one semester with my brother Clyde in Willis,  Oklahoma. Laid out one semester and I entered Oklahoma A M  College in 1929.  Started in January?  Yeah. Got my B.S. degree in 1933 and a Master   s degree in 1940.  Can you talk a little bit about what Oklahoma A M was like in 1929?  What do you remember about the buildings and campus locations?  Just a few buildings, but Dr. Bennett had a 25-year plan that he carried  out and built a lot of buildings. It   s enlarged ever since.  In what buildings were your classes held?  In the shops building and engineering building. And of course, the old  biology building, had science classes there. Had one class in Old  Central. Old Central was the oldest college building in Oklahoma I  think. Still standing there.  Still is. You were talking about the shops building. Was that by the old  industrial arts building?  Yeah. That   s where, yeah. It   s still there I guess.  So your major then was in technology?  Trade and Industrial Education. I worked my way through college  building furniture and working in the broom factory. The college had  this broom factory downtown and I was shipping clerk for the broom  factory.  8  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Okay, so it was located downtown. Was it on Main Street or just off of  Main?  Just off of Main Street. They paid us 40 cents an hour.  Forty cents an hour?  Yes.  Well, that was good money then, wasn   t it?  Pretty good then.  Sure was, absolutely. Do you recall some of the professors that had an  impact on you, Floyd?  Dr. DeWitt Hunt. He was also the tennis coach. And Soderstrom was my  metal shop teacher. And Dr.  Charles Walter  Briles was, of course,  former president of East Central at Ada. He was head of the Trade and  Industrial Education Department. Had most of my major courses under  him. Dr. Briles was a wonderful old man, went on crutches.  At that time, do you remember what student enrollment was? How many  students you had on campus?  Seemed to me like about 2500 to 2900, best I can remember.  What did the students do for fun and recreation back in the late    20s,  early    30s?  Oh, of course, we had athletics in the gym and wrestling, basketball,  football. Of course, we   d all visit ROTC, too. Had two years of that.  If you were going out on a date, where would you go with your date?  To the movies is about all. I spent about all my money.  (Laughs) What movie theatre did most of the students go to?  I forget the name of it.  Was it the one right across from the campus? The Campus Theatre?  No, it was downtown. Seemed to me like it was the Mecca. I   m not sure.  At that time, a lot of the students would get on the train   go to Horse  9  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Thief Canyon or go up north to the train stop up there. Did you ever do  any of that?  No.  Do you remember ever going to Swim   s? Was that a pretty popular  hangout?  Oh, Swim   s, that was the hangout.  Can you describe a little bit of it? Two floors, was it?  Yeah.  Can you describe a little bit about what it was like, what they had in the  building?  It was just a regular hangout,  a  drug store. They sold a lot of stuff in  there.  Did they have a pool table upstairs?  Yeah.  Well, what about just south of there, you know right there on the corner  of Knoblock where students would come there upstairs? You remember  that student place?  Thatcher Hall?  It was right across the street from the campus, just where the fire station  is, southeast.  That tall building? That   s Gardiner Hall.  Gardiner Hall, okay. Did you have classes in Williams Hall? The gothic  structure building?  Yeah, Morrill Hall. Had science and math classes over in the Biology  Building. Engineering classes in the Engineering Building.  Well, I understand that you met a special young lady there, is that right?  Iris Hall, yeah. Stella Iris Hall.  Stella Iris, goes by Iris?  10  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  We were going on a picnic out by the farm and I just happened to grab  onto her and love at first sight, I guess.  (Laughs) And she didn   t let you let go either, right? That   s good. What  were some of the student traditions? Did they still have the tug-of-wars  at that time across Theta Pond?  Yeah, they had a lot of that.  What was Theta Pond like back in those days? What did it look like?  Regular pond. Well-known place on the campus where everybody hung  out a lot.  Were they still watering livestock at that time?  Yeah. I used to work on the grounds and I remember I did a lot of my  work around Theta Pond working on the campus.  A lot of weeds around Theta Pond at that time? A lot of grass? Not as  trim as it is today, is it?  No.  Did you have to wear the freshman beanie? Was that still one of the  traditions they had in those days?  Yeah.  So tell me about that tradition. How   d that work?  Well, you had to wear it or they   d get you.  So you had to wear it in public any time you were outside or in class.  Did you have to wear it for a semester or a full year?  One semester.  Now if they caught you without it on, what happened to you?  (Laughs) They would give you a couple of licks.  Do you remember Homecoming back in those days? Did you watch any  of the Homecoming parades?  Yeah, we had those downtown. They were in the morning and then  11  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  usually the football game that afternoon. It was a long parade.  Did you ever work on any of the floats?  No.  (Laughs) Well, how did you get out of that? I thought it was almost  required? I heard back in the    20s, early    30s that Frank    Pistol Pete     Eaton, would ride in the parade. Did he ever ride in the parades when  you were a student?  Yeah.  You remember seeing him?  Yeah.  Did you ever meet him personally?  Yeah.  Can you tell me about that?  He   s a friendly guy, talked a lot.  Where did you meet him?  I really met him there in this Alumni Hall that ConocoPhillips built there  on campus, did you know that?  I sure did. Absolutely. They did a great job helping out with that. So did  Pistol Pete come to see you?  Yeah.  The character? That   s great. Did you ever meet Frank Eaton himself,  personally? Did you ever meet Frank Eaton alive?  No, I never did. He was the original Pistol Pete, wasn   t he?  He was the original. He used to come on campus a lot and I thought  maybe you   d had a chance to meet him in one of your classes or see him.  Oh, no. What age did he live to?  He lived to 1958. I think he was like 88 years old or 98     12  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Wasn   t he from Perkins?  Yes, he was. You were a member of Iota Lambda Sigma? What  organization was that?  That was a trade and industrial arts fraternity.  Oh, okay. Honorary?  Yeah, honorary.  Well, what was Stillwater like? What do you remember about Stillwater,  the town? What points of interest?  It was a small town. I worked out north of town with a guy  Harley  Thomas  that owned the Ford agency. Took care of his kids. Walked  back and forth to town.  Any buildings or things that you remember about the community there in  Stillwater?  Yeah, I was janitor of the library, the old library. Of course, the  Engineering Hall, we had the drawing classes there.  Well, you must have done a lot of things. Could we review some of those  again? You worked in a broom factory, you worked at the shops here  and made furniture for Willard Hall I think?  Yeah. We built all that furniture for Willard Hall.  Right. Let   s see, you labeled the brooms down at the broom factory.  Yeah.  You worked in the library?  I was janitor at the library.  See now I heard you worked at the dairy. Williamson   s Dairy?  Yeah. That was my first job. Running a route and milking.  Okay, so you   d help with the milking? Of course, it was all by hand then,  wasn   t it?  Yeah.  13  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  You didn   t have the mechanical milker     No machines.  Then you worked the route and delivered the milk on the route?  Yeah.  I guess you had to get up early in the morning for that?  Oh, I worked all my way through college; I didn   t get any help from  home.  Those jobs you mention are all pretty tough jobs, most of them.  Yeah.  So you really appreciated your degree then I guess more than most?  Yeah, sure do.  You truly earned it. Did you live off campus during your time there at  OSU?  Yeah, I lived over there on Duck Street most of the time.  Was that like a boarding place?  Yeah.  So you   d have room and board?  That   s where I delivered milk. Oh, I forget his name now. Sam Williams  I believe was his name.  And there were several boarding houses around Stillwater at that time,  particularly didn   t most of the male students live off campus?  Yeah.  Were the women required to live on campus?  Some of them I think lived off and boarded where they just had women.  Women boarding houses.  Where did Iris live? Did she live on campus?  14  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  No, they had a house rented. She and her sister and two brothers all went  to college together     My gosh, that was a family affair.     took the cow up there to milk (laughter) and help pay their way  through.  I hadn   t heard about that, that   s great. Well do you remember any, let   s  see we had Thatcher Hall for the women?  Yeah. Hanner Hall was the men.  Hanner and then Gardiner Hall was the other one for women?  That was all women, I think. It was the biggest one.  I hear their rules were pretty strict. Living on campus, what were the  hours for the women, then? When did they have to be back in the  evening?  I think by 10:30 or 11 o   clock. I didn   t live on the campus.  You never dated anyone that lived in the residence hall so you don   t  really know, huh?  No.  Who was the Dean of Women at that time? She was a pretty tough gal I  heard. Was it Julia Stout?  Yeah, Stout.  I heard she can be pretty tough. (Laughs) Well, speaking of that though,  did you know Dean Mac? Clarence McElroy, Dean of Students?  Yeah.  Did you ever meet with him personally, get a chance to talk to him?  Yeah. He was a science teacher. Dean of Science and Literature.  And he was also a Dean of Men I think. Dean of the men students,  wasn   t he?  Yeah.  15  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Did you ever get in trouble and have to go to the dean?  No.  You probably wouldn   t tell it anyway, would you? (Laughs) That   s good.  Well, let me back up, it   s a pretty special year. You came actually right  within six months of when Henry G. Bennett came in as President in  1928?  Yeah.  Do you remember what the students thought about Dr. Bennett?  They thought he was the greatest. He came up there from Durant,  where  he  was President down at that college. After that, he resigned at A M.  He   d gotten this Point Four Program and travelled all over the world  working on that. I don   t know what all it entailed, but it was quite a  program.  Did you ever go to the President   s home and visit with the president?  Yeah. I   ve even borrowed money from him.  Oh, really? Well can you tell me about that story? How   d that come  about?  I just got so broke, I had to go somewhere. He and A.L. Craybill were in  the same office, and I borrowed money from both of them.  (Laughs) Equal opportunity borrower.  I always managed to pay it back some way.  Do you remember how much you borrowed?  Oh, about 15-20 dollars.  I heard that Dr. Bennett did a lot of loaning, if a student needed help  he   d give them you know  10 or  15,  20.  He was also my Sunday school teacher at First Baptist Church.  What kind of teacher was he?  He was the best.  16  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Was he pretty inspiring?  Yeah and he really knew his Bible.  Now his father was a Baptist minister as I understand.  Yeah.  Was your class just a class for college students or was it for all adults  and students, for men?  Mostly college students.  And it was for the men students, right?  Yes, men that wanted to be in it.  Now did his wife, she taught the women   s class?  She taught the women.  So what was his teaching style when he taught Sunday school class?  Oh, he didn   t have to refer to any notes. He   d read a verse and then  discussed it.  And he could just quote scripture without having to look it up?  He could quote scripture real good. He was one of the best men I ever  knew.  Did he encourage discussion?  Yeah he   d have discussion. Group discussion.  How many typically would be in your Sunday school class that he was  teaching?  Oh, about 30.  Did you have assignments? I mean not like a school assignment, but  your next lesson, did you study your next lesson?  Yeah, we had our Sunday school books we studied.  You wanted to kind of be up for the college president, didn   t you?  17  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Wanted to know your stuff?  Yeah.  Well, was he an influence on you in terms of what you learned from him,  spiritually and other ways?  He was a good example. Set good examples for all the kids there.  I had heard that he really had a penchant for remembering names. Did  he remember names very well, is that true?  Yeah, he could call us by name.  So after a time or two he knew everybody   s name.  Yeah. If he ever met you, he   d remember your name.  Looking back on Dr. Bennett and his life, what do you remember as a  student about him? What things stand out in your mind about him?  His intellect. A real brilliant mind. And his world travels, he did so  much good travelling for this Point Four Program and other   he was  busy, engaged making speeches all around. And he was in demand to  talk to groups a lot.  Did you ever visit him in his home there in the white two-story frame  house?  Yeah.  You visited in his home?  Yes. They   d have parties there and we   d go.  What kind of parties would you have in his home?  Just groups in his class mostly.  His Sunday school class group primarily?  Yeah.  Just have a little social and maybe some hors d   oeurves.  Yeah.  18  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  What do you remember about his wife, was she pretty accommodating?  She was really a nice person. Beautiful woman and a good teacher.  Did you meet some of their kids? Did you know any of the Bennett  children that were there?  I knew Phil just not too well, but he knew me and that   s about all.  Did you know Tom, the other son?  No, I don   t remember.  I interviewed Tom back a couple months ago.  You   ve met him? Where is he now?  In Oklahoma City. He   s still a judge, an administrative judge for social  security.  A judge.  And he   s still going strong, goes to work nearly every day still.  I wonder what Phil Bennett   s doing.  Phil   s deceased now.  Oh, is he?  Yes. Tom   s the only one of the kids still living. Talking about people,  there   s another special personality that you were engaged with, Coach  Ed Gallagher.  Yeah.  So you wrestled for one year at Oklahoma State, what year was that?  I went out, seemed to me like that was 1932 or 3. But I never did make  the wrestling team. I just wrestled once. (Laughs)  Well, tell me about that, there   s got to be a story there. What duel was  that?  It was a match with East Central.  East Central. What weight did you wrestle at?  19  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  115.  115, huh? Should I ask how the match came out?  He won.  Well, golly, I thought guys in orange and black always won in wrestling.  I wasn   t that good.  Do you remember some of the guys that you wrestled with?  Chuck  Charles Field  Sawyer,  Jr. .  Was  Earl Gray McCready still there?  Rex  Peery , oh that boy made the Olympic team. Can   t remember what  year.  Well, I was looking here because at one time I had a photocopy of it  here. Here we go. How about Andy Hesser? You remember Andy?  Oh yeah, Andy could pin me. He and I were the same weight.  Andy worked for the University many many years and just died two or  three years ago.  What was he doing?  He worked over in the College of Engineering and worked with that  program for several years. And Andy owned the land that we bought for  the parking lot of the alumni center. Good guy.  He did what to the parking lot?  The alumni center that Helen Craig helped us build, right across the  street from it, we bought land from Andy Hesser.  He owned that land?  He did. Later when he retired he got into real estate or even before  retiring, he and his sons were in real estate and property management.  I didn   t know that.  Did one of Gallagher   s sons wrestle at that time? I see D. Gallagher. Is  20  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  that Don Gallagher?  Don wrestled some, yeah.  Is he a pretty good wrestler?  Pretty good. His  other son , Clarence, was a 100-yard dash man though,  he was a track man.  Well, I   m thinking here of McGuirk, was LeRoy his first name?  LeRoy.  Was he a pretty good wrestler? What do you remember about LeRoy?  Yeah, he was really good.  He was national champion I think, wasn   t he?  Yeah. He seemed to me like he had one eye out, I   m not sure.  I was looking at some of them here, Pierce and Sawyer and Brown,  Costner.  Oh yeah, Pierce. Bobby Pierce, was it?  Yes. Some pretty good wrestlers in there, right?  Oh, yeah.  What do you remember about the workouts? What were the workouts  like?  They were rough.  With all the things you were doing, I   m surprised you found time to  wrestle.  I didn   t go out too long. I didn   t wrestle much. I was too busy working.  So what was a typical workout under Coach Gallagher like?  He was really strict.  So a lot of discipline?  21  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Showed you a lot of good holds.  Did he work a lot of hands-on, demonstrating holds?  Yeah, just showing you.  So about how long was a typical workout?  About an hour, hour and a half.  Did you also have to do calisthenics, wind conditioning, other things as  well?  Yeah, beforehand. Weightlifting.  So believed in weightlifting for strength, and you did some wind sprints,  blitzers or whatever.  Yeah.  How did he relate to his wrestlers? I   ve heard stories about Coach  Gallagher how he could really inspire people, but what do you  remember about him as a coach? His technique, his style, how he  worked with his wrestlers?  He wrote the book on it.  Literally did.  Yeah. And he, a lot of people going out from under him that are coaches  are still coaching wrestling. One at Iowa State was coached by him.  In the workout you said he was pretty much a tough taskmaster, I mean  did he have you working pretty hard all the time?  Yeah.  Was he an inspirational coach to the guys? I know he was tough.  They all respected him.  I   d heard that for wrestling matches primarily, he had a quiet style but  he could really look a guy in the eye and inspire him with kind of a quiet,  intense voice. Is that true?  Yeah.  22  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  What do you remember about your interaction with him? I know it  wasn   t very much since you weren   t on the regular team, but what  impact did he have on you personally?  I thought he was a wonderful coach.  Let   s see, it   s probably a little bit different, a lot of folks wouldn   t  recognize the setup now. You wrestled actually in the old gymnasium, is  that correct?  Yeah. Upstairs.  And there was actually a ring? Kind of a raised platform with a ring  around it?  It was just a mat. We didn   t have it roped off.  Didn   t have it roped off at that time. What was it like, was it pretty  crowded in wrestling matches there in the old gymnasium?  Yeah, they had pretty good attendance.  I   ve seen pictures where they showed them hanging up on the rafters  even up there, is that true?  Yeah.  That must   ve been really something special. Was it pretty noisy in one of  those matches? Did the crowd get into it?  Yeah, they really yelled a lot.  Is there anything you remember about Coach Gallagher in terms of, did  he stress, you talked about lifting, about working hard, was he big on  diet, technique, things like that? What did he teach and preach?  He expected you to be in good shape. Lifting weights and the right kind  of diet and so forth.  So did he talk about tobacco and alcohol and things like that? Leaving  that alone?  Yeah.  But he specifically said, one of the boys told me, to be sure and eat three  good meals a day. Did he ever talk about it? I heard he sometimes talked  23  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  about diet. Did he ever talk about what he expected you to eat?  No, just a good healthy diet.  Okay, good. What memories are your special memories of your time  wrestling there? Any special moments you have? I guess the wrestling  match against the guy from East Central is one of them.  Mostly the workouts. Of course, I just wrestled that one time.  Had you ever wrestled before?  No. Oh, I had in grade school and out on the playgrounds. Used to  wrestle Indians down in McCurtain County.  What made you want to go out for wrestling?  I just thought I could make it. But I didn   t.  Well, there were some pretty doggone good wrestlers at the time too  though. You were right about that. We were talking awhile ago about  Dr. Bennett. Are there any Dr. Bennett stories that you remember? I  mean there   s a lot of Dr. Bennett stories told and some of them are true I  heard. But do you have some stories about Dr. Bennett that you  remember? While you were a student or even later?  No. Did you remember Clay Potts?  Yep. Cooked all the barbeque?  Yeah. He did all the barbequing. Wonder if he   s still living.  No, he   s been deceased several years now.  He sure put on some good feasts.  Boy he did, didn   t he? Well, you were talking about some of the faculty  members earlier, are there other faculty members or other  administrators on campus that you remember at the time that had an  impact on your life or just that you remember specifically for some  reason?  English teacher, but I can   t remember her name. I had one though   Dr.  Briles taught all the trade and industrial classes. He was really a good  teacher.  24  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  At that time, I guess your classes were usually fairly small classes?  Yeah.  Did you get a lot of personal attention from professors?  Yeah. He said,    Here   s a book, y   all can read it, but we won   t use it very  much.    (Laughter) He just talked from experiences.  (Laughs) That   s good. So your major was T and I, trade and industrial  education?  Yeah.  And I understand that you had a pretty rough first semester. But it got  better as you went on?  Yeah, I think I made eight hours.  How many did you take?  I think 12.  What did you think about it at the time? Were you kind of wondering     I was about ready to go home. Stuck it out.  (Laughs) Did somebody encourage you to stay?  No, I just decided I   m going to stay or else.  Just too ornery to     Nothing else to do.  (Laughs) But I understand your last couple of semesters you were on the  Dean   s Honor Roll?  Yeah.  Well, you made some progress then.  Yeah.  Congratulations. Was it tough balancing all your work that you did with  your school work?  25  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Yeah. It took a lot to do it.  Well, you were there at a unique time, Floyd, when the stock market and  the beginning of the Depression. I guess it was pretty hard to come by  money. Did a lot of students have     What was that?  The Great Depression. You know we had     What was the money?  Oh, what was the money? (Laughs) Okay, I got you; no one had any,  didn   t see it, didn   t recognize it. So most of the students had jobs to pay  their way through school?  Oh, a lot of them didn   t have to work. Fraternity boys. Of course, a lot of  them worked in the fraternities.  So were a lot of the students in your same boat? Had to put in a lot of  hours and do odd jobs to pay their way through school?  Yeah, I painted furniture. I remember I had a job painting all the chairs  in a big restaurant they had off the campus. I remember being in there  painting chairs when everybody else was having a big time, laughing  and going on. I was there painting those chairs.  (Laughs) So you   re painting when everyone else is having a good time.  We talked about the jobs you had and so on, but you graduated in spring  of 1933?  Yeah.  And so you had a teaching certificate along with your T and I; is that  what you taught in high school? You taught in high school a few years  and coached wrestling some as well?  Yeah.  What were some of the schools that you taught at?  Hochatown.  So you went back to your hometown?  Yeah. And taught at Norman one year where I inherited the best  26  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  wrestling team in the state. We won the state championship; wasn   t my  fault though.  In Norman? Well you can take a little bit of credit, at least you didn   t  mess it up, right? (Laughter)  I remember we rode over to Hobart in an open truck. The football coach  there got all the money, and we just had to do the best we could. Snarter  Lester, did you ever hear of him?  I don   t think so.  He thought all the money ought to go to football. We didn   t get hardly  anything. It   s mostly on our own. We won that Hobart tournament.  You won the state championship then?  Yeah.  That   s great. So Hochatown, Norman, you went out to the Panhandle  then after that?  Yeah. Taught school at Goodwell, Oklahoma for let   s see from    36 to     two years I guess out there. And then I went to Anadarko.  So now you were there in the Dust Bowl days.  Yeah.  Can you tell a little bit     Yeah, we had to wear sacks over our heads to keep the dirt out of our  mouths.  Have a wet cloth in front of your face sometimes.  I remember one time we swept off about 30 pounds of dust off our living  room floor.  Wow. Because of those jobs did you have like some milk cows and some  animals?  Not out there, no.  Because I know it   s pretty hard sometimes for them to even find forage  wasn   t it because of all the sand?  27  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Yeah.  Do you remember some of the blackouts then from the blizzards, not  blizzards from the sandstorms?  Oh, they were really black. Tumbleweeds would get in the fences, then  the dust would cover the fences up.  So you actually lived the Dust Bowl days truly then out there?  Yeah.  So you got out of there as quick as you could after a couple of years?  Yeah, I got the hay fever out there.  And then to Anadarko then from there.  Taught there for a year.  Did you wrestle also? Were you a wrestling coach there also?  Oh, we had a team one year, but we didn   t stay with it. I remember  making a big walnut desk for the junior high principal there in the shop.  One of these big desks.  You were pretty impressed with that, huh?  Uh-huh.  You taught woodworking classes and so on, what kinds of things would  you make as your projects working with the students? Desks and other  things?  Yeah and little trinkets. I made that desk there. And that cabinet in there.  Is that something you still do as a hobby later in life after you quit  teaching?  Yeah, I moved to Lawton, I had a workshop in the back.  Now when you left Anadarko did you come back to A M to get your  master   s degree, is that correct?   No, I received my master   s in 1940.   28  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Now then after you got your degree, did you go back into teaching for  awhile? What year did you start with vocation rehabilitation?  I started teaching shop and science in Anadarko. And then I started in  rehabilitation in 1944. Had fourteen counties.  When did you move to Lawton then?  1944.  What was the connection that you went from teaching in high school to  working in vocational rehabilitation services?  Well, all of this was with handicapped people.  I mean how did you get the job? Did you know someone or just apply for  an opening for the position? How did you get a position in vocation  rehabilitation?  I just applied for a job. The high school principal where I was teaching  applied for it too. He even hauled me back and forth to Lawton awhile  before I moved down there.  So that was 1944?  Yeah.  And you said you had several counties around that you worked with?  Yeah, fourteen counties. At the last job, I had one county. They kept  adding counselors. At one time they only had two counselors for the  whole state.  Could you describe a little about your job? What you did in that  position?  We   d interview people according to their handicaps and send them to  college and try to get them into the work that their handicap wouldn   t be  too much of a drawback. We trained barbers and nearly everything.  So a lot of those used to be called area vo-tech schools, I guess they   re  career tech centers now. Did they still have some of those, I mean did  they go to some of those kinds of centers also for training?  I didn   t     29  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Most of yours went to colleges for the training?  Yeah.  That had to be pretty rewarding over the years. So you   re helping people  get educated and then did you help them find jobs as well as part of the  program?  We even paid for physical restoration too. If they needed surgery or  some other type work, we tried to help them get into it.  So this was under the Department of Human Services?  Yeah.  Under Mr. Rader, Lloyd Rader   s program?  Yeah.  Well, there   s got to be some special memories and moments that you  have that stand out in your mind, and you were like 39 years in vocation  rehabilitation. I mean that   s a long time.  Every once and a while, I   d meet somebody that I   d forgotten all about.     You helped me go through college    or    You helped me get a job.    And  I   d even forgotten about them. After 39 years, there   s a lot of people go  through your hands.  When you were out working in those fourteen counties, how did you  identify and find the people to help?  The county superintendents helped and they referred people. I   d go to all  the high schools and find handicapped people and put on programs to let  them know what the program was like.  What kinds of handicaps were you usually working with?  Everything from asthma on down and on up. Some that couldn   t walk. I  had one client with both hands off.  Wow.  He managed to do things.  So you worked with him, helping him get materials and equipment and  wheelchairs and different things, and help get educational training?  30  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Yeah.  And then did you also help them with the placement and help find jobs  for them too?  Yeah.  That had to be a very rewarding career to do 39 years of that. Does it  bring you some special satisfaction and pride that you were able to help  hundreds, maybe literally thousands of people in your lifetime?  Oh, yeah. On the job trainings, we trained a lot of them, typewriter  mechanics and stuff like that.  That   s got to be pretty special. Is there a special person or two that  stand out that you remember that went on and really achieved something  significant with their life that you helped, you   d changed their life for the  better? Some names you might recall?  There   s a Perkins boy here, I can   t remember his first name. And then  had a boy by the name of Joe B. Reeves. He   s an attorney. Helped him  through college, just paid his tuition. Some of them we even paid some  maintenance for them, board and room. But they had to really have to  have it. We   d have to take an inventory of what they had and what they  needed.  To change the subject a minute, you   re a life member of the OSU Alumni  Association?  Yeah.  And we   re proud that you are. So you   ve been associated with the  University for many, many years, of course going back to the thirtie s.  Do you remember some of the people, like A.O. Martin in the Former  Student Association?  Yeah.  What was Archie or I guess A.O. as they called him, what was he like?  Did you ever work with him doing some things here in the Lawton area?  No, not much. H.G. Bennett would come out to our alumni programs  and make speeches.  So you had an active club here in Lawton at the time?  31  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Yeah.  Did you participate in those? Were you an officer in the club and  helping out some?  Yes.  Did you go back to some of the class reunions? The class reunions used  to be a really big deal with the Alumni Association and the University.  Did you participate in any of the class reunions?  No, I never did.  Go back to Homecoming regularly?  Yeah.  See the parade and the house decorations?  Yeah.  Speaking of Homecoming, while you were going to school there the  house decorations weren   t really a big deal, they just maybe decorated  around the entry ways to the houses, but like we have the large house  decorations on the lawns, they didn   t have those in those days did they?  No.  What did they do there at the fraternity and sorority houses? Anything?  I don   t know.  Don   t remember? Of course, most of them at that time, they put their  time into the floats and into the parade and so on.  Yeah.  Well how about Murl Rogers, you remember Murl?  Yeah.  He was a go getter, wasn   t he?  Yeah. I just wonder if Murl is still living.  Murl is not. His wife is still there. But you went back to Stillwater a  32  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  couple of times when April and Bryant were on campus?  Yeah.  Did you ever see him do his Spirit Rider thing?  Yeah.  Did it make you pretty proud?  Yeah, he was Spirit Rider.  Rumor has it that your kids could go anywhere they wanted, but you   d  only pay their tuition at Oklahoma A M. Is that true? (Laughter) But  Gwen and Helen your two daughters both went to Oklahoma State  University and both had      I didn   t have much money. I remember for one of them I had to cancel  an insurance policy to get money enough to pay her tuition.  Oh, my gosh. That is a sacrifice. That   s great. Well I see then their two  husbands are OSU graduates and out of your four grandkids, three of  them are graduates of Oklahoma State.  Joel went to OBU  Oklahoma Baptist University  on a tennis  scholarship.  Well, that   s okay. But OSU is a tradition in your family isn   t it?  Yeah.  Through all the years, is Oklahoma State University still pretty special  to you? Have you stayed connected with your university?  I never failed to watch a game there if I can get them on TV.  What is special to you? Special moments that you   ve had with Oklahoma  State University since you   ve graduated? Things you   ve done here or  back on the campus that are special to you?  I guess having Dr. Bennett come up to our alumni meetings.  Did he remember you?  Yeah.  33  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  He didn   t forget names, did he?  No.  That   s great.  It was a terrible crash when he got killed.  It surely was. Surely was.  I don   t know how old Dr. Bennett was when he got killed. He must have  been in his 70s though.  I think he was maybe about mid-60s, somewhere in that neighborhood.  Oh, was he?  I think so. It was December of    51 when he died.  You don   t know how old he was though?  No, but I think he was right pretty close to retirement, he was around 65,  66 I believe. We were talking about you know the Alumni Association  and A.O. Martin and Murl Rogers, you knew some of those?  Will Rogers came and made a speech there one time. I remember him  walking across the campus with Dr. Bennett. He was a lot taller than  Bennett was.  One of his trips to Dean Blizzard, he was in Dean  Warren  Blizzard   s  judging team. Remember his livestock judging teams he was famous for?  Yeah.  Well, what   d you think about Will Rogers? Did you get the chance to see  him up close?  No. I just was pretty close to him. I didn   t get to shake hands with him  though.  Did he speak in Gallagher Hall? Is that where he     At the auditorium for the whole student body. In the auditorium there.  Well let me, I want to come back and ask you some of the facilities  maybe that you remember. Did they still have the cafeteria there?  34  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Yeah, there was an old cafeteria.  Two-story building there on the corner?  Yeah, close to Hanner Hall, I believe.  Just south of Hanner     Is it just west of Morrill Hall?  Just west of Morrill Hall and south of Hanner Hall.  Yeah.  On that corner, yes sir.  There wasn   t much room in there.  What do you remember about it? Did they just have long tables,  cafeteria-style?  I never did eat there much. Boy, they got a good place now.  Do you remember, let   s see the old auditorium you referred to earlier  was a pretty nice facility, wasn   t it?  Yeah. It held most of the student body.  Did you have assemblies there? You   d have class assemblies in the  auditorium?  Not often.  Were you in basic ROTC for two years?  Yeah. Two years. We called it    bull   .  Was there another name at the end of it or just bull? (Laughter) That   s  great. Of course the Student Union wasn   t there, so was there a hangout  on campus where you   d go to get milk or coffee or something?  Swim   s.  You could just go to Swim   s?  Before Eskimo Joe   s.  35  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Right. Well how about, was the Dairy Building there then? They used to  serve milk at the Dairy Building.  Yeah.  Were they serving then back in the thirties?  Yeah.  Did you have a favorite building on campus that you enjoyed more than  any others?  Engineering building, I guess.  Then let   s see, you said you worked in the library, was the library just  south from Gunderson Hall? Is that where the library was located,  across from the president   s home?  Yeah.  The old library that   s torn down now.  Yeah, I don   t know what part of the Student Union   s in there now, I  guess. It was right where the Student Union building is, wasn   t it?  Right. Well, kind of going back to maybe some of our alumni  conversation, Floyd, a little bit earlier, in your mind is it important for  alumni to stay connected to the University?  Yeah, they ought to.  They ought to be a member of the Alumni Association?  Yeah, everybody ought to.  You had a local club here and you told me about Dr. Bennett coming to  visit you, what are some of the things they ask you to do as a club for the  university? Did you help recruit students, did you help provide  scholarships for students?  Yeah, tried to get as many to go up and visit the campus as we could.  Try to get them enrolled.  Did you ever help visit any of the students in the high schools to talk to  them about OSU?  36  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Yeah.  Some alumni would come and they   d have like a college day or college  night and talk to them?  Yeah.  In your mind, how has OSU changed over the years? I mean physically  obviously it   s changed.  It   s gotten bigger. Bigger and better.  (Laughs) Well, is that good, to get bigger?  Yeah. Don   t get too big.  How have students changed in your mind? I mean you   ve seen your  daughters go there.  Hadn   t changed too much, I don   t think.  What do you remember about OSU or A M that   s special to you,  Floyd? Have you got a special place in your heart for any of them?  It   s special to go back or see the athletic events on TV. That   s the most  special thing now to me.  You said earlier in your career you went back to OSU campus a lot to  watch athletic and football games     Not too much. Mostly on TV.  Mostly on TV, okay. Looking back, if you could give any advice to  current faculty or students at OSU, what would that advice be? What  would you tell them?  Study hard and don   t overdo it. Don   t overload yourself. You can get too  many activities I think. That   s a detriment to your studies. But  extracurricular activities are one of the important things though.  And not to work as many hours as you did?  No.  You didn   t need your advice about overload?  37  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Need more hours to study.  Any particular part of the university that you   ve supported over the  years that you   ve been close to? I mean they don   t have the Trade    Industrial program any more, but is there any part of the university     I support the Foundation, give money to the Foundation. Though it   s not  very much.  Have you supported scholarship programs? Or what kinds of things  have you supported financially over the years?  Just to the Foundation.  Kind of going back, you were at a unique time at Oklahoma State, at  Oklahoma A M then, as we mentioned earlier, because you got there  just before the stock market crashed, just before the Depression, just  when Dr. Bennett got there. Did you notice a change while you were  there and the few years after you left? There were some pretty  significant changes. What do you remember that changed most about  OSU?  Well, I remember that a little later on, people seemed to have more  money, more help from home. Depression days people couldn   t help  their kids much.  Right. Kind of had to, like you did, sort of go it on your own?  Yeah.  Floyd, looking back, you know 100 years is a pretty significant milestone  and again, I want to end where I started and congratulate you on your  hundredth birthday, because it   s pretty special. What moments in your  life have been important to you? There are some key events, I mean  certainly you got married and I   m sure when you had your kids, but  what things stand out in your lifetime that are special memories, special  moments for you?  I believe in church work. And helping the great-grandkids, of course. I  try to give my great-grandkids money on their birthdays, all of them.  Tell them to try to save up for college.  So your family   s very important to you obviously. Your church is very  important to you.  Yeah. Family.  38  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Wood  Gill  Have you maintained over the years any connections at all, I know it   s  been several years now, but with rehabilitative services, some of the  people you worked with?  Yeah, I got a good friend here in Lawton that was my supervisor, still  living here in Lawton. I don   t ever get up to their meetings. There   s a  blind man that I think his mother shot him. He   s a counselor for rehab,  lives here in Lawton, works for services for the blind.  Floyd, if you had a chance to be on TV with Willard Scott, live, and they  asked you this question out to all of America, what advice would you  give to people that throughout their life   you   ve seen a lot of life   what  would be important in their lives?  Work hard and tend to your own business.  (Laughs) That   d be a good one.  Stay away from wild women.  (Laughter) That   s great. Well have we left anything out, Floyd? I   m  really particularly interested in your memories of early in your life, that  time at Oklahoma State. We don   t have very many people around who  remember Oklahoma State/Oklahoma A M in 1928 like you do. But is  there anything we didn   t talk about at A M at that time that you   d like  to share that you   ve thought about since?  It   s a good place to go to work your way through school. I never did fail  to have some kind of work to do. And that   s the only way I could go.  Didn   t get any help from home.  I heard that Dr. Bennett was very good to the whole school really to  create opportunities for students to work, and put them to work if they  wanted to.  Yeah, he   s the one that got that broom factory started. And his idea of  making furniture for the auditoriums instead of having to buy it, give the  students jobs instead of buying furniture outside. It was all good hard  wood furniture, most of it.  From our conversation I picked up he was a pretty strong influence on  your life then?  Yeah.  Well unless there   s anything else     39  Wood  Gill  Wood  You know he was a   even the governors went to him for advice. He  was a politician, really a statesman instead of a politician.  I understand he was pretty good. Floyd, I sure appreciate it and think  that   ll conclude our interview unless you   ve got something else.  Thanks.  -------  -------
