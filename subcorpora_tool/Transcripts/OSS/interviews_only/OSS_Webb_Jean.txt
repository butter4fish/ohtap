 Larson  Webb  Today is January 8, 2010. My name is Mary Larson, and we   re here  with Jean Webb to talk about her family   s involvement with the Ethiopia  project at OSU. Thank you so much for being here today. We really  appreciate it.  You   re welcome.  I   d like to start just by getting some general biographical information  from you. Could you tell me a little bit about your family or where you  were raised?  My dad was a farmer. He rented farmland, so we moved around a lot   when I was  a child. Then we settled in Custer County around Custer  City, and he worked for my brother-in-law for some years, helping him  on the farm and building fences or whatever needed to be done. He was  going to work one day and was hit by a pickup, the broad side of a  pickup, and he was thrown out of the car. He was unconscious for about  a week before he passed away. So, then Mother and I were the only ones  at home at that time, and we moved down closer to my sister and her  husband. They had a house that was just about a quarter of a mile from  them that we moved into.  How old were you when that happened?  I was a junior in high school at that time. And of course World War II  was still going on, and all four of my brothers were in the service, three  in the Navy and one in the Air Force. The two in the Navy were on ships  and participated in the war pretty heavily. The oldest brother was getting  discharged, and he didn   t get the message before he got home that our  Dad was gone, so that was pretty hard on him. The rest of the family   I  had two sisters and four brothers, but I   m the youngest of all of them, so  they were all gone from home when I was in high school.  5  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  So, once you graduated high school, how did you end up at Oklahoma  A M?  Well, first I went to work in the Oklahoma Farmers Union  in Oklahoma  City . Bill and I broke up for about a year, and then we got back  together. I guess I worked at the Farmers Union two or three years, and  then we got married and moved to Stillwater. He was in school at  Stillwater at that time. I went to college for one semester, and then I  became pregnant and stayed home from then on with the baby, and until  my youngest child went to kindergarten   of course, this was after we  went to Ethiopia, so maybe I   m getting ahead of myself here.  I realized I skipped over your Kansas State University  experience . I  went straight to OSU. So, can you tell me a little bit about what you did  after high school, and we   ll just go from there?  Okay. I worked in the accounting department at Farmers Union, and  then we got married, and after Bill finished his bachelor   s degree at  Oklahoma State, (I had gone just one semester) we went back to the  farm near his parents and farmed for about three years, I guess.  And where was that?  That was in Custer County, near Custer City, about three miles. Bill   s  last year of college, we had a baby boy. Then after we moved to the  farm, we had a little baby girl. Then we got the opportunity, if you can  call it that, to go to Ethiopia working for two years, and then we were  allowed to come back home for a three-month leave and then go back  for two more years.  I guess before we get into that, can you talk a little bit about how you  and your husband met?  Well, we met on a junior-senior trip. I was a senior. We knew each other  before that, but not real well.  And this was in high school?  This was in high school. We went on junior-senior trip, and I was a  senior and he was a junior. There was a single male teacher with us, and  as we got to Juarez, the teacher told Bill,    If you   ll take Jean to the  movie, I   ll take Irene,    which was my best friend. So, we all agreed on  that, but when we got there, some of the boys went into town more than  where we were and said it wasn   t safe to go there. So, we didn   t do  anything. We didn   t go to the movie that night, but then on that same  trip we went on to White Sands, New Mexico, and we were there about  6  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  three days, I believe. So, we took walks out in the white sand and got to  know each other better.  And the rest is history.  The rest is history.  When you folks first got to Stillwater, where did you live?  We lived in a little apartment house on Knoblock, just across the street  from the auditorium, I believe it was. I   m not sure what that building is.  I think that   s where it was. That   s when I went to one semester of school  in college.  What was your interest?  At that time it was home economics, but then I didn   t go for quite a  number of years, and my interests changed.  We had started on how you got to Ethiopia just a few minutes ago, so  why don   t you talk a little bit about how the two of you ended up going  to Ethiopia.  Well, we had gone to the farm, and there was a drought and our crops  were not making, and the sand bowl time, sort of   not like the big sand  bowl that the storms were just continuous for days. That was way back  when I was a child, in grade school.  Did you see much of that when you were younger?  Yes, because we were going to a little country school and had to walk to  and from school about a mile or so. We had to walk home with that Dust  Bowl just blowing. You couldn   t hardly see anything.  Is this when you were in Custer County when you were younger?  I was near Butler, Oklahoma.  So, this was back in the early    50s, then?  That was back in probably the late    30s.  Right, but when you and your husband went back and were farming for  those three years.  Oh yes, that was   we got married in 1950, and he was in school for two  7  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  more years, and then we went to the farm in    52, I guess. Bill and a  friend of ours heard about the opportunity to go to Ethiopia, so they  went one day to interview, and a little later the guys called from  Stillwater and wanted to come out and visit with us. So, they came out,  and I cooked lunch for them, and after that we sat and visited. After they  left, I just kind of sat down and relaxed and thought,    Oh well, that   s  probably the end of that.    (Laughter) And then the next thing we knew,  they called us to come to Stillwater, and we agreed to go at that time. So,  we had to start getting passports and all of that. I cried all the next day,  because we decided to go. (Laughs) I didn   t want to leave, because my  mother lived out in that area and his parents   all of our family was out  there. So, anyway, we got through all of that, and we took two kids with  us and brought five back home. (Laughter) Three of them were boys,  and then Bill came back to Oklahoma State and worked on his master   s,  and we had another baby girl then. So, that made our sixth one. Then we  went after he finished his coursework out to the research station, and he  finished writing his master   s dissertation down there, and it took him  three years to get it done. So, when he decided to go get a doctorate, I  said,    You   re not leaving until you get that written and turned in and  finished up.    So, he got busy and did that in about three and a half years.  (Laughs)  So, when you went to Ethiopia, what years would that have been?  That would have been in    56 to... No, must have been    54, around that  time.    52 or    54.  And how many years were you there?  We were there four years. We got to come home at the end of two years,  and then we went back.  Who arranged for you to go, and what was that process like of getting  ready?  Bill Abbott was the director of all of this, so his office made all of the  arrangements: flight, all that type of thing. We had to pack and take what  we wanted. I mean, we didn   t have to pack. We just had to gather it up,  and then they put all of our other things in storage until we came back to  stay.  What sorts of things did you have to take with you versus what you could  get when you were there?  We took quite a few groceries, but they also had a PX  Post Exchange   when we got there, and we could also order things by the case sent in if  8  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  we couldn   t get it at the PX, or we did that anyway just to start with  before we realized we could get so much at the PX.  You said you had two children when you went. Did the whole family  travel together when you first went over?  Yes.  So, your husband didn   t go ahead. You all went at the same time.  No, we all went at the same time.  Where were you assigned?  To Addis Ababa to start with.  What was your husband   s assignment there?  He was in charge of the research stations at Bishoftu.  And how long were you in Addis Ababa?  We were there less than a year. Then we moved to Debre Zeyit, or  Bishoftu. The emperor had a castle down there on the lake also, but they  rented a house from the Swedish Air Force for us to live in, and we  stayed there for probably a couple of years, and then they moved us back  into Addis because the Swedish Air Force wanted their house back. So,  we moved back to Addis for the remainder of the time.  So, when you were in Addis, what was the size of the city?  It was pretty large. It was quite large. The steering wheel was on the  right-hand side of the vehicles; they drove like the English, on the wrong  side of the road. (Laughs)  That must have been something to get used to.  Yes, it was.  What kinds of stores and facilities did they have?  Well, they had fabric stores and grocery stores, hotels and bookstores  and all kinds   just about anything like that.  Because it was a larger city?  9  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  It was.  And were you right in the city center, or were you on the edges of town?  We were kind of out   well, there was a shopping mall just close to us  with a hotel there and other stores, so we were kind of on more of the  edge. We were within sight of the emperor   s Jubilee Palace. We would  quite often see him out driving around. That was exciting.  What was your housing like in Addis?  It was modern. The water was stored in a container on the roof for the  gravity to let it get through the faucets and all for pressure. It was heated  water, hot and cold water.  Did you have a house or an apartment?  It was a house.  And how many rooms? What was the layout?  Well, we lived in four different houses in Addis. When we first moved  back from Bishoftu, they put us in a house that somebody else had been  in, and they were going to have us live there, but as we were moving in,  the land owner came in and said that we couldn   t move in. We didn   t  have that rented. So, we only stayed there a few days, and while we were  there, there was a big flight of termites that came in. They were huge,  and they lost their wings in the house in the bathroom and just about  stopped up all of the plumbing with those bunches of wings. So, that was  kind of a traumatic experience. (Laughs) Rick was born by the time we  moved back in, so we had a new baby and then the two other children     And a flight of termites. (Laughs)  A flight of termites and we couldn   t unpack anything because we  weren   t going to be there very long. They found us another house.  Was the termite incident common?  I don   t know. I think probably it must have been. It   s the only time we  ever had any experience with them.  When you first went to Addis, what was your housing like then?  They put us up in a hotel for awhile until a house became empty that  another family was living in that was coming home. We about froze to  10  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  death in the hotel in the middle of August, so the kids and I sat around in  our coats all the time.  Was that the chilly season?  Apparently so. And, of course, we had left Oklahoma in about 112  degrees temperature, and we weren   t ready for that kind of cold yet.  So, it was about August of that year that you went out.  Yes.  Were there any surprises with the living conditions, besides the  termites? (Laughter)  Well, that was after we moved back from Bishoftu, but   well, it was  hard to get used to the people coming around selling eggs and live  chickens and going to the meat market, and the meat was just hanging  up there in carcasses, and you picked what cut you wanted, and they  would cut it for you and fix it all up and bundle it up. Of course, flies  were all over the place, and I finally got used to that.  So, grocery shopping was definitely a different experience.  The meat shopping, anyway.  Were you in a neighborhood that had a lot of folks from the U.S., or was  there an area where a lot of the people lived that were working in Addis,  or was it a mixed neighborhood?  Just a mixed  neighborhood  that we lived in.  And who owned the housing?  The Ethiopians, I think. The university rented them.  What were some of the challenges in keeping a house going?  Well, we had a cook. We were expected to have servants, so we had a  cook and a mumiti that helped take care of the children.  A mumiti?  I don   t have any idea how you spell it. (Laughs)  Sort of a nanny?  11  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Kind of a nanny and she also did the housework.  So, that took some stress off.  Yes.  Could you walk us through what your normal day would have been  when you lived in Addis?  We had to have a night guard also, and the first few nights we were  sleeping there, in the middle of the night he would start singing. It scared  us to death, because we didn   t know what was going on, and we finally  found out what it was, so then it was okay.  So, he was just sort of like playing the radio to keep himself awake?  I guess, but it woke us up at first until we got used to it. Janette got flea  bites really bad. She had a ring around her waist of red bumps where the  fleas had bitten her. The thing is she was more allergic to them than the  rest of us were.  How old was she at the time?  She had her second birthday after we got there. That would have been in  November.  And your son was how old?  He was almost three.  Okay, so, at the time, a two-year-old and almost a three-year-old.  Yes.  You mentioned having a night guard. Was that common?  Yes, it was. In fact, you had a night guard and a day guard.  Was that just for     Keeping people from   we lived in a compound. Our house was  enclosed within fence, but people would still sneak in at night and steal  things, even with the guard there sometimes.  Was that something that Ethiopians had, too, or was it just something  they did for people who came in from outside of the country?  12  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  For the Americans, anyway. I don   t know about the Ethiopians. They  lived in little huts and probably pretty close together, so I don   t know if  they had guards or not.  So, back to an average day. What would that be like?  Well, the cook would come fix breakfast for us, and we just did  whatever we wanted to most of the time, because once you got one  trained to do what you wanted, then we really didn   t have any duties as  far as keeping house. I usually took care of the children unless I needed  to go someplace.  Was there an American school there, or did you   well, they were two  and three, so you wouldn   t have had to homeschool them. They still  would have been too young.  No, no they didn   t. There was an American school. I guess the American  military had it, and they let us send our children there.  Once they got a little older?  Yes. They had a bus. Somebody would drive a bus and pick up the  kiddos, usually some of our group.  So, when the children were younger, during the day would you all go out  and investigate different places?  One of the ladies that was with the American group had a playschool, so  we took Ted to the playschool, and he enjoyed that. We took Jeanette,  but she was about three years old, and she did not like it. She cried the  whole time she was there, (Laughter) so I just took her out of it because  I didn   t want her doing that every day. She would either play at home  with the servants or go wherever I went.  Did your typical schedule change much according to seasons?  No, because there wasn   t much change of seasons there. They had a  small rainy season and a large rainy season, and it wasn   t raining all the  time, but you might be out shopping, and just all of a sudden a cloud  burst would come along and last a little while, and then it was over.  So, how did the living situation differ when you went out to Bishoftu?  It was pretty much the same. Let   s see. We took our mumiti with us. She  moved down there with us, and I think maybe we had a cook for a while,  and then she became the cook and did housework, too.  13  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  How far was Bishoftu from Addis?  It was about an hour   s drive, and the roads were blacktop, so they  weren   t bad. You just had to watch out for the camels, donkeys, and  cows running. One time as I was going home from Addis, we had a  Volkswagen bug, and this big old oxen hopped down out of some trees  and ran across in front of me, kind of laid down on the hood of the car,  and then got up and ran on, and I ran on home. Didn   t do that much  damage.  You   re lucky if it was a Volkswagen. The engine was in the back   Probably lucky for you and the oxen.  Right.  So, you could travel back and forth to Addis whenever you needed  supplies or something.  Yes. We had to go there for supplies and for the doctor and shopping,  mostly. I   m not sure there were any shops in Bishoftu. I never really did  go into Bishoftu to shop.  How large was Bishoftu?  Just a small Swedish Army settlement, I think, was there.  So, it wasn   t a local village so much as     Well, I think it was. It did have a lot of local people, and we had some  American missionaries that were about a mile or two from us, and so we  visited with them a lot.  Do you remember which group they were from?  They were with the SIM, Sudan Interior Mission. This couple was at  what they call the rest home for the missionaries to come on vacation  and stay there, and there was a crater lake right there by it.  That must have been very pretty.  It was very pretty. They were very nice, and we enjoyed visiting with  them.  So, what was your husband doing that was different when you were out  at Bishoftu?  14  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  The same thing because he had been driving down there. He had been  commuting.  Oh, okay. So, there was the extension station.  A research station.  Now, you had mentioned going into Addis for supplies and groceries  and medical care. I understand that you had three of your children while  you were in Ethiopia.  First two years, we just had one. (Laughter) We brought him home on  home leave.  What are the medical facilities like in Addis?  We used the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital. They had American-trained  doctors or American doctors, and so that   s what we used.  So, would it have been the same as in any big city?  Except at the hospital they didn   t serve meat. They had a special diet.  One time I thought I was getting a hamburger patty and it turned out to  be a soybean patty. (Laughs) So, that was a disappointment.  So, for any family doctor appointments, you would just drive into Addis.  Yes.  Now, I want to try and get an idea of who your neighbors were. You  mentioned when you were in Bishoftu, you had the missionaries and the  Swedish Air Force Base.  A Swedish Air Force family was just next door, and we were hoping that  Ted would learn Swedish, but instead they learned American from him.  Did the kids learn Amharic?  They did, some, from the servants. In fact, the first time we went to  Jimma to visit the college people down there, they took us to lunch to eat  the native food, which was injera and wat. So, we were sitting there  waiting for them to show us how to eat it. I looked over at Jeanette, and  she was just going to town with it. (Laughter)  She understood it already.  15  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  She had been eating with the servants. There were servants    quarters in  the back behind our house, so she had been out there eating with them,  which we didn   t know, (Laughs) and she knew exactly how to eat that.  So, when you had the cook, were they mainly cooking American-style  food?  Yes, they cooked American for us.  Up until you went to Jimma, had you had any experience with the local  Ethiopians?  No. We went there not too long after we got to Ethiopia. We had some  friends that we met just before we went over that were friends of our  friends. We met them at our friends    house. They were mutual friends,  too.  I understand there was quite an OSU alumni contingent involved with  the Ethiopia project. I mean, so many OSU alums.  Right, there were.  Were there any folks you knew right in the area that you were staying,  either in Addis or down at Bishoftu?  The last place we lived in Addis, there was a German couple next door  to us in an apartment, and we got to know them a little bit. They had a  little baby boy, or I don   t know. He was still sleeping in a crib. Probably  about a year old.  Now, you mentioned that your children   I guess Jeannette was playing  with the servants?  She was just home playing, and they were watching her.  Right. And you had said that your son Ted had gone to playschool.  Yes, the pre-school.  And in Bishoftu, he was the one teaching English to the kids over in the  Swedish compound?  Yes. (Laughs)  As they got older, did they find friends as you moved around?  16  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Not so much around where we lived, but in school. He went to the  American school when he was old enough, so he had friends there.  Was Jeanette old enough to go into school while you were there?  No, I don   t believe she was in school yet. I think she started after we got  back.  And then the three who were born over there, can you give me a little  chronology on when they appeared on the scene throughout your time  here?  Okay, Rick was born in    57, and then Rod was born two years later.  That   d be    59. And then Danny was born about a year later, so in    60.  Rod was a preemie, so he was in the hospital for about a month before  he got to come home.  Were you still in Addis at the time?  Yes.  So, that didn   t pose any problems with having to go back and forth.  No. We weren   t very far from it. It was just touch and go for him, but he  made it. They had an incubator, and were able to take care of him.  So, did you have a lot of interaction with other folks there? You  mentioned some of the folks you knew in Addis, and then down in  Bishoftu you had the Swedish Air Force and the missionaries. Did you  get to know any of the locals or any other families around there?  Not the locals, but other missionaries in Addis. There was a Presbyterian  missionary that we really became attached to. He was out away from  Addis, but he would have to come in every so often to meetings and  such to their headquarters.  Do you remember his name?  Don McClure. He had gone over as a young man and then just kept  going back, and he married, and his wife   they both were over there  working as missionaries, and they had two daughters and a son, I  believe. And, unfortunately, as they were getting ready to retire and  come home, Don was still out in the mission station, and somebody  came through and was burglarizing them, and they shot him and he was  killed, and his son was there and watched it and then another man. They  escaped, but Don was killed instantly. So, they buried him under a tree  17  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  there.  Were there a lot of fears of things like that where you were in Addis or  down in Bishoftu?  No, not really. I don   t know. He was just out in the boonies in a mission  station, and he had been there, well, ever since he was a young man.  Maybe as a student, he went over to start with. They would get a station  going, and then they would go on down river, down the Nile, and start  another one. And many times, his wife Lyda would take some men with  her and go down the river in a boat or walking to the next point where  they were going to build a station, just she and a couple of men maybe, a  couple of natives.  Go down to find the next spot.  Yes. They were really very special friends.  Did you stay in touch with the other missionaries that you met down  there?  We did.  What were their names?  The Pittmans, Keith and Betty Pittman, ran the SIM Mission Rest Home,  and we kept in touch with them. In fact, we went to Oregon to see them  a time or two, and we kept in touch as much as we could with Lyda after  she came back.  Is there anybody else that you stayed in contact with over the years?  Well, there   s an airline pilot that we kind of kept aware of where they  were. As we were coming home, he flew us out of Ethiopia.  And what was his name?  Len Tuw. We visited with them quite a lot before they left.  Were there other groups of folks that you socialized with?  Well, just some of our own group from OSU that we knew.  How often did you see other OSU folks when you were there?  Oh, probably every few days, some of them.  18  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  So, were you the lone family for the project at the extension station down  at Bishoftu?  Yes.  But there would be people coming and going.  Some would, especially men, just coming to the research station.  What parts of the assignment to Ethiopia were the most difficult for you?  Just being so far away and having that many babies. Of course, I guess it  was a good time, because I had a lot of help (Laughter) taking care of  them.  How hard was it to get news from home?  We wrote. We didn   t ever try   I think we could have called on the  phone, but it was hard to hear at all, so we figured if we called we   d be  crying all the time. So, there wasn   t any point in doing that.  Do you remember how long it took mail?  Probably about a week. We sent these little APO letters that you fold up.  The envelope and all is one thing.  Right. I haven   t seen those in a while.  I haven   t either. (Laughs)  What did you enjoy the most?  Oh, just having the freedom to sew a lot. I sewed a lot and just doing  various hobbies.  What other hobbies did you have?  It was mainly sewing.  In terms of making clothes, or did you do needle work?  I made clothes for the kiddos.  Which would have kept you busy, just with that. That   s why you knew  where the fabric store was. (Laughs)  19  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Right.  It sounds like while you were in Ethiopia, the cooks were cooking  American-style meals for you. So, did you celebrate all the usual  American holidays when you were over there?  Yes, we tried to.  How were they different over there from trying to celebrate at home?  Well, one thing, you didn   t have the regular Christmas trees, and they  advised us not to because some of the Ethiopians worshiped trees. So,  we didn   t want to make them think that we worshipped trees. Then one  Christmas in particular, when Rick was just a baby, Ted got up early  before anybody else got up, and all of a sudden I heard paper rattling,  and I got up, and he was just opening up all of the packages as he came  to them. If they weren   t for him then he   d just toss them aside  unwrapped and on the floor. Then a little later, that same Christmas, we  had gotten Jeanette a little iron that really worked. Well, she plugged it  into the transformer at the wrong place, and it burned the cord.  Oh, no   And smoke was going every place. I think that was the time that I forgot  to put the turkey in the oven and turn it on. (Laughter)  So, you could get turkeys. There was no problem getting turkeys.  We did get turkeys.  Were they your standard?  I don   t remember where we got those. It could be that Bill shot them,  because when we lived at Bishoftu, we lived on a lot of the meat that he  would hunt.  Were you using anything that was grown at the station, or was he  hunting for things?  He would go hunting for meat. We would have wild boar, pheasants, and  gazelle. So, it was very good food. Guineas, they had light meat. They  didn   t all have dark meat like American guineas.  Out of all of the wild game, what was your favorite?  Probably the quail, because it was just like fried chicken and it was  20  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  really very good.  Now, you kept up American traditions. Were there any Ethiopian  traditions or Swedish traditions that you picked up while you were down  there?  No, we weren   t that close to the Swedish neighbors. I don   t think we ate  with them; I can   t remember that we did.  And no Ethiopian traditions that you     Well, Bill would go to the station with the natives in Bishoftu, with the  guys that were working for him, and he   d eat Ethiopian food quite  regularly.  Was there anything that he particularly liked that you remember?  I think he liked it all. (Laughter)  And you said pretty much the main time you had it was down in Jimma?  Yes.  And what did that consist of?  It was kind of like a stew. They put vegetables in it, boiled eggs and  chicken. Boiled the chicken, and put bones and all, and then used a lot of  hot spices.  And what was that called?  Wat. Chicken wat or vegetable wat and various kinds that they had.  How long did it take for you to feel that you   d gotten acclimated in  Ethiopia, or did you ever feel like you really got acclimated there?  Yes, it wasn   t too long as far as the climate goes. When we lived in  Addis, it   s a high altitude, and it would be hot if you were out in the sun,  but in the shade is just real pleasant, so it wasn   t ever really, really cold.  So, it was, perhaps, similar to what you   d be used to in Oklahoma?  It wasn   t as cold and windy as it is in Oklahoma.  And it probably wasn   t that different in Bishoftu, or was it lower  altitude?  21  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  No, it was probably a little bit lower altitude, probably a little warmer in  Bishoftu.  Do you remember what the altitudes were?  I think Addis was 8,000 feet, I believe.  That is good altitude. (Laughs)  It was quite up the mountain.  And Bishoftu was     Down in a valley.  Now, how about culturally? How long did it take you to feel acclimated  in that regard?  Well, I never did learn to speak their language very much. Just a few  words, but they could speak English. So, that wasn   t absolutely  necessary.  And you said that the kids had learned a little bit of Amharic?  I think they did.  Just picked it up? Do you know if they remember any of it?  I doubt that they do. I haven   t asked them, but I don   t think they do.  Something that if you aren   t using it     Yes.  Were there any political tensions or problems while you were in  Ethiopia that caused problems?  There were right after we left. The army tried to take over the embassy,  and there were some bullets that entered the house that we lived in, but  luckily we weren   t there. (Laughs)  How much longer after you left was that?  It was maybe a couple of weeks.  Oh, so, right after you left. Do you remember what time of year you left?  22  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  We got home about Thanksgiving time. So, we left in November, and  we had to wait on Danny to be born and get old enough.  So, that would have been around Thanksgiving in 1960?  Yes.  Were there any other local political things going on that you remember?  Not that I am aware of. One highlight that happened while we were  there, we lived real close to the soccer field, and Billy Graham came  over and had his program at the soccer field. So, we just walked from  our house down to listen to him, and it just started pouring down rain  while he was there, but everybody just sat there (Laughs) and waited  until it stopped and listened to him.  Do you remember what kind of a crowd he had?  They had a pretty good crowd. We were just out in the open and had just  fold-up chairs to sit in.  And a lot of folks came out? Do you remember when that would have  been?  A lot of Ethiopian folks.  Was that early on in your stay there, or was that towards the end?  No, it was the second tour, because it was the last house we lived in was  right there close.  Did you have an easy time getting news not just from family, but just  general news from the U.S. or world news?  I think we had a radio, but I   m not sure how much news we got on it.  I was just wondering if there were things that you remembered  happening when you were there that were notable.  Well, when we came home on home leave, we were traveling with  another family, and when we landed in the Holy Lands, the Marines  landed in Beirut during that conflict, and they closed the airport right  after we landed in Jerusalem.  So, that was your route on the way home was going through     23  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Yes. We had already arranged for a guide to take us around and to show  us things. He was able to do that, but he warned us about getting out or  saying anything about politics or discussing anything. So, we didn   t get  out except when he took us places. Then we left there to go into Israel.  This was in Jordan that we first landed. We had to walk across No  Man   s Land. A taxi could take us up so far, and then we had to get a  different taxi on the other side. So, we had to walk and carry all of our  luggage across No Man   s Land.  How far was that?  Oh, it was probably about a block or maybe a little bit more. We could  look up into the buildings, and they had sandbags in the windows and  guns pointing at us (Laughs), so we didn   t make a   I said,    Don   t ever  turn your back. Just keep walking      Just keep moving. So, that was the border at that point.  Yes. And there was that much No Man   s Land keeping them separated, I  guess.  And that would have been around    59 that you went?     58. Two years later.  How much time did you spend in that area before you went home?  I think we spent about three days in Jordan and about the same in Israel,  and then we went to Europe, to Brussels, to the World   s Fair in Brussels.  We ate a lot of hamburgers at the American place that they had there.  Now, I guess in terms of food, were there certain things that you really  missed? It sounds like hamburgers have come up twice.  Yes, hamburgers. We really didn   t eat out that much there. There was a  caf  , a restaurant, that opened up and had good fish and good American-type  food, so we ate there a few times, but most of the time we ate at  home.  Were there other things that you couldn   t get that you really missed?  Well, bologna was one thing I missed. I don   t know why, but I did.  (Laughs)  The ring bologna?  24  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  The big sandwich bologna.  When you were going out to Ethiopia, was that about the same time as  the Suez Canal Crisis was going on in    56?  Yes, because our sea freight had to go around to get it into Ethiopia, had  to go around the Cape, so it took longer to get there than normal.  I was thinking that might have been about the same time you were going  over.  It was.  Did that have any impact besides everything having to go the long  route?  No, it really didn   t.  What, in your opinion, just generally, was the part about living in  Ethiopia that tended to cause the most culture shock for folks from the  U.S.?  Probably the slowness of time moving. They just didn   t ever get in a  hurry.  Just a completely different  pace of life .  Right, and the stores usually would close for about two hours for noon  for lunch and nap.  How long would they stay open in the evening?  I don   t remember how late they stayed open. Probably not terribly late,  but I don   t remember.  What were some of the more pleasant surprises?  I guess just getting together with the group.  Were there a lot of other families over there that you could socialize  with?  Yes. A lot of them that we kind of knew when we were here, and then  got acquainted with a lot of others.  Did you have any record of your stay in Ethiopia? Did you keep a  25  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  diary? Did you take photos?  No, I really didn   t. Well, we did take movies, but I don   t think we   ve  watched them since. (Laughter) They aren   t really good like they are  now.  They   re home movies.  Yes, just home movies.  Did you travel around when you had free time? Did you go out and  travel around or within the country at all besides between the station  and Addis?  Well, we went to visit other   like, they had a school at Jimma, and then  there was another higher education one at another location, Dire Dawa.  So, you got to travel with those?  Yes. We flew to that because it was kind of   I don   t know if there were  good roads or not, but it was quite a distance, so we flew.  Were there different regions that you remember in Ethiopia, of the  different locations that you   ve visited, that really made them different  from each other?  Yes, like at Dire Dawa, there were basket ladies that made colorful  baskets. They were kind of known for that. And Jimma, I don   t  remember what exactly was     Was the environment, ecologically, pretty much the same? Same types of  plants and weather?  I think the weather was probably a little nicer at Jimma than it was at  Dire Dawa. I think it was a little bit more desert at Dire Dawa than  Jimma and Addis.  What would your high temperatures be? We were talking a little bit  about this earlier, but how warm did it get?  Probably in the    70s.  Okay, so pretty temperate.  Pretty, yes, it was. Now, in the evenings it would get a little chilly, and  we   d have a fireplace going.  26  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Yes, because it   s some altitude there. Did you visit any place else in  Africa besides Ethiopia while you were there?  No, we really didn   t.  And you talked a little bit about coming back for your couple-month  break between the two-year stints. What was that like coming back?  It was almost more of a culture shock than going over. It felt like we  were about forty years behind.  Did you spend a lot of time catching up with family at that point?  We did. We did quite a bit of traveling, going and coming, though,  through Europe, and then when we left, we went through Hawaii and  Hong Kong and that way. We stopped at Hong Kong and about went  broke saving money. (Laughter) We had clothes made and bought linens  and that kind of thing.  So, you got to take full advantage of the trip over and back.  Yes.  And the kids would have been old enough to remember some of that.  Some of them were.  So, Hawaii and Hong Kong on the way, and that was on the way back  out? That was on the way out for the second trip?  No, that was after we came home. We only came home once for  furlough, and then the next time we came home we pretty much came  straight home. Well, we did stop in New York and stayed with some  friends, waiting on a car to come that we had ordered to come, to have  here.  So, just to make sure I have the timeline correct, you went over on your  way back on the first furlough, you went through the Holy Land and up  through Europe to Brussels to the World   s Fair.  And we went to Scandinavia, Holland, at that time, and then when we  went back over there, we went the other way.  And then when you came home you just came directly home.  Came directly home. Except for the waiting for the shipment in New  27  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  York. New Haven, actually. Connecticut is where we went.  So, how did you keep in contact with family and friends? You said you  did a lot of letter writing?  Yes.  Did you do that on a weekly basis?  Pretty much to family. My mother, especially, and different family  members.  I guess a logistical question, I think there would have been elections in  the U.S. or Oklahoma while you were over there. Did you vote?  There probably were. No, we didn   t.  As you think back, how do you feel about your experience in Ethiopia?  Well, it was good. It brought a big change to our life as we came back,  because Dr. Pat Murphy was over there when we were, and he  encouraged Bill to come back to the department, and he helped him get a  job so he could work and get his master   s. So, that changed.  So, that led directly to grad school?  Yes.  And you mentioned some of the friendships that you   d maintained. Are  there others besides the folks you mentioned?  Oh, yes. The group that was with us from OSU at the time.  Who were some of those folks that you remember?  Oh let   s see, the Raucks, Hugh and Hazel. And, of course, Bill Abbott  would come over every once in a while, and he was always kidding me  about going back. He said,    This is your last chance to go back      (Laughter)  After four years was     It was enough for me.  Do you think your husband would have stayed?  28  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Oh, he might would have. I don   t know. I didn   t really ask him if he  wanted to stay. (Laughter)  So, what did everyone do when you returned after the second stint there?  Well, they all met us at my brother   s house here in Oklahoma City. We  were driving from New York down, and we went by to see a young man  that was a doctor that was visiting, helping. I guess he was there for a  year with the McClures at their station helping out, and actually Ted  needed a tooth pulled, so he pulled the tooth for him (Laughter) when  we were down there one time.  Do you remember his name?  Paul Bowen. We stopped by Pittsburg to see him on the way from New  York back to Oklahoma. And let   s see, the Nicholsons, Bonnie.  It sounds like your husband went to grad school once you returned. So,  he started grad school, and you had the kids to keep you busy at that  point?  Yes.  Was it a tough adjustment coming back after being gone? I realize you  were home in the middle, but you   d been uprooted for four years. Was it  hard to get back to things?  Oh, it kind of was.  What was the toughest part about that, do you think?  Trying to get settled into another house. We bought a house in Stillwater  and moved into that.  You did a lot of moving over the course of four years.  Yes, we did. (Laughs)  That   s logistically tough.  Right, it was.  And then after your husband did his master   s, where did you go?  We went to Altus to the research station down there for three and a half  years. While he was down there he had to finish his master   s thesis. He  29  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  finally got that done just before he went to start his doctorate. That   s  when I said,    You can   t leave Manhattan until you get your doctorate  written and completely finished.     So, did you have the house in Stillwater the whole time you were down in  Altus?  No, we sold it and had one built down there, and then we sold that one  after we went to Manhattan and bought one up there.  Okay, and you said you were up there for about three and a half years.  I think it was about three and a half years.  What did you all do after that?  Then we moved back to Stillwater.  And did you stay this time? (Laughs)  For thirty-three years we did this time, and then after that, we both  retired, and it was   let   s see. We retired in    95, and we moved here in     03, so we were up there for a while. It shocked our neighbors. They  didn   t like it one little bit. (Laughter) They just couldn   t understand why  we were selling the house that we raised our family in and moving to  Oklahoma City.  Was that a relief to be in one house for thirty-three years after doing so  much moving?  Well, yes it was. It was really nice to be there that long. Of course, we  were both working once we both finished school in Manhattan. I  finished up down here in medical technology. Actually, the last year, I  had to commute to the Health Science Center here in Oklahoma City to  finish my degree.  And once the last child was in kindergarten you said you started back to  school.  Started back to school in Manhattan.  So, once the kids had gotten off to school, did you use your degree?  Yes, as soon as I got it, I used my degree. I got a job and worked for  twenty years, I guess.  30  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Webb  Larson  Do you want to talk a little bit about that?  Well, I worked in three different clinic labs, and I enjoyed it very much.  What were you doing for the most part?  Drawing blood and running various tests that doctors wanted run on  patients.  Are there questions that we haven   t asked about your experiences in  Ethiopia, any stories that you wanted to share, or anything we didn   t  cover?  I can   t think of any right now.  What do you think the legacy is of the OSU/Ethiopia cooperative venture  from the    50s and    60s?  I don   t know. A lot of people still go to meetings, but we haven   t kept up  with that that much. I don   t know if you know the Evans.  Conrad and  Joy  They were over there. They stayed about ten years, I think.  And are they in Stillwater?  Yes, they are. He was with the International Programs Office.  Did you want to bring everybody up to date with where the kids are,  what they   re doing now, as we   ve heard about each of them being  introduced onto the scene?  Well, we have six children: four boys and two girls; seventeen  grandchildren: eleven boys and six girls; and three great-grandchildren:  all three little boys. The oldest one is three and a half, and the youngest  one will be two in April, and they   re just sweet as they can be.  So, that must make for large family gatherings. (Laughs)  Yes, there was about thirty-two of us here for Christmas. We have  enjoyed it so much.  Well, thank you so much for helping us out with this project. We really  do appreciate it.  -------  -------
