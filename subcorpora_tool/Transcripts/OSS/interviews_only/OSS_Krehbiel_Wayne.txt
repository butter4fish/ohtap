 Finchum Today is August 4, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, and along with me is  Madison Warlick. We   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in  Hydro, Oklahoma,  which is in Caddo County , to speak with Wayne  Krehbiel. This is part of our Cowboy in Every County, so thank you for  having us today.  W. Krehbiel You   re welcome.  Finchum Let   s learn a little bit about you. Can you tell us when and where you were  born?  W. Krehbiel I was born in the farm home two miles west of here, May 3, 1931. I   m  eighty-four.  Finchum You   re eighty-four. Do you have brothers and sisters?  W. Krehbiel I have one brother who is a retired college professor at Texas A M. He also  worked here at Oklahoma State. I have one sister who is a retired teacher in  Texas.  Finchum Where were you; oldest, middle, youngest?  W. Krehbiel Middle. My brother   s seven years older, and my sister   s seven years  younger.  Finchum Wow  They planned that pretty good didn   t they?  W. Krehbiel I guess. (Laughs) I wasn   t there. I didn   t have no influence.  Finchum What were your parents    names?  W. Krehbiel Val and Margaret Krehbiel. His full name was Valentine, but it was Val that  he went by. He went by Val.  Finchum Were they born in Oklahoma?  W. Krehbiel Yes. He was born at Geary. She was born on this farm.  Finchum So how did the farm come to be in the family?  W. Krehbiel My grandfather wanted to draw for a farm, but he didn   t like where he was  drawing, so he traded a team of horses and a wagon load of oats for this  farm in 1901, when this area opened up. This was one of the last areas in the  state because they called it the Indians    Big Pasture. If you go just a few  miles north, that was opened up quite a bit, several years earlier.  Finchum In 1901, that   s over a hundred years too.  W. Krehbiel Yeah.  Finchum Where had they come from?  W. Krehbiel They came from Kansas. My grandfather was born in Russia, and my  grandmother was born in Poland, and I had another grandmother that was  born in Switzerland. The other grandfather, I think he was born in Iowa. I   m  not sure.  Finchum Okay, been in Oklahoma ever since?  W. Krehbiel Yes, I have.  Finchum Well where did you go to school? When you were in elementary school,  where did you go?  W. Krehbiel Went to Hydro. We lived two miles west and a mile north. That was in  Hydro school district. I went to Hydro for twelve years.  Finchum Was it one through twelve in the same building?  W. Krehbiel No. The first building they tore down in my third grade, and we built a new  one. We stayed in that until they tore it down this year.  Finchum Hydro has changed a little bit?  W. Krehbiel Well, yes. It   s like every town and little town. It   s probably more unique  than a lot of little towns, because it   s kind of held its own. A lot of little  towns all the stores are closed and the people have moved out. We are close  enough that people can live here and work in Oklahoma City, be there in  forty-five minutes, or Weatherford, whatever. We have the college at  Weatherford. It   s beneficial to a lot of local people.  Finchum We noticed that Route 66 comes through.  W. Krehbiel Right. That was put in the year I was born. One of the first things I can  remember is we was going to California, and I just remember getting on Old  66 and heading that way. I know at that time, there was a lot of dirt roads.  Sixty-six wasn   t completed.  Finchum Then I-40 came along?  W. Krehbiel I-40 came in, I think in the    50s. I   m not sure. I think was, probably,  somewhere in the mid to late    50s.  Finchum If you were born in    31, you graduated high school in forty-      W. Krehbiel Nine.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject while you were in high school?  W. Krehbiel No. I didn   t have any. I just didn   t have any problems with any classes. I just  couldn   t understand why we had to have English and some of these things.  (Laughter) We knew how to speak English. I liked   I was always good in  geometry and math, and that sort of thing. Of course I was active in  agriculture and FFA  Future Farmers of America . We had a real strong  chapter of FFA.  Finchum Did you have to raise an animal or something for FFA?  W. Krehbiel Oh, I had several. I had sheep and hogs. No cattle, just sheep and hogs.  Finchum Took them to the county fair?  W. Krehbiel We took them to the county fair, the state fair, and Fort Worth, and different  places.  Finchum Did you have an outside job or were you working on the farm in high  school?  W. Krehbiel No. I just helped my dad and then I    he made the wheat harvest, and I went  with him on the wheat harvest a year or two, a couple years. I still didn   t  have a driver   s license. It was before I had a driver   s license, we went north.  The year I got out of high school, I took a combine and went on harvest by  myself, on my own. That is pretty unusual for somebody that young, but we  had good luck getting jobs.  Finchum For those who might not know, what do you mean by harvest?  W. Krehbiel A harvest is you have combines and you go through Oklahoma, Kansas,  Colorado, and Wyoming harvesting wheat.  Finchum Planned ahead as to who you were going to do or just     W. Krehbiel Yeah, I had a lot of contacts that I could make. In those days we had no cell  phones so I   d go to a pay phone and call people or go see them. In the spring  I   d make a round to try and contact people that I might get a job with. The  wheat harvest gets ready at different times. The further north you go the  later it is, so you start in Texas harvesting, then come here, then you go to  Kansas, then you go to Colorado, then you go to Wyoming, and then you go  to Montana, or whatever.  Finchum A lot of hot, long days?  W. Krehbiel Well, I didn   t think anything about it then. We didn   t have air-conditioned  cabs. We just sat out there in the dirt, and probably today I suffer from it.  My head stops up and stuff. I talked to one fellow, he had surgery, and said  that they got a cup full of dirt out his head. That was just part of farming in  those days. You had no air-conditioning. You just sat out in the dirt, ate the  dirt.  Finchum Where would you stay at night?  W. Krehbiel Well, the first year we would just take a blanket and throw it under the back  of the truck. (Laughs) Then, later on we had a house trailer, and after we  were married, we had a house trailer and the crew and several combines and  made the harvest that a way. I had a deal with, at first, my dad. I   d take his  combine and go up through there and pay all expenses, and when I got done,  if there was any profit I   d split it with him. That worked pretty good for two  or three years. I think I made my first trip when I got my driver   s license.  Before that, we had pull type combines, and I would drive the tractor on the  road. The tractor would run thirty miles an hour so I   d get there before the  trucks would. (Laughs)  One time   we sold our pull type combine. We had a tractor at Goodland,  Kansas, which is five hundred miles. I said,    I   ll drive it home. I   ll beat the  rest of you guys home.    I got it at five o   clock and never stopped, only to  fuel up, and I was home by eleven. (Laughs) That was five hundred miles. I  think I set a record. I   ve never talked to anybody that drove a tractor five  hundred miles in one day. (Laughs)  Finchum You weren   t speeding either, I don   t     W. Krehbiel No, but I was young. No, it run thirty mile an hour. It had a fast road gear in  it. It run thirty mile an hour. You could just set your watch. Every two  minutes you   d run a mile. (Laughs)  Finchum Did it have a radio? How did you entertain yourself?  W. Krehbiel No, you were in the open. (Laughs)  Finchum You were alone with your thoughts?  W. Krehbiel Yep. (Laughs) It was a lot of fun.  Finchum So your father was in farming?  W. Krehbiel Yes.  Finchum Did your mother have a job off the farm?  W. Krehbiel No. Those days, women didn   t work off the farm. He also did soil  conservation work, building dams and terraces and helping other farmers.  He made pretty good money doing that.  Finchum You were too young to be in World War II?  W. Krehbiel I was Korea. Korean War was   at the time, we were at Stillwater. We could  take ROTC and stay in school, or if we wasn   t in ROTC, we would be  drafted. I took ROTC and graduated with a second lieutenant commission,  prepared to go overseas. I went to an officers    training school that lasts  fifteen weeks, and week before I graduated from that, Korea stopped. So in  turn, I was sent to, then it was Camp Louisiana, and they wanted to close  that out, so I helped close that out. Then come back and spent the rest of my  two years in Fort Sill.  Finchum Then, let   s back up then. You finished high school, went on the road for a  little while. When did you go to OSU?  W. Krehbiel Well, in the winter I went to OSU. Just in the summer time, I made the  harvest.  Finchum Okay, so you started at Oklahoma A M?  W. Krehbiel Yes.  Finchum In Fall of    49?  W. Krehbiel Yes.  Finchum What was your major?  W. Krehbiel Animal Science.  Finchum Why Oklahoma A M?  W. Krehbiel Well, you know, I had a farming background, and I had an interest in it. I  guess maybe my older brother, he was at A M at the time too. He was just  finishing when I started. World War II caught him and set him back. He  didn   t get to finish as quick as he should   ve. Anyway, that, maybe I was  kind of following him, I don   t know. I didn   t, at the time, think I was  coming back to the farm, because I didn   t feel like I could afford it.  I had been on the college meats team and got acquainted with some people  when we made the trip to Chicago. We went through a packinghouse,  meatpacking plant and when we got through, one of them, the owner pulled  me aside and said,    When you get out of school come and we   ll hire you.     (Laughs) I never made that trip, because before I got out of the Army, I had  an uncle come and talk me into the notion of coming here to farm. That   s  how that happened.  Finchum Well, do you remember what your tuition might have been back?  W. Krehbiel Oh yeah. I had a scholarship for all my tuition for two years. It was forty-eight  dollars a semester. (Laughs) So I had all my tuition paid. My first job  was living in the hog barn, and cleaning the pens and working with feeding  the hogs. I got twenty-five cents an hour. The college paid me twenty-five  cents an hour, but I still made money. (Laughs)  Finchum Where did you live?  W. Krehbiel In the hog barn. There was a room in the hog barn that we could live in. I  just said,    I   ll just fix it up and live in that.    They said,    Okay.    (Laughs)  Finchum Had its own unique smell?  W. Krehbiel Huh?  Finchum Had its own unique smell?  W. Krehbiel Oh yeah. First time Fern and I went together, she said,    This seems like a  nice kid but he sure should wash his feet.    (Laughter)  Finchum We should say Fern is your wife   W. Krehbiel Yeah, that   s it. (Laughs)  Finchum How did you meet her?  W. Krehbiel Well, we   you know you accumulate a lot of friends and stuff. We had kind  of a round of friends that we   d just get together. She was a year younger,  and one of her good friends come to Stillwater, and we met her. I didn   t pay  no attention to her. Then she said,    You need to get acquainted with that  guy.    (Laughs) That   s how it worked I guess, isn   t Fern?  F. Krehbiel More or less.  W. Krehbiel More or less. Yeah. Anyway, she, we     Finchum Did she live in a dormitory?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, she lived in Stout Hall. If it   s still Stout Hall, I don   t know. Stout  Hall.  Finchum Stout is still there for the time being.  W. Krehbiel Yeah. She had a job there running the elevator I think or something.  Finchum Cool.  W. Krehbiel She probably got more money than I did, I don   t know. (Laughs)  Finchum She had a curfew? You had to get her home by a certain time?  W. Krehbiel Oh yeah  They had curfews, I think. I don   t remember what it was. It was  real early on the weekday, and then Saturday I think you could stay out until  ten or eleven, probably.  Finchum What were some things you would do for a date?  W. Krehbiel Oh, I don   t know. We never went to a lot of movies. We went once in a  while, and we   d just get together with everybody else and visit. We had     we didn   t do anything bad, you know. We didn   t get in no trouble or  anything like that.  Finchum Go to dances?  W. Krehbiel No, I never did.  Finchum Play cards?  W. Krehbiel No, we didn   t play cards. I don   t remember now what we did.  Finchum Sporting events?  W. Krehbiel Oh yeah. We went to basketball games, wrestling and stuff like that. I never  played. I wasn   t very athletic, so I didn   t play any sports.  Finchum So how would you get from Hydro to Stillwater?  W. Krehbiel Well, the first year, I had an old homemade motor scooter that I took, but I  didn   t drive it. My dad hauled it up there, I think, or somebody did. I run  that   of course, the barn was three-quarter mile to the school. I drove it to  the school. Then, before the end of the year, I bought a pickup, and I would  drive back and forth and drive out here.  Finchum During the term, how often would you come home?  W. Krehbiel Oh, three or four times a year. Not very often. I usually stayed there on the  weekends.  Finchum You mentioned, when we came, that you worked somewhere on campus  besides the barn?  W. Krehbiel Well, they went from twenty-five to thirty to thirty-five cents an hour. Then,  we got married between my junior and senior year, in 1952. Going to  harvest I made money and I bought a house trailer and had a new pickup.  When I started to school, I had nothing, and when I got out I had a house  trailer paid for, a pickup paid for, and money in the bank. (Laughs)  Anyway, they approached me. The library was opening up, the new library.  They approached me and said,    Would you be willing to be work at the  library for seventy-five cents an hour. You   ll get more money. They   ll pay  you seventy-five cents an hour.    I got jumped from forty or fifty cents to  seventy-five cents.    We want you to be kind of in charge of the other  students. We have two older gentleman that are supposed to take care of the  library.    One, he was really old. He just worked a couple hours a day, and  the other one, after I went to work there, he got sick. So I was the first  person in charge of the janitor work in the library. (Laughs) Brand new  library. Anyway, that   s my library story. I know all things about it.  We just threw a fit when they went and put orange paint in the fountain.  Now, they do it on purpose. (Laughs) We went out and scrubbed that thing  and worked at it. Of course, I knew every part of that library at that time.  Finchum Where was the card catalog?  W. Krehbiel I don   t remember what floor, I think second floor. I   m not sure.  Finchum Coming up the big staircase?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, uh-huh. I believe that   s right. They, it was all     Finchum Well, did you have to help them move into it?  W. Krehbiel No. We didn   t do any of the moving or anything. All we done was janitor  work. My job was just to make sure that all of it was clean and bathrooms  were clean and furnished and the rooms were clean.  Finchum Didn   t have to move the books from the old building?  W. Krehbiel No, I didn   t do any of that. That was, a lot of that was done the summer  before I started there. It was open in the fall. It was open in the Fall of    52.  Finchum That sounds right   W. Krehbiel I think, I don   t know when they moved it in there. Whether they did in the  summer or the spring before, but I didn   t start there until the Fall of    52.  Finchum Did you know Edmon Low?  W. Krehbiel Yes, I did. I visit with him every once in a while when I   d clean his room,  (laughs) do the janitor work. He was a nice guy.  Finchum They named the building after him.  W. Krehbiel Yes, I know, uh-huh. I don   t know whether they named that building at that  time, or not?  Finchum I don   t know either.  W. Krehbiel Yes, I can remember his office.  Finchum Where was it?  W. Krehbiel I   m not sure what floor it was. It was on the south end there, as you come  up. Seems to me like when you come in on the south, you   d go around the  corner and it was right there, I think.  Finchum I know they have moved the offices around. I   m not sure where it is.  W. Krehbiel I don   t know exactly. I remember that part of it. It was kind of pretty well at  the front end of the building, the south end. I don   t know. I call that the front  end.  Finchum Did the students sneak in food?  W. Krehbiel Huh?  Finchum Did they sneak in food?  W. Krehbiel I didn   t know that.  Finchum As janitor I thought that you   d know if they did.  W. Krehbiel I don   t remember them ever having a trouble with that. Do they now?  Finchum They allow it now.  W. Krehbiel They allow it? Well, as long as they don   t allow beer. (Laughs)  Finchum As far as I know, they don   t allow it.  W. Krehbiel (Laughs) It   d be all right.  Finchum They   ve carpeted most of the floors.  W. Krehbiel Yeah, see we didn   t have carpet on most of them. We just cleaned them, you  know, swept them.  Finchum Easier to clean.  W. Krehbiel I don   t remember, I don   t remember too much carpeting.  Finchum Yeah, they   ve just done that in the last few years.  W. Krehbiel I don   t remember too much. I remember redoing some of the floors. When  they built it, they kind of messed them up a little. We had to sand them  down or something and start over with them, refinish them.  Finchum The Student Union was new at that time.  W. Krehbiel It was new. I can   t remember whether it was, I think it was built one or two  years before the library. They had just started on it when I started to school  in    49. They had just then closed the street and started to build on it.  Finchum You got to watch it go up.  W. Krehbiel Yep, got to watch it go up.  Finchum Was Theta Pond there?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, Theta Pond was there.  Finchum Did you get thrown in when you got engaged?  W. Krehbiel No, we didn   t have anything to do with that. (Laughs)  Finchum I hear a lot of people got thrown in when they got penned or engaged?  W. Krehbiel Yeah. I don   t know. Fern, what did we do on dates? We, lot of times we   d  just study.  F. Krehbiel We usually had friends that were couples.  W. Krehbiel Yeah, other people. That might   ve been. Sometimes I   d have ten or fifteen  people out there at the barn, and once in a while on Sunday, we   d have a big  feed out there. Dr. Willham was the president of the college at that time. He  was always interested in that, because that was his job at one time. We was  having a big party out there eating and he come there and ate with us. We  fed him a little bit. (Laughs) I was, I was real good friends with Dr.  Willham   s son, too, Richard. He went on to Iowa State, I think, now. Dr.  Bennett was the president when I went and he was killed, and then Dr.  Willham took over. I think he was the next president, I   m not sure.  Finchum I think that   s right. It sounds like it.  W. Krehbiel Dr. Bennett was killed when, maybe     F. Krehbiel We were in school.  W. Krehbiel    we were in school when he was killed.  F. Krehbiel That was sad.  Finchum Very sad.  W. Krehbiel Yep. His work is still seen today in Ethiopia. Dean Smith over here, he  works with a group in Ethiopia that   s working on the research station that  Dr. Bennett set up.  Finchum Point Four?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, the Point Four Program.  Finchum That   s right, isn   t it?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, I think. Then afterwards the communists took over. That kind of  stopped all that, but now then it   s kind of getting straightened up. A lot of  those countries are getting a little more straightened out. There are still a lot  of problems in Sudan and places.  Finchum Campus was small enough where you knew the president and he knew you?  W. Krehbiel I don   t know if that happened with everybody. I never did know Dr.  Bennett. I did know Dr. Willham.  Finchum During that time, there were Quonset huts?  W. Krehbiel Yes, we had a lot of classes in Quonset huts. A lot of them over south there,  south of Sixth Street, that is, whatever. Had a big area in there that people  lived in them.  Finchum Not Vet Village, but     W. Krehbiel It wasn   t Vet Village. It was just a group of those old buildings. (Oretoopa)  When I went to school they was living in those buildings. A lot of students  were. They couldn   t get in the dormitories.  Finchum Get cold in the wintertime.  W. Krehbiel When I started to school, I lived one month in Hanner Hall. I don   t know if  it   s still Hanner Hall or not.  Finchum They tore it down.  W. Krehbiel They tore it down. I lived one month there. I decided this was not for me and  moved to the hog barn. (Laughter)  Finchum What didn   t you like?  W. Krehbiel Huh?  Finchum What didn   t you like?  W. Krehbiel Oh, I don   t know. That was the athletic dorm. Some of those guys kind of  bugged me a little bit. (Laughs)  Finchum They   re putting a business building in that space now.  W. Krehbiel Yeah.  Finchum Building it just now, breaking ground for that.  W. Krehbiel Well, there was Hanner, and Thatcher was on the other side of that, and I  don   t know if that   s still there or not.  Finchum Thatcher is still there.  W. Krehbiel That was the two main men   s dormitories. Then, while I was there, they  build Cordell.  Finchum It   s still there for the moment, but part of it is coming down.  W. Krehbiel Really? Well, it   s probably served its time. I don   t even know if they use it  for dormitory anymore.  Finchum No, office space.  W. Krehbiel Most of the buildings that were there, at any length of time, are gone. The  animal science building and the dairy building, and all that.  Finchum Old Central is still there.  W. Krehbiel Old Central is still there. They thought about tearing it down, but     Finchum Did you have a class in it?  W. Krehbiel I had a class in Old Central. I think we had a class together in Old Central.  Didn   t we?  F. Krehbiel No. You   re talking about the law class.  W. Krehbiel Yeah.  F. Krehbiel I had a class in Old Central.  W. Krehbiel We had one class together and I can   t remember what it was.  F. Krehbiel It was     W. Krehbiel    business law or something like that.  F. Krehbiel Yeah.  Finchum Did you have a favorite professor?  W. Krehbiel Well, I guess. I didn   t have any problem with any of them that I know of. I  don   t    know who you would say the favorite was. Course, I liked my animal  science professors because that was my major. I don   t know if I can say if  there was any one professor that was an outstanding favorite or anything.  Finchum What did you think when they changed the name from Oklahoma A M?  W. Krehbiel You know, our county alumni association held it up for a while. They didn   t  change it. We was the last one to give in to change the name. It didn   t make  no difference to me, but there were some of them in my county at the county  alumni association that just threw a fit. They said,    We   re going to stop that.  They don   t need to change it     I still don   t see the advantage of changing it,  but it   s all right with me.  Finchum And the switch from Aggies to Cowboys?  W. Krehbiel Yes  We was Aggies. I never have figured out the song. It was O-A-M-C,  O-A-M-C, and it   s not anymore. I don   t know. I just sit there and wave.  (Laughs)  Finchum So you watch games or do you go to them?  W. Krehbiel For twenty-some years I had football tickets, when the boys were growing  up and all, on the forty-five yard line, about twenty rows up. Ideal seats.  Then, my youngest son wanted those tickets. I had some basketball tickets,  and my oldest son wanted those. That was fine. Then, after they redone it,  we never did go to the football games much. It was just not for our age. I   ve  gone a few times, but not much.  When they redid Gallagher Iba, my son that is a writer for the Tulsa World,  he lives in Tulsa. We like to go and meet them. Then, her sister lives at  Yale. We   d go to the basketball games and meet them. When they expanded  it, I called up there and said,    I   m going to give my basketball tickets to my  son and I want two for myself, but I don   t want to get too high.    They said,     You   ve got a lot of points,    or whatever,    it won   t be too high.    I said,     What   s too high?       Well,    and hem-hawed around. I said,    I just don   t  want to climb any stairs.    She (Fern) was having some problems at that  time. They said,    You   re old enough, just take the handicapped seats.    I  said,    No. We   re not handicapped.       Yes, now listen to us,    (laughs)    please  take the handicap because we can   t get rid of them.    It was new and nobody  wanted to get in the handicap. They said,    We   ll make a deal. You look at  that deal and see where you want your seats, and we   ll give you those seats.     (Laughs) So we   ve had those handicaps seats ever since they redid that.  How long has that been?  Finchum It   s been a while  Ten years maybe   W. Krehbiel I bet more than that. I believe more than that. I don   t know.  Finchum At least ten   W. Krehbiel We   ve always had connections with grandkids there, or her sister, so we  kept ours. We didn   t make very many basketball games last year because of  health reasons. I like to go if she can go, but she has a little trouble getting  there.  Finchum Got a little orange in your closet then?  W. Krehbiel Oh we   ve got orange everywhere. You seen my Suburban? (Laughter)  Finchum No, I hadn   t paid attention, but that is really orange   W. Krehbiel It   s really orange  (Laughs) I had a car that the air conditioner wouldn   t  work, and I   d go on a trip and come back burning up, and I   d take it to the  dealer. I   d say,    Fix my air conditioner.    He   d say,    I   ll give you a loaner.     We   d drive the loaner for most of the summer. I   d keep at him.    No, I don   t  have it fixed.    Finally, one fall I went in and I said,    Chad,    he   s a young  kid that was running, the dealer. I said,    Chad, quit horsing around and fix  it. I   m not going to drive that car this winter. I want you to fix that air  conditioner.    He said,    We cannot fix it. Just trade it off.    I said,    I don   t  want to trade it. It   s a good car.       It ain   t a good car because the air  conditioner don   t work.    He said,    It   ll trade good now.    That   s always  sales talk.    If you trade it right now. You   ve had it four years and nearly a  hundred thousand miles, you need to trade it.    I said,    I can   t afford it.        Yes you can      I said,    Well, only way I   d trade with you is if you   d get me an orange.    He  said,    You   re always wanting something orange, and you know that they  don   t make an orange one. I am going to take a Suburban down to the shop  and paint it orange for you.    I said,    No you   re not. I   ve got to have it  factory orange.    We argued around there for a month or two. I think it was  about in December he come, I was in his dealership, he come in and said,    I  got this memo from General Motors, and I can order any special color at no  extra charge. I have already ordered you an orange one.    I said,    You  shouldn   t have done that, because I don   t think I   ll have the money.     He called me in March or April and said,    Get ready. Your suburban is on  the way. It   s bright orange.    It came in.    Come in and get your car.    I said,     Just sell it to somebody else.       You know I know you better than that. If I  sold that, in ten minutes, you   d be back in here wanting that orange car      (Laughs) I left it on his lot for about three weeks, him calling me and  everything. Finally one day I said,    I tell you what Chad, only way I can see  that I could get that car is if I   d get a good oil lease.    He said,    You better  get an oil lease.    You know, two days later I got an oil lease. I said the Lord  said,    Quit harassing him, (laughs) and get that car     It   s been fun. It   s been  a lot of fun. We   d go to Stillwater and some of the kids from here would see  me, and they   d tell their folks,    Saw him up here.    Then they   d jump me out  in town,    What you doing in Stillwater?    (Laughs) So you can   t hide.  (Laughter)  When I was in high school, I had an old 1929 Model A car that I drove just  to high school, and it had no doors, no top, no brakes, and it was just a rat  trap. (Laughs) I kind of liked that car, and here a couple years ago I had a  chance to buy one like that. I fixed it up, and I painted it all black except  orange wheels and orange trim. (Laughs) I said,    Henry Ford wouldn   t let  me paint it anything else.    He said,    You can have any color you want as  long as it   s black.    (Laughter) But he didn   t say anything about the trim.  (Laughs)  Finchum Orange is an okay color for you   W. Krehbiel Yeah, it is. We   ve had a lot of good association with the university. I   ve  been  recognized as a Graduate of Distinction  and stuff like with them,  because of things I   ve done. I told a classmate of mine today, I said,    I  don   t    know how I could   ve had a better life.    It   s been good.  Finchum And partly because of OSU?  W. Krehbiel Of course   Finchum Going there?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, of course.  Finchum You graduated in    52?  W. Krehbiel In    53.  Finchum You remember graduation day? Anything about it?  W. Krehbiel Well, we graduated. We had it in the auditorium there, Gallagher Iba. I  mean it was Gallagher then. It wasn   t Gallagher Iba. That   s about the extent  of it. I don   t know.  Finchum Did your parents come?  W. Krehbiel I   m sure they did.  F. Krehbiel Yes, they did. That was up in the stadium.  W. Krehbiel Huh?  F. Krehbiel It was in the stadium. It was in the football stadium.  W. Krehbiel No, we didn   t have it, I didn   t graduate there. I graduated in the other  building. You   re thinking of when Randy graduated. I don   t think I, I don   t  know.  Finchum So you went, and a son went, and now a granddaughter is going?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, I had two sons go there. Then, I had a couple of granddaughters go  there. Another one, Brittany, the other one is really a sharp gal. When she  was in high school, she went to school in Tulsa, and she was on the  academic team, and in fact, captain of the academic team. They always won  every year at State. When she got to OSU, they didn   t have an academic  team and she established one. Then, they tried to get OSU to help support it  with some funds or something. They said,    No. We   ve got to make sure it  works.    Then, when she got in graduate school, she got on Jeopardy and  won some money. She took that money and gave it to the academic team, to  carry on. I don   t know whether they   ve got it anymore or not.  Finchum I don   t know either. I   ll look when I get back.  W. Krehbiel I don   t know whether it   s still going or not. Her dad   s a writer for the Tulsa  World, has been for forty years. She wanted a job with the Tulsa World and  couldn   t    get it so she set up her own. She   s a private writer, you know,  whatever you call it. Then, she got started writing Indian news. She writes  for Indian papers. You know, newspapers, like Indian Times and whatever,  Native American Times, I think it   s called.  Finchum Someone puts up a hurdle, she goes over it   W. Krehbiel Yep, she is doing real good. Now then, Tulsa World offered her a job. She  turned it down and said,    I   m doing too good on my own.    (Laughs) She  don   t need it.    Don   t need you.    But she still writes for them some on a per  item basis.  Finchum When you graduated, what did you do? Did you come back here?  W. Krehbiel When I graduated, I had to spend two years in the service. Everybody did.  While I was there, a year before I got out, I had an uncle that come, I was at  Fort Sill, and he come down there. He said,    The farm, the homestead here,  had eleven heirs and they wanted to sell it, but they would like to sell it to  someone within the family.    He said,    We   ve been offered a certain price  for it. We   ll sell it to you for that.    I said,    I can   t buy nothing.       No, listen  to me. Half of them, it would amount to each one getting about twenty-two  hundred dollars for their part. Half of them will not take their money now,  they   ll take it one year at a time. The other half of the half you can go to the  bank and borrow some money, except you   ll lack a little bit. You got any  money?    I said,    Yeah, I   ve got eighteen hundred dollars in the bank.    He  said,    That   s just enough.    I said,    What if I lose it?    (Laughs) Anyway,  that   s how I got back to farm.  The first ten years probably, we made the wheat harvest. Then I got  involved in other businesses, and I couldn   t go. I had to stay here. One thing  led to another. I   ve had several pretty good businesses along the way.  Finchum And an oil well.  W. Krehbiel Well, we had some production from oil wells. That helps of course. That  hasn   t been a real factor until maybe the last three or four years.  Finchum How many acres do you farm?  W. Krehbiel Well, I only got about twelve hundred now. Actually I just, Brittany and her  mother, I   m a volunteer for a non-profit organization. (Laughs) I work every  day for them. I get enough money from the oil. It don   t matter whether you  got anything or not.  Finchum Enough to put gas in your orange     W. Krehbiel Yeah, I don   t drive it that much. (Laughs) They furnish me a pickup to do  things you know. Anyway     F. Krehbiel We lost one boy.  W. Krehbiel Huh?  F. Krehbiel We lost     W. Krehbiel Our youngest son, yeah. Brittany   s dad died of cancer in    11. She said,    I  promised him that I would carry on,    and so that   s what she   s going to do.  Finchum It   s a nice place. I can see why you   d want to come back.  W. Krehbiel Yeah. (Laughs) Well, she lives in this, you can see right through here, a big  house. That   s their house there.  Finchum They can keep an eye on you   W. Krehbiel Yeah. I had some of the land my son had bought earlier, about four hundred  and eighty acres of it.  Finchum Well, did you insist on them going to OSU, or did they choose?  W. Krehbiel I never insisted on anybody going anyplace. That   s their choice. I had one  grandson that didn   t, because he thought he could be on a soccer team. He  liked soccer. He went to Drury and didn   t. He didn   t make the team, but he  done well. Then when he graduated, he got a scholarship to go get a  doctorate degree in political science, for sixty-six thousand a year, at  Washington University. He   s finishing that up this year. He   ll have his  doctorate degree, and he   ll be a college professor. He   s smart anyway, even  though he didn   t go to OSU. (Laughs)  Finchum He came from good stock.  W. Krehbiel I don   t know about that. (Laughs) Yeah. Anyway, but I   ve traveled a lot of  places, enjoyed life, and done a lot of different things. I spent most of three  years in Saudi Arabia developing farmland. I worked with a mission group  to establish churches throughout the world. This group, last year, established  over fourteen hundred new churches. Their job is to train people, native  people, to be church pastors. In doing that, they also train them to make a  living. There   s our granddaughter, Brittany. (Comes in the house) Anyway,  that   s been kind of a good thing.  Finchum Stayed busy. When did you retire or have you?  W. Krehbiel You know what? I always said that   I kind of watch people and all the  people that I know that retire die sometime, and I figure I might as well live  a little longer. (Laughter)  Finchum That makes sense to me, doesn   t it?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, it makes sense. Why retire if you   re going to die? (Laughs)  Finchum You mentioned earlier about the alumni association for this county?  W. Krehbiel Uh-huh.  Finchum You   re active in it?  W. Krehbiel You know, I was for years but I haven   t been lately. I should be, but I  haven   t been.  Finchum What sort of things would they do?  W. Krehbiel Well, you know, our county was really pretty strong. One thing, we provide  scholarships for anybody that wants to go to OSU. They did at that time,  when I, you know, all along. Then, they get together and they would go to  someplace else to a football game or something, you know. I don   t know,  we haven   t been very active in the county alumni association and we should  be. It   s forty miles over there, and we don   t do it. What you say young lady?  Brittany Do you mind if I ask him a couple of questions?  Finchum No, go ahead.  W. Krehbiel Are you cleaning weed?  Brittany Yes, we   re starting. Get the last load off, then are we going north of town?  W. Krehbiel Yeah.  Brittany How do you want us to get there?  W. Krehbiel Huh?  Brittany How do you want us to get there? Go north here all the way to     W. Krehbiel You   re going to be all the way down here. Just go across 58 Highway, by  the Indian lease.  Brittany I   m talking with grain carts.  W. Krehbiel I would go empty here and go in across, Low Water crossing. Then, the  loads go through town. Then, go a mile west of (Highway) 58 down through  there five miles. It   s about two miles further     Brittany Will this little bridge hold us full?  W. Krehbiel No. It   ll hold you empty, but not full.  Brittany But not full. Not Low Water, the bridge, over in it?  W. Krehbiel Low Water will take, both will carry you empty.  Brittany Neither one of them will hold full?  W. Krehbiel Yeah. I   m worried about, on the Low Water, when you come up out of that,  it   s awful steep there.  Brittany They don   t want to pull them as it is.  W. Krehbiel Yeah, I think you   re     Brittany We need one more guy. Can we take Ernesto?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, take him.  Brittany All right. Thanks.  W. Krehbiel Well, saved me having to do anything. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, if you want to volunteer, we   ll let you.  W. Krehbiel No, I don   t. I   ll let them do it. They   ve got to learn.  Finchum Those are good directions. Low Water bridge and     W. Krehbiel Yeah.  Finchum Everything has a name. We noticed the mounds out here. What are those?  W. Krehbiel I wasn   t here when they put them here, I don   t know. (Laughs) I   ve heard all  kinds of things. They claim that this during the ice age, I   ve heard one  explanation, that during the ice age, those were probably like buffalo  wallows or something, and it solidified the rock there where they stayed in  one place. Consequently, when the ice age come it bulldozed all this land off  and left those there. I don   t know. It could be that     Finchum Is that part of your land?  W. Krehbiel Not that. I got one place south of Hydro that has a hill on it. They took all  the   at one time, they had a crusher, a rock crusher on it. They put all the  base, the river bridge here, for thirty miles, off of that hill up on Interstate  40. Sold all that. It was my dad   s, and he got enough to build a new house,  at a nickel a ton. (Laughs)  Finchum Hey, all adds up.  W. Krehbiel Adds up. Yeah, they were running a hundred trucks a day out of there for a  year. In those days when they built the Interstate 40, they didn   t have semis.  It was just bobtail trucks.  Finchum Took longer then.  W. Krehbiel Little dump trucks. Yep.  Finchum During the WPA   no, you wouldn   t have been...  W. Krehbiel Yeah, of course I know the WPA. It stands for We Piddle Around.  (Laughter) That   s what we always said. They come through the country and  built some culverts and built outhouses, some things like that.  Finchum Do anything on your farm?  W. Krehbiel They didn   t do anything on our place. They built a culvert by our house,  that   s all. Just a little block deal in front. I just remember a lot of guys there,  not doing anything.  Finchum Did they do anything in Hydro?  W. Krehbiel I don   t know of anything. I wouldn   t have been familiar with it. I don   t  remember them doing anything. They might have built the community  building. I don   t know whether they had anything to do with that or not. It  was not in existence, after I was probably ten years old.  Finchum I noticed Hydro has a co-op?  W. Krehbiel Uh-huh.  Finchum Was it there when you were younger?  W. Krehbiel Yes, it was not right there. They built all of that afterwards. It was on east  here, which they   ve tore the old elevator down. There was a Hydro Co-op.  Finchum The town is up on a little hill?  W. Krehbiel Yes, it goes down and then up on the hill. The railroad, when I was growing  up, was pretty popular there. When they opened this country, the railroads  brought people in there.  Phone rings  It   s my hired man, he can wait.  (Laughs)  Finchum When you were younger, did you have chores on the farm?  W. Krehbiel Oh yeah  We milked cows. Then in the summertime, I   d herd cattle on the  side of the roads. Take them to the other pastures and stuff. I had a little  pony that I   d drive the cattle to feed, graze on the roads. I had another  pasture rented, and sometimes I   d run them on somebody   s wheat stubble.  Finchum Would you get paid?  W. Krehbiel Oh no   Finchum Another volunteer work.  W. Krehbiel All volunteer, yeah. I don   t know. I had, probably, a little bit of cash from  my FFA projects, but not much. Didn   t need much.  Finchum What would you do for fun?  W. Krehbiel Well, I don   t know. We     Finchum Did you have a pond to go swimming or fishing?  W. Krehbiel No. Didn   t ever go fishing. Sometimes in the wintertime, if it was ice and  snow, we   d slide down the hill in a scoop shovel or something like that.  (Laughs) I don   t remember any special thing we did. When I was younger, I  played with toys and ride that horse every day. (Laughs)  Finchum What was its name?  W. Krehbiel Sugar  Sugar, a Shetland pony.  Finchum So if someone asked you where you considered home, it   d be Hydro?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, I suppose. We are, kind of privileged to be the same distance from  Hydro, Bridgeport, Sickles, and Hinton. (Laughs) So wherever we want to  be, that   s where we are.  Finchum Where do you take your crops now?  W. Krehbiel Mostly either Hinton or Hydro, it don   t matter. Then, we don   t necessarily  haul to the local elevators. We raise a lot of seed wheat now. The wheat we  don   t raise for seed, a lot of times we sell it direct to the port and bypass the  elevator. They don   t like it that well, the co-ops. We do real good doing that.  Finchum How do you keep up with the weather?  W. Krehbiel You have to take whatever they give you  (Laughs)  Finchum You watch, keep up with the Mesonet or just     W. Krehbiel Absolutely. I wake up every morning and go to the Mesonet. Of course, we  work all over the state with our business, irrigation business. A lot of times I  can send them someplace and say,    It   s not raining here. You need to do  this.    With the Mesonet too, you can get radar of any place in the area  you   re working. They   ll be working at Fort Smith or someplace and call and  say,    Hey, it   s raining here,    looking to see how long it   s going to rain. I can  look on the Mesonet,    You   re going to get a lot, come home,    or    Just hold  tight for about ten minutes, and you can go back to work.    The Mesonet is  really a good thing for us. It really is.  I always say the people on TV are show monkeys. (Laughs) They got to  make a big show out everything, and it never even happens. The Mesonet  will give you pretty accurate. I can look up there and any particular place     they have a Mesonet station every twenty miles. I can look up there and  pickup for the next eighty-four hours what it   s going to do each hour at any  place in the state.  Finchum You stay on top of that.  W. Krehbiel Oh yeah.  Finchum So you are not retired.  W. Krehbiel Oh no  Not retired.  Finchum You   re working crews all over the state.  W. Krehbiel Yeah.  Finchum Keeping tabs     W. Krehbiel I   m not traveling like I did. I did a lot of traveling. I   ve probably been on  about every road in Oklahoma. (Laughs) There are a lot of them in  Southeastern that I haven   t. Most of the rest of them, I   ve been there. I use a  phone a lot.  Finchum You   re doing irrigation systems. Is that right?  W. Krehbiel Yeah, center pivot irrigation. Then, we install some pumps and stuff like  that, help the farmer establish the irrigation system.  Finchum Water is a pretty big deal.  W. Krehbiel Water is a big thing.  Finchum Well, do you still have the windmill from the original farm?  W. Krehbiel No. It was sitting here and it finally just blew down. I   ve only got one farm  with a windmill standing anymore. It   s not hooked up. We don   t use  windmills anymore. You can get, we don   t have solar pumps, but you can  use a solar pump pretty good to get water.  Finchum Well, do you have any other OSU stories you want to share with us?  W. Krehbiel Oh, I don   t know.  Finchum Pistol Pete wasn   t the mascot when you were there, was he?  W. Krehbiel I think maybe they started it then. Did they Fern?  F. Krehbiel Michael was right in there at the first.  W. Krehbiel Yeah, well he would   ve been fifteen years afterwards. You know, we knew  the original Pistol Pete.  Finchum Frank Eaton?  W. Krehbiel Yeah.  Finchum Cool   W. Krehbiel He   d come there to Stillwater every once in a while. I can   t say that that was  a   I can   t remember that.  Finchum They may have introduced him when they switched the names.  W. Krehbiel That might be right. I   m not sure.  Finchum I think that may be     W. Krehbiel Yeah.  Finchum When was the last time you were on campus?  W. Krehbiel Well, I was there, I don   t know.  F. Krehbiel That basketball game     W. Krehbiel Well, I think I   ve been there since then. I go quite often. We did some work  for the University with their irrigation. I   ve been up there last month. I go up  there some. To go to the specific classroom or something, I don   t know  when. It   s been a while.  Finchum You   ll have to come in the library and I   ll give you a tour.  W. Krehbiel Yeah. (Laughs) I need to do that. It   s a lot bigger now than it was then. They  added onto it in the north there.  Finchum Yes, a little bit. And the card catalog is not there anymore. They took it out.  W. Krehbiel It   s all looking in the screen. I can do a little of that. I   m not too proficient at  it. (Laughs)  Finchum I   m impressed that you use the Mesonet. That   s technology, too.  W. Krehbiel Yeah. I like to read everybody   s Facebook and stuff like that. Then, we get a  couple emails, one from Ron Hays on agriculture, and then the one that is on  energy and oil production and stuff. There   s one that comes on every day on  the (Oklahoma City) Thunder. I   ve never been to watch a ballgame, but we  watch them on TV. I   m able to do some things. I   m not really efficient. I  can   t use everything on my phone either. I don   t know what all that is.  Finchum But you have one   W. Krehbiel (Laughs) Yeah, I got one. I can push the buttons. Brittany can help me.  (Laughs)  Finchum I have help too. (Laughter)  W. Krehbiel Yeah   Finchum Well, if there   s not anything else, I   ll say thank you for sharing with us  today   W. Krehbiel I don   t know of anything. Looks like somebody   s at the door.  Finchum You got company so we   ll shut off. Thank you for talking today.  W. Krehbiel Okay, thank you.  -------  -------
