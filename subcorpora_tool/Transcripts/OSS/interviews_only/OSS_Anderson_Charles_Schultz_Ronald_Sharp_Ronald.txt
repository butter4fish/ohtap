 Neurohr. I am with the OSU Library, and today we   re  at the OSU Alumni Center. It   s Homecoming weekend. Today   s date is  October 21, 2006, and we   re here with three gentlemen who are alumni  of Oklahoma State University, and they   re here for our library project  titled O-STATE Stories, an oral history project of the OSU Library. We  have Mr. Ron Schultz who graduated from Oklahoma State University in  1957, Mr. Ron Sharp who graduated in 1957, and Mr. Charles Anderson  who graduated in 1963. You gentlemen are all here, besides for  Homecoming, for another activity and event this weekend, and it   s a  connection that you all have with each other   and could you tell me a  little bit about that?  Well, we started out about five years ago. There was about eight of us  got together one evening after Homecoming Walk Around and basically  shot the bull, visited and in the end talked about how we need to get  more of our fraternity brothers to come back with us, and so each year  since then we   ve done that. It   s grown. We had, I counted heads this  morning, we had about fifty-five at breakfast this morning   AGRs   Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity , we call us the    moldy oldies    and our  wives, and it   s just growing each year. But we just come back, have a  good time. Some of the people that came back don   t have tickets to the  ballgame. They didn   t come back for the ballgame. They just came back  to be a part of the fellowship, and they   re from everywhere from Florida,  Arizona, Texas, Illinois to Tennessee, Colorado     Ohio  Ohio, of course, and Oklahoma. But we just have a good time, and it   s a  5  Neurohr  Schultz  Sharp  Anderson  Sharp  Neurohr  Sharp  brotherhood, that acquaintance that you know, has lasted fifty years or  more.  Has the fraternity changed as far as you can tell, as far as the number of  young men that are in it now compared to when you were in the  fraternity, Mr. Schultz?  I think they have probably about twenty more living in the house now,  as I understand it, than what we had. I don   t know   what did we have,  forty-nine or so in the house? I think they   re in the seventies now in the  house. One thing I noticed, nobody plays bridge now. There was a bunch  of us back then that played bridge all the time in the living room at the  fraternity house. It was quite enjoyable. Our house mother was Mom B.  and she was an avid bridge player. She taught us to play bridge. I don   t  know what really happened after I graduated, but she certainly taught us  to play bridge as well as many social graces   that   s what we were   her  purpose was really, but for an old farm boy like me, it really helped a  lot.  And we, you know, AGR was an ag fraternity. OSU is an ag university,  so we feel like we   re the foundation of the university. Outside of playing  bridge back then, there wasn   t the things that there is to do today like  there was   I mean, back then there was nothing like they have today so  we did a lot of things in the house. Nobody   and I came, I had no car.  Three or four of them had a car and you would   you know, they would  loan you their vehicle, but there wasn   t the things to do back then that  there is now.  I think a lot of kids go home now. I mean they   re more mobile. And we  weren   t.  And we tell stories. Oh, if you knew some of the stories that they tell  about what we did back then, you know, the poor kids today would go to  jail if they did what we did, but, you know, that was all in being here and  doing what we did. And I think it made better people out of us, and the  relationship that we had. We keep up with each other all the time. We   ve  got   there were five of us that really started together and ended  together, and one of them is in Dallas with his grandsons    and  granddaughter this weekend and couldn   t make it, but we all know  where he   s at and what   s going on so we stay close to one another.  How do you communicate with each other? Has that changed over the  years?  Oh, I don   t know what we   d do if we had a cell phone back when we  were in school here. Now everybody carries them and you   ve got  6  Anderson  Sharp  Schultz  Anderson  Schultz  Anderson  Sharp  Anderson  Neurohr  Schultz  Sharp  Schultz  everybody   s number in the phone.  We e-mail back and forth now, too. Another thing we all went through,  you know, called a hell week. It included initiation and pledging and that  type of thing and, you know   no, I don   t believe in hazing and that type  of thing. I   m sure a lot of what we did and went through as pledge  brothers and as a fraternity bonded us more maybe in a lot of ways.  How many people have slept in a gunny sack (Laughter) for a week and  not change it? You know, and this, it didn   t bother us, did it?  No, we made it. Like I tell people now, and I   ve believed it for a long  time, that the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity is the second best thing that  ever happened to me. I   d always have to rate my wife as number one, of  course, but there would be no replacing the association that   s there, my  close friends that   I guess the closest friends I   ve had were there and     just what I learned there.  I met my wife, because I roomed with her brother, through a blind date  at the house.  I would never   I don   t know if I   d have ever run across Eloise if I  hadn   t been with a bunch of people on the fourth floor of the Student  Union in the corner booth, and later I asked Doug Peacock, I said,    Who  was that girl?    And he told me, and I said,    Well, I think I   ll call her up  and ask her out.    That was the end of that. (Laughter)  Our social time, a lot of it was on the fourth floor of the Student Union. I  mean, somebody would play the jukebox. We could buy a Coke for a  nickel and, you know, we could have a real nice date and dance all night  for, you know, fifteen, twenty cents.  As long as someone else played the jukebox.  As long as somebody else had a quarter to play the jukebox. Fifteen,  twenty cents and we could have a good date.  Was it a large area that students could congregate on the fourth floor?  I don   t know that it was that large. You know, the bigger congregations  in the Student Union were on the first floor and you   d go, if you had an  hour break between classes, why you   d go in there and drink coffee     In the cafeteria.  Yeah.  7  Anderson  Schultz  Neurohr  Sharp  Anderson  Sharp  Anderson  Schultz  Neurohr  Anderson  Schultz  Sharp  Schultz  Sharp  Schultz  Neurohr  Anderson  Schultz  Sharp  Yeah.  In the cafeteria. I guess it   s still at the same place but the fourth floor  was also a social center.  Were there other favorite places in town to socialize? Did you go to a  movie theater for dates or mainly was your socializing here on campus?  Well, we went to Swim   s.  Well, they had the Leachman  movie theater  and     Aggie B.  Was there just one theater?  Well, there was the Campus Corner Theater and then the one downtown,  the Leachman. Of course, there was Louie   s Club Forty. (Laughter)  Louie   s Club Forty, well that sounds like an interesting place.  No comment. (Laughter)  Others on Main Street, kind of to the north of town but, of course     Out by the drive-in theater.  At that time, why   how old did you have to be to drink beer then?  I don   t think they checked your ID.  But anyway, we would go out there occasionally.  Since you   re here for your reunion with AGR and it   s also Homecoming  weekend, what kind of Homecoming traditions did AGR have when you  were students here, and have you seen some changes in that?  Oh, definitely. We used to, when we were in school, we made floats.  That was the main priority. Now it   s house decorations. I don   t know  how many floats they have or don   t have, I don   t think, the size and the  scope of floats that we used to, you know, but we didn   t have very much  house decoration, if any.  I don   t remember any.  We   ve got to commend the members of the fraternity the last four or five  8  Neurohr  Anderson  Neurohr  Anderson  Schultz  Sharp  Neurohr  Sharp  Neurohr  Sharp  Anderson  years because I don   t think we had an engineer that could make anything  run when we were there. We were more soils and animal science and  that type of thing, and I don   t know what the majors are of the  members   the majority of them now, if you look at that decoration. As  an example this year, there are twelve or thirteen different things in  motion all at the same time. Gosh, we couldn   t have made two of them  go when we were here. But it   s amazing that   of the minds that are  there in that fraternity for the last four or five years, and I understand  there   s a couple   a set of twins that are in pre-med that have done most  of that this year. So, you know, it   s amazing, it   s a wonder as to the way  these guys think, you know, and then you go around   the Walk Around  and you look at other fraternities and it   s the same way. They   ve got  ideas that we never would have dreamed about back then.  Describe the house decorations this year for the AGR house? What did it  have in it?  Oh, golly. It has a big pond where we used, you know   kind of   we  protected our front lawn. Now, it   s dug out for a pond.  So they put a pond in their house decorations?  It has a boat, a moveable boat in it. They   ve got a background of, what, a  sky? Blue sky, I guess is     I looked at so many house decorations last night, I have trouble sorting  them out.  Well, there was talking more about orange around the world and there   s  a deal   there   s a flag from Australia, there   s all sorts of things.  Was there a big globe that was turning?  Yes, there is, right in the center of it. Very, very interesting, and it   s  more interesting when you go around behind and see what makes  everything go.  Did you all have an event at the fraternity house that you were able to  meet the young men that are in the fraternity now?  We always get together at the motel, the last four or five years, and then  we go to the fraternity house and eat, and this is where we get to see   to  meet all the young men that are there. And last night they gave plaques  to the pledge class of     Fifty.  9  Sharp  Anderson  Sharp  Anderson  Sharp  Schultz  Sharp  Anderson  Sharp  Anderson  Neurohr  Sharp  Schultz  Neurohr  Anderson  Neurohr     1950.  Well, fifty years ago.  Yeah.  Fifty-six. Fifty-six.  Pledge class of 1906 or no     1956.  Fifty-six. But, you know, they have a wonderful meal. You can take  your wife, take your kids, your family with you and go in. But you meet  people that   well, they stick out their hand and say,    I   m so and so,     and you don   t have any idea in the world who they are. You know, I met  two last night and if you asked me where they were from or who they  were, I couldn   t tell you, but they knew me, and sometimes it   s good.  Sometimes it   s kind of embarrassing. (Laughter)  But it gives you something to tie to. For example, I used to be with the  Department of Agriculture and at my first southern conference that I  went to, didn   t know anyone. Went my first time and, within an hour  after I was there, I found out that six of the commissioners from the  southern regions of the United States were Alpha Gamma Rho   s and  immediately had a     Had a tie.     a tie.  Is there a strong family legacy with Alpha Gamma Rho? Have you had  other family members who have pledged Alpha Gamma Rho at all, or  have some of your fraternity brothers?  I have two brothers that are both AGRs. In fact, one, Ray, was the  director of the OSU Alumni Association at one time.  None. No other AGRs.  What about you, Mr. Anderson?  I   m the only one.  You   re the only one?  10  Anderson  Neurohr  Anderson  Neurohr  Anderson  Sharp  Anderson  Neurohr  Schultz  Neurohr  Sharp  Neurohr  Schultz  Sharp  Neurohr  Sharp  They wouldn   t let my sister join. (Laughter)  They wouldn   t? Do you have any other thoughts on AGR that you want  to share with us?  Oh, we   re proud of what they   re doing today because, you know,  Homecoming yes, but scholastically they   re at the top, and last year  were rewarded as the top Pi chapter, the top nationally     That   s impressive.     of the AGR.  They   ve had from three to five in the top ten freshmen the last three or  four years. They had two top seniors last year. You know, it   s something  that we   re real proud of. We had a reorganization some ten, twelve years  ago and since that time, they   ve done wonders. They   re the leaders of  tomorrow really.  We   ve got two fraternity brothers that would be here today, but fifty  years ago they were on the OSU, A M livestock judging team that won  the American Royal contest, and so they   re in Kansas City this weekend  being honored at that fiftieth anniversary.  Is the AGR house the same house that you lived in when you were here?  It   s been remodeled and added-on to. No, it   s not the same.  It   s not the same, but it   s in the same location?  It   s the same building. Same location, yes.  So what was it like when you were living there? Were there two people  in a room?  Mostly four or five, and then the dorm had forty-four bunks     It   s a dorm situation. We slept in the dorm, but when we had a room we  had like four desks by five desks or six desks. You changed every  semester, so you would meet and learn to grow with different brothers  each time, each semester.  How many stories is the house?  Two.  11  Neurohr  Sharp  Neurohr  Anderson  Neurohr  Anderson  Neurohr  Sharp  Schultz  Anderson  Neurohr  Anderson  Sharp  Sharp  Anderson  Neurohr  Schultz  Anderson  Schultz  It   s two stories? Is there a basement?  No.  What other traditions do you remember from your time as a student here  at OSU? I know the fraternity was a really big part of your lives and  very rightly so. That is an important connection for the students, and you  all are alumni of an excellent fraternity it sounds like. Were there other  campus activities that you were involved in, or other campus traditions?  Well, I was a member of the Cow Pokes, which you don   t     I don   t know what that is.  They   re not here now.  What are the Cow Pokes?  That   s the men   s pep club, basically.  Don   t they still bang their paddles over there?  They still bang some paddles, but we all had, you know, black hats and  black and white shirts and a cow bell. It was a pep group, and we  followed the football team around to different schools.  How many people were in the group?  We had probably forty to fifty.  Forty or fifty, yeah.  I think each of us     Stole the OU  University of Oklahoma  shotgun and a few things like  that.  Stole the OU shotgun? Oh my.  A megaphone from   was it Kansas or Kansas State? Where did that  come from, that megaphone?  I think that was Kansas State, wasn   t it?  Yeah, it might have been.  12  Neurohr  Schultz  Sharp  Schultz  Sharp  Anderson  Neurohr  Anderson  Neurohr  Schultz  Sharp  Anderson  So what happened to it after you had it? Did someone keep it?  Somebody mailed it back.  Yeah, they got it back, you know. It was just one of those things that  they tried to show their power and we proved to them they had no  power. (Laughter) But I think each of us, you know, whether our major  was   mine was animal science, so I was a member of Block and Bridle.  You were in agronomy     Agronomy Club.  Agronomy Club, and each of us   if we were in a particular major, we  had a club that we were members of.  I was a member of Scabbard and Blade.  And then what was your major?  Ag Education.  Ag Education   and so what career did you go on to with your degree  from OSU?  Just because of the time and the military service obligation, I took  advanced Air Force ROTC and then I went on active duty in the Air  Force. I did not fly, but I worked as a personnel administrative officer,  then as a missile launch officer, and finally as a research and  development engineer primarily on intercontinental ballistic missiles  until I retired from the Air Force in 1980. Since then, I   ve been back on  the family farm   about half retired. (Laughs)  After graduation, I started to work for USDA Crop and Livestock Ag  Estimates in Oklahoma City, and all of the officers were in the state  capitols of every state in the union, so I decided that that wasn   t what I  wanted to do. I then went to work for Cooperative Extension Service. I  started in Coal County and from Coal County to Muskogee County,  from Muskogee County to Antlers, which is Pushmataha County, and  ended up in Carter County as County Director, and retired in 1990. So I  worked with 4-H kids across the state for thirty-five years.  And I busted my knee the last semester, so that   s the reason my year   s  different than the others   had to come back, so I didn   t go into the  military. I ended up as personnel director in a mental health hospital  when I got out. From there I went to the Department of Agriculture and  was active with the Alumni Association. I   ve been on the Athletic  13  Neurohr  Schultz  Sharp  Anderson  Neurohr  Schultz  Anderson  Council and President of the Alumni Association and been involved  from that aspect with the university. I ended up as Assistant  Commissioner of Agriculture for the State of Oklahoma.  What brought you to OSU as a student?  I don   t guess there was any other consideration. There was one guy that  was two years older than I from Billings, Oklahoma that was going to  school down here, and I just knew I wanted to go to college and nobody,  of course, in my family before me had gone to college. Well, actually  my oldest sister had gone to Phillips University in Enid. But he just kind  of stayed after me and brought me down and enrolled me and   like I  say, I never considered going anyplace else.  I grew up in Pawnee, which is twenty-seven miles from here and have  two younger brothers and a sister. My dad was the principal of the  school and he would, you know   back then, that was fifty-five, sixty  years ago, Mom would pop a big sack of popcorn and we   d come to  Oklahoma A M and go to wrestling matches, basketball games, football  games. It cost fifty cents to get in and there was never, ever any other  school considered. You know, my family and their husbands and  spouses   we have thirty-four or thirty-five degrees from OSU so my  blood is as orange as it   ll ever get, you know. It   s not red, it   s orange.  Well, that   s a hard question to answer because it   s kind of like someone  asked me, you know,    When did you learn to ride a horse?    I don   t  know. I just always knew how to ride one. And there was never any  other   I don   t guess I had, other than I started out in junior college at  Northeastern A M because of being on scholarship partially for  livestock judging. And you couldn   t tell it now but on football, you  know   I immediately transferred then to OSU. That was just the route  to go. Now, I guess the schools and some of them push them to go look  at other schools. There wasn   t any other thought about going anywhere  else.  Has your love for OSU deepened as the years go by? Your connection  with the university and how you feel about the university and your  experiences here   has that changed?  Of course, during my career in the Air Force I was out of the State of  Oklahoma, but really didn   t have a close connection to OSU during most  of that time, but during the last twenty-six years, it certainly has,  primarily because of these guys, but     I don   t know whether it has grown more, but I   ve always been involved.  When I lived at Vinita, we used to pick up high school students, my wife  14  Sharp  Neurohr  Anderson  Neurohr  Sharp  Neurohr  Sharp  Neurohr  and I, and haul them down here. We always brought somebody with us  when we   d come game days, some students from Vinita. After I moved  to Edmond, we were involved with the honors banquets in Oklahoma  County and student recruitment and     And you know, that   s a hard question to answer and it is because when  little brother Ray was alumni director here, they had what Charlie had  just mentioned, an honors banquet in each county, with the top ten  percent of the junior class, and every county would have an honors  banquet. Then OSU would come and present a program and these   most  of these kids would come then to OSU, and this really made you proud  because we got the top students in the state of Oklahoma by doing that. I  don   t think they do that anymore and it   s a shame because this was  something that really brought kids here.  Another thing that we   ve not mentioned is each year in the summertime,  4-H Roundup is here and they bring the top twenty or thirty children  from each county in the state. They   re on the campus for three or four  days. I can remember when I was a 4-H   er. Lord, we came to Stillwater,  you know. That was the thing. That was your final reward for that year   s  work, so they still do that and we still get real good students, but back to  your question, does that mean more to you? I think it does. I mean, I  have a season ticket for football, a season ticket for basketball, a season  ticket for wrestling. We are the mainstream, the lifeblood of the  university, and there   s a lot of us in our age group that, they may not  think so, but we do, that if it weren   t for us it wouldn   t be what it really  is. You know, T. Boone Pickens has donated millions and millions of  dollars, but he   s just an active alumni just like the rest of us.  Now, several of you were here during the time that the name of the  university changed, and wonder what you thought about that? When you  started as a freshman student, the university was called     A M.  Oklahoma A M College?  Sophomore year and junior year, and we both have diplomas from OSU  and from Oklahoma A M.  So it changed your senior year?  Yes, ma   am.  What did the class think about that?  15  Schultz  Neurohr  Schultz  Anderson  Neurohr  Schultz  Sharp  Anderson  Neurohr  Anderson  Sharp  I don   t think I had any   now what I mean is,    A rose by any other name  would still smell just as sweet?    I don   t know that it made a lot of  difference to me what the name was. A particular memory I have from it  is that they needed a new song to sing, and it seems to me like there was  a   the head of the music department I guess came up with a new song  right away. There wasn   t much time to do that, and I think it   s still the  one they use today. I   m not sure.  I think that   s correct.  And that   s probably the one single memory I have of that. Like I say, the  name didn   t matter.  I remember riding around on a hay wagon during western week singing,     We don   t give a damn for a state university    cause we   re from A M.     (Laughter)  Do you have any stories about favorite classes or favorite professors  when you were here?  Well, I   d always have to put in a pitch for my faculty advisor in the Soils  Department, Dr. J. Q. Lynd. I understand he still goes to the office every  day, even up till right now. He was certainly a wonderful man and was a  big influence on my life. In fact, he made available an assistantship and I  was able to go on and get a master   s degree under his direction before I  left OSU. I   m sure he   s been a great part of the Oklahoma State  University for all these years.  I think my favorite instructor would probably be Dr. Bob Totusek, who  was in charge of Animal Science for many, many years. He was a fella  that grew up in Garfield County on the farm and he relayed that  relationship to all of his students. You know, everybody was special to  him, and I think that   s one of the things that I can remember him by.  Dr. Totusek was special to me because I carried the crown when I was in  the third grade for him to crown his wife FFA Queen in high school, so  we had a relationship that went back from Garfield, Oklahoma.  Well, do you have any further thoughts about your time here as a student  at Oklahoma State University that you want to share?  Have no regrets. Loved it and enjoyed it. Still do.  Same thing. We   ll be here till the day we die, you know. We   ve lost a  couple of our fraternity brothers since we started, but we live one day at  a time and we   re glad that we   ve had yesterday and we   re looking  16  Anderson  Schultz  Anderson  Neurohr  Sharp  Anderson  forward to tomorrow.  Am I last?  After four years and my graduation from Oklahoma Agricultural and  Mechanical College in 1957, I wasn   t at all tired of going to college. In  fact, I don   t know what could be a better life   and so I suppose I wasn   t  all that anxious to have a master   s degree in agronomy, but that allowed  me to stay another year, and I did. (Laughter) So that   s how well I liked  to go to school here.  It grows on you, to a degree. I lost my wife eight years ago, and when  we buried her, she had an orange pinstripe on her casket.  What advice would you give to students of today? They have computers.  They have e-mail. Most of them have vehicles. It   s changed from when  you were students here, but what kind of advice would you give students  today?  The kids that I   m around in my area of the state, and my wife and I are  associated with several, but I try to tell them that they   re going to the  university to learn, but they also must have a good time. The university  is not study, study, study. Yes, you came to study and you came to pass,  but you also came to learn, to meet someone, to have a good time, to  enjoy yourself while you   re here because if you don   t, it won   t mean  anything to you. You know, we did things together when we were in  school that we won   t tell you about (Laughter) but we had a wonderful,  wonderful time when we were here in school. And, you know, we   ve all  got master   s degrees and yes we made good grades and we made some  bad grades. We made some mistakes, but we   ve got a lot more plusses  than we have minuses.  But the relationships that you get   over the years, I don   t know how  many students I   ve talked to about going to college   wherever you go,  but one of the things   and I   ve been biased in this   is telling them,    Go  to the campus. Get away from the student tour guides. Just walk across  the campus and the campus where you feel a friendly atmosphere     someone saying,    Hello, good morning, how are you,    versus ones that  don   t speak to you   I mean, where you feel comfortable. That   s where  you   re gonna be for four or five years, where you   re gonna enjoy it, and  that   s where you   re gonna build your relationships for the rest of your  life in a lot of ways is out of the associations that you get through the  college here. You have some in high school still, but a lot of it is college  relationships that you will value, and that   s important. Go where you,  you know, will be happy and where you feel comfortable. I   ve always  said that because I   ve always felt walking across our campus is good.  17  Schultz  Sharp  Neurohr  Sharp  Neurohr  Schultz  Anderson  Neurohr  I guess for any college student   I think what they have to do is learn  self-discipline probably almost overnight because when you need to  study, you need to study. But you   re certainly also entitled to enjoy your  life during that time period and you   ve got to do the appropriate things at  the appropriate time because if you   re taking a math class, you   ve got to  do your homework that night and some of these other   at least when I  went to school here, some of the other classes you didn   t have to do your  homework every night, but you did in math and so right away they need  to learn the self-discipline of getting what they have to do and at the  same time make it time for enjoyment.  And you know, we all had children and our relationship together in the  fraternity when   as an example, my personal family   we bring our kids  here. They know where University Street is or they know where  Knoblock is or they know where the Classroom Building is, and our  daughter came here as a freshman knowing where every building was  when she got here because she   d been here at Roundup for 4-H and she  knew the Student Union inside and out, and knew the classrooms. And  she graduated in the top ten out of twenty-two hundred, is a successful  attorney now in Oklahoma City, but her blood is as orange as mine, you  know. They know where everything is on the university before they get  here and there   s so many students that are   their parents are Aggies or  they   re Cowboys and they   d been here forever and they know exactly  where they   re going and what they   re going to do.  What would you say to alumni, the younger alumni in particular, about  staying active with the alumni of the university and the importance of  that?  If the university is going to grow, they have to stay active. I mean, to  me, if you came here, be an active member of the Alumni Association.  Get out and do things. Promote yourself with the university. Wear  orange when everybody else is wearing red, you know. If that   s what it  takes, do it, but have the nerve to get out and do it.  Okay.  I won   t comment on that. That was good enough.  Yeah, you build pride and relationships that you meet day to day and be  it   whether you   re a lawyer or in agriculture or in business, whatever,  you   re going to meet other people who have a   engineers, business and  you cultivate that. It   s something that, you know, just stays with you and  will help you throughout your career.  Okay, the last thing I think I   d like to ask you about is the library. The  18  Sharp  Schultz  Anderson  Neurohr  Sharp  Neurohr  Sharp  Schultz  library was fairly new   library building   when you first came to school  here. Did you spend a little time in the library at all?  Every night. I can remember when Washington Street was a through  street and there was no library when I was a kid growing up, and I  thought that was the worst thing in the world to build a library in the  middle of a street. (Laughs) But, you know, it   to me it was a gathering  place as well as the Student Union was. Good gosh. It was a huge place  when I was there.  Of course, in the one English class you   re forced to learn how to use the  library and do some research and spend some time there. Otherwise,  why I didn   t really spend a lot of time there studying. I generally did that  in the fraternity house. Of course there wasn   t anything there I needed, I  guess, but of course working on the master   s degree again, I had to use it  as a research facility, but as a place to go to study, it wasn   t. Some  people went for the quiet place to study, I didn   t particularly do that a  lot.  We could gather as a group. It   d be a place where we could get   in  agriculture   even from a fraternity, there were several of us to take the  same course so to get away from the activity in the house, we could slip  off over there in their small meeting rooms or places that we could get  together, five, six of us, and, you know, cram for the tests and so forth.  Okay. Any last thoughts you want to share?  Go Pokes. (Laughter)  Okay, well thank you very much for coming today and telling us about  Alpha Gamma Rho and your annual reunion that you have with this  group and how it keeps growing over the years. I think that   s a  wonderful legacy that you   ve started that I   m sure will continue forever  now, and your connection with that and your connection with Oklahoma  State University, and we just really appreciate you coming for the  interview today.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
