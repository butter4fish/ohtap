 Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  My name is David Peters and today is October 16, 2009. I am visiting  with Harold and Betty Welch in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is  for the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. First of all, welcome back for your fiftieth class reunion. Why  did you decide to participate in the reunion?  Well, this is a wonderful university. And we think, of course, it   s one of  the best universities in the state of Oklahoma and in the United States.  We were very anxious to come back here at this time because we  thought we might see some old friends and see some acquaintances and  we wanted to see the new Alumni Building. And like I say, this is a  wonderful occasion for us to come back here to this particular situation.  Well, we haven   t been back here for a little while, for a year or two, and  we wanted to come back and see the new stadium and the alumni  facility. And we hope to run into some old friends.  Can you tell us where you grew up and a little about your early lives?  I grew up in Okeene, Oklahoma. I decided to come to Oklahoma State  University in 1955. This was where I met my wonderful wife of fifty  years. She and I have been going together fifty-three and a-half years.  This was a wonderful place to come to. I decided to be in the field of  education and this is a wonderful occasion that we can come back to this  alumni presentation for the graduates of 1959.  I was going to ask real quickly, growing up in Okeene, what was that  like in the    40s,    50s?  I graduated from high school in 1954 in Okeene and then in 1955, I  5  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  decided to come back over here to Stillwater and     I grew up in Covington, Oklahoma, lived there all my life. Had four  brothers, no sisters, came from a big family. I went to school there,  participated in all activities. And many of my family came to OSU and  graduated from here, uncles, aunts also. So it was just a given that I  come here. I really enjoyed my time here. I met a lot of wonderful  people. And like my husband said, we met here and dated all the way  through school and then married after we graduated. And we   re both  teachers. We are retired teachers.  My father graduated from here in 1931. He had two other brothers that  graduated from here in the 1920s and the later    30s. And just like my  wife said, it was kind of a given thing that I come to Oklahoma State  University. Of course at that time, it was Oklahoma A M. When we  first came here it was A M. They changed the name of the school in  1957 to Oklahoma State University. So actually we   ve attended both  schools. And like I say, we   re very proud to be Oklahoma State  University people and it   s just a wonderful university to be from.  So you started at A M and you finished at OSU?  (Laughter) OSU, that   s correct. We did.  Where are you living now?  Helena, Oklahoma.  Which is located?  Northwest of Enid, thirty-two miles.  What influenced you to enroll at OSU? You   ve kind of covered that with  family ties. Is there anything else that influenced you to attend?  Well, my dad back in the 1940s took me to several Oklahoma A M  football games. Of course Oklahoma A M at that time had one of the  best football teams in the nation. Bob Fennimore, Bobby Reynolds, Neill  Armstrong and all those guys were just excellent football players. And  so my dad would bring me over here to the football games. When I was  nine years old, I got to watch A M beat OU forty-seven to nothing. I  was in the stands that particular day. We came over here one time to a  football game when they played Tulsa, beat Tulsa twelve to six. There  were fifteen thousand people here at that time, that was supposed to be a  big crowd, and my dad carried me on his shoulders to come to the  football game. And that   s one of the things that influenced me to come  6  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  to Oklahoma State University is just because of the atmosphere. It just  had a great atmosphere and I just loved it over here.  And Betty?  Well, a lot of my family came over here and many of my friends and it  was just a given that I go to OSU. I didn   t even think about any other  university, this was it.  So most of your friends also from Covington?  Yes, yes, in fact my roommate was my best friend. At least for that  freshman year, then she moved on. (Laughs)  She was also from Covington?  Yes.  What were your majors?  Social studies: psychology, sociology, American history, economics,  Oklahoma history. I majored in social studies field over here.  And I majored in elementary education.  And both planned to be then teachers, with those degrees?  Yes.  Are there some classes you especially remember well?  I remember B.B. Chapman   s class. He was the Oklahoma State  professor in history over here. He made a big impression on me and I  never will forget. There were three things that he told us that we should  remember. You can take it with you, your information is no better than  your source, and what was the other one, dear?  I don   t know. I wasn   t in the class. (Laughs)  There were three things. I remember the two things. But after fifty-some  years I   ve forgotten the other one. (Laughter)  Always remember the first two, they were most important.  Remember the first two. The information is no better than your source,  you can take it with you, and having knowledge is knowing where to  7  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  find it. Those were the three things he taught us and I never will forget  that.  And for you, Betty, any particular classes?  I liked all of them. I started out in the College of Home Economics.  Then after Harold and I met, he was going to be a teacher and I sort of  wanted to do that, too. My mother was an elementary teacher so I  changed to the School of Education. And I enjoyed all those classes. All  the home ec classes, all the education classes, economic classes, art  classes, we enjoyed all of those. We fully enjoyed the college experience  when we were here.  One of the questions is what faculty member influenced you most.  You   ve already mentioned B.B. Chapman.  Dr. Chapman did.  Any for you, Betty?  I don   t really have a favorite, but there were many that were great.  What buildings were your classes in, do you remember?  Classroom Building, Gunderson Hall, that was the education building.  That was pretty much it for me, wasn   t it? What about you?  I think so.  It was about the same for both of us.  The Classroom Building was a fairly new building then, wasn   t it?  It was a brand new building at that particular   oh, the air-conditioning.  And at that, we didn   t have very many air-conditioned buildings to go  to, but that was really a nice building. Now they   re all air-conditioned.  Did you have any classes in Quonset huts? Because there were still  Quonset huts on campus at that time.  Yes, the military. When I was in ROTC and the Air Force we had to go  to the Quonset hut buildings to have that, I did.  And they weren   t air-conditioned.  Oh, not whatsoever, none of that. No, you had to be tough.  8  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Did they just open up the windows?  Just open up the windows and enjoy yourself as best as you possibly  could.  What were they like in the wintertime?  Terrible. Terrible. (Laughter) Not like it is now. But we came from the  old school, you know. Like I say, we had to walk that ten miles to school  uphill the whole way. That kind of business, you know what I   m talking  about.  Yes. And for you, Betty, the Home Economics Building was new. You  started in home economics.  Yes, it was called the New Home Economics Building so I had classes  there and I had classes in the Old Home Economics Building, the  Classroom Building, Old Central, Williams Hall, some in the old gym. I  remember one year I had a seven o   clock class in Gallagher Hall and it  was in the far corner. We walked from Willard Hall to Gallagher Hall in  the cold. And it was really cold that winter. I   ll never forget that class.  Couldn   t wear slacks, either.  You couldn   t wear slacks then.  Had to wear a dress.  So it was plenty chilly walking to classes.  And it was a seven o   clock class?  Yes.  Barely finished milking the cows at seven o   clock.  That   s right, that   s definitely right.  Where did you live while you were in school?  Well, I lived in Bennett Hall and then I met a lot of guys in Bennett Hall  that belonged to the Lambda Chi fraternity and they encouraged me to  go with the Lambda Chi. I liked it over there so that   s where I finally  ended up was at Lambda Chi, Lambda Chi Alpha. That   s where I spent  most of my time was at Lambda Chi.  9  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  So was that like your sophomore, junior, senior year?  Sophomore, junior, and senior year is about right. That   s correct.  And then the first year at Bennett. Was Bennett air-conditioned?  No, just windows. Just raised the windows. That was the only air-conditioner  we had. And you had a fan, maybe.  Because it was a fairly new dormitory     But no air conditioning.  But it wasn   t air-conditioned.  No, not at that time. Not in the    50s.  And you, Betty?  I lived in Willard Hall the whole time. That   s the only place I lived. And  my husband forgot to tell you about his music classes because he     Yes, I did. I was in music with Cy Perkins and I was in Men   s Glee Club  and I sang with the Men   s Glee Club. And in fact I was a soloist for the  Men   s Glee Club my junior and senior year here at Oklahoma State  University. I forgot to tell you that.  And you sung for the President.  And I sang for the President of the United States, President Eisenhower.  Where did that happen?  They had a convention in Oklahoma City and we sang down there. And  I sang for the President of the United States, President Eisenhower.  How many people were in the Glee Club?  Oh, there were about fifty of us.  All men?  All men. All men   s glee club. Cy Perkins was the director of it at that  particular time.  Were you in all four years then?  10  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  I was all four years in the Glee Club, that   s right.  Had you sung before in high school?  I did a lot of solos in high school and sang for a lot of weddings. I sang  after I got out of college, I sang for a number of weddings. I sing at  church even today still.  Now the Lambda Chi house, is it still where it is today on University?  No, the Lambda Chi house is right down across the road from Theta  Pond.  But I mean is it still the same location where it is today or has it moved?  Well, it was here on Hester Street, 311 Hester, but then they moved it.  They bought the house right across the street from Theta Pond.  So when you were there it was at 311 Hester?  It was still at 311 Hester. That   s right.  That   s not too far from Willard Hall, though.  No, it wasn   t too far at all.  Well for both of you, when you lived at the residence halls, what were  your rooms like? They were both fairly new residence halls. I guess  Willard was probably close to twenty years old by then.  Probably. It was a room about the size of, I   d say it was 12   x14   , it had  two twin beds, it had two desks, two chairs, two chests, two closets, and  one sink. And the bathroom, of course, and shower were down the hall.  And then on the ground floor there was a large living room with little  side rooms where people could go in and visit with people a little bit  more privately. Most of the basement was a cafeteria. It was a huge  cafeteria. We had counselors that served on each floor that kind of  looked after especially freshmen girls. We had a head counselor. Oh,  and we had to be in by eight o   clock weekdays. On Friday and Saturday  night it was midnight and on Sunday night it was 10:30. But once in a  while, about once a year, the Mortar Board had a money-making project  and you could pay a penny a minute to stay out after midnight, so you  could stay out till one o   clock if you paid sixty cents. But they locked  the doors at eight and if you were late getting back, you had to ring the  bell and answer to the counselor. (Laughs)  11  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  One more thing I want to say about having to be in at eight o   clock on  weeknights, I think that was a really good thing, especially for freshman  women. We all thought we were pretty grown up, but we weren   t. We  had to be in and then we had to be studying and they kept track of us and  I   m sure that made our folks a lot more comfortable that we were in the  dorm and fairly safe. Because sometimes when women get away from  home, they go do things they shouldn   t be doing, their parents wouldn   t  want them to be doing. So I think that was really a good thing. I don   t  know if young girls in this day and age would really appreciate having  that close of ties looking after them, but it is really a good thing.  So you didn   t have to be in your room at 8:30 but you had to be back in  the dorm.  Had to be back in the dorm. Now if you were in somebody else   s room,  you needed to let your counselor know where you are so she   ll know  what room you   re in, that you   re in the building.  And what about Harold, for you, was it the same for the boys?  No, not for the boys. The boys could roam around like they wanted to.  But now when I got into the fraternity, you had to make a certain grade  point and they did keep track of you. At that particular time, after you  were there for awhile, you had to date. You had to begin to date girls. So  that   s how I met my wife is I had to have a date. And my cousin, who  was in the same Willard Hall with my wife, they became good friends  and my cousin introduced me to her. I really met her on a blind date. But  then I was attracted to her and she was attracted to me and one thing led  to another. I met her in January but I didn   t start going with her until  March because I didn   t have enough self-confidence that she   d go with  me. So eventually in March, we finally got together and from March  until now we   ve been together for the last fifty-three and a half years. So  it   s been a very good situation.  And you were required to date, I mean     You were required to get a date. So we began looking, this guy and I  began looking. He was a pledge like I was and so we began looking to  date girls on the campus. She was the only girl I ever dated here.  So sometimes it   s good to have requirements, then.  It was good to have the requirement. It was very good.  It was really kind of nice too because he and I dated that whole three and  a half years and as we grew closer, he gave me his fraternity drop and  12  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  then he gave me his pin a year or two later, and then the last year we  were here, he gave me an engagement ring. But every time they would  do something like this, his fraternity would come and serenade that girl  in her living quarters. So at least three times I was serenaded by his  fraternity and they were especially talented in music and just did a  wonderful job.  And we also gave you roses, a dozen roses.  Yes, also I could go out onto the patio and they   d let him present me  with a dozen roses.  At Willard.  At Willard. Well that   s the way they all did in all the girls    living areas.  But anyway, that was memorable. And his fraternity serenaded our dorm  probably three or four times a year, like a holiday time and different  times during the year. So it was really nice and they   d do that at about  10:30 at night when all the girls were in the dorm and we   d all go to the  windows, open the windows, watch them and clap. But it was a lot of  fun. It was really sweet.  Were there other girls in Willard who had boyfriends in the Lambda  house?  Yes, yes. Or other fraternities, too, but of course I was interested in his.  (Laughs)  Were there other Lambda Chi   s who were part of the Glee Club?  Yes, there was.  You mentioned how the singing was     Yes, there was. The Lambda Chi   s had probably one of the best singing  groups on the campus.  Musical.  And there were a lot of guys that were in the Men   s Glee Club from  Lambda Chi. There were five or six of us that were in that thing.  What kind of social activities did the Lambda Chi   s or Willard Hall  sponsor? Did they have dances or other kinds of social activities?  I believe the dorm had two a year: a Christmas dance and a Spring  13  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  dance. And that spring that we met, I asked him to my spring dance. So  he said,    That   s the first time a woman   s ever asked me for a date.     (Laughs)  And I was really happy about that deal. I thought that was fantastic. I   d  never had a woman or never had a girl ask me to go to a dance or  anything like that. And the Lambda Chi   s always had the Hobo dance  and we had the Spring dance and Spring formal. We would invite the  girls over to the house sometimes for dinner and we had a lot of social  activities during that time.  The men wore their black tux, most of the time they were black tux or  sometimes a white jacket. And the girls all wore formals and that   s when  we wore the net formals real full and beautiful and we all had corsages.  His fraternity always gave us some kind of favor to remember the dance  by. I think you had about three a year, I think you had Spring and Hobo  and Christmas.  Yes, I think we did.  They were big formals and a lot of times it was a dinner dance. They  were always really nice, we always enjoyed them. When we had dances  like that, we always had a photographer and they took pictures of  everybody and then later you could buy those pictures. And, of course,  we have a lot of those.  Do you remember the photographer   s name? Was it the guy with the tall  top hat?  Yes, that was the guy in the top hat. That   s who it was.  And they   d have some kind of background set up for that particular  party and it made it really nice.  And we   d go on hayrack rides. We had hayrack rides, and there were all  kinds of activities.  Was PDA, public display of affection, a serious infraction of the rules?  Were there any problems with public displays of affection?  I think it would have been, had any of us done that. (Laughs)  So it just wasn   t done much?  It just wasn   t   we knew you didn   t do that. It wasn   t appropriate.  14  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  During the 1950s we had a moral code and most everybody followed it.  Just like the girls had to be in at a certain time. And that   s not to say that  there wasn   t things that went on, but I   m just saying we had a lot of  good times in the 1950s. I think that was one of the best times that a  person could have grown up. We had good-looking cars, we had morals,  we had values, we had a lot of good codes during the 1950s that we  don   t have today.  People dressed neat.  People dressed nice and neat and they looked good. There wasn   t any  shoddish-looking things. We made it a point to look nice, in the 1950s,  and I wish that would come back to America. We had good morals.  That   s not to say that, like I say, that things went on, but I   m just saying  when you were out in public you didn   t put on any kind of an elicit act  or anything like that.  Do you remember your house mom?  Mother Ruth was our house mother.  I remember them very well. One lady was an unmarried lady and she  was there probably a couple of years. I can   t think of her name right off.  And the second lady was a Mrs. White and she happened to be kind of  from my hometown and her son and I graduated from high school  together. She was real sweet and both of them did real nice jobs. I  thought a lot of them and was glad they were there.  Well you had Mary Jane Hessel.  Oh, and then the counselor on my floor was also one of his classmates  from his high school.  From Okeene.  So, yes, there were some.  Do you still have contact with friends from the Lambda Chi House or  Willard Hall?  I don   t have too many. A lot of them live out of state now and I just  haven   t had too much lately.  Harold?  Well, some of my guys have passed away and passed on. I haven   t seen  15  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  some of my fraternity brothers for a long time. I do see Earl Wagner  every now and then. But so far as having a lot of contact with a lot of  Lambda Chi   s, I don   t have that much anymore.  Do you have any favorite memories of living in the residence halls or the  Lambda Chi house?  My wife and I had a fantastic courtship. We had a fantastic time over  here. We studied together and we had a lot of classes together. Of  course, she was in elementary and I was in secondary, but we had some  classes together. We had probably one of the best experiences at a  university that a couple could ever have here at Oklahoma State  University.  We met a lot of nice people here that we think a lot of and have always  thought a lot of them. My roommate got married after her freshman  year. She and I were good friends in high school, but the rest of the  people that I met and roomed with, some of them were strangers to me  to begin with but we formed real good friendships. We haven   t seen a lot  of those people because one of them   s husband died and she lives down  close to Texas and she never comes for any football games or anything  like that. And another one is a geologist and I don   t know where she is  now. (Laughs) There   s just one that I see very often. But we look at our  yearbooks and it brings back old memories of things we did with those  people and the fun we had.  I remember one incident when I had been to a formal with him and I had  received this beautiful little stuffed animal; it was sitting on my desk.  Well, the next day the alarm went off, and I didn   t want to get up  because I like to sleep so I turned my study lamp around so it wouldn   t  face me, so it wouldn   t be in my eyes. I turned it on but turned it away  from me. Pretty soon my roommate and I began to smell something.  And I had turned that study lamp right into the face of that little stuffed  animal and it was catching on fire. Of course, you could smell it all over  that whole floor on our dorm. And, of course, the counselors and  everything were running around looking for everything. I came out and I  said,    It   s me. It   s me. I   m sorry,    I said,    I think I caught that dog on  fire, but the fire   s out.    And they said,    What   d you do with it?    And I  said,    I ran the sink full of water and stuffed it in the lavatory.    (Laughs)  And they said,    Okay.    But that   s one thing I remember that was kind of  scary. We used to just do all kinds, play jokes and everything on other  girls in the dorm. We used to put rice in their bed, just to be funny, just  to be silly. Or short-sheet them. Anyway, we had a lot of fun.  Doc Pruett is the  photographer   s  name.  16  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  That   s the name. That   s exactly right. Doc Pruett. The top hat and the  whole deal. That was him.  He was the photographer.  Do you have pictures from Doc Pruett?  I don   t know whether I have any pictures of him. It   s too bad we didn   t  bring the pictures that you and I had made. I wish we   d have done that  now.  But you have the pictures he took of you.  Yes, oh yes. We   ve got those pictures. Too bad, I wish you   d have asked  for them, we   d have brought them with us. Because we   ve got some.  That   s great that you still have them. We kind of touched on this earlier,  but during your time Oklahoma A M changed its name to Oklahoma  State University. It joined the Big 8 conference at that time, too. How  did students react to these changes? Do you remember any reactions to  it at all?  They just went about their business and just went on to do their studies.  There wasn   t any big deal about it. It was just one of those transitions  that took place.  I think they were all positive about it. I didn   t hear anything negative at  all about that.  It was a good deal. It helped the university grow. It put us in another  class. Just like the Big 12 today, we   re one in the top elite conferences in  the United States. We were very privileged to get into the Big 8.  Okay, so you saw it as a progression then?  Right, it was a progression. Exactly right.  Do you remember Pistol Pete as the mascot? Was he evident at games  and activities?  Oh, yes. He was then as well as     As he is now, oh yes. He was a big part of it. I mean that really helps a  university. In fact, we think we   ve got one of the best mascots in the Big  12, Pistol Pete.  17  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Because he was fairly new, too.  That   s right. And I   ve got to tell you, when I was in the Oklahoma  history class, Pistol Pete, he visited us. The actual Pistol Pete visited us.  Frank Eaton.  Frank Eaton. He visited our Oklahoma history class and he was about  ninety-five years old, if I remember that. But Dr. Chapman had him  come to our class so we met the actual Pistol Pete.  Was that your freshman or sophomore year?  Probably about junior year, something like that. Sophomore, junior year,  right around that time.  And I met him, too. He came to my class. I wasn   t in the same class, but  that was very interesting.  What was he like? Do you remember what he talked about or is there  anything you remember about Frank Eaton? You said he was old.  Like I say, he was pretty old and he was kind of on the downhill slide at  that particular time because of his age. But it was just amazing though  that he was still around. And you know, he just told some stories about  the old west and things like that. It was very nice to have him though.  Did he still have his pistols with him?  Yes, I think he did. I think he had them.  I think he did.  You   d have trouble getting pistols on campus now.  Oh, yes. Well now you couldn   t do that whatsoever.  Were you involved in Homecomings at all during your time when you  were students? Do you remember Homecoming activities?  We built something there at the house but I can   t remember what it was.  We didn   t have a float.  But you had a house decoration?  House decoration.  18  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  That   s what they had at that particular time.  Did Willard Hall participate?  They did, but they weren   t in it as much as the Greek living groups  were. We did a little bit, but they weren   t in it that big so I didn   t do  much with that.  What were some of the student traditions and activities as you think  back?  Well, we had the Walk Around then, didn   t we?  Yes, we had the Walk Around then.  And we had the parade.  Yes, and we had a cinder track at the old stadium where they would  bring the floats around the cinder track at that particular time.  I don   t think they do that anymore.  They can   t do it anymore because they don   t have a cinder track.  And we had the queens, you know, the queen contest. It was all a lot of  fun. And we may have had some bonfires. Do you remember that?  Yes, we had some bonfires.  Are there other traditions or activities through the year that were kind of  an annual  event , people would look forward to?  Well, during Christmas we would always have a sing. Of course, I was  in the Men   s Glee Club and she was in the Women   s Glee Club and they  would put on a program at that particular time during Christmas.  Varsity Revue.  We had Varsity Revue and things of that particular nature.  I don   t know if I told you this before or not, but when a girl and a boy  got pinned or engaged, they would throw the guy in Theta Pond. So he  was thrown in Theta Pond twice. His fraternity brothers did that, but he  took them with him. (Laughs)  I took some of them with me in the pond.  19  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H.

There were     The O   Colly was about the big thing, wasn   t it, at that particular time.  And then the Redskin came out annually.  Yes.  Annually, that   s right.  Did most people get a Redskin?  Most people got a Redskin. And I   ve heard they don   t have the Redskin  anymore.  Stopped in 1990.  That   s too bad.  I hate that.  Because we go back and look at them. And I really think that Oklahoma  State University is missing a big thing by not bringing that Redskin back.  I think they should. That took a lot of work, but I   ll tell you, it makes a  lot of memories. You know, we   ve been out fifty years but when you  look back at them and you think golly, I was just there the other day. It  makes you really feel good.  The floats and the house decorations at Homecoming were always  fantastic. They were just really something. And we have been up here a  lot of times and gone through the walkthroughs and come up for  Homecoming. Our son graduated and he belonged to a fraternity here. I  think they won second that one year, didn   t they?  Yes.  It was when Barry Sanders was here and he was the star of their float.  But they were just fantastic. I just thought they were unbelievable for  college students to do that well on the floats and house decorations. And  that still is true.  I also served on the Alumni Board of Directors for about three years.  And we used to come to most all the football games and a few of the  basketball games. But when our sons got older, the one wasn   t big  enough to play football here. He loved football and he played at another  20  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  school, so we had to be involved with that. But now that he   s out on his  own and they   re both out on their own and doing their own thing, we  have gone to most, not all, but most all bowl games. We have gone to a  lot of football games down here, too. In fact, our sons are giving us this  weekend for our fiftieth anniversary celebration, our wedding  anniversary celebration. They said,    We want you to do something you  want to do.    We wanted to come back for Homecoming. So that   s what  they did.  You   ve got some good boys.  Yes. (Laughs)  Our boys are fantastic. I mean they really are, they   re great guys, both  boys. They both turned out very well, both our sons.  How old are they?  One is forty-two and the other one is thirty-eight. One   s a vice president  of a bank and the other one   s a head football coach in Lake Jackson,  Texas.  The one that graduated from here said, when he came home from college  and he   d graduated,    Who wouldn   t like to go to school at OSU?  Everybody likes to go to school at OSU. It   s great.    So I thought that  spoke real highly of the University. He was president of his fraternity  and he was on the Greek Council.  Greek Council, yes.  He really enjoyed school here.  That   s where he met his wife, too. His wife   s from Buffalo.  What activities or campus organizations were you involved in? You  mentioned the Alumni Board.  And the Lambda Chi and that   s about it for me, wasn   t it?  Well I was in the teachers    organizations. Mainly that   s what I was in.  What opportunities did you have for leadership roles? Did you ever get  leadership opportunities?  Just the Men   s Glee Club. And that was just about it, wasn   t it?  21  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  What   d you do for fun and entertainment with your friends?  Oh, gosh.  Harold, you sung with the group that goes around. I don   t know what  they call it now, but the group of OSU students that goes around and  entertains.  Oh, the Student Entertainers. Yes, I was a Student Entertainer for  awhile, yes.  Was Ashley Alexander involved?  Ashley Alexander.  Beverly, his wife, was in my Rotary Club.  Oh, is that right? He was really a nice guy and I mean he was an  energetic person and he really loved Oklahoma State University, really  loved it. Well I do too, but I mean he really had that university at heart.  When my wife and I got married, he was the entertainment at our  reception.  Oh, is that right?  Ashley Alexander, yes. So you sang, what other kinds of things did you  do? Were there movies you went to or were there     We went to the basketball games, went to the football games, we went to  the wrestling games, we went to the movies, we went to dances     Studied, went to the library. (Laughs)  Went to the library to study, we did that together.  The Leachman Theater was still open downtown. That   s where a lot of  people went on Friday or Saturday night to a movie. They had a lot of  good movies back in those days.  Was the Campus Theater open on the corner of Knoblock     The Campus Theater     Yes     22  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Yes, where the Hideaway Pizza is now.  The Hideaway Pizza is one place we liked to go too, wasn   t it?  Yes.  And it just started in    57, I think.  That   s exactly right.  It was good.  Where was it located?  On Campus Corner.  Just about a block south and right there on the corner is where it was  located.  From the fire station.  That little building   s still there.  It   s south of the fire station, isn   t it?  So you enjoyed Hideaway Pizza.  Oh, we thought it was one of the best pizzas that they made back in  1957.  Were there many pizza parlors back in    57?  Not very many.  I mean that was kind of a first.  Not very many. That was kind of a first.  Any other student hangouts?  Well the Student Union was always a good place. The fourth floor of the  Student Union was a good place to go. And Hideaway Pizza. What else?  The fourth floor of the Student Union had a Starlight Terrace that some  dances were held or sometimes people would just go in there and dance.  There was also a room that had a jukebox and people liked to go in there  23  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  and jitterbug and things like that. The Union was a nice place to go.  Was the bowling alley in operation?  The bowling alley was in operation.  In the bottom of the Student Union.  And they had a cafeteria then too, didn   t they?  Yes, they had a cafeteria at that particular time, too.  So you did things both on and off campus, but generally fairly close to  campus.  Yes.  Was the Aggie Theater open downtown? Because there was     Yes, it was. It was on down the street. That was open then. I think there  were three theaters here at that time. The one on Campus Corner, the  Leachman, and the Aggie Theater I think is right.  And there was one drive-in, wasn   t there?  And one drive-in, yes.  The East 6th Drive-In or 177 North? Do you remember where?  Out here. Out here by where Red Lobster is where the drive-in theater  was.  It was called the Moonlite Theater.   Okay, I   ve seen pictures of that. You talked about dating, you dated each  other. Are there any things that couples would do as groups?  Well we   d go dancing sometimes and we   d go out and eat sometimes.  We   d go to the ballgames sometimes together, wouldn   t we? Stuff like  that, you know.  You tried to do things that didn   t cost a lot of money. I mean the  ballgames, I believe at that time that was included in our fees, the tickets  to the ballgames. So you did the basketball games and the football  games. And we were at the game when OSU beat Wilt    the Stilt    from  Kansas  University . We had a walkout on Monday. I think that   s the  only walkout we ever had when we were here.  24  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  Yes, that was it.  February of 1957 when they came and played here.  That   s right. That   s exactly right.  Eddie Sutton was on the team.  That   s right.  Eddie Sutton was my husband   s age so he was a student here and played  basketball here.  Yes, he and I are the same age.  And Mel Wright.  Yes, Mel Wright was there.  So the tickets for these athletic events were included with   as a student  you were entitled to go to the athletic     If I remember correctly, yes.  And then whenever we went to the basketball games they had odd-even  games that you could go to. Because at one time not everybody could  get in, so you had odd tickets and even tickets that you could go to the  basketball games with.  And then we had Allied Art programs. It seemed like there was one a  semester, I   m not sure. But they were usually something that was really  good. They were real good shows that they put on. Can you remember  any of them particularly?  No.  They were always somebody that was real popular at the time.  So they were bringing in someone else     Yes.  Yes, like Vaughn Monroe or Tony Bennett or somebody like that.  Fred Waring was     25  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Fred Waring, those guys, exactly right.  And I believe those   weren   t those held in Gallagher Hall?  Gallagher Hall at the time.  And I think there was maybe one a semester.  Yes, one a semester I believe is right.  So they   d bring in a talent.  Yes.  Did you go to wrestling matches at all?  Oh, yes. Gosh, yes. Wrestling was a big thing here.  And they   d fill it, wouldn   t they?  Yes, at that time they could fill it. When we had around seventy-five  hundred people it would be full.  Who was it that was a good wrestler? Was it Johnny Chesbro? No.  No, it was     He was a wrestling coach here after that.  I can   t think of it right now.  Well Doug Chesbro wrestled here and coached at the high school and  then was the coach of the Cowboys.  No, it wasn   t Chesbro, was it?  Griffith would   ve been the wrestling coach in the    50s.  No, this was somebody that I had class with this guy and he was always  talking about the wrestling. (Laughs)  Well you talked about sporting events you attended and the various  teams. Did many students have cars on campus then?  Most of the boys had cars but not very many girls had automobiles.  26  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Maybe one in ten for the girls.  Yes.  We always relied on boyfriends (laughs) to take us around.  The boys had the cars.  Where would they park them?  Well, we had a parking lot at the Lambda Chi house and you could park  out front. They had a big parking lot right here at Willard Hall. Bennett  had a parking place. But most of the fraternities had one behind the  fraternity house. The dorms had one like they did here at Willard Hall.  Were there any restrictions on where you could park on campus?  Oh yes, you   d get a ticket if you didn   t watch where you parked.  Didn   t you have to have a sticker?  Yes, you had to have a sticker. Had to have a sticker, that   s true.  And you were only allowed to park in that     In that particular place.  So you needed to register your car in certain areas then.  Yes, right. Then when I went to the Lambda Chi house, we didn   t have  to do that because I was on private property so to speak. And we never  parked at the university.  And we would walk a lot on campus, wouldn   t we?  Yes, a lot of walking.  Did you go home very much while you were here?  Well, I did because my dad bought me a new car and I said,    Boy, I  really do appreciate this,    and he said,    Yes,    but he said,    There   s one  restriction.    He did work for the Soil Conservation Service, but we  farmed on the weekends. He said,    If I buy this car for you, you   ve got  to come whenever I ask you to come home on the weekends to help me  farm.    And I said,    Okay, that won   t be very hard to do.    So that   s how I  got a brand new car at that particular time. I got a brand new 1955  27  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Country Club Cruiser Nash hardtop, had a Continental on the back of it,  black and white, and that   s how I fell heir to the brand new car was  because of that.  So what kind of farm was it? Wheat?  Farmed wheat at that particular time. We didn   t have cattle because he  worked for the Soil Conservation Service and it was just a lot easier to  grow the wheat because if you had cattle you   ve got to look after them  all the time. So we had mainly wheat. My son and I today still have  cattle, we run several head of cattle right now. And, of course, he works  for the bank and I take hay to them and look after them, I   m still  involved in the cattle right now.  And Betty, did you get back to Covington much?  At the beginning when I was a freshman down here I probably went  home every weekend for about the first month. And then I decided, you  know, I need to stay here. Things happen on the weekend; that   s when  there   s a lot of fun and you can get your studying done and all that. So  then I started staying more. As time went on I stayed more than before. I  got to where I just went home maybe three times during the semester,  because my hometown is only 45 miles from here, and he   d usually take  me. When he had to go home, he   d take me past my house.  Because it was right on the way to Okeene.  So you dropped her off.  Dropped her off and just drive on. Okeene was just seventy-five miles  from here so it worked out really good for both of us. Like I say, it was a  fantastic relationship because everything just worked out great.  How   d you get home your freshman year when you went home every  week? Because you hadn   t met Harold yet.  Well, there were a couple of guys down here that had cars and my  roommate and I would give them two or three dollars to take us home.  They were going home anyway, but at that time that pretty much paid  for their gasoline. So they were glad to have us ride with them.  Do you have any favorite memories of your student experience? You   ve  mentioned so many things     Everything. Everything that we did at the university has been very  memorable. We had a fun time. She and I had a great time together. In  28  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  fact, we talk about this all the time how great a relationship she and I  had and what the university did for us so far as a couple was just a  wonderful experience. And I   ll tell you what, if you don   t go to college,  you   re missing something. If you don   t go to a university, you   re really  missing something because of those experiences that you have. And I  would advise anybody, if they can go to a university to go to school, of  course come to Oklahoma State University, but I mean go, because it   s  just a wonderful life.  It   s a better experience if you can go live there, too, rather than commute  from home.  Oh, yes.  Because when you commute, you don   t get in on anything much. And  you don   t meet as many new people. It   s just a whole new experience  and we always felt like it was a wonderful thing that our parents were  able to put us through college because both of us really, really enjoyed it  and we really enjoy being down here. This is just like old home week  when we come here.  Every time we come over here, it just makes you have a nostalgic  feeling about, this is where we came from.  Is there a special place on campus that has meaning for you? A certain  location? Or just the whole campus?  Just the whole university.  The whole university. Some people mention a certain spot where they     Well, we used to have romantic dinners at Cliff   s Restaurant.  Yes.  (Laughs) I don   t know if that   s still here or not.  No, it   s not there.  But it was the south end of Main Street, wasn   t it? Cliff   s Restaurant. It  was a real nice little restaurant and we   d go there and be alone and talk.  But the whole campus and everything was just great. And the people  were great, instructors.  And when you stay over here, you really become a part of the institution.  You become a part of Oklahoma State University when you get to stay  29  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  here on the campus. That   s why, like she said awhile ago, when you  commute you lose that value. When you stay here on the campus, it  means a lot more to you.  That   s true. Did you spend much time in the library?  Well     As much as we had to. (Laughter)  As much as we had to to get a degree. And we went together, she and I  went together to the library a lot, you know, at that particular time.  We spent quite a bit of time. I mean that was our first priority is to do  our work and get that done. And so we always talked about that first,  whether we needed to go study that evening or whether we had caught  up or     Did many students study in the library?  Yes.  Quite a few did, yes.  I mean if the residence halls aren   t air-conditioned and the library is     Oh, yes. And, of course, they had study rooms up on the fourth floor  where you could go in there if you were working on a term paper or  something, you could just take all your information in there and work on  it. And if you needed to talk with people around you to get your work  done, they had those study rooms up there that were real nice, too.  Did they have typewriters available? Did your papers have to be typed,  do you remember?  Yes.  So where would you find a typewriter? Would you have one in your  room?  You   d just have to have one in your room or pay someone to type it for  you. I don   t believe they had them in the  library . I don   t remember that  they did. If they did you probably had to rent them, because they weren   t  just available. Not that I recall.  What is it about Oklahoma State that sparks such loyalty amongst its  30  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  alums? Do you have any thoughts on that?  Kind of the feeling of family here, I think. And people that go here have  something in common, even when you go out in a restaurant, people will  be friendly and come up and talk to you and make comments about OSU  and it   s just a good family feeling, isn   t it?  A very good family feeling.  And we   ve had so many family that have come here that, you know, we  have a lot to talk about with them, too. And that makes it really great.  Do you remember anything about the administration of President  Willham, who would have been president for most of the time you were  here? Did you have any contact with administration or the deans of your  college? Do you remember those kinds of relationships at all?  We didn   t have a lot of contact with them, did we?  Well, Ida Smith was my advisor and at the particular time that I was  graduating, she said,    Would you like to have a job?    And I said,    Well,  sure I   d like to have a job,    I said,    That   s what I   m supposed to do.     She said,    Well, we   ve got a position, there   s a girl that has become  pregnant, a teacher,    and at that particular time in 1959 if a woman  became pregnant, well she just had to leave. She couldn   t stay and teach  at all; that was just a no-no. She said,    Well, there   s a job opening at  Cushing. Now if you want it, I can get it for you.    And I said,    Okay,    I  said,    I   d like to have the job.    So she, Ida Smith, Ms. Ida Smith is the  very one that helped me get a job in Cushing, Oklahoma. I taught one  semester in Cushing while she was still working on her degree and then,  of course, when she finished well then she and I, we both had jobs in  Cushing.  I   ve got to tell you this. My first salary for being a teacher in the state of  Oklahoma is  3,150. I took home  244.45. And they raised the pay in  Oklahoma City from  3,100 to  3,800. That was a big chunk. Well she  was coming out, she was graduating, but we both had jobs in Cushing  and they were going to pay us  3,400 so I said,    Let   s go to Oklahoma  City and make  800 more between us.    So we decided to do that. So Ida  Smith was kind of responsible for me getting a job in Cushing,  Oklahoma, which helped start my teaching career. We both went down  to Oklahoma City, interviewed, and they hired us in Oklahoma City and  we taught thirteen years down there in Oklahoma City, both of us did.  Can you believe making  244.45? That was my take-home pay at that  particular time.  3,150.  31  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  Yes. My parents had a little jar   I was born in    54 so by    59 I   m five  years old, but I still remember that jar where any change, anything, went  and that was the jar that you didn   t touch because that was going to get  you through.  Yes. See, I can remember what it cost for room and board. At my  fraternity house it cost  75 a month for room and board. I don   t know, I  think Willard was  60 or  65. It cost us about  10 more a month to  belong to a fraternity so far as room and board was concerned, but I  think the room and board at that particular time was either  65 or  something like that in the dorms. I gave  75 a month.  I think mine was  70.  Well, it might have been that.  Did you have jobs while you were on campus?  I didn   t.  Well, no, but I had a job because my dad wanted me to come home and  help him farm and do stuff like that. That was what I had to do. And, of  course, in the summertime, then I would run custom combining and do  the plowing, help do the plowing, and all that business is what I   d do. So  that   s kind of how I made my money.  Any scholarships?  No.  They didn   t give too many scholarships then. They weren   t     I hadn   t heard of scholarships either, so I just was curious.  Very, very few of those. They just started that in about the last twenty to  twenty-five years.  My advisors were the Marsdens and I think they were both doctors, it  was man and wife. I   m pretty sure he was and I think she was. But they  were my advisors my last year and they were very helpful, too, to me.  And this was in the College of Education.  Yes.  Marsden?  32  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  B. Welch  H. Welch  Marsden. I hadn   t thought of that name until just now for a long time.  (Laughs) That   s an old recollection.  Can you tell us about your life and careers after OSU? You mentioned  you started in Cushing and then went to Oklahoma City and were there  for a number of years. What transpired after that?  Well, then our two boys came along. And we didn   t want the boys  growing up in Oklahoma City so we got jobs in Helena, Oklahoma in  the Helena State School for Delinquent Boys. We both taught there. And  my dad owned some land out there and, of course, I helped him farm in  the summertime and during the year sometimes. After we left Oklahoma  City, we went on to Helena and we   ve been there for the last thirty-seven  years.  We got married, then we went to Oklahoma City to teach and we stayed  down there thirteen years and then we moved to Helena because a friend  of his was principal at that boys    training school and he happened to run  into Harold one day and he said,    Would you like to have a job out  here?    And Harold said,    Well, I don   t know,    he said,    My wife would  need one, too.    And he said,    Why don   t you come out and interview,     so we did. And they hired us and we stayed out there   how long were  we there, ten, eleven years?  Yes. We stayed from 1972 to 1982 and then they closed the School for  Delinquent Boys and made a prison out of it now. And we didn   t want to  teach at the prison, so we got other jobs someplace else.  I taught at Ringwood and he taught at Ames and Carrier after that. And  then he got a little tired of   well, Carrier closed and they joined in with  North Enid so he just decided     I could retire.  He could retire anyway. So he started selling cars because he   s always  wanted to do that and I went ahead and taught at Ringwood. He did that  for awhile and then he decided he didn   t want to do that anymore, he   d  just do the ranching and I went ahead and taught at Ringwood. So he had  twenty-eight years of teaching and I had thirty-eight. (Laughs) But our  boys were getting ready to go to college and we needed to have my  income so I waited and I retired early but not as early as he did. And  then we   ve had two sons and they got married and now we have them  and three grandsons. And he   s retired and ranching and we   re really  enjoying life.  We worked for a funeral home for about fifteen years, though.  33  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  B. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  H. Welch  Peters  B. Welch  Peters  H. Welch  Peters  Just off and on.  Off and on, yes.  Which one?  The Lanman Funeral Home in Helena, Oklahoma. They owned four  funeral homes and we     We aren   t embalmers, but we just helped the funerals themselves. And  that was interesting, too.  Are there any words of advice for high school students or college  students today that you can give?  Come to OSU. (Laughs) That   s the first thing. Study hard, figure out  what your aims are, and work hard on them. Have an aim and reach for  it.  Have a goal and go through with it.  Sounds like pretty good advice.  And if you want to get married, be sure you find a person who is  somebody you want to live with the rest of your life. Cause that   s a goal,  too. And you   re likely to find someone here. (Laughs) A lot of nice  people here.  Is there anything else you   d like to add? Anything I didn   t ask you I  should   ve asked you, or any other comments you   d like to make?  Well, when you get ready to go to college, just think about coming to  Oklahoma State University because it   s one of the top-notch colleges in  the United States. And you won   t be sorry that you came here, I   ll  guarantee you that. You   ll have a wonderful life and a wonderful time.  And you   ll be educated by some of the greatest professors in America.  So when you get ready to go, think about coming to Oklahoma State  University, because it   s a great place to be.  That   s a good place to end. Thank you very much.  -------  -------
