 Ahrberg. Today is October15, 2009 and I am visiting  with Jean Rickstrew Pilcher in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is  for the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Welcome, Jean.  Thank you.  We   re glad to have you here for this Women of Willard or WOW  Reunion, as we   re calling it. I   m going to start off this interview and ask  you to tell me about your early life, where you grew up, your family,  your school, your siblings.  Okay, I was born in Guthrie, Oklahoma and my parents lived on a farm.  I was the second in the family. My older sister, Joan, is two years,  twenty days older than I and we lived on this farm until   actually the  Depression kind of wiped out my parents. So we went from the farm to  Stillwater, from Stillwater to   we were in Ripley at one time and then to  Stillwater and then finally to Fort Smith, Arkansas. I started grade  school in Fort Smith, Arkansas. My father was working at a construction  company there. We lived in a little rental house and I know times were  tough. I knew we didn   t have health insurance that everybody worries  about now. I remember having ear infections and then the miracle of  sulfa drugs. Then my father was killed in an accident in, I believe, 1946  when I was in third grade, so at that point we came back to Oklahoma.  My mother started teaching school in Ripley. I had an aunt in that town,  so that   s why we went back to Ripley and grew up and graduated from  school there and came to Oklahoma State.  I know Ripley is very close to Stillwater, but did that influence you, the  proximity, or can you tell us what actually influenced you to come to  OSU?  5  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Well, I thought about OU, too. I was in the band and we took trips to  different schools and I had been to Enid, Phillips University and so forth  and I liked OU, just the physical thing. But I guess my mother went to  Oklahoma A M College and     So, that was kind of the reason then?  Yes.  What year did you enroll?  1955.  When you landed on campus, what were your first impressions of it and  the town of Stillwater in general?  Oh, pretty. I loved Willard. That group that I landed with in Willard Hall  West was just great. One of them was my cousin and my roommate the  first year was from Ripley. She was in my graduating class too, so that  was kind of nice. And my grandfather had lived in Stillwater, so I   d been  to Stillwater a lot. He lived just west of the campus. He was a municipal  judge in Stillwater, so it wasn   t like it was some place new, but of course  college was new. You   re away from home and so forth.  It has a little bit of a different take on it at that time, doesn   t it?  Different from today, that   s for sure. Wow.  So what years did you live in Willard Hall?  I lived there, I believe three years. I lived there my freshman,  sophomore, and junior years. When I started out, I had a job   well both  Frances and I had a job at the PBX Office. We were PBX Operators.     We do not accept inter-dorm calls. You may not call from Willard West  to Willard East.     Can you explain what that is? I do not know what PBX is.  (Laughs) Well this is in the old days before cell phones and all of that.  When you picked up a telephone, they didn   t even have dials on them in  the dorms. So that would light up on this switchboard and you plug into  that and you   d ask them what they wanted to call. If it was Willard  second floor west, they could call Bennett third floor east. But they  couldn   t call within Willard Hall. That was just not permitted. I don   t  know why it wasn   t permitted, but it wasn   t.  6  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  So did you do this operation in Willard or did you do it somewhere on  campus?  No, this was over in   I want to say it was Whitehurst or the top floor of  the science building. There was Willard and then Whitehurst and I can   t  remember what   s behind, but where Arts and Science was at that time.  Was it a large room where everybody just sat there and pulled     Yes. And there would be several of us along the line and I certainly was  not the best operator. I just did that for about six months until I got a job  in the   well it ended up the Registrar   s Office, but the Office of  Admissions. I can   t remember the name of the man who ran Admissions,  but I worked with Wanda van Hook. She was a wonderful lady. And the  gentleman who ran the Office of Admissions died in that year and so  they incorporated Admissions into the Registrar   s Office and I worked  for  Raymond  Girod.  Do you remember what your pay was?  Yes, it was  65 a month during the year, I believe, or maybe that was the  summer. The nice thing was that it was half time in the winter time and  full time in the summer time. I was just doing high school admissions,  you know, tallying up how many credits they had and so forth. I  certainly wasn   t the deciding factor on anything, but it was a nice  clerical job.  How many hours did you work?  Half-time, twenty hours a week.  Was that a struggle for you to get through your job and to do classes?  No, because fortunately since I was in the Registrar   s Office, they  managed that I could arrange my schedule. I could have all my classes in  the morning and work in the afternoon and some Saturday mornings. It  worked really well. I thought that was a wonderful experience for me.  Were you assigned to Willard or did you specifically request to live  there?  I think we requested it. I don   t think we requested which floor, but I  believe Frances and I decided Willard would be the closest   you know,  it would be close to the Student Union. Stout was way out (laughter) and  I think Bennett was   no, not Bennett.  7  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Murray?  Murray. Those were the three choices, basically.  And Frances was your roommate?  Yes, she was my first roommate. Frances Wells from Ripley. She was in  my graduating class.  How big was your graduating class from Ripley?  Oh my goodness, twenty people.  (Laughter) Did they all go to college?  Oh my, no. A lot of them did not at all. No, I would say maybe a fourth  of the class went to college.  When you landed at Willard Hall that day, what were your first  impressions of it?  Well a little bit of chaos with all the moving everything up and so forth,  and,    Oh, I   m sure we   ll get lost     A lot of worries and so forth, but it  was a great experience.  So, did you move all your belongings upstairs with the elevator or did  you take the stairs?  Oh, we took the stairs. We were pretty close to the stairs as I recall   the  second floor, you know, who   s going to wait for the elevator? And, of  course, you didn   t bring microwaves and all the things kids bring now. I  think had a suitcase. I remember I had a sewing machine.  A sewing machine?  Yes, because my sister said,    It   s a good idea to have a sewing  machine.    And she had found this place where we could buy sewing  machines for  50 each. So, I had a sewing machine.  Well, I bet you were pretty popular then.  I   m sure we all used it; I don   t recall that. I gave it to my daughter-in-law  and a part finally broke, so it   s still sitting there waiting for a part.  (Laughs)  I never heard of someone having a sewing machine. What was your  8  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  room like?  We did have a little niche out for a sink and then there were two closets.  We each had a bed. Some people did stack their beds into a bunk, but we  did not because we didn   t have all of those loft things. I think it was  Marilyn Green who always had her bed stacked, which made more room  in your room. We each had a desk. I think I finally had a night table that  a boyfriend made me, but that wasn   t standard.  Were you able to get all your clothes in the closet?  Oh, yes. I didn   t have that much  (Laughs) And I remember at one point  I was   the dorm, I can   t remember what they called it, but they had a  test file for the dorm and I kept that in the closet on the floor and that  was in a foot locker or something like that. So, obviously there was  plenty of room. We weren   t crowded.  Were the rooms hot or cold, did the temperature shift a lot? I know they  didn   t have air conditioning.  Yes, no air conditioning.  Did you have the freeze in the winter or anything like that?  I can remember opening the window a little bit because once they turned  the heat on, the heat was on and it was on until they turned it off in the  spring. So if it was a hot day, that didn   t matter. So you   d raise the  window a little bit. It had what we called a steam heater.  And did you have a fan?  Oh, yes, we did have a fan. (Laughs)  That was a priority. You had to have that.  I think we started out on the west. Our first room was on the west side of  the hall, so that was hot in the afternoons in the fall because you get the  west sun.  Did you live in the same room the whole three years?  No, I shifted around and shifted roommates every year. I can   t remember  if Frances was there the second year or not, but Frances was my first  roommate. I believe Harriet Wright was my second roommate (she   ll be  here for the reunion), and Susie Westfall from Perkins was my third  roommate.  9  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  What was it like to have a personal conversation on the floor phone?  I don   t think I ever did. I think the only conversations you ever had was  just to maybe make a date.  So, you didn   t use the floor phone much?  I did not, no.  Was it heavily used by other people?  Yes, there were some people, obviously, that were very popular.  So, they would get the phone calls. And when the phone rang who would  go get the phone?  Whoever was closest or had their clothes on or whatever the case may  be. (Laughter)  Did the phone ring late at night or did they shut them down?  They shut them down. We had quiet hours from eight to ten and I think  they maybe let the phones ring from ten to eleven and then that was it.  And I can remember, I think we had to be in the dorm by eight o   clock  through the week because when Frances and I worked the PBX,  sometimes we had evening hours and then we would have to ring the  doorbell and the lady would come and let us in. They would even save  our dinners downstairs because Willard wasn   t an open cafeteria, that  first year anyway, and they would put our dinner on for us. (Laughs)  Was the food good there?  Oh, it was okay. I don   t think it was    Just dorm food, yes.  But you ate all free meals there?  Yes, at that point that was just part of the package deal, except I think  they didn   t have anything on Sunday night.  Where would you go on Sunday night?  Probably over to the Student Union and eat. You could get a grilled  cheese sandwich for fifteen cents and a glass of milk, a little carton of  milk for ten cents.  Was there a common shower and restroom area?  10  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Yes.  How many women shared the facility and what was that like?  Well, it seemed okay. The toilets were private. We never seemed to have  to stand in line. I guess people got up at different times and it always  worked okay. I know we were always urged to wear shower shoes  because you didn   t want to get, what     Plantars wart?  No, something else. Athlete   s foot. There weren   t very many bath tubs. I  think there were just a couple of bathtubs in there.  Was there ever a line to get to the showers at a particular time?  I can   t remember any. But I was always kind of out of sync with  everybody else. I liked to go to bed early. I always have. (Laughs) They  were still up playing bridge and so forth, you know, and then I got up  early because I always had an eight o   clock class.  You talked about the different hours. Did everybody have to be in bed by  a certain time   lights out?  Well, it was quiet hours after eleven. I think you could stay up as long as  you wanted. But they did come in and check your room. That   s right, I  forgot that they had bed check. (Laughter) So, your RA would come in  and check on you.  What would happen if you weren   t in your room?  Well, I suppose if you weren   t in your room as long as they made sure  you were in the dorm, that was okay. Now if you were missing, then that  would be a problem.  Do you know what the penalty was?  Some people just disappeared, but (laughter) we didn   t know much  about that. People didn   t talk about things as much back then.  Was Willard considered to be more of the popular or prestigious hall at  that time?  I think Stout was supposed to be the most prestigious hall.  Why would you say that?  11  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Because it was the newest and it was the closest to sorority row.  Okay, so a lot of sorority girls lived in there.  Yes.  In your mind, what set Willard apart from the other women   s halls in the  late 1950s?  Well, for my choice it was basically location. That would be easiest to  get around because everybody was walking. We didn   t have cars or  anything. Then I knew that my cousin was there and she had been there  because she was a year older than I. So everything sort of came together  that Willard would be best. I was trying to remember   I think my sister  probably lived in Willard. I know she lived up on the fourth floor. She  went one year to Oklahoma State and then she got married.  Now were you both in the dorm at the same time?  No, no. She was there two years before me.  Well, I   m going to talk about some of the traditions that I   ve heard about  Willard and I   ll see if you can remember any of these. Was there a  Willard Beach there at the time you were there?  Not that I know of.  Some of them have mentioned about going through the second floor  window and laying out.  Oh, I think they maybe did on the roof of the entry. Yes, I was not a  participant (laughs) in that.  What about some of the Christmas traditions? Did they have a tree that  you would decorate? Or sing Christmas carols?  Yes, down in the main   yes. And a piano they had down there.  Did somebody lead that? Was there a particular person?  I   m sure there was a dorm head girl or somebody who was responsible  for pulling all that together.  How about Willard, was it pretty active on campus? Did it participate in  Homecoming events and contests? Did the girls come together and do  that kind of thing?  12  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  I   m trying to remember. I think we must have done a float at one of the  Homecomings. They were always kind of anticlimactic. Of course, the  teams were never any good. (Laughs) They could hardly get people to  go to the games.  Can you recall what happened when someone in Willard became  engaged, did they have a candlelight  vigil ?  Certainly, if there was a fraternity involved, they came over and  serenaded and so forth. They even did that for pinning and that was kind  of the pre-engagement, I think. Other than that I don   t remember much. I  remember panty raids.  Oh, tell us a little bit about those.  I was trying to think why we had panty raids, but I     Well, I know in 1955 there was, I guess, a very famous panty raid on  Willard.  Yes, and I can   t remember who came or anything, but I can remember  being a little frightened and a little stimulated. (Laughter)  Did you ever see any of the Willard scrapbooks laying around or  working on those?  Yes, I think those were down in the main area.  Did anybody work on them?  No, I just saw them lying around. I don   t remember anybody doing that.  What were the residence hall hours like?  I don   t know what the opening was in the early morning, but I just know  they closed the doors at eight o   clock through the week. Now on the  weekend, I believe Saturday night, it may have been ten or eleven.  Maybe eleven. We had some dances that went pretty late, I mean most  have gone until twelve, so maybe you had to have told them that you  were going to do that. You could also sign out to go to somebody   s  house. I had an aunt in town and I can remember one party, Phyllis and I  asked Aunt Hank if we could come over and stay at her house that night  instead of going back to the dorm and she let us.  But you had to sign out and let them know where you were going to be?  13  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Yes, yes, exactly. It was all in loco parentis back then, it is not anymore.  Do you remember if there were any penalties for coming in late past  curfew?  There were, but I don   t know what they were. I never     Didn   t have that problem?  I didn   t.  Was there a dress code in the hall?  Let   s see.  Were you allowed to wear jeans or were there     No, I don   t think you had to wear a dress. I   ll have to look at some of  those pictures, but I   m sure we wore jeans and shorts and pajamas. And I  can even remember there was one girl that would go to the phone  without any clothes on (laughs) or, you know, a towel.  Yes. Well, that   s interesting. Were the women allowed to come  downstairs in the living area in their pajamas?  No, I would say no.  So, they always had to be fully clothed before they came downstairs.  Yes, I   d say that casual stuff was up on the floor. You didn   t go to  breakfast in your pajamas or anything casual.  Was there any public display of affection, PDA? Was it considered a  serious infraction if it was done in Willard or in front of the house or the  dorms?  Usually you   re saying goodnight to your date right outside the door. I  think there was some kissing and so forth.  Nobody came out and shooed them away?  No, I don   t think so.  Do you remember anything about the dorm moms?  I   d like to remember her name. I remember that she was the one that told  14  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  me that   I want to call him Mr. Anderson, but I don   t think that   s  right   the gentleman who was the Admissions Director that died. She  called me and told me that. Generally it was RAs up on the floor that  handled everything and the mom was just there to talk to parents or     They lived in the dorms though, right?  Yes, yes. She had an apartment right there.  Did you pretty much have the same dorm mom every year?  No, I think she was pretty much there most of the time.  What were some of the special hall events and activities that you  remember? Your particular floor, did it do anything a little bit different  than the other floors? Did you all have contests between floors?  I think we did have some contests, but I   ll be darned if I can remember  what they were. Yes, I can kind of remember our getting stirred up and  wanting to    (Laughs)  Did you all participate in intramural sports?  I did not.  Do you have anything that really stands out in your mind? Was there a  particular party that you had that really stood out that you recall?  Nope. (Laughs)  You had to work, so were there any tough times for you when you were  in Willard?  Not really that I remember. I was just kind of a routine sort of person.  Was there any diversity in Willard? Were there any ethnic or  international students that lived in the dorms with you at that time?  Wow, that   s a good question. Not any on our floor, but I do remember  there was one room at the end of the hall which was a single room. I  think she was a graduate student or something, but I don   t think she was  from another country. But I was very interested and I joined the Latin  American Club   I dated a couple of guys from the Middle East early on,  so through the clubs, I think, there was more diversity on campus.  Tell us some of the other organizations that you were involved in.  15  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Oh, I got in the square dance club for awhile (laughs) because I was  reminiscing with Frances, I did see her a couple of spring breaks ago.  She came down and we had gone to the state square dance festival, if  you can imagine how insane that was, with these two guys. And I just  remember how exhausting that was to spend the whole day square  dancing   wow. (Laughs)  Were your dates in the rodeo club?  They were in the square dance club. They might have been in the rodeo  club, too. They were a pair of twins   I can   t remember their names or  anything else. They probably were Ag majors, yes.  So you said you did the square dance thing, what other things?  Square dance, Latin American. I don   t think I was in any political and  yet it seems like to me I was, but I can   t remember. It would have been  some independent student group.  Talking about political, what was the campus like, let   s see, in 1955  President Eisenhower was in office?  Yes, but everything in Oklahoma at that time, at least according to my  feeling, was democrat. I mean everybody in Oklahoma was a Democrat.  That was one of the things that attracted me to my husband was we were  in the same history class together. He was going for his master   s and I  was a junior that year. And when I met him the summer after that and  we were discussing politics, I found out he was interested in republicans  and I said,    Oh my goodness, I didn   t know there were any  Republicans     And the rest is history.  So, there wasn   t a lot of political, nobody was protesting at that time?  No, that was to come. I can remember a couple of sort of scandals with  The O   Colly,that The O   Collegian wrote some things that maybe they  got slapped down for. They were probably the most, you know,  journalistic.  So, they were kind of upset with some of the things they wrote.  Yes.  The administration was.  Exactly.  16  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Were you active in Willard or OSU women   s residence hall  associations?  No.  Did you hold a hall or floor position?  No, I did not.  You said you didn   t work in the dorm as a floor assistant?  No.  Can you tell us why you think these women of Willard stayed so close  through the years and continue to have reunions even fifty years later?  Well, I don   t know, because this is my first reunion   Oh, okay. That   s neat.  Some of us have exchanged Christmas cards, but I     So, this is really a special time then for you, this is your first time. Well,  that   s great, but obviously because you have stayed in contact with them,  you have some kind of special bond. Can you explain why you think that  is, why you   ve been able to stay in contact with the people you have?  No, I don   t know. I think we were just kind of all the same sort of folks.  (Laughs)  Well some people have expressed that they think it   s because they were  all from small towns. Some of them said that 4-H was a big bonding  thing.  Okay, and I was not in 4-H.  But maybe because it was a unique time and you were up there on the  second floor.  I think it was a very good time to be in college. Later was tougher. Well  the kids had more fun later, I suppose, but I don   t think they learned as  much.  So, this is your first reunion that you participated in?  Right.  17  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Well, congratulations. That is so cool. Since you have been close to the  OSU campus, you probably remember when Willard was converted to  administrative use.  Well actually, I suppose I was aware, but when did that happen?  It doesn   t say in here. I don   t know.  Because I left here in    59. We went to Illinois for four years. George got  his PhD and then we came back here. He was on the history faculty for  two years and then we went to Colorado. So it may have been during  that time, but I don   t know.  Okay, but you do know that it   s no longer a dorm.  Okay, (laughter) you just told me that, so.  It   s no longer a dorm. So, how do you feel about that, that they no  longer continue to use it as a dorm?  Oh, that makes sense. Administrators take over the world. (Laughter)  Have you seen any of the new residence halls?  No, I haven   t. I   ve seen residence halls at Michigan State and so forth,  but no.  How do those compare to what you see at Willard Hall?  Oh my goodness, Michigan State   well this was several years ago,  rooms, suites, co-ed. I think that would be much harder. (Laughs) I think  it was much easier for us. And that may be, too, why we   re good friends.  Because you had to come out of your rooms and meet in the hall, share a  bathroom.  Exactly. You couldn   t just go hide.  I   m going to talk a little bit about OSU in general and ask you a few  questions. Let   s start off with the new buildings on campus by the time  you were in school. The Student Union was new. The library was new.  Classroom Building was new. Stout Hall was new.  Did you go to the library a lot?  18  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Oh my, yes. Of course.  Okay, tell us a little bit about your use of the library and how that maybe  affected your study habits and so forth.  Well that was probably where I did most of my studying, was in the  library.  Was it quiet or crowded?  There was room. There were a lot of people there. It was always busy,  but for instance, you had books that were on reserve especially for  history classes. I usually filled up all my schedule. What would you call  it? For my optional classes I took history classes because you could get  more credit for them and I was interested, so that required a lot of time  in the library.  What about the Student Union, did you use it a lot?  Library to Student Union for a break and then back to the library.  Well, I   m going to jump back here for a minute and then I   ll go back to  where we were. Can you share some highlights of your life after leaving  OSU and where are you currently living?  Well let   s see, left OSU and went to Illinois. My husband got his PhD in  history at Illinois and I taught elementary school at Flossie Wiley  Elementary School in Urbana, Illinois. And then upon graduation, we  came back to Stillwater. He taught at the University and I taught at first  Jefferson Elementary School and then Lincoln. Then, at that point, we  moved to Colorado. He was hired by the history department there. We  spent seventeen to eighteen years in Colorado. Built a nice house in the  mountains, had a son, adopted a daughter, took a Fulbright appointment  to teach in France. So we spent a year in France, same year my son  would have been in the first grade so he went to first grade in France,  which was (laughs) kind of hard for him, but it was lots of fun for us.  Then we came back to Colorado and then in the early    70s I started  teaching in Longmont, Colorado as the children were both in school.  Then we went to Muncie, Indiana. George wanted to try his hand at  being an administrator and he was an administrator for awhile and he  was a history professor again, then had many medical problems so  retired as soon we could and built a house in Hilton Head, South  Carolina.  Oh, how wonderful.  19  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  And moved down there close to my sister (about a half mile) in a  beautiful community on the golf courses and we played golf and had a  good time until he died.  I   m so sorry. Well during those years were you able to get back to  Stillwater at all?  Oh, yes, we came back because my aunt Margaret was here in Stillwater.  So we came back two or three times a year to see her. So I   ve always  had a connection with Stillwater, but I haven   t done the alumni stuff.  After that in Hilton Head, right after my husband died, then my son met  this girl from Peru and they got married. My sister and I both went down  to Peru with them for their Peruvian wedding. They had an American  wedding and a Peruvian wedding. So we met her family.  Now your children aren   t OSU graduates?  No, my son went to Michigan State and my daughter went to Ball State.  I have since sold my house in Hilton Head and moved to Texas. They  asked me to come live with them and so I came and we lived in a little  house until we could find the right house to build and we built a house  together.  What   s it like to come back to Stillwater? Has it changed a lot through  the campus?  Well I drove up Jardot and I was amazed at how many new groupings of  houses there are, subdivisions or additions or whatever we call them  here.  Have you been on campus yet to see all of the new construction?  No, not at this time.  Well I hope you get to see it. It   s pretty impressive.  Well, Aunt Margaret was in the north end of Stillwater, so I would drive  through the campus, but never really stopped and walked around.  What year did you graduate?     59.  And your major, again, was?  Well I ended up in Elementary Education.  20  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  President Willham was your president then.  That   s correct.  Do you remember anything particular about him that stood out?  No, I don   t believe I do. I remember lots of stories about Bennett, all the  Magnolia trees and, of course, I think he got Oklahoma State, Oklahoma  A M connected to Ethiopia and USAID.  Well what I   ve heard of President Willham is that he tried to learn every  student   s name, which I was very impressed  with that . Do you  remember how large the campus was?  Oh, it wasn   t that big.  Were there any classes that you especially remember? Or any professors  that particularly stand out?  I can remember a Professor Smith. (Laughs) I think she was Ida T.  Smith. My gosh, that just came back to me. She was a professor of  elementary education and she worked you hard.  Too hard? What letter grade did you get in her class?  I believe I got an A, but I worked like heck for it. (Laughter) I remember  LeRoy Fischer. He was a wonderful history teacher and I took every  class he ever taught that I could take.  I had him, too. He was a wonderful professor.  Theodore Agnew, also excellent.  What were some of the traditions or other important activities of your  era that you remember on campus?  Well, I do remember Homecoming parades and we went to most of the  football games because your tickets were included with your tuition, you  know. You couldn   t go to all the basketball games. There were too many  students, so we could go to half of them. I believe that   s right. Then they  always had some musical things that I can remember,    Jazz at the  Philharmonic    and some other things like that.  Were you a big Elvis fan?  No. (Laughs)  21  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Didn   t like Elvis?  Oh, I didn   t not like him.  So, what did you like to listen to? What was the music you liked to dance  to?     The Twelfth of Never     by Johnny Mathis . (Laughs) Just old soft. I do  remember the Bunny Hop was popular then.  Did you go to the dances?  I went to some.  What were the popular hangouts on campus and off campus?  Well as far as I was concerned it was always the Student Union. Yes,  there was a place up on the fourth floor where there were booths all  around and a dance floor in the middle and you just go and have cokes.  Of course everything was dry then. I mean I   m sure the campus still is,  but Oklahoma was dry so you had no problem with anything like that.  Did you hear of the Hideaway restaurant when you were here?  Oh yes, that opened up in a different place than where it is now. I think  that probably opened up about my last year, so probably about    58,    59.  So, did you eat pizza?  Yes.  Was that your first time to eat pizza?  I believe it was, yes. Little checkered table cloths.  Do you remember, were there a lot of students upset at the time that  Oklahoma A M changed the name to OSU, Oklahoma State University?  I don   t remember anybody being upset about it. (Laughs) Maybe some  of the people in the Registrar   s Office because they had to re-stamp all  that paper  Speaking of the Registrar   s Office, Leah Schedler  was  Assistant Registrar . Girod was the registrar, but she was in charge of  keeping track of all the grades and signed every one of those transcripts.  A lot of paperwork back then.  22  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Ahrberg  Pilcher  Yes. I can remember Raymond Girod was really big into IBM. They did  those punch cards, you know (laughs), running them through those  machines and everybody was sitting around saying,    Hmm, hmm,    so  that was the beginning of that.  Are there any other memories that really stand out that you would like to  share with us? Something that you thought about coming to this  interview or coming back to Stillwater for this first time reunion?  Theta Pond. (Laughs) It was a nice place to walk and hang out.  Did they have the ducks there?  That was the place to go and neck a little bit. (Laughs)  Did they have the fountain going in it?  I don   t remember that if they did. I don   t think so.  Well, I just want to thank you so much for sharing your memories with  us. It   s been a pleasure to meet you and thank you so much for coming  and spending a little time with us.  Thank you.  -------  -------
