Speaker 2: Service is the price you pay for it, occupying your space on Earth.
Story_ID: 620537
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [George Roberts, Jr.] side. But we'll start with your mother's side first, so we don't get mixed up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Velma, V-E-L-M-A; Ruddell, R-U-D-D-E-L-L; Morrison, M-O-R-R-I-S-O-N [Velma Morrison Young].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth September 7th, 1918.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where did she live?
Speaker 2: She was born in Montgomery, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  Do they all, do you trace that side back to Alabama or does it go to another state? Do you know?
Speaker 2: The most I know is about her, okay, her mother's [Aileen Morrison] side.  Her mother was in Alabama.  It's my understanding that my grandmother was part Indian [Native American] and her mother was full-blooded Indian and died in childbirth when my grandmother was born, and so my grandmother's father remarried and that side of the family was, you know, sort of the step-family, the Malones [ph.].  So, I don't know much about my mother's grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay now, do you know what Indian root?
Speaker 2: That area, I want to say, it's not Cherokee.  I did look that up once before.  It's more Seminole.  Florida, coming up, they have a southern area Indian group (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh okay, okay. Now (unclear), you said, were they from, you said from Florida?
Speaker 2: I mean, yeah, they came up from Florida--
Speaker 1: From Florida, from southern, right--
Speaker 2: --but she was in, she came up from Florida, Alabama, that area.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay. (Unclear) okay. Now, okay, go--
Speaker 2: And in terms of my mother's father, Joseph Paul Morrison [Joseph Morrison], he was born into a family of about, I think it was about eight children, six boys and two girls, and they lived in southern Illinois, this is my mother's father, they lived in southern Illinois, the Cairo, Illinois area before he moved to the Chicago [Illinois] area.  He worked for the Postal Service [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] here in Chicago, and very active community leader.  The earliest memories I have of him were church activities and things like that; a person really dedicated to education.  He took a keen interest in what we did in school, and so on.  The most interesting thing about him was that his mother, my great-grandmother, lived to be 110 years old, even though Granddaddy died of a heart attack at sixty-four.
Speaker 1: What was your great-grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Mary Smith [Mary Smith Morrison], and she married Abraham Morrison.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your great-grandfather was Abraham Morrison.
Speaker 2: That's correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 620538
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about them in southern Illinois?
Speaker 2: Not really, I don't, not really.  I don't know a lot about Cairo [Illinois], or what happened before they came to Chicago [Illinois].  I do remember grandmother [Dodd's maternal great-grandmother, Mary Smith Morrison] from them having a great celebration for her when she became 100, and even--
Speaker 1: What, what year was that?  To give us some idea how old she was.
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  I believe that was in the '70s [1970s]. I knew the exact date.
Speaker 1: So, that was in the '70s [1970s]? That actually would mean that her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was 110 about then.
Speaker 1: Her mother and father were born during slavery.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Abraham Morrison was--
Speaker 2: I think Granddaddy's [Dodd's maternal grandfather, Joseph Morrison] birthday was 1898, yeah '98 [1898], that's right, because my mother [Velma Morrison Young] was born in 1918.  So, yes.  They, they, they were, it was slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Eighteen ninety-eight [1898], yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they migrated to the North and southern Illinois and then on to Chicago.  The reason why my mother was born in Montgomery, Alabama, was simply that even though Granddaddy and Grandmother [Aileen Morrison] were in Cairo at the time, my grandmother went home to Montgomery, Alabama, to have the baby and then she came back, so, she was still a little pampered then, I guess, 'cause my mother was the oldest of four siblings that she had, yeah.
Speaker 1: I hear that story a lot where women in those days go back home and have a baby.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  She was particularly concerned because, you know, her own mother died in childbirth having her, so that was the situation for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did your mother, so she didn't grow up in Montgomery.  She was born there.
Speaker 2: No, my mother actually grew up in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She attended Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois] and I think she graduated around 1936.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's when Englewood was integrated (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Englewood was, yeah, actually there were just a few blacks there at the time, you know.  If you look at our yearbook, it was just starting to integrate at that high school.  At that time, most of the blacks in Chicago went to Wendell Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois], so to live in the Englewood area and to attend that high school was a tremendous opportunity for her.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, we interviewed Mr. LeRoy Winbush [HistoryMaker LeRoy Winbush]--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --yeah, he went to Englewood at about the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The fire family, there were firemen in the family?  The Winbush family?
Speaker 1: Not the fireman Winbush, but he's a graphic designer.
Speaker 2: Not that one? Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Every year he swims in the Chicago River on January 1st, and stuff.
Speaker 2: Oh okay, oh boy.
Speaker 1: He's part of the group that does that.  He's a famous artist and designer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He was like a pre-advertiser, I guess, person.
Speaker 2: I see, oh, okay.
Speaker 1: But he went to Englewood back--I think around the same time.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: I think yeah, about the same time.   I don't know if he's related to the other Winbushes or not, to tell the truth.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, because that's a big family with deep Chicago roots.
Speaker 1: Englewood was like one of the premiere neighborhoods on the South Side in those days.
Speaker 2: At that time, it was.  I mean, working for the Postal Service [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] was the premiere job too, you know.
Story_ID: 620539
Speaker 1: Did she actually live in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] when she went to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because she talked about how Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois], they, they would have ice skating, all the activities they would have over in Washington Park for the kids, the duck pond there, and how beautiful, you know, the area was.  I think she went to Burke Elementary School [Edmund Burke Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], which is also near that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was just a different South Side [Chicago, Illinois] from what you would see today, you know, even though they are refurbishing it and trying to bring it back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your mother [Velma Morrison Young] went to Englewood.  Now was she able to go to college?
Speaker 2: No, because the interesting fact is my, my mother, she married at, what, twenty, and there were four of us born at that age, twenty-seven, my mother was widowed.  My dad [George Roberts, Jr.] died, and I'll tell you about that when we go into his history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, here she was an educated woman with four young children and it was kind of difficult.  My earliest memories of that time was periodically when she held a job, a relative keeping the four of us and so it was kind of difficult at the time to work. And once we started school and so on, she went on to take a job with Campbell's Soup [Campbell Soup Company], but pretty much she was not able to go to college.  She was a prolific reader and a person who really stressed education and so I guess because she was unable to go to college herself.
Story_ID: 620540
Speaker 1: Now let me turn to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: George Roberts, Jr.  He was born in Charleston, Missouri.  He was an only child to Molly [Molly Roberts] and George Roberts [George Roberts, Sr.].  Charleston, Missouri, interestingly enough, was pretty close to Cairo, Illinois, the area where my [maternal] grandfather [Joseph Morrison] grew up, and I was told, I didn't know, that Charleston was really a small cotton town, you know, all they had was cotton fields there and the family moved to Chicago [Illinois] and that's where my mother [Velma Morrison Young] met my father.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the year of your father's birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1916.  I think it was, I want to say August of 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So the family moved, well, well, the first thing is how much do you know about his side of the family?  Did you know much about--?
Speaker 2: No, because he was an only child.  And when he moved to Chicago, he married my mom and they, they settled on the South Side of Chicago.  He worked for the Ward Baking Company [Chicago, Illinois] and he became ill at that time, tuberculosis was a tough--was taking its toll on the community and he died.  I was born in 1944 of September and he died in May, May 17th, 1945, so I was barely a year old.  I was the youngest of those first four children when he passed.  I think my mother was about twenty-seven, and he was thirty, thirty-one, or something like that, when he passed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, tuberculosis would, you know, take its toll, that's--so you, you really didn't know your father, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't know him at all.  Only the memories and the stories that my mother would tell us.  With him being an only child, it's my understanding that the parents moved back to Missouri even though they had a lot of cousins, and looking at his obituary, all they mentioned is the mother, the father, some cousins, and mainly our family, you know, my mother, her sisters, and then--so evidently it was a small family and there was no tracking after that.  My brother attempted to do some tracking of the family, but I'd have to ask him where he got, how far he got with that.  He never shared the information with me because he said that he got to a stumbling block because he had paid once before.  You know how they have these people online that will chase your ancestry and after forty-nine dollars he didn't get the information, but he said he was going to try to get something more reliable on it so, and we will see (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. So, so you're, Charleston was like a cotton town, like southern Illinois.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Father worked for a baking company when he was here in Chicago, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: When he came to Chicago he worked at the Ward Baking Company, which is on, it was in, what? 55th Street [sic. 57th Street], that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Garfield Boulevard area (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the big one on Garfield, okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 620541
Speaker 1: He didn't have any cousins here either, I mean, or very few, yeah(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: No, no uncles and aunts.  Let's see, so, when you think about, you know, well, is there a story about how your parents [Velma Morrison Young and George Roberts, Jr.] met?  Did they tell you how they met?  Did your mother tell (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother--the, the most I've heard is my mother talks about right after high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] she was at a party and how everyone there was raving about this handsome young man, and so on and so forth, and she was so surprised that he spent a lot of time talking to her and, and they just got to be good friends and two years later they were married, so--.  That's the most I've gotten out of it.  I can remember as a kid my brothers and sisters and I, we would sit around and go through the pictures of my dad, a very proud, a very handsome man, and we'd sit there and look at the pictures and read the obituary and go through our little crying session, so, you know, it was like we--I just didn't know, but my Granddaddy [Dodd's maternal grandfather, Joseph Morrison], that's why when I speak of my granddad, he was such a strong force.  He was very close to my mother because of what she was going through, even though my aunts, his other daughters, they had husbands and they had families that were intact, Granddaddy spent a lot of time taking us places, doing cultural things with us, really enforcing the importance of education, attending things at our school, always instilling pride in what you do at school, and so on, so.  And then my mother was a really, really strong independent woman.  And I say that because around that time, my granddad and, well shortly after my father passed, my granddad and my grandmother [Aileen Morrison] divorced and my grandmother moved to Cleveland [Ohio] and when my dad died, my grandmother asked could she raise my older sister and brother [Aileen Roberts and George Roberts, III] in Cleveland and my mother refused.  She said she never wanted her kids broken apart, pulled apart, and even though there was a struggle raising four children, she refused to do that.  My grandmother had the financial means and all of that, and she just thought that she could give the older two a better life but my mother refused to do that, and as a consequence we made a very close family, my sisters and brothers, and even though my mother remarried later in life with what we call quote, unquote (air quotes) the new family, we're all still very close.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Family comes first.  We stick together.  We understand the importance of being together, because we understand the struggle that she went through.
Story_ID: 620542
Speaker 1: And you have how many brothers and sisters now?
Speaker 2: Okay, I have, say in the first family there was one older sister and two brothers, and I was the youngest with my father (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You want to name them for us, from the beginning?  Start again and name them for us and tell us where you fit in.
Speaker 2: Okay. The, my oldest, the oldest sibling is Aileen [Aileen Roberts].  She was named after my [maternal] grandmother [Aileen Morrison], in fact.  Aileen is the oldest, then comes George Roberts, III, that's my older brother, Aileen, well let me just tell you where they are.  Aileen is here in Chicago [Illinois] and she's retired.  George is a retired policeman.  He lives in Las Vegas [Nevada], George III.  John [John Roberts], who is the third child, he is also retired.  He lives in Las Vegas.  He was a systems analyst, works with computers, and so on.  And then I was the fourth child.  My mother [Velma Morrison Young] remarried and her, and she married Jack Young and to that union was Delores [Delores Young (ph.)] who lives here in Chicago.  Delores is like fifty-five, fifty-six.  And then Andre [Andre Young (ph.)], which is my youngest brother.  He's an electrical engineer.  Lives in Chicago and has his own family.  So, it ends up six of us and a very close knit family, even though we're spread across the miles now (laughter).
Story_ID: 620543
Speaker 1: When you think about your, your mother's [Velma Morrison Young] personality and, I guess, what you know about your father [George Roberts, Jr.] and I guess the other influences in your life, other relatives, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think unquestionably, it's my mother and the reason why I say that is because even though there were six of us, for some reason my mother always depended on me, and here I was the middle child, but in terms of say, later in life when she became ill, or just major decisions, I was always the go-to person.  That's, that always amazed me and I still see that now in my sisters and brothers.  In terms of major decisions or how you just get together as a family, I guess I picked up a lot of her attributes and as a result, I was the go-to person.  When she became ill, I was the one that she called in and had me talk to the doctor, then had me talk to my sisters and brothers and then I set up a system how we were gonna help her through the illness and this and that, and just, I was always the person (laughter).  So I guess that's why I would say I probably was the most, I was more like her.  I just step in, take charge, and keep going, you know?
Story_ID: 620544
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory with the family?
Speaker 2: Lots of them (laughter).  Where do you start, you know (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, the earliest one you can think of.
Speaker 2: The earliest ones, I can think of some really tough times, you know?  There were some good times and there were some hard times, but I think, just some that stand out.  Like I told you, Christmas is my favorite holiday and I can remember a Christmas when evidently it was going to be a slim pickings Christmas because I remember a friend coming over and bringing us a chicken dinner, which was so much different from the big turkey and all the stuff we normally got.  I remember people coming by and giving us toys.  They gave me this, they gave me a ragdoll and my brothers some toys, trucks, and so on and fruit and candy, and so on, but what I remember about it was my brothers making fun of this rag doll.  You know, the fact that I didn't get a doll and I wanted this wedding doll.  You know how you go through the catalog and you pick out all the stuff you want, and for some reason, I could see the sadness in my mother's [Velma Morrison Young] face and I could tell that this was not gonna be a normal Christmas for us and I remember getting that ragdoll and I remember my brothers kicking it around the house, playing with it, making fun of it.  I do remember that.  And then I remember shortly thereafter, maybe in January or I guess when time got a little better, my mother taking me to the store to let me pick out a doll that I wanted, and so on and so forth. That was one time.  But then I remember other Christmases where, for some reason, I don't know why, I always wanted to be a teacher and I wanted this.  They had this little teaching set in the catalog and I was just determined to get that and I'll never forget how happy I was when I got that teaching set.  It had chalkboard and chalk and report cards and all of that, so those are the times that I remember.  I remember the good and I remember the bad and I think, because of that struggle, it instilled in me that you gotta work hard to get through this one, you know, to work your way out of this, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. I've never seen a teaching set.  That's interesting, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was cute.  I remember it distinctly.  It had a chalkboard, a little eraser, actual chalk, it had report cards for your students, and it had a little pointer and I would try to get my brothers and sisters to play school with me and they didn't want to play because I was young and they were older than me (laughter), so I'd have to get my little friends and try to get them to play school, but, oh, that, that, that was one of my best gifts.  The other thing about, going back to that ragdoll, what's so interesting is that when I was older, I remember my older sister [Aileen Roberts] bought me this beautiful wedding doll because she never forgot that either, and she, she gave me, it must have been about ten or fifteen years ago, but there's this gorgeous black wedding doll that stands like two feet tall, and she gave it to me for Christmas because she just said, "You know, I remember you always talking about that (laughter)," and it just stands out, you know.
Story_ID: 620545
Speaker 1: Where did you-did you grow up in one place or did you move around a lot?
Speaker 2: I grew up in one place.  We grew up on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] in the Ida B. Wells housing project [Ida B. Wells Homes] there, and the interesting thing about Ida B. Wells, that was really a community atmosphere, even though today, you know, you know, it reeks the horrors of what they call urban slums or what have you, but at that time Ida B. Wells was a very community-oriented neighborhood and I call it a neighborhood, because in that area I learned to, I mean we had all kinds of activities over at Madden Park [Madden Park Homes, Chicago, Illinois].  I learned to ice skate, to swim, to--I took ballet dancing, I took piano lessons; I mean, all the cultural exposures that you can get, you, they were there to be had if you just chose to participate.  And, so that was the good thing about growing up in that area.  I attended, early years I attended Oakland elementary [Oakland School, Chicago, Illinois], which was a public school, and shortly thereafter when my mother [Velma Morrison Young] remarried, I was able to go parochial school.  I went to Holy Angels and then that's, that's the school I graduated from, Holy Angels School [Holy Angels Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois] on the South Side.
Story_ID: 620546
Speaker 1: We were talking off-camera about the difference between the projects then and projects now.  The difference between a place like Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois] and the big high rises and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right. And, and as I said, as a kid I'd watched them build the Stateway Gardens [Chicago, Illinois] and Robert Taylor [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois], and as a kid I said, "I don't understand how they only have six wings for all these kids?" And I, in other words, in my mind I saw the social problems that could evolve from that.  I remember how the kids, and even my cousin, would go up in those projects and throw water balloons down on you and things like that, you know.  So, there was a good part and there was a bad part.  When I say there's a good part to those projects, I also remember when we would come from Ida B. Wells over to Stateway Gardens or, what was that, Robert Taylor.  There used to be old row houses there, I mean, just really trash dumps there.  You know, passing along, it's a good thing that they tore down most of those little really bad housing that, you know, before straight along 39th Street, 37th Street, all in there.  There were some real poor shacks in there with oil stoves.  I can remember that as a kid; oil stoves, because my mother [Velma Morrison Young] had a friend who ran, it was a shoe store.  In those days they used to repair shoes.  You get a new heel on your shoes and you get taps put on, or whatever, to preserve a shoe.  You didn't just toss it and go buy a new one, and I remember my mother's friend, Edna [ph.] had, she operated a shoe shop in front of the shack where she lived in the back, so there were some tough times, so to see that stuff come up and out of there and move those people into at least public housing, it was a good thing, you know, but again, I think it created a lot of social ills, because you just can't stack people on top of each other without some kind of, of outlet, cultural exposure, and so on, and that was the difference that I saw, the things that we had when I grew up in Ida B. Wells.
Speaker 1: Now, is Ida B. Wells still, we interviewed Robert Taylor's granddaughter, and she said that she--or daughter, she, [HistoryMaker] Barbara Bowman, and she was talking about how she would accompany Robert Taylor on trips to Ida B. Wells to inspect the properties.  But the people who were living there fully expected to be able to buy a house, I mean so it was a transitional place, not, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They did.  And I could point to so many successful people who came through there. That, it was.  It was like a jumping off point and pretty much how we ended up there, with, with--my father [George Roberts, Jr.] died, my mother even though she was educated, you know, she couldn't do gainful employment with four young kids, but--and when she did it was still a struggle, but as soon as you could get out, you got out, you know (laughter) and we made a move to Chatham [Chicago, Illinois], and so on.  But I still say the times that we were there, I, I still think the cultural enrichment, the exposure, and then again, you know it all starts at home.  You know, if you have the values and principles instilled at home, you're gonna carry them out, I don't care where you live (background noise).
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, pause a second (pause). Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay. So I was just saying that just the morals and the values, that, you know, they start at home and if it's at home, it doesn't matter where your setting is, but I think one advantage that we had, even though the environment was, it could have been a troublesome environment, you had the choices and strong institutions like the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], and, and so on, you, you had places to go for good social outlets.
Story_ID: 620547
Speaker 1: I remember going to the Y [South Side YWCA, Chicago, Illinois], some of the clubs we were in and going to see Queen Elizabeth [Elizabeth II] when she came to Chicago [Illinois] and we had to do all the studying and the history, the English history before she came.  I mean, they do little things to push you and then we, I, I, I will never forget going downtown, right in front of the Hilton [Conrad Hilton Hotel; Hilton Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] we had a chance to see Queen Elizabeth.
Speaker 2: How old were you then?
Speaker 1: I would say probably ten or eleven.
Speaker 2: That was like 1964, or '54 [1954], fifty- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955], okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That was '55 [1955], I think she visited the Chicago area, and that was so exciting to, us (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] was a major social--
Speaker 1: The South Side YWCA, yeah.  I went to summer camp.  The YWCA had a wonderful girls camp in New Buffalo, Michigan, and I went there maybe two years, and what's so interesting, even though you lived in Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois], you never knew you were poor.  I never knew I was poor until I went away to the summer camp, and it's, most of the girls at the camp were from the North Shore [Chicago, Illinois], a lot of Jewish families and Christian families, but the good thing about it is that you really had exposure to, that's what broadened my circle.  I used to, you know, when you're confined to Ida B. Wells, that's all you know.  People you see, they pretty much live like you have what you have, so you don't know you're poor.  You come up to Forest Beach [New Buffalo, Michigan], and the parents are visiting with yachts on the back of their cars, you know, and you're learning to play tennis, I learned to play tennis.  We had a chance to horseback ride, you know, swimming, you know, water safety, and rowing, and so on. So, it was such a rich exposure that you just wouldn't get if you sat in that Ida B. Wells project, you know. So that was another good thing about being there, and just seeing the, the opportunities that are out there in the world, meeting people who are used to these things and talking to them, and just enjoying being with them, it was just a, a good opportunity for me.

Speaker 1: We always ask this question, so I better ask it.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and smells.  Sights--in the early times or just later, or just going along?
Speaker 1: Growing up, I guess, I mean--
Speaker 2: I guess the sights, I just view it as a normal neighborhood; believe it or not, we kept gardens, we kept--even though it was public housing [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois], we kept gardens.  The sights, sounds, and smells, when you're in a building you've got the smells of all of the six people who live in your building of what's cooking and, sights, sounds, smells.  I do remember the lady on the first floor used to bake cakes and sell them.  So, and we would go down and she would always give us the crumbs.  When she trimmed the cakes, and so on, she would give me a big bag of cake crumbs or bread crumbs or whatever she was selling.  Those were wonderful smells, and interesting enough, it was public housing, but it was pretty clean, too, you know, so it was just a good time.  It was a good time to be there, but it was a good time to leave by the time we left, which was the '58 [1958], '59 [1959].  It was a good time to leave, too.  We moved to the Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] area, and the Chatham area, at that time, was at the beginning of white flight.  They started to let blacks move in and the whites were running, by neighborhood by neighborhood, block by block, you'd see the evolution and you know the change as it went along and, and even though I was living in that area, I stayed at the school I was at, the high school I was at [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and I just used public transportation and went back and forth until I graduated.
Story_ID: 620549
Speaker 1: Now you started at Oakland School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I started at Oakland.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's near the Lake [Lake Michigan], Lake Park [Avenue]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 39th [Street] and Langley [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Langley, okay. Oh, Langley, all right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And which is now Holy Angels [Holy Angels Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois], and, and, and I was there until fifth grade and went to Holy Angels, which was on Oakwood Boulevard, and I graduated from Holy Angels, eighth grade, I guess that was in '58 [1958], and I started at St. Elizabeth's high school [St. Elizabeth Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois], which was at 40th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue], and again, I go back to social institutions that help, they had a place called the Shield House [ph.], and most of our high school activities emanated around the Shield House, but my third year at St. Elizabeth, they changed the school.  They changed the school.  They sent all of the boys to Corpus Christi [Corpus Christi High School, Chicago, Illinois], and they changed St. Elizabeth to all girls, and I just use that as an excuse (laughter) and I just transferred around the corner to Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and I did the last two years at Phillips High School, Wendell Phillips High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, right, right.  Phillips is a traditional, I guess black high school in Chicago [Illinois], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  Technically I should have gone to Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], 'cause Hirsch was the high school when I lived at 80th [Street] and Langley.  That was the neighborhood high school, but I just wanted to stay with my friends; the people I knew, you know, and I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, what--
Story_ID: 620550
Speaker 1: I'm gonna to get back to Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] in a minute but were there any special teachers or mentors at Oakland [Oakland School, Chicago, Illinois] or Holy Angels [Holy Angels Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois] that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, interestingly enough I remember Dr. Bill Finch [William Hayes Finch], William Finch was a teacher at Oakland that I remember, and the thing I remembered about him, even though he was such a strict disciplinarian, I was lucky enough not to have to go to his classroom, because I had transferred before I got to his classroom, but my brothers and sisters said he was just such a strict disciplinarian and the interesting thing about Dr. Finch was, you know, in those days not everybody had a telephone, or if you did it didn't stay on long, you know, and I can remember Dr. Finch coming through the neighborhood like the Pied Piper.  If you see Dr. Finch walking through the neighborhood, it's like twenty or thirty kids following him because he was going to somebody's house to tell on them.  They did something in school and he couldn't call the parent and he had no problem going to your house and telling your parents about what you did, and so I'd never forget that about him and later in life, I ended up working for him when I started teaching, and I always called him the Pied Piper because we, we couldn't wait to follow him, see what house he was going to, who he's going to tell on, and soon as it was over we would sit there and listen for the commotion because we knew somebody was gonna get it, you know (laughter).  It was just a--he just laughed about that in later years when I told him about that, but I do remember Dr. Finch being a person who really cared, you know, really followed through and just didn't take any prisoners.  In high school, Henry Grant [ph.] was a mentor for me.
Speaker 1: Is this, is this at Phillips (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Phillips, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what did Mr. Grant teach?
Speaker 2: He was an English teacher and I really think Mr. Grant was responsible for me going on to college, because I really thought that, well I just didn't see the possibilities financially of me going away to school, and I really wanted to go away to school and so, first of all Mr. Grant got me interested in journalism and I worked with the school newspaper and some other activities, and then one day he just happened to say well, "What do you plan to do when you finish high school?"  I think I was a junior then, and I said, "Well I don't really know."  I said, "I'd love to be a teacher, but I don't know, right now I don't know what I'm going to do in terms of college."  I had thought about trying to go to college in Cleveland [Ohio], where my [maternal] grandmother [Aileen Morrison] had moved, and perhaps change residences, stay with her, and go to college there.  But, and he was saying, well, you know, "If you keep your grades up you'll be able to get a scholarship," and so on and so forth.  I thought in order to get a scholarship you have to be a straight A student and brilliant, right?  I had very good grades.  I was on the honor roll, but I still thought you had to be brilliant (laughter).
Story_ID: 620551
Speaker 1: --Well, to make a long story short, he [Dodd's high school teacher, Henry Grant (ph.)] helped me do applications for college, really start to make that a possibility in my mind and work towards it, and by the next year I was really excelling in school. I graduated in the honors society.  I was a class officer, and I did get a scholarship to Northern Illinois University [DeKalb, Illinois], which at that time was one of the best teacher colleges in the country; in fact, three of our Chicago [Illinois] superintendents came from Northern Illinois. So--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I did attend Northern and it was a very good experience; I finished, in fact I finished school early.  I finished in three-and-a-half years simply because I needed the money to go--I needed to go to work, you know.
Speaker 2: What year did you graduate from high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: I graduated from high school in '62 [1962], 1962.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you started Northern that fall? Probably?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in that fall, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I kind of did what we talked about earlier.  A couple of summers I decided to stay there and work.  I had a job at the student union as a cashier, and so I just stayed at school a couple of summer and worked because my conditions at home hadn't changed drastically in terms of you know, economic freedom, and so on.  It was just better for me to work and kind of help myself along.  So, so I finished in three and a half years.  I had enough credits and I--in January I finished.  I worked as a substitute teacher until I was able to march in June, and--
Speaker 2: Now had any of your brothers or sisters gone to college?
Speaker 1: Nobody.
Speaker 2: Nobody?  You're the first? Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nobody, I was the first one, yeah; yeah, I was the first one and probably the trigger person for everybody else.
Speaker 2: What about? Okay.
Speaker 1: Subsequently everyone else has finished college, you know, but, and, and done very well.
Story_ID: 620552
Speaker 1: Were there like any special teachers or mentors at Northern [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Not one (laughter).  I shouldn't talk about Northern like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what was it like?  Was it, was it like pretty--
Speaker 2: Northern was extremely segregated at that time when I first got there, let me put it that way.  We maybe had two hundred black students.  This was the '60s [1960s] now, in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement, and if you didn't stay on campus at the dorms you had to stay in Sycamore [Illinois], which is thirty miles away.  There was one family in Sycamore and I just met the people in that family a couple years ago, but they, if you, black students had to stay in Sycamore and commute to DeKalb [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So black--wait a minute.  Now you're saying that, let me get it straight.  That black students couldn't live in DeKalb?  If they don't live in a dorm at the school, they really couldn't live in DeKalb?
Speaker 2: Well, the choices were family homes. And lots of families took in students, you know, I'm saying when I started.  Now remember, this is the '60s [1960s] and most of the black kids stayed at Annie's [ph.] and I would say after maybe the first or second year, 'cause first of all not a lot of black students stayed at Northern.  You go to Northern, but either they punch out or they would leave; you know, they'd flunk out or leave.  So, even though I started with maybe two hundred black students, by the time I graduated only eleven of us graduated, so it was tough times in DeKalb.  But by my junior year, yes you could.  There were a few families who would take in black students, but in terms of moving off campus or, no, there was no mobility there.  In fact, my first year at Northern and West Neptune, there were only, even though you had four beds, you know, in a room, I only had two roommates because one roommate refused to stay there because there was a black student in the room, so it, it was pretty tough.
Story_ID: 620553
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were there any black instructors on campus [of Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I think we had one, in sociology.  I mean we even, even in terms of Greek organizations, we only had one, you get one sorority and one fraternity, and that was it.  Black students that wanted to, an alternate sorority or alternate fraternity, they had to go back to Chicago [Illinois] and pledge and join there.
Speaker 1: Which two, which two--
Speaker 2: But we had Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] for ladies and Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] for men and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the way of the world.  Now, I do remember one instructor that I really enjoyed and that was George McCollis [ph.], who later on became, he was the Illinois superintendent of schools for a while and the reason why I remember him was because I remember he had us read this essay by George Orwell, was it 'On the Liberty of Thought and Discussion,' [sic. 'Of The Liberty of Thought and Discussion,' John Stuart Mill] and in it, it was a satire on society, and so on and so I did a pivot on that.  I wrote a story, it was all about satire and the satire was that to solve the racial issues that are going on in America today, that was in the '60s [1960s], maybe we should just pack up all the black people, send them back to Africa, and I had all these reasons why.  I said, "Then you wouldn't have to worry about the church bombings," because, at the time, the Birmingham church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] was blown up, and so on and then I ended the essay just like Orwell did.  Now, of course, none of these thoughts are personal, because a lot of the nicest people I know are black, and I said my mother [Velma Morrison Young], my father [George Roberts, Jr.], my sister [Aileen Roberts], my brother [George Roberts, III].  So, I turned it into the satire that George Orwell did, and I remember him talking to me about it.  He got a good chuckle about it, you know, and then later on I would find that whenever I was assigned a paper, he would give me something that really pertained to my own blackness and, like the sub-Saharan Africa, do some research on that, talk about that, and that's something that you just didn't see.  You know, it was like you were just a non-person there, you know, 'Invisible Man' [Ralph Ellison], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's one teacher that did recognize your individuality (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Recognize you, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --and try to address it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --on some level.
Story_ID: 620554
Speaker 1: Now, do you know if, did you go to the March on Washington, or did you hear about it?
Speaker 2: I didn't go, but my best friend went because the March on Washington, that was like right before the beginning of the semester and, remember, I told you I worked, so I had gone back to school but there were busloads of folks going.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was August of '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Right, right, but--and what's interesting about it is that my mother [Velma Morrison Young] was not a militant person or a person who really pressed for equal opportunities and all that.  She was just kind of a go-along person and I never understood that, why, 'cause she felt that marching and things like that, you're just stirring up trouble.  You know, I'm saying, "Wait a minute," you know (laughter) and you see these students doing sit-ins, you know.  In the college at that time, the, the students in the South were doing the sit-ins.  They were really out there trying to fight for equal opportunities and so, you know, you do what you could on the campus, you know.  I knew I could not transfer and go to another school that might be a little more liberal or a little more integrated, because I was tied to the scholarship and that was the best I could do, and I knew financially they weren't, my parents weren't able to see me through that, so I had to depend on what I had, you know, and that's why I stayed there [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] and it was a tough challenge, I should say.
Story_ID: 620555
Speaker 1: So that was days before there was a black student organization or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  But the interesting thing is we got involved.  We did our own thing.  I did pledge.  I got in the sorority and our sorority, the only black sorority on campus, we had the highest academic average on campus.  Now, first of all you have to remember we probably had fewer students; you know, maybe we had forty AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], but we all excelled.  We stressed the importance of education, making a difference while we were there.  We won a Greek sing.  This is something interesting.  At the time, I was president of our sorority and when you have the competitions and here you're the only black sorority on campus, you always have to be better than others and so I studied the judge's sheets in terms of Greek singing and what they would say about us, and one thing they always said was that we didn't enunciate when we were singing.  They couldn't understand what we were doing, and so on.  So, I said, "Okay."  So I went home and I got this album of 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin], and we centered all our songs around 'Porgy and Bess.'  We did "Summertime," we did "Strawberry Man," [sic. "Strawberry Woman, Crab Man"] and so on.  So, that eliminated the enunciation.  We did something that was generic to us, that made us comfortable, and don't you know we won Greek sing that year, because, you know, so what I'm saying is that you really have to internalize what's comfortable for you and, and then you can still excel. So--and reading those ratings that they had given us in previous years, it wasn't voice quality, 'cause you know we could all sing.  We all went to church.  We could all belt it out.  It was just being comfortable with what you were singing and I'll never forget that I was so happy when we, and I don't think they've ever won since, you know, but you just make your way.  That's pretty much how we did it in Northern [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois].  We just did the best we could and made our way through what came at us (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 620556
Speaker 1: I forgot to ask you about church life growing up.  Was church a big part of growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Catholic, I'm still Catholic.  Very much so in younger years and even now.  I'm a Catholic, and in spite of the changes and the things that the Catholic church has gone through, I think religion is something that's inbred in you and my kids [Robert Dodd, Kimberly Yelverton, and Courtney Dodd], they've had the opportunity to pick and choose religions even though they went to Jesuit schools and Catholic schools, but I've stuck with the religion.  It gives a peace for me, you know, even though when I grew up in the Catholic church it was the Latin Mass and all of that, catechism, and so on, so you just find your way in terms of what works for you and it still works for me.  Every once in a while I will go to a Unitarian Church, just to, if you want to change the mood or change the music, or, and then many times I've even gone to Jeremiah Wright's [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.] church [Trinity United Church of Christ, Chicago, Illinois].  I used to go to his hour of power, sometimes if you just want a weekly message, you know.  He certainly was not the fire and brimstone that people would make him out to be, but many times the hour of power was something that you could take a lesson from that and use it through your weekly ventures, and so on.  But, I remain a devout Catholic.
Story_ID: 620557
Speaker 1: It's 1965, I guess.  Is that when you start in the public schools to teach, teaching?
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962], '65 [1965], yeah; '65 [1965], '66 [1966] yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Now, what was your student teaching assignment?
Speaker 2: My student teaching assignment was Robbins, Illinois, even though I was at Northern [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois].  I took Robbins, because at that time I didn't drive and most of the assignments were out in the western suburbs, Aurora [Illinois], and so on and so forth, so I took Robbins because I could stay home.  They're nine week assignments, and so I could stay at home in Chicago [Illinois], and I just took the bus out to Robbins daily, and it was a good experience.  I was at Horace Mann Elementary School [Robbins, Illinois], and the good thing was that it was a black school, because prior to that you do occupational teaching throughout when you're in Northern.  You start your sophomore year doing observations of the schools in DeKalb [Illinois] and in the area and you do your practice teaching, but your actual assignment, all of the practice teaching in those areas, it was the white students, so when I went to Robbins I had a chance to really have, you know, the black population.  It was a good experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, Robbins was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It prepped me for the Chicago Public Schools in the inner city (laughter).
Speaker 1: How was Robbins in those days?
Speaker 2: It was pretty good.
Speaker 1: It's fallen on some harder times lately (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right yeah.  I think they were probably, and at that time, Robbins probably had families that just managed to get out of the inner city, you know, so families appeared to be intact.  It wasn't-I don't think it was as severe as it is now.
Story_ID: 620558
Speaker 1: What was your first assignment then?
Speaker 2: Okay. And my first teaching assignment was at Woodson Elementary School [Woodson North Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  It was a new school in, I guess, the Oak Lawn [Chicago, Illinois], Oakwood [Boulevard] district [sic. Oakland, Chicago, Illinois] at 40th [Street] and Ellis [Avenue] or Champlain [Avenue], or something like that, yeah, 40th and Champlain.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and the interesting thing was Dr. Finch [William Hayes Finch] was the principal and this was the gentleman who I told you was the teacher at Oakland School [Chicago, Illinois] when, in my early years my brothers and sisters went through him and even though I transferred, I still knew of Dr. Finch and that worked there.  It was a really good experience working with the students there.  Most of the kids came from a housing project right in front of the school, and I thought coming, having graduated from Northern [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] and I passed the teacher's exam right away, you know, it wasn't a problem.  I thought I had all the answers but I discovered that you don't really have the answers out of the book.  The answers come from experience and really working with these students because I had to understand that what I did with these students in the classroom, some of them were going home to what I called a vacuum; you know, the education stopped when they left my room and so I had to start to understand that this was beyond just a classroom problem of teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic.  It was really about understanding the social issues they were up against, understanding them as a person and really trying to instill a confidence in them, both the confidence in themselves as well as a confidence in me so that they would open up and learn what I was trying to teach them.  So, that's kind of I made my way when I first started teaching.  I did very well.  My students did very well.  It was a good connection, and so on and as a result, Dr. Finch started the practice of, he let me keep that group until they graduated.  I started with them in fifth grade and I worked with them straight through.
Speaker 1: That's really unusual, is that--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was very unusual and I'll never forget when he told me.  He said, you know, "I'm gonna let you keep this group even though they're excelling," and at that time, the best teachers got the top kids, you know.  He said, "Not because you're a great teacher as much as these kids seem to connect to you, they seem to be excelling, and I think we'll just let them stay," and the parents liked the idea, too.
Speaker 1: So, you had them all the way through eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. I kept them--right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That is something.  Yeah. Why isn't that done more? That's--it seems like it might be a good idea if there's a good rapport between the teacher and the students.
Speaker 2: I don't know, and I think there was a theory of practice that came along later where they actually tried that.  It was called team teaching or something, where they would keep the kids straight through.  They would track them and maintain the relationship for two or three years, but I don't know.  It's just that was the first class followed through and that was the only time that ever happened for me.  I think I stayed at, I want to say I stayed at Woodson for about six years and I transferred out to Chatham [Chicago, Illinois].  That's when I went out to Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], because I really wanted to, at that time, Woodson only went through sixth grade and then they went to the upper grade center at Forrestville [Forrestville Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], and so I transferred to Dixon in Chatham. And--
Speaker 1: So that was about 1971?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in '69 [1969], '70 [1970], yeah. (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy [1970]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969], actually.
Story_ID: 620559
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you this. Did--you grew up in that neighborhood.  It's unusual, a lot of times, for people to be able to come back and teach in the same neighborhood that they grew up in, in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: You mean back in the inner city or out to Chatham [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Not Chatham.
Speaker 2: Both? The inner city?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Having had grown up right over there--
Speaker 2: I wish I had stayed longer to be honest.  I went out, I simply went out to Chatham because I lived in that area and I was thinking of it in terms of transportation and still I didn't drive, so I wanted something that was closer in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: And had the neighborhood changed a lot since you were there?  I mean, did you see it in a different way coming back as a teacher?
Speaker 2: At 40th [Street] and Langley [Avenue]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter).  It, it, it was heart-wrenching.  That's why I said that you really have to understand what these kids are up against when they go home.  I had a kid who, a fairly bright kid, Teamo Gill [ph.].  A very, very smart kid, but he just succumbed to the elements of the street, and even though I connected with him, we did very well, and when he left me at sixth grade, he went over to the upper grade center and I will never forget, I was in class one day and someone came in and they told me that Teamo had just killed someone.  I mean, these are the things that you just don't, see, don't happen, and he had just shot a boy in front of Forrestville [Forrestville Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], and I couldn't understand it because Teamo was such a nice kid you know, and, interestingly enough, later years in life when I was out at Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], he did get out of jail and he came by to see me and he--we just talked about it.  He said, "You just get caught up."  He became a Muslim while he was in jail, and so on, and at the time I think that the Muslims had just built this big restaurant [Salaam Restaurant and Bakery, Chicago, Illinois] and all of this stuff on 83rd [Street] and Cottage [Cottage Grove Avenue], you remember that?  And he was employed to help manage that and he found out I was at Dixon and came over to visit me, but things like that happened all the time, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah right down the street.
Story_ID: 620560
Speaker 1: I could name the kids--Antoine [ph.], I remember this little kid. He was, his grandmother was raising him because his mother was, had a drug problem and Antoine was just, he was just a powder keg waiting to happen, you know.  They just had obstacles that you just wouldn't believe the things that went on.  And, as a teacher, you know how I talked about Dr. Finch [William Hayes Finch] walking through the projects, going to see your mother, getting you in trouble?  You wouldn't dare go up in that project building in front of our school.  You know, you just, it was just like that.  The kids couldn't even go up there.  You know, parents have to wait downstairs to take them up and that, I think, was when they started these community representatives.  They started to have people who were from the community become school representatives and they would come into the schools and work with the teachers, along, even though you had social workers, and so on, but the school community rep was your kind of key person to get you if you had to go up into the project buildings and work with the families, that kind of thing, and, in fact, I remember our school representative there, her name was Ms. Robinson.  I think it was Mary Robinson [ph.], or--I only knew her first name, per se, but Ms. Robinson, and she actually became a very strong person in Mayor Harold Washington's administration.  She worked with the housing institutions, and so on.  She's really good with pulling those families together and really tying the school [Woodson North Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] to the families because, you know, you just can't make a disconnect there.  You know, if you don't get into that home, you're with these kids five hours a day and the other hours, if you can't at least connect to what you're doing with them and to what they're facing at home, it's all a wash, and I've realized that early on, and it really was a tough go there, it really was.  Totally different from what you saw when I transferred out to Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  Now, I go out to Dixon, what's my greatest discipline problem?  If the kid wore a tie in class or not.  You know, it's seventh and eighth grade.  I wanted upper grades, so that's why I transferred out there.  Seventh and eighth grade, we made the boys wear ties, and if they tried to stick it in their back pocket and come in your classroom, that's a discipline problem, you see.  Totally different, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 1: Kids are kids, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 620561
Speaker 1: Dixon School [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] in Chatham is--Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] started changing, was it, I guess in the, I guess in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Probably the '70s [1970s].  It was still pretty much intact in the early '70s [1970s], because to be honest a lot of the teachers' kids, the teachers lived in Chatham and their kids went to those schools, you know, so you had to follow through with the home, you had the parents up there all the time talking with you, working with you, really trying to work with the kids so it was a lot different.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Dixon School.  What did you teach in Dixon?
Speaker 2: At Dixon I taught seventh and eighth grade language arts.  And I think, I was never just a classroom teacher.  I did the school newspaper.  Remember, I told you I had the experience in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] as--in journalism and I always liked journalism, so I did the school newspaper and we had won many national awards, as a matter of fact, as a school newspaper.  I also worked with the student council.  I took the classes on many large trips.  We'd go to Washington, D.C., to Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida], to Disneyland [Anaheim, California], and in fact that kids used to try to get in my class, because they knew they'd have a big trip, and the interesting thing about the trip was I used it as an economic opportunity.  The kids had to raise the money to go on the trip.  So, it was like setting up, you had your little bank account and you had, we had activities like raffles and things like that.  We had a school carnival.  We had a school book fair, other things.  We had activities to raise the money.  I even remember, and I know you won't know about this, they used to have S&H Green Stamps [Sperry and Hutchinson Company], when you buy things you get green stamps (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So we would collect S&H Green Stamps, get a TV, a little black and white TV, and use the TV and raffle it off and you make so much money. But the kids, they just loved that opportunity for being able to earn their way to go on the trip, and now I told you about Joan Crisler being my student teacher.  The reason why I trained the teachers at Dixon was because I was doing so many activities that the principal, Dr. Keenan [Charles E. Keenan], felt that with a student teacher that would help you with all of those activities.  Well, Joan Crisler was one of my student teachers.  She came from Northern Illinois [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] and, to make a long story short, later on she became principal of Dixon and she ended up opening up a bank and a store within the school.  I mean, those same things, those same principles of bringing your lifestyle into the classroom, those were the things that we really liked to emulate.
Speaker 1: Yeah, my daughter worked in a bank (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) She did?  Yeah.  At Seaway [Seaway National Bank; Seaway Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, Illinois], I tell [HistoryMaker] Jacoby Dickens, the chairman, he's a good friend of mine and they set the Seaway Bank up in that school and we just talk about how we started with just our own little classroom project of trying to go on the trip, and it was fun.  It really was.  Teaching was never just going into the classroom and, and, and pushing information.  It was a learning process to me, and I think that's why a lot of the kids excelled.  I see my students all the time and they'll say, "Oh, that was my teacher, So-and-So," and they're principals of schools and they're all doing very well, you know.  I know they probably had good family input, and so on, but just to be a part of that, you know, like [HistoryMaker] Cheryl Burton, ABC News, I taught all of those Burton kids, wonderful kids, and their mother was up there all the time. You know, those are parents that are up there, working with you, helping you, pushing you, really helping you make a difference with the kids.  So, many students.
Speaker 1: So, so, how long were you at Dixon?
Speaker 2: Okay, I stayed at Dixon until '70 [1970], from '70 [1970] until '77 [1977] and then I went into administration, school administration and I worked as a chapter one coordinator and that's, that's the working with disadvantaged students to bring the scores up in reading and math.
Story_ID: 620562
Speaker 1: Did you go to graduate school while you were at Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]? 'Cause you got a--
Speaker 2: Did I go to grammar school there?
Speaker 1: No, graduate school while you were there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  I did.  When I went to Dixon, I worked on my master's degree.  I finished a master's degree in reading and then I went back and got forty-eight hours in administration and supervision too, so I did post graduate work as well.
Speaker 1: Where did you go for your post graduate work?
Speaker 2: Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Chicago State? Okay.
Speaker 2: I started out, I did some classes at Loyola [Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and then Chicago State University is where I ultimately finished.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 620563
Speaker 1: I have here that you, now you were at Lawson School [Victor F. Lawson School, Chicago, Illinois] and--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lawson was a district reading clinic-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and in the reading clinic it was a clinical setting where you work with students by the hour in a smaller setting.  You did diagnostic and prescriptive teaching, where it's more of a one-on-one relationship where you can really diagnose the deficit areas and then just use, prescribe lessons to work with the kids.  Usually you'd carry a caseload of about twenty to twenty-five students, and with short forty minute sessions with them, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Gillespie School [Gillespie Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], now that's '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that again, that was another reading clinic on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but the same setting, and then by then they had redefined a reading deficit as learning disabilities and so they were called learning disabilities clinics and that's when I went back and took additional post graduate hours in learning disabilities and I worked with the students, but to me it was the same clinical setting.  It's just that they just didn't define it as a reading deficit.  We looked at all modalities that you work with in terms of the auditory, the visual, and so on.  You take in all of the modalities to work with the student, and that's it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 620564
Speaker 1: --I've heard it said many times that the sixth grade is, is kind of a place where male students, a lot of male students in more, poorer communities, more disadvantaged communities end up drifting from school.  Did you find this to be true when you were teaching?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do.  And, I'll say this because I could remember, I'll use two instances, the instance of Teamo Gill [ph.], who I told you about who killed this boy in seventh grade, but at Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] I could remember I had this little kid, I knew he was a bright kid but he was an antsy kid, who moved around a lot,  just a whole lot and I had the parent come up and I was trying to talk to her and really identify well what is going on?  This kid is bright.  I can't get across to him.  I can't even settle him down enough to get any work out of him, and so I asked the mother.  I said, "Did he ever skip a grade?"  And she said, "Yeah, how did you know?"  She said he had skipped third grade and I said, "Because his social development is just, you know, he just does not act like a seventh grader."  You know, seventh graders tend to start to slow down and mellow out.  He was still that same little eleven year-old busybody and changing from class to class was too much for him.  He still needed that setting of a one-on-one teacher with thirty kids in the class, but once you get in seventh grade and you're going from teacher to teacher, class to class, it was too much for him.  And so, that's what I'm saying, sometimes the social development is not connected to the mental development.  I also think that, I think boys, the curriculum has to tie into what their life is about.  I found that I'd have to incorporate sports in some of the teaching, a lot of the things that are important to them.  It was tough for those seventh and eighth graders to just plow through what they called history.  They call that old stuff.  They didn't want to hear that, you know.  I could remember at The Jackson Five was very popular and so I would just have them analyze the songs that The Jackson Five would sing, because that's what they were into.  They liked this, they were doing this, and they would just analyze the songs and then we, I'd tell them, "Well let's pull a thoughts concept out of that."  What I was trying to do was just trying to teach them to conceptualize because kids, they can read and really identify words and all that, but they aren't processing and conceptualizing, you know.  That's where the breakoff comes in, and so I would just take whatever element they had, averaging sports scores, things like that, you know.  Those are things that worked for the boys in those days.
Story_ID: 620565
Speaker 1: Of course, I had students who'd come to class and they, even in that day I had one boy that, he, he would come to class and he was obviously high on something, and just sleep through the class.  Never could get a parent to come up there.  It was tough going, you know.  He didn't stay there long because in those days you do have follow-up.  You were able to get intervention by referring him to a social worker if a social worker gets in the home, that kind of thing.  But, I've seen it all, really.  I've seen it all and the thing that I tried to tell my students at that time, you know, when you go through life it's not the experiences that hit you, it's that if you don't grow from these experiences.  You know, you just gotta weigh what you have to go through, but you gotta grow beyond what comes at you, and I think that's what used to help them through a lot of the things that they come up against, and today, I'm not surprised that we have such a high dropout rate in terms of males in high school, because the relevance isn't there.  They're not able to internalize and make the transfer of how this is going to develop them as a person and move them on into the greater society, and until we do build that bridge again, we've got to build that bridge under these young males to make them understand the responsibility that's involved in it, and I'm hoping that's what they're gonna see with Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] as president.  All possibilities are there now, you know.  It might be a long shot, but the possibility is there, and even Barack has pointed out that he has fallen off on the way, but he found his way and that's I still say the only thing, the only problem with life, if you don't grow from the experience then, it's a loss.
Story_ID: 620566
Speaker 1: Now you became an instructional intervention teacher from '81 [1981] to '85 [1985]. Now, did you travel around from school to school? Or-okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That is correct and in that process, what you do is you go to the various schools and that's when you, when students are referred for learning disabilities and you have to go in and sit with the caseworkers.  You have a psychologist, a social worker, the parent, and the principal of the school and the intervention teacher and you make the, between all of the case studies that you pull together, you make the decision on whether or not a child would be placed in a special education setting for learning disabilities.  And so, basically that's what I did as well as I did staff development for those teachers who were actually in the classrooms with the learning disabled students.
Story_ID: 620567
Speaker 1: Now this is the, the Harold Washington era, too.  Did, did you get active in the campaign?
Speaker 2: Very much so (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know a lot of teachers were active.
Speaker 2: Right.  Very much so, and I can remember, you know, it was like a feeling in the air that you knew that, because I lived in the city at that time and you just, I don't want to go into politics but you just knew that some kind of change had to come.  I lived through the big snow, I lived through not being able to drive to work, my husband [HistoryMaker Louis Dodd] had to take the kids to my mother's [Velma Morrison Young] and I had to just make it the best way I can, because you couldn't even get down the street for weeks at a time, and so we just knew that a change had come and I could remember that I took off work three days of the week that he, I took off Friday, Monday, and then Tuesday was the election.  We made calls, we had, the office was set up on 47th Street, where the South Center [Chicago, Illinois] was, and so we would make calls to the people in the neighborhood and set up ways to have them picked up and brought to the election, et cetera.  And I still knew a lot of the people in the community because I had taught down there and I still had a lot of teachers down there so we really worked with getting the parents out to come out and vote, and so on, and I knew that Harold was particularly interested in coming in and making a difference with the schools.  He came in, he put Dr. Manford Byrd [HistoryMaker Manford Byrd, Jr.] in, our first black superintendent, you know.  Just a lot of the changes, and I knew Manford had been there.  He had been sitting there as assistant for so long.  He knew the ins and outs of how to keep the system going, what we needed to do, where our emphasis should be in terms of the reading, the math programs, and so on.  So, I think that's why it was important to, I just looked at it from the perspective of the educational viewpoint more so than overall city and all of that.  I just knew that Harold could make a difference to help us on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], and he did, you know.  The streets changed, the schools changed, money went into the schools.  At one time, as nice as Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] was, I could remember it snowing in my classroom, you know?  So, it wasn't like it was all gravy.  When Harold came in, the money went into those schools on the South Side.  And, it did make a difference.
Story_ID: 620568
Speaker 1: Tell us about things began to change in the public school system for you.
Speaker 2: Okay, I had what I thought was a truly traumatic experience.  At the time that I was assigned at the Lawson reading clinic, the Lawson School [Victor F. Lawson School] was on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois] right off 12th [12th Street; Roosevelt Road] and Homan [Avenue], and the school was about, I would say a good one hundred years old, okay?  And so I had a clinic in this school and I service students from throughout the district.  They decided to renovate Lawson School, and the entire time that I was working there in the clinic, I would see all kinds of tradesmen coming through the building; the electricians, the painters, and so on, and never saw any black tradesmen come through there, and one time we happened to have a black shade hanger.  They were hanging the shades, and I happened to be talking to the gentleman and I found out that they made this crazy amount of money per hour, because he was a union person.  I said, wow, that's really different but, again, they worked on this school for I would say about a year-and-a-half.  Because our district office was in that school, the whole third floor was the district office.  They put in new carpeting, new blinds, new computers, everything and someone broke in the school, stole the materials and they refurbished and did everything.  They put a brand new couple-hundred thousand dollar furnace in this hundred-year-old building and just totally redid the school.  About, right shortly thereafter, remember I told you I transferred to Gillespie [Gillespie Elementary School] to the South Side of Chicago solely in the interest of cutting down on the travel and I was gone less than six months.  The next school semester, they closed Lawson School and tore the school down and it became a vacant lot.  I was absolutely furious and I called Cliff Kelley at the time.  He had a talk radio.  I said, "Cliff, do you know," I know what it was.  I was working with a community center.  I was on the board there, and Cliff was the chair of the board at Parkway Community House [Chicago, Illinois].  I said, "Do you know I worked at this school?  They renovated that school.  They put in a new hundred thousand dollar, couple-hundred thousand dollar furnace.  They did all of this.  Do you know that place is a vacant lot now?"  I was just absolutely furious and that's when it came to me that this system is designed to, and I said this to Cliff, I said, "This system is designed to finance these unions.  They're not trying to teach anybody how to read and write."  I said I'm driving over here every day working with these kids.  These people are making triple the amount of money I'm making and now they put all this money in a school and they tore it down, and I think Cliff did something about it on his radio, but that's when it started to sink in to me, you know, this is an exercise in futility, you know.
Speaker 1: That's a, that's--that's an important point.  I've heard people talk about that before, and it's one of the amazing things about living in Chicago [Illinois].  It probably happens in other cities, too--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you suspect it has something to do with how to get money out of the system, you know, the cash cow, without really doing anything wrong.  They seem like stupid decisions, but somebody gets paid for putting and installing that stuff, somebody gets paid for refurbishing the furnace, a company gets paid for the new furnace (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: Stuff that's stolen out, whoever stole it got that and then they replaced it with more stuff, and they--
Speaker 2: And then they closed the whole place down.  And I'm saying you can't tell me that you didn't have on the drawing board that this school was going down, you know, when you got this grand idea to refurbish this school, and the second thing I noticed is that every week I'd come to work, a building had gone down.  You know, they were really just renovating or tearing down a lot of buildings over there on the West Side, so if the buildings are being torn down, there are less kids.  So, if you have less kids, you don't have enough kids to populate the school in the first place, and because of the low enrollment, that's how they were able to put that district office on the third floor, so this is where I'm going.  You had to know that the school population was dropping.  You still insisted on renovating this hundred-year-old building and then it's all for naught.  And that's when I said, "Oh, this is just games people play," you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 620569
Speaker 1: Anyway, here I was on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  I was working and that's when the schools started to run out of money, you remember.  There were days when teachers didn't get paid and then we had like two or three teacher strikes in a row, and so the very last teacher strike, I think it was in 1987, at the time I was a school administrator, so administrators couldn't go on strike, but we worked throughout the strike with teachers harassing us, we've got to work or we don't have a job.  We don't have people to represent us.  We didn't have a union.  So, I'm going to work and I said I can't go out and do workshops and resource teaching with these people who, you know, they're yelling at me because I'm going to work every day.  I'm just trying to protect my job.  This was like October, November.  I don't know how long that strike went on, but I just made up my mind (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was 19--what?
Speaker 1: It was probably '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I just said, "You know what?  I can't do this anymore," and once it came into my mind that you're not making a difference that this system was designed to finance the unions, and I'm just saying that was my take on it.  I don't know if that was the real reason or not.  That's when I was able to walk away.
Speaker 2: Maybe not the union as much as contractors in general, yeah.
Speaker 1: Contractors, everything.  It's a big political play.  That's the way I read it.  And so, I went down and I resigned and, right after the strike.  I went down in December and, to put in my resignation and I can remember the teacher counselor said well why don't you just take a leave.  I said I don't want a leave.  I don't wanna come back to this.  I am not going to perpetuate, and this is quote, unquote, I'm not going to perpetuate this.  I think it's disingenuous, it's unfair to these kids, and I'm a better person than this.  I mean, it sounded all Christian moral and all that, but I was really mad.  That's all I can say.  I was mad.  I just said this is not working.  There has to be a change.  Somebody has to do something about it.  Most people say you stay there, you work through the system.  I just walked away and I quit.
Speaker 2: So you quit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I hadn't been there long enough to retire.  I was too far away from retirement because, as I told you, I started teaching early.  So, I just quit.  I was going home and then Louis [Dodd's husband, HistoryMaker Louis Dodd] said, "No, you don't just quit.  Why don't you try this?"  And so, I went into insurance, I took the exams and I opened up an insurance office and then, at the time, he was working as an Allstate [Allstate Corporation] agent for the company itself.  I opened up the independent office [Dodd's Insurance Agency] and then, after about six or eight months, then he moved into the office with me as an independent agent also.  That's really the birth of how we got into the independent insurance agency.
Story_ID: 620570
Speaker 1: How did you and Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Dodd] meet?
Speaker 2: Teaching school.  (Laughter) Years ago, when I was at Woodson [Woodson North Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], he was at Forrestville in the upper grade center [Forrestville Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], and we were just friends, and he'd come in my room borrowing chalk and all those other excuses, and got to be friends and then later, a more committed relationship and we married.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when did you all get married?
Speaker 2: We got married in 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we've been married thirty-five years.
Story_ID: 620571
Speaker 1: So now, so insurance now.  That's what seemed like a jump, a big jump from insurance to, I mean from school, from education to insurance, but was it that big a jump or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in the sense that I wasn't away from it because with Louis [Dodd's husband, HistoryMaker Louis Dodd] being in it, you know, there's a carryover.  People call your house all the time.  You're still involved with it, you know.  He had an office set up at home, so I had cursory knowledge of it and quite frankly, I guess I've always had that business side of me since college, because I tried to minor in business ed at college and at Northern [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] you couldn't do that with a teaching major, but if you'll notice the entire time I was teaching we all, I always things beyond what was in the classroom.  If I was not doing the trips and working with the children raising money for the trips, I also did an awful lot of volunteer work.  I worked with Parkway Community House [Chicago, Illinois], I worked with AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], eta [eta Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois], et cetera. so I've always just had an interest in what's going on in the business world, social world, or what have you.  And, and with insurance, it was a little bit self-serving in the sense that I would free up a little more of my time because I was, the kids [Robert Dodd, Kimberly Yelverton, and Courtney Dodd] were starting to get older and I could do a little more of the community work that I had been doing, volunteer work, so this way it would free up my time.
Speaker 1: Okay. How many kids do you have?
Speaker 2: We have three children.
Speaker 1: Three? Okay.
Speaker 2: Two girls and a boy.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you detailed questions about them later, I just wanted to establish that.  So you have three kids.  Now, did Louis leave teaching before you did? I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.  Louis left teaching right away.  Louis left teaching in 1971.  No, he was still, yeah '71 [1971], yeah, '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: So he left when you all got married? Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, uh-huh.  He was out there. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he--was it, was it for similar reasons, or--
Speaker 2: No Louis, to be honest and he'll tell you, Louis probably had five jobs then, so Louis taught school, he worked with the after-school program at the Boys and Girls Club [Boys and Girls Clubs of America], he had his own business, he had a business, a stamp business, where he made rubber stamps and so Louis has always been independent (laughter), so he went from that.  He'll tell you the story.  He'll tell you.  Five jobs, that's what I always--and it's still like that.  He's in insurance but what? He's built two hotels since then and, you know, it's always something, you know, and I'm always thinking when are we gonna retire, you know?  When is it time to take it easy?  Then here comes the next project and I get pulled in all the time, so it's kind of natural.  It's an ebb and flow, you know.  Even though I went out into insurance and set up the office [Dodd's Insurance Agency], I still do a lot of work to keep the office going.  I still do the payroll, I still work with the employees and all of that.  Louis is more the sales side, I'm more the business side, and even with the hotels, I mean, it's not unusual just like yesterday, "I need you to get me 150 shower curtains," you know.  So, you're still doing stuff and every once in a while, I say, "Well what about your manager?" (Laughter) You know.  But sometimes it's just the trust level.  He wants you to do certain things, so you gotta be there, you know, and it works for us.
Story_ID: 620572
Speaker 1: Tell us about the insurance business.
Speaker 2: Insurance, it's, it's a fast paced business and it rises and falls with the economy, you know that.  Because it's an intangible, you're selling an intangible, you have to build a lot of trust and confidence in people to let them know that you want to be the person that's there for them when any perils come against them, so it's an interesting business and it's very busy, constantly.  There's always something.  When something is built around trauma and catastrophe, you've got to really maintain a sense of balance and really try to help and assure people that, "I'm here to help you and this is how I can help."  The problem is that when you go in situations when you do the initial sale and you're trying to make people understand that I've seen these things that have happened, perhaps you should consider covering yourself with this, and so on and people look at the bottom line, what's in their pocket, and this is all I can afford, and then when the catastrophe comes there's nothing you can do, you know.  You just do the best that you can.
Story_ID: 620573
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's the biggest catastrophe, I guess that's hit, since you've been, you know, working in insurance in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you know the most gut-wrenching thing that ever happened to me was when I first went in to insurance, the first thing you do is depend on friends and family in terms of selling things and do you remember we talked about Joan Crisler, the principal at Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and I sold her a universal life policy on her son and it was one of those built in policies where you get cash value, high interest rate, and by the time the kid gets to college you can use the money for college or whatever, and she lost B.J. at twelve.  Her son died from lupus.  I'll never forget.  I was travelling, doing something with one of the volunteer organizations The Links [The Links, Incorporated],  I was south of Minneapolis [Minnesota] and they called me.  It was the most gut-wrenching.  First of all, it was the first person who ever died from a life insurance policy that I sold.  Secondly she was a very, very good friend and thirdly, I knew B.J. so well, you know, so it was just heart wrenching to go through that, of course.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know she's very, the--I know the hallway in Dixon is named after him, you know.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: And the artwork is called the Crisler gallery, and Bruce Crisler gallery [Bruce Allen Crisler Gallery].  It's named after her son.
Speaker 2: Oh right. We used to call him B.J. and I can still see B.J. out, because at the time I told you I was working at the district office still, and I could see B.J. out there on the swings, on the monkey bars, just playing, and so that was probably the worst phone call and the toughest time I had in insurance.  Certainly, I've had, I'd lost insurance along the way but that was the one that hardened me and really, it made me understand how important life insurance is for people, you know.  It somehow helps you get on with life, but in that situation, I just couldn't take that one.
Story_ID: 620574
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the, the insurance needs of the black community, I mean, as we speak?  Are black people insured enough or are they, are they, I don't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  And I've seen so many white families.  I've seen how it's made them grow.  I mean, they look at the investment and I think with black families we're so caught up in the day-to-day trying to get by, that you don't have time for what I keep telling you, they're intangible.  You just can't see it right now.  When you've got to put food on the table, clothes on your back, or if those are the things that are important to you, you're not looking at the long range future.  I can remember teaching at Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and we had a teacher who taught social studies seventh grade, and her father passed.  This was a white teacher, and had a tremendous life insurance policy.  She was able to quit teaching, go back to Northwestern Kellogg School of Journalism [sic. Medill School of Journalism; Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, Evanston, Illinois].  She's doing very well now, you know.  But those kinds of stories just did not come through the families.  We just can't do estate planning and looking long range when you're trying to get by day to day.  I try to tell families, you know, get something, term life, something cheap, whatever you can afford, but do something to protect your family.  The reason why I say that is because I was a victim of that.  If you remember, my father [George Roberts, Jr.] died.  You know, my mother [Velma Morrison Young] was just twenty-seven with four kids, you know.  That's tough.  Life insurance could have pulled her through that.  Now certainly in those days, you probably had issues of discrimination, and so on, in terms of being able to buy a substantial policy, but I will tell you from that situation my mother always kept those little penny ante insurance policies on everybody in our family and her sisters and brothers, the kids, and the guy would come by the house and you'd pay him, what is it, forty cents, twenty-five cents, whatever those debit policies were.  But she always kept debit policies after that, you know.  She believed in insurance and in the back of my mind that always transferred to me too when it came to insurance.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Was there, were you conscious of insurance redlining in the city?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  We went from redlining to credit scoring to all of those things, you know.  That's all part of it, you know.  And, in fact, it's a hardship on agencies like ours [Dodd's Insurance Agency] when you deal in a predominantly urban area, maybe lower income.  The credit scores are so low, it's hard to get quality business, you know, or if they take on the people in the red line zip code or the people with the credit scores, the policy is so high they can't afford it.  So, all of those things are, are factors.

Speaker 1: Are most of your clients [at Dodd's Insurance Agency] in the suburbs, or in the, I know you were based in Calumet City [Illinois], are you still like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  So, the good thing about Calumet City is that it's a borderline state so I can write Illinois as well as Indiana.  I'm certified for both states and but, to be honest, because Louis [Dodd's husband, HistoryMaker Louis Dodd] and I have been in Chicago [Illinois] so long, and know so many people, it's a big cross section.  I wouldn't say that my business depended on Cal City.  It's been more of relationships.  I know a lot of people in the school system [Chicago Public Schools], so I have a lot of teachers and people that I met along the way.  I work with a lot of civic and social organizations, so those relationships have transferred into insurance also.  So, I can't just identify one area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where's, I guess, the ceiling on the insurance, in terms of, I mean, are you satisfied with what you're doing right now with insurance?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I am, because now I have my oldest daughter [Kimberly Yelverton] there in the office, and she does a lot of my work and it frees me up. I, you know, I can do the charitable work that I do, because I would say, I call it my nonpaying job.  I spend probably more time working on the organizations that I'm with.
Story_ID: 620576
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you've mentioned eta [eta Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois], Parkway Community House [Chicago, Illinois], the well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. The bulk of my time now is with The Links organization [The Links, Incorporated].  Have you heard of The Links?  It's probably one of the premiere women's organizations, about twelve thousand membership and it's an international organization, you know.  We're in South Africa, the Bahamas, Germany, as well as the U.S., and I've done a lot of work with them over the years, but right now I am what you call the national program coordinator, so with 270 chapters, all chapters have to do some kind of service for their respective communities and as the national program coordinator, I'm responsible for helping to set the program agenda, really being out there supporting the chapters, helping them to design programs, working with the business community to bring in funds to finance the programs, and so on.  It takes a lot of travel.  I just came back from South Africa.  Earlier this year we built fifty-five schools in South Africa, so I've been working with them.  We're working with the women of Rwanda.  You know, in the aftermath of the genocide, there were so many orphan children and the society was almost 70 percent women for a while and so they took on an entrepreneurial project of basket weaving, and from the work with their basket weaving, they've been able to turn around that economy, the education, the hospitalization.  They've done a lot of things. So I've been working a lot with them, and then there are a lot of domestic things that we're doing.  We're working with HIV AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], teen pregnancy, you name it, we're out there, and I'm kind of sitting in the driver's seat in terms of working with the chapters, the presidents, and the executive consult of our organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is Chicago [Illinois] the national headquarters for the Links--
Speaker 2: Washington, D.C., um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Washington, D.C., okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're sixty-one years, sixty-two years old.
Story_ID: 620577
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about, now the hotel is such a big, you said your husband now has built two hotels.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is, it's funny, this has been Louis' [HistoryMaker Louis Dodd] lifelong dream.  I can remember in the early years of teaching, he had the opportunity to invest in what was here was a motel originally on this facility and at the time, we were looking into other ventures like a car dealership, you know, things to invest in because Louis was never just going to do insurance, and somehow it came into his mind that he wanted to get into the lodging business and I thought, "Oh, please, give me a break.  Why are you doing this?"  But he stuck with that dream and opportunity came up to invest at 39th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue], the Amber Inn [Chicago, Illinois], and that's when he and his business partner built the Amber Inn, and at that time, we envisioned me with my community mind as well, I envisioned trying to put some kind of social facility where we'd have something on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] that people could have meetings and parties and all of the above in the area.  So they built the Amber Inn with the concept that the third floor would be a community resource area and all of that.  Well, I guess it took off so well that they ended up turning the third floor into all suites and I never did get the community room concept, and so on.  We did have Pearl's Place [Chicago, Illinois], the restaurant that's there.  I set up the restaurant.  At the time, our youngest daughter, Courtney [Courtney Dodd], was at Penn, University of Pennsylvania at the Wharton School [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and she developed a business plan for me to do the restaurant and consequently we opened Pearl's Place restaurant.  Her nickname is Pearl, because of AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] and the twenty pearls and I would tell her pearls are precious, and so on and that's how we got the name Pearl's Place.  But she really did the business model to open that restaurant when she was a senior at Wharton.
Speaker 1: Hm, okay.
Speaker 2: So it's always been kind of a family affair, 'cause like I told you now my oldest daughter, Kim [Kimberly Yelverton], she's in the insurance business with me helping me out, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the hotel, does that take a lot of your personal time too?
Speaker 2: No.  We have a manager.  We have managers in both facilities here, too.  There are two managers here.  It takes more of Louis' time in the sense that he generally goes through both places early in the morning before he comes to the office.  He gets to the office around noon or one o'clock. And--
Speaker 1: The insurance office [Dodd's Insurance Agency]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He still comes to the insurance office, too, afternoons.  That's why I told you to go from five jobs to two, that's pretty good for him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 620578
Speaker 1: Well tell us something about the--you're involved with the bank, Northern Trust [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois]---
Speaker 2: Well basically it's with the community board at the 79th Street facility and we pretty much work with the community there, the Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] community and we try to facilitate a user-friendly atmosphere in terms of using the bank and how the bank can be a helper, we do seminars on financial education, job opportunities.  I've even done health seminars there too, so, but basically it's bringing the bank out into the community, helping to meet community needs and, you know, Northern has always been such a traditional bank in some lines, but when I bring friends and professionals into the bank they really understand how, you know, the bank, Northern is not as traditional as folks thought.  You know, they really are into developing that community.  They have an interest in what's going on, and the board members, we kind of just act as facilitators.  We're, we're out there.  We're introducing people to the bank.  I got involved because being in insurance, a lot of times people transfer to the city and they will refer people to me and so if you come in you got an insurance person, you need a doctor referral, you need a dentist referral, you need a bank referral, you know.  So, you kind of just, these are things that could help you and it's up to you to decide if this is what you wanna do, you know.  It's been a good experience.  It really has.
Story_ID: 620579
Speaker 1: We always ask this question now.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Today (laughter)?  You know it is just not the African American community.  Society as a whole.  I hope that we can get back to the core value of family.  We've lost the concept of family, the moral values that come with the family, the connectedness of family.  I think as African Americans, I just cannot accept the, the, the disconnect of the baby daddy concept and the drama that comes with all of these disconnected families.  I think children need to grow up with role models, so if you can't have the family connections, then you need mentors; people to really come in and use life experience to help you through your experience, and I'm a strong proponent of mentoring now, and I say that because if you can't put the families back intact, then we need substitute role models to come back and help these young people.  So, in terms of the African American community, my dream is to somehow, some way be able to reach these young people, help them to understand the importance of education, and not just to get a job, but just to advance themselves to be able to live in this world, grow in this world, learn from this world.  That's what education does for you.  That's my dream for the African American.  I, the challenges are really large at this point.  I look at the crime rate in Chicago [Illinois] and it just, something has to be done about these young people just dying and I think, I hate to say it, in a white situation it wouldn't be happening.  I mean, something would have been done long ago.  But, black on black crime is insignificant to me, from what, that's the way I think Chicago looks at it and I think as a community, we have to stand together, rise up, and demand city services to help us stop this.  To me, it's an epidemic.  One, one, one life lost to me is an epidemic, you know, of a fourteen year old shooting a sixteen year old, that kind of thing.  But, you pick up the paper and every day innocent children riding to school on a bus and somebody can walk in and shoot up a bus.  I mean, no.  This can't go on.  This can't continue to happen.  And so, in terms of African Americans, that worries me but, again, I say society as a whole, we all have to get back to a core unit for our society.  Get back to the family construct.  Some kind of way, even if it's a loose construction, having mentors that act as a family person.
Story_ID: 620580
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point in life, what, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: What would I do differently (laughter)?  I probably would have stayed in the school system, you know.  I think I just gave up and left and sometimes I think maybe I could have done more.  Maybe I could have made a difference.  Of course, it seems to me that it blew up even worse once I left, but in the back of mind I think that sometimes you have to fight a fight within, be in the midst of the battle, but at the time I was raising a family, I was, you know, I had other things and I said, "I can't be out here saving somebody else's kid and destroying my own kid, you know?"  So, I put a lot of energy into my children [Robert Dodd, Kimberly Yelverton, and Courtney Dodd], they're well educated people and I think productive members of society.  I'm happy with them, so that was a good investment and leaving and giving up teaching, that was the regret that I had.  But, I had to do it for myself and for them.
Speaker 1: I mean, for you to really make a difference in the Chicago Public Schools, what position do you think you would have to have, or what would you have to organize?
Speaker 2: Well, I say that because some of the individuals that I tapped as they were teachers when I was the administrator and teacher resource person, and all of them went on to grow through the system, I cited Joan Crisler,  who did an outstanding job at Dixon [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], Renee Mitchell, she went on to be superintendent of learning disabilities.  A lot of people that I worked with went on to run the system.  They were curriculum directors or superintendents, and they all managed to stay there and fight their way through the system, you know.  If they made a great contribution, I don't know that, but I'm just saying that they worked and found a way, and did the best they could.  I think they did a great job at what they were working with.  I think that had I stayed, I had a little more insight to take to the drawing board and maybe I could have made a difference.  I don't know, it might be lofty plans, I don't know.
Story_ID: 620581
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look at everything you've done to this point, is there, what today would you consider, I guess to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy, if--I hope that people see and realize that I think that next to family and what you do in life, I think the most important thing is what you do to help other people and I think that that is something that has been in the forefront of everything that I've done, whether I was teaching school and collecting clothes on the weekend to help the kids, or helping families and doing things, working for community organizations, I always felt that I had to reach back and help others because, if you're remember, I told you about the Christmas where I had the ragdoll and somebody came in and helped us, and I've never forgotten that.  I had people along the way, mentors along the way, who always pushed us and I just felt that it was my duty to, that service is, that's the most important thing that we can do as individuals, to really go out and give of yourself to help others.  It's not enough to sit there and be comfortable and say I've made it, I've made my way.  I think that there's always a chance to help somebody else find their way, so that would be my legacy.  I'm very committed to it.  I guess it's no accident that I ended up being a director of programs for Links [The Links, Incorporated] because I sincerely believe in what I'm doing and I'm very charged with trying to motivate others to believe in that service component and giving back to our communities.  Many of The Links, you know, they might not know of having to have someone come in and help them because originally Links were viewed as doctors' wives and this and that, and you know, the premiere society, but not so.  There are so many of us who really make that commitment to improve our communities and I just happened to be one that had the benefit of some outside institutions and organizations helping me.
Story_ID: 620582
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  Tell us about your children, and--
Speaker 2: Well, they're nice young people.  My oldest, Robert [Robert Dodd], he is a neurosurgeon.  He attended MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] undergraduate, and received an M.D. Ph.D. from Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], and he presently, presently is director of neuroscience at Stanford University.  Kim [Kimberly Yelverton], the oldest daughter, is administrative assistant and actually runs Dodd's Insurance Agency.  Kim has a master's degree in finance and she also is a charter financial analyst, has her CFA [chartered financial analyst], but she has made the commitment to help us and keep the Dodd's Insurance Agency steady and growing, and then the youngest, Courtney Dodd, she too is in finance.  She went to Wharton [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for undergraduate and Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] for graduate school, and she presently works at the Northern Trust company [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] downtown.  So, they're pretty independent and on their way.  I tell them every day that I'm going out to adopt grandchildren because none of them are married.  They've been in school and they don't even talk or act like they're going to get married soon, so I'll just go and adopt some grandkids and drop them at their homes and pick them up on weekends (laughter).  That's where we are, but they're nice, productive people and I'm very proud of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, is there anything we have not mentioned or discussed we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Dodd]? (Laughter) Did we talk about Louis?  No.  Since you're going to interview him, that--he has been the rock of our family and, you know, the anchor in our lives so, best friend, you know, the person that you love the most, and a good partner for thirty-five years.  So, that's about all I left out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're interviewing him at the same time we're doing this one, so I guess--
Speaker 2: Oh, somebody else is doing him?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 2: I got you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I thought you had to do him after me.
Story_ID: 620583
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Again, as I said, just remember me as someone who tried to help somebody.  Someone who tried to make a difference.  That's all, you know.  I don't worry about talking about any awards I've been given or any acknowledgements that I've had, unh-uh.  In fact, that's probably why it was so hard for Julieanna [Julianna Richardson] to get me to sit for one of these interviews.  You know, I don't concentrate on self.  I just do what I have to do to try to make a difference in this world, see what I could do to help others and I'm okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, thank you, thank you very much (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
