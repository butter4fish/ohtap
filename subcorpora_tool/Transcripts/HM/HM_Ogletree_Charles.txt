Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna start with your, you know, your childhood.  And I'd like to first ask about your mother, if you could give her, her name and talk about her family and her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother, her name is Willie Mae Ogletree Robinson.  Her birth name is Willie Mae Reed, W-I-L-L-I-E M-A-E.  She was the first child and of course, first daughter of my grandparents, Willie Reed and Essie D. Reed.  My grandfather clearly wanted a boy.  He was gonna make sure that whatever it was, the name was gonna be Willie, and so that's why she became Willie Mae Reed.  She grew up in Arkansas.  She actually told me and told all of us in our formative years that she was from around Little Rock [Arkansas].  And we sort of lived with that for decades.  In reality, as we got older, she said well, it's not quite Little Rock.  It's a little place on the rural part, and there's a sign, and there's a gas station, et cetera.  And it turns out, it's from Pop Spurs, Arkansas, which no one has ever heard of, and, and no one can find.  She's the first of four children.  She has two sisters and a brother.  She was born on November 8th, 1933, in Arkansas.  My parent--grandparents came from Arkansas.  They were common workers.  Neither of them had much of a formal education.  My mother went through elementary schools in Arkansas.  They moved to California in the 1940s.
Story_ID: 174839
Speaker 1: She [Ogletree's mother, Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] started high school there at McClymonds High School [Oakland, California], I believe.  She went through the tenth grade and became pregnant, had my half-brother, Curtis Lee Reed [ph.].  And she then moved to Merced, California, where I was born.  She met my father [Charles Ogletree, Sr.] in 1950.  They were married in 1950.  I was born, their first child, in December 1952.  And they worked there as common laborers.  We all did.  My father was a truck driver.  My mother was a homemaker, but she did a lot of stuff in the community as well, including we'd go out and pick our, all the vegetables and fruits and things and nuts during the, most of the year.  It was this--Merced is the Cesar Chavez area of California.  That's where he organized the farm workers.  And so we grew up in an environment where hard work and common work was par for the course.  The communities were largely segregated, on race but largely on class as well.  We had a railroad that, you know, across the tracks.  We were on the south side with all the other then-Mexicans and blacks.  Very few blacks or Mexicans live on the north side of town.  I went to the public schools there.  And even though she didn't finish high school as my father--who we'll talk about later--who only went through fourth grade.  They both were very adamant that their children stay in school and, and get a education so that's her contribution to where I am and who I am.
Story_ID: 174840
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson]?
Speaker 2: Determined, focused, opinionated, deliberate.  Mae is someone who would fill a room when she walked into it.  When you talk to her she had a very deep voice.  And some, sometimes when she's talking on the phone people would think it was a male speaking 'cause of her, her deep voice.  And she always spoke slowly, so you had to take the time for her to finish her sentences.  And she always spoke for a long time.  There was no such thing as a conversation with Mae.  You always had a meeting, so it would take a long time to get through it.  She was very active in the community, and she was considered by so many people in our hometown a saint.  And she was always taking people to doctor's appointments, taking care of their medical prescriptions.  She, you know, she had her own medical problems.  She's always had back problem.  She had surgery that was unsuccessful.  But from sunup to sundown, she's driving someone somewhere, taking folks home.  Every holiday we'd have people that we'd never know or never seen coming to the house.  This is Uncle Bernie [ph.].  This is cousin so and so, who weren't uncles or cousins.  They were people who she could cer- she was concerned about, who could come to our house.  And we'd have our holiday meals.  When those ended, she'd get in the car, and then she would take food to people at other places.  And she was, she was organized in that sense as well.  She had what we called the poverty wagon, the station wagon which was very old.  It was a 1960s car, and it created incredible problems for us.  But she could put all the food in the back, take people to different places, and that was her goal, to make sure she got people food, got people fed during the holidays.  So, she was the community's matriarch.  Whenever people had a problem, bills getting paid, kids getting to school, medical problem, housing, whatever it was, Mae was the person that people would go to, and she would do the job.
Story_ID: 174841
Speaker 1: Can you talk about your grandparents, her [Ogletree's mother, Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] parents?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, my grandparents [Willie Reed and Essie Reed] were a unique couple.  They grew up in segregation.  They were, you know, half a generation removed from slavery.  Their parents came from, from slavery.  They had no real formal education.  They had incredible pride.  They always worked.  That's the one thing I remember, they always worked.  They worked the fields, whether it was picking cotton or whether it's going to the almond orchards or whatever it was.  They worked from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.  They worked their own land, even though we had a very small house, 'cause when we first lived with them--when we first grew up we lived with my grandparents.  And, and there was no toilet in the house.  We had what we called an outhouse.  If you had to use it, you had to go outside, or you could get a pan if you needed to get a quick (laughter) brush up.  But there was no such thing as taking a shower, taking a bath.
Story_ID: 174842
Speaker 1: --My father--grandfather loved to hunt.  His name was Willie Reed, but everybody knew him as Snuff.  He was a notorious lover of snuff, and he would even send us to the store.  Back then, ironically, kids could go and say go get me two brown snuffs and one black snuff, and we get the powered snuff.  And he was known throughout the community.  In fact, many of my friends, until they were adults, never knew that Snuff, who they knew from hanging outside the liquor store and hanging out near the barbershop and in the pool hall, was my grandfather.  They knew I had a grandfather named Mr. Reed, but they knew Snuff was somebody who was always in the community.  And I have acquired one of his worst habits of being a packrat.  Whether it was a hundred degrees outside or fifty degrees outside, in California it's never any colder than that.  Snuff, my grandfather always had in his pocket utility items.  What do I mean by that?  He'd have a pocket knife; he'd have scissors; he'd have cards; he'd have money; he'd have a little notebook; he'd have a screwdriver; he'd have a wrench; he'd have rings; he'd have a--what do you call 'em, the--not a scarf, but a--
Speaker 2: Handkerchief.
Speaker 1: --nap--a handkerchief; he'd have an extra belt; he'd have a leather wallet, and he'd have a plastic wallet; and he'd have a change holder; he'd have a clip for bills; he had finger clips, I mean just everything.  He--whatever, if you needed it, you walked by, he'd pull something out of his pocket.  He'd have incredible things that didn't make any sense.  And he would work until he retired, and he'd hang around the liquor store, not always drinking, but sitting there dipping snuff, as, as he loved to do.
Story_ID: 174843
Speaker 1: My grandmother [Essie Reed] was a very special lady.  And she took us, her grandchildren, under her wings.  She would work like he [Ogletree's maternal grandfather, Willie Reed] did all day, but she'd also come home and fix the meals for everybody.  And we spent a lot of time as children with my grandmother when my father--grandfather was out.  She was a very religious woman, always reading the Bible, always going to church, and trying to instill those values of spirituality in us.  She also sort of grabbed me as the oldest of the children that she was supervising and taught me how to cook, which I thought was remarkable.  You know, the whole, whole idea of men as opposed to women cooking, she said, "Hey, you're the oldest.  You never know when you'll need this talent.  I'm gonna show you how to do it."  And she tricked me into making this interesting.  She didn't tell me I wanna teach you how to cook.  She would tell me, look, Junior, as they called me--she didn't call me Junior; she called me Junebug.  I was the--she gave me the nickname of Junebug for Junior.  And her goal was to make sure that I learned how to cook without it being a challenge or being obvious that I was learning a skill.  Why did she do that?  For two reasons: the first reason, I said she worked all the time.  When she was a relatively young mother, she had a stroke.  And her entire side was paralyzed, so she used a cane to get around.  She had a brace on her leg, and each night she'd ask us to rub her down with oil to sort of, at least give some sort of relief with, not oil, but with alcohol, to give some kind of relief from, from the pain that she received.  But she still used that.  She said, "Junior, I want you to get up here.  Junebug, I want you to cook this rice pudding," that she taught me how to cook, classic rice pudding, with her secret ingredients of coconut and raisins, which is still a family secret.  But she was quiet, but she was in control of that house.  My grandfather was the patriarch, but he paid attention to what Big Mama--that's what we called her, Big Mama--would say and do.  And Big Daddy was a tall, lean, quiet man that he only had to look at you to get your attention.  But Big Mama was in charge of that house and everything that we did.  So they were special people who influenced me in a lot of ways.  They were very giving people; they were very family-oriented people.  As I said, they literally raised me and, and my siblings when my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] and father [Charles Ogletree, Sr.] were not able to do that.  So, they are the people who I always look to, even now when I have my conversations with them in prayer about, you know, how do you answer the challenges of life?  They always still have an ability to articulate what I need to do in, in making my priorities in life.  So, they were two remarkable people who still influence me in everything that I do.
Story_ID: 174844
Speaker 1: Your father--your grandfather [Willie Reed] also you used to fish with, right?
Speaker 2: My grandfather and my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] were the only people in my family, adult, who loved to fish.  And my grandmother [Essie Reed] fished for a while, but because of the problems with, with her stroke and paralysis, she didn't do that.  My grandfather was the one that I went out to fish with.  And it was a fascinating way, to just sit there and watch him on these muddy banks in California, show me the tricks of the trade that he'd learned in Arkansas that he would still apply in California.  My father [Charles Ogletree, Sr.] did not fish.  We couldn't get him out there.  He didn't have the patience, but my mother loved it.  So you can see on one side of the bank, grandfather, and then my mother, and then me, and then my siblings, and also a remarkable dynamic because they were both teaching me but also giving me independence, that is that we would go there, and we've have our cane poles.   We didn't have fancy equipment then.  And our bait was actually wheat dough bread that we used.  And we were catching largely carp, some catfish, some perch, ba- basically bottom feeders.  And what was remarkable about it when I say the independence, they would--we would go to the creek.  And as we'd fish we would land in spot A, which was the spot where everybody fished, so we'd settle there, but then my grandfather would get up 'cause spot A is overfished.  So he would walk around the banks, and he'd go find his own little area, and what he was saying: this is where I'm gonna fish; stay away from me, right; this is my territory.  And my mother would move, and she'd find her own space, not my grandfather's but her own.  And I would try to do that, and of course, I would always go to places where I didn't find any fish.  So, I did--there was a trick to the trade.  They knew how deep was the water, what sort of bushes are hanging over, how your bait is used, what's the, the, the tide like, what's the, the drift like.  But I think they were teaching me fishing, but they also were teaching me responsibility.  They were teaching me how to spend some time thinking, because when you're fishing, the first thing I'm looking at, where's the bite?  Where's the bite?  But then, I spent times thinking about wow, I wonder what it was like when my father grew up in Birmingham, Alabama; wow, I wonder what my grandfather felt like being a black man in Little Rock, Arkansas; wow, I wonder how, how my mother feels trying to raise children, and have a job, and, and not being able to follow her own education.  So, the fishing created a space, and a time, and a place to think about larger issues that, that I didn't think about in the classroom, I didn't think about in any other place.  And so they were teaching me the early discipline of use your time wisely.  They didn't say that, but that's exactly the impact of what they did--
Story_ID: 174845
Speaker 1: I used to ask questions in class that I never got satisfactory answers to, and so I didn't ask those questions, and I regret it.  I mean, as they got older, I did talk to my grandfather [Willie Reed] and mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] more when I was at Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  My grandfather actually died when I was a student at Stanford and for me it was sort of tragic to just beginning to be able to get a good relationship with him, and he was gone.  But I, I bugged my mother with those issues.  And it was hard 'cause my mother always, whenever she called, she had her agenda.  And you had to force your conservation into the, the dialogue, and I would find a way.  The one thing I did learn, even before law school, you got to segue your points in.  When she'd start talking about, you know, Ms. Smith [ph.], I said, "Speaking of Ms. Smith, I remember her son, so and so, who was in high school.  But, speaking of high school, let me ask you this."  But you could not just ask a question and how it would be related to her.  And, and she was, she would always stay, as my teacher stayed, on task, that is that, even when I would switch her away, she would find a way to bring us right back to: this is what I'm talking about; this is my issue, and I'm not finished yet, Junior, as she'd call me, and made sure that I stayed focused on things that she thought was important.
Story_ID: 174846
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk about your father [Charles Ogletree, Sr.].  You're, you're a junior.  You're named after your father.
Speaker 2: Right, right, my father was born in Birmingham, Alabama.  He grew up there.  His brothers and sisters, many of them spent most of their life there.  He was very strong, very quiet, a man of few words, very proud in some respects but also very angry about the, coming up in a, in a part of the South at a time when it was difficult.  He was born in the same year that Thurgood Marshall was born.  They both are men born early in the 20th century.  And it was clear that that meant that he was in the heart of Jim Crow, and he was in, in Alabama.  You had that twin dilemmas of being from a segregated place and being born at a time in, when it was so flagrant.  And he ultimately left Alabama.  He was in the [U.S.] Military.  He was stationed in Georgia for a while.  He never had to leave the country, but he was in, in the [U.S.] Army for a few years.  He finally migrated to California where he met my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] and father [sic] and others.  He was much older than my mother.  When they were married in 1950 he was already forty-three years old, and she was nineteen.  And in fact, the amazing thing is that getting married to my mother wasn't a choice.  They had a shotgun wedding.  Now, not the kind of shotgun wedding you think.  Most shotgun weddings means that the bride is pregnant, and so the groom is forced to marry.  That wasn't the case.  My grandfather [Willie Reed], Big Daddy, found out that my father, Elmido [ph.], as he was called, was dating my mother and they--it was getting serious.  He thought he was too old for his daughter and that they shouldn't be together.  And so what he did, he actually, as my mother reports it, took his shotgun to my father and said you're gonna marry this girl, or you're gonna get out of town.  And they got married in 1950, and I was the first child born two years ago--two years later, 1952.  So, and that's interesting 'cause my father's a tough man.  I, I, I, I think it, it was clear it's out of respect for my grandfather because Elmido, as he was called, would toughen up--I, I, I could imagine him fighting Big Daddy.  He didn't.  He accepted his responsibility.  They were married, and I was the first of five children.  He worked as a truck driver and a lot, lot of other common labor in, in the [San Joaquin] Valley [California].  He worked for a guy named Charlie Huddleston, who is well known.  We call him the mayor.  He's never held any public office, but he's the black man who everybody comes through for everything.  If you need to get your rent, if you need to get a contact, if you need, if you need a lawyer when you have an accident Charlie could help everybody, as long as you give him his cut.  He didn't do this for free.  He was always looking for a, a generous contribution to the nonprofit Charlie Huddleston Referral Service and, and he did a great job.  My father drove trucks all up and down the San Joaquin Valley.  He also, so he would work all day, and you could find him routinely at the, the pool hall.  My aunt actually owned the pool hall, called the Blue Moon [ph.].  It was a restaurant and a pool hall.  So, in the front was a restaurant, where tables you can eat; in the middle were the pool tables and other forms of recreation; in the back, behind the, the door that you had to have permission to get in, that's where the hardcore gambling would go.  And every now and then the police would raid it, and everybody'd get locked up or get a warning or something.  But he'd always be there gambling.  And as a younger man he spent a lot of time drinking, which was a problem for him, until the doctor told him if you keep drinking you will die.  And he heard that and, and never had a drink after that.  We also had another place that before we went to the Blue Moon, there's a place called the Knotty Pine [ph.] that my earliest memory is another cafe in the community, same design.  It was down the street from where I grew up as a child.  It was right, it was right across the street from McNamara Park [Merced, California].  Charlie Huddleston ran a, a little place--not McNamara Park--right across the street from Charlie's Hut, there's a little hut there that he would have a skating rink off Cullen Avenue.  And the Knotty Pine had, again, tables for dinner, in the back, the serious gambling, and that's where I first saw my father gambling with folks from the community.  And he was sometimes good at it and sometimes not so good at it.  You know, he'd come home occasionally with a wad of money, and other times he'd come home with just a pocket of change, coins.  So when he had the change, we knew that was not a good night.  When he came with a wad of money, we knew that it was gonna be a good week.  And he, I think he enjoyed life that, because of that, the gambling, the truck driving, and a comfortable existence in Merced [California].  It went very well.
Story_ID: 174847
Speaker 1: Do you remember your earliest memory of growing up?  Do you have one?
Speaker 2: When I think about growing up, I remember a lot of things.  I remember sitting around a little grocery store as a kid before I even started school.  It was called Mr. Henry's [(ph.) Merced, California].  Mr. Henry had a little grocery store.  It was wonderful.  Once you walked in, for kids who couldn't be better, all you could do is see these rolls of candy, candy, penny candy, two for a penny.  And so, with five cents, you could have a field day going to Mr. Henry's.  And my aunt, Nadine Washington [ph.], spent some time with Mr. Henry and his family, and Mr. Henry and his wife liked us.  And there were times when you'd come in with a nickel, and you'd get eight cents worth of candy because--here take this, boy, take this, boy.  And so it was like a, a birthday or holiday that Mr. Henry would give us something special.  So I remember those times hanging out at the store, hoping for that opportunity.  I remember sitting around with the old five cent bottles of Coca-Cola, and we had then RC Cola on a summer day, sitting there drinking as a kid.  I remember as well we had a guy who lived down the street called Moneyback Lee [ph.].  He had a--what would you call it?  It's not quite a pawn shop, but he had everything imaginable that he would sell.  And Mr. Lee was right on the corner down from the Knotty Pine [ph.].  And you could go in there and you could buy things.  It was like a pawn shop, but it had all kinds of stuff in there, and I remember just being fascinated.  But here are all these things.  You couldn't buy them.  It was amazing to see them.  And I also remember that Mr. Lee really attracted the kids in another way.  He would go around--we didn't know it then--to all the bakeries in town.  Where we were was in the, in the rural part. We were in the country.  But he'd go into the city and pick up on Saturday I think their discarded donuts, 'cause they'd be closed on Sunday and Monday, Sunday until Monday.  He would get all these kids who we could see 'em coming at five o'clock.  He'd rush us down from his little pond area down the street where he had a church.  And what he did was to take these donuts and give them to us, and we enjoyed 'em.  We didn't know that they were a week old or three days old.  They were, they were donuts.  We did, we couldn't eat donuts anywhere else.  There was no donut shop or bakery anywhere, anywhere in that part of Merced [California].  But what he did was he used the donuts to entice us to go to church.  So he would feed us donuts on Saturday afternoon, said we'll see you tomorrow, right, and so yes, Mr. Lee, yes, Mr. Lee.  And it was very much one of, one of the, the, the--my first experience what they called a Pentecostal church.  It was jumping.  And you'd sit back there sort of frightened like, man, that lady is gonna fall, and she's gonna hurt somebody.  But they were deep into it.  But we felt a bond and that Mr. Lee's gonna give us donuts, and we have to be there and worship on Sunday.  And those are some of the early memories as, as a child.  School, the first school that I went to was Weaver Elementary [later, Weaver Middle School, Merced, California], which was also in the country.  We lived outside the city limits.  We lived in the county limits.  And it was a school that was populated primarily by poor, working class, largely ethnic African American and Mexican--I said Mexican 'cause there, it was far more Mexican than it was general Latino--and sort of working class white farmers' children, other regular workers who live in the county.
Story_ID: 174848
Speaker 1: --Weaver [Elementary, later, Weaver Middle School, Merced, California] was an interesting school, not only the diversity but the, the commonality of people who were sort of poor and working class that was significant.  My cousin, George Ray Johnson [ph.], who was born eighteen days after I was born--he was born January 18th, 1953--we were comrades from the, from birth.  Now, it's ironic that my aunt's first child, also a boy, was born the first, you know, eighteen days later.  So both of my grandparents' [Willie Reed and Essie Reed] first children, their first two daughters, their oldest children, had their babies eighteen days apart.  And, and George and I were always together, and we were in school at Weaver together in elementary school.  And the first thing I can remember about George was kids would have their lunches, and he was trying to get my attention because what he was doing was--our lunch was very simple, sometimes a sandwich.  But we didn't have like other people: sandwich, fruit, cookies, you know, drinks, et cetera.  And he would be going through people's lunches when they were in the little room where you put your lunchboxes and your coats, stealing stuff and giving it to me.  I said that's very interesting.  Boy, we can go from a sandwich to a sandwich and a banana, and that, that was notorious George.  And, and I guess he thought no one would notice.  At some point the teachers said, "Children, John's lunch doesn't have his banana.  And Mary's cookies are gone, and we can't do that.  Does anyone know about John's, dah, dah, dah, dah?"  And I'd look at George, and he'd look down, so we had to stop that.  But the thing that sort of startled me, and, and, and at Weaver was that I had no idea that I was poor.  It just didn't occur to me.  I was living with my--we were both living with my grandparents out there in their large two-room house, me and my sembly [ph.]--siblings, George and his older sister, my grandparents and her kids.  Because our parents just weren't doing what they could do to take care of parents, we were staying with them.  And I remember one day the teacher sent me to the office with a note.  I had no idea what that note was about.  And I went there, and what happened is that she was so concerned about the clothing that I was wearing, that it was so tattered, and it was clear that I wasn't showered, et cetera, she had sent me there.  And, and the nurse or somebody took me to a room, says, you know, "Why don't you go in there.  Here's a towel, take a shower, come out and put these on," and gave me a, a set of used clothes, but they were new to me.  It was the first time I sort of understood a difference.  I was, I would, I was embarrassed, but also I was sort of amazed that somebody had even noticed, 'cause I had never noticed that any of the other six or seven-year-old kids thought anything about it.  And so it was a remarkable memory that I've always had of somebody recognizing this--
Story_ID: 174849
Speaker 1: It happened again in fourth grade in a different context.  I was at the Galen Clark Elementary School [Merced, California], and I had my first African American male teacher.  He was named Mr. Lee [ph.], no relationship to Moneyback Lee [ph.].  This guy was always impressed me.  He was very good in class.  We loved him.  And we'd, we'd move from the county into the city [Merced, California].  We were living with my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson], as opposed to my grandmother [Essie Reed].  And one day he gave me a note.  He told me to go up to Mr. Roberts' [ph.] office.  Mr. Roberts, who lived about four or five blocks from my elementary school, had a barbershop, Al Roberts.  And I went there and gave him the note.  And what happens, that Mr. Lee had said look, I want you to take care of this young man.  He clearly needs his hair cut and hadn't it done in a long time.  Will you take care of him and put it on my bill?  And so I went there and handed him the note.  And then I got in the chair when he told me to get in the chair, and he cut my hair.  I thought that was wonderful.  And I knew I didn't have any money.  I didn't know what to do.  He said--and he wrote something down and said you know, give this to your teacher, and I went back to school.  And it took me forever to remember that.  I actually had a chance to thank Mr. Lee, not then, in the fourth grade, but about twenty-five years later.  I was fortunate to be inducted in the California Public School Hall of Fame.  They had a ceremony in San Diego, California.  My parents went, my, my aunt, not my father [Charles Ogletree, Sr.] but my mother, my aunt, wife then.  I had completed college I think.  I think I was, just started practicing, and ironically, Mr. Lee had moved from Merced [California] to Los Angeles [California].  Two months before this event, there was a photograph of me in the Los Angeles Times newspaper where I was moderating a panel about the [U.S.] Constitution and civil rights and criminal justice, and he saw the picture.  I was at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] then I think or--(unclear)--but he called anyway.  He called and said, "Ogletree, this is Mr. Lee."  And I--he said, "How your, how did you know?"  He said, "Look, I didn't even see your face.  All I saw was your eyes, those moon eyes, in the picture, and I knew that was you."  And he--this is twenty-five years later.  He didn't even, he said I didn't even read the caption, but I knew it was you 'cause I know you had these droopy eyes every time you were a kid in my fourth grade class.  As a result of that, we made contact.  And I told him about the event coming up and invited him to San Diego, and he came.  And I was able to tell that story the same day I was getting the award.  At the same time they were inducting me, they were inducting several other people.  But it was remarkable for me to be able to look back and thank him.  I also invited Mr. Hanes [ph.].  Mr. Hanes was the principal at that school, a Native American, who's still alive in his, in his late eighties.  And sort of, you know, this is not about me.  This is about the teachers and principals and others who looked out for me to make it possible for me to go from nowhere and no one to somewhere and someone decades later.  And so, those incidents are the early childhood, both the shower and clothes in kindergarten and first grade and the haircut in fourth grade.  People sort of noticed my poverty but looked beyond it to try to figure out what are some things they could do without embarrassing me.  They didn't talk about me.  They didn't demean me.  They just quietly and privately tried to help me through.  And those are things I will never forget.
Story_ID: 174850
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna take you back.  You were, you very adeptly described some of the sights that reminded you of your childhood.  I'm wondering if you could talk about any sounds or smells.
Speaker 2: The, the, as I think about growing up, there are some remarkable memories, first in the rural part, the county of Merced [California] where my grandparents [Willie Reed and Essie Reed] lived.  I remember going out to the area where they lived, and there was a little creek there.  And the reason I remember is when we were very, very young, I remember the sight of this water rushing, which means it was very hard to catch any fish, but we, we'd catch what we called crawdads.  Some people call crawfish.  And we'd boil them and have a, or fry them, have a wonderful meal.  We were out there one day doing that, and my sister, my older sister, Barbara, who's the older of the two girls, who's now deceased, somehow fell into the creek.  Everybody was startled she fell in and literally went from one side of the creek under the tunnel across the road before she came out on the other side.  And my Uncle, Jab--that's his nickname--Turner [ph.], was there and got her and pulled her out.  So I remember the, the, the, just this whole creek going from a place that would feed us and would--we could swim in, et cetera, almost taken away a cherished sister.  And so that, that, that was sort of a memory of a place and that, that I can just still feel that water, the sound of that ripple water that seemed quiet but was deceptively dangerous right below the surface.  I remember, even more significantly as a kid, that we lived very close to the railroad tracks.  And I used to sit up at night listening to the trains go through, the sound of the trains, not just the alarm from the conductor, which you would hear when you'd hear the whistle blow, but I remember more just the sound of the wheels on the tracks.  And I used that as a vehicle to figuratively take me from where I was in Merced to places I could only imagine ever going.  And so I was on that train, and that train was taking me to San Francisco [California] 'cause that's where the, the Giants played baseball.  And that train was taking me to Los Angeles [California] because I would sit up at night and listen to Vin Scully talk about the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Sandy Koufax, and Johnny Roseboro, and all the great Dodgers players of the fifties [1950s] and sixties [1960s].  I remember that train taking me all the way to Baja, California because at night I would hear on the radio Wolfman Jack playing music, a lot of rock 'n' roll, but occasionally some [The] Temptations or some James Brown or something else that clicked with me, and so the sounds on the radio when my parents would be sleep.  But you know, I would keep it on low because he would come on late, and I could listen to Wolfman Jack; I could listen to the baseball games, and that, that sound was important.  But I also remember just walking out of the back of our houses and walking to the fields and smelling grass and thinking how wonderful it was and hearing birds chirp and fly around and how much the, the freedom meant, the open space, what that meant in the context of a young man.
Story_ID: 174851
Speaker 1: --But the most important smells were, of course, those coming out of the kitchen, my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] cooking these dinners and using things that she would scrap together and the fact that there was no part of a pig she didn't respect, from the tails to the head, from the nose to the ham hocks, to the chitlins [chitterlings], to the hog maws, to the pork rinds, to the bacon, to the ham, to the snouts.  And it was just remarkable that there was nothing that was thrown away.  And I remember that, you know, the whole idea that this early morning breakfast, having her make these pancakes or whatever else she would make, that, that we were--when she cooked we always ate well.  And she didn't have to come knocking on the door or ringing a bell.  That smell would hit you, and, and you would find a way to get up and get to the table and get there as soon as you could because with six of us around the house as children, you had to fight for your space.  There were no reserved seats, you know.  You got there and the first person there would get the best seat.  And you would eat according to your ability to jump at what was available, and, and take care of yourself.  The other sounds growing up were the sounds of sirens often from police cars or other emergency vehicles.  There was a constant refrain in this community.  And it, it largely influenced my career path when I thought the police had just too much authority over people who were poor and who were black outside the judicial system, that you'd hear a siren, and you'd say oh, they got somebody else.  Or, the other point is not the siren, the sight of a car without a siren, like, they're gonna try to get this brother to give 'em some information when they don't have a basis to arrest him.  And so those were the early memories that sort of shaped my sense about it.  The other sound, when we moved to another part of the country [sic, county], on, on Beachwood Drive, we were just a block away from the freeway, so I remember hearing cars come at night going, you know, traffic all up and down [Highway] 99, the major highway that would go from San Francisco [California] north to Los Angeles [California] south, the main thoroughfare in the central part of California.  I can imagine traveling on the, those highways as well.  But I also remember listening to the cars and keep imagining, okay, my mother's coming home; she should get here now; and it's not her, or my father's [Charles Ogletree, Sr.] gonna be visiting--they were separated by then--my father's gonna be visiting; it was not him, and that sense of trying to guess which car was our car, which time they're coming home, and playing a game so it's not to be--and as, and as opposed to being angry being hopeful.  If I keep waiting, if I keep guessing, that car is gonna be our car.  And of course, particularly on the weekends, that didn't happen.  My mother would go out to a club and dance or something and, and wouldn't see her Friday nights.  She'd come back sometime maybe Saturday night.  And that, those sort of memories of hearing cars and listening to cars were part of the sounds that sort of shaped my early sense about, okay, you've got to become more responsible; you've gotta step up to the plate; you've gotta take on the necessary role of working with your brothers and sisters to keep moving.  So those are some of the amazing, and painful, and challenging, and delightful sort of sights and sounds of growing up a kid in Merced.
Story_ID: 174852
Speaker 1: Now, was, what was your family life like?  And I just--I mean, at what point did you go, go to live with your grandparents [Willie Reed and Essie Reed]?  I mean, how old were you at that point and--
Speaker 2: When we were growing up, my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] obviously was a young mother, nineteen years old having her first child; and then my brother came just a year and a half later; and then my sister came a year after that.  And so there are all--
Speaker 1: Can you give--
Speaker 2: --five of us.
Speaker 1: --their names?
Speaker 2: Yep, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the--
Speaker 2: I was born in 1952; in '54 [1954] my brother Rick--Robert [ph.]--was the next oldest was born; and then in '55 [1955] my sister, Barbara; and then after Barbara was born, my brother Richard [ph.] was born in '57 [1957]; and then in '58 [1958] my youngest sister, Rose Marie [ph.].  So they were all close together.  And since there were so many of us, we went through a variety of, of, of experiences and, and opportunities.  The, my, by the time my sister, Rose, was born, my mother and father's [Charles Ogletree, Sr.] relationship had become so rough that they were not going to stay together.  So by the sixties [1960s], they were separated and then divorced.  And so my mother was not really able to manage a family that size.  And so we went not--we went with my grandparents for a while when we were still preschool.  But that burden in a one, literally, one-room apartment was impossible for them.  And so the next step was that whenever, when my mother have to go into the hospital for a few days or something, we'd go into foster care or some kind of home for children, and we would be separated.  In fact, the brother under me, Robert, who had had some difficulties in school where people thought he was, he was very aggressive.  But at that time, that was considered acting out in a way, and so he ended up being placed almost permanently in a foster home.  He remembers being a kid and, and not home with us.  I would spend weekends with him; I would stay at the, at the foster home.  Mr. Mackey's [ph.] foster home was also in the rural part, Mr. and Mrs. Mackey.  And, and that's where Robert grew up in his early, so elementary years.  And so, we went from place to place to place to place to place, grandparents, foster home, a series of different placements.  And it didn't really change until by the time I was in junior high.  By the time I was getting to my teens, then there was, my mother then sort of took control, was a single mother and able to provide the support that we needed.  And that's when we all finally lived together, and Robert actually came home and lived with us as well.
Story_ID: 174853
Speaker 1: We [Ogletree and his siblings] actually went back one year to all the places that we lived.  And this was in the '90s [1990s], and I found it remarkable.  Every place that we lived has been--clearly it was condemned; but it's all been destroyed.  None of the places lived except the last house that we lived in before my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] moved to Reno [Nevada] in the '90s [1990s] on 1240 Home Avenue [Merced, California].  That's the only one that's still existing.  But the two places out in the country, and Cullen Avenue, and Childs Avenue, the place, 964 K Street.  I don't know why I remember these addresses, but I do.  Beachwood Drive, that's gone, and a variety of other places that we lived temporarily were all gone.  And, and the, the, actually the first place that we really owned was 1240 Home Avenue.  That's our real home, and we didn't get that until the '70s [1970s] when I was about to go to high school that, that we got that.  And so that's the, the recollection of where we were, what we were doing, and how we managed to manage under those circumstances.
Story_ID: 174854
Speaker 1: As the oldest, were you told your position as the oldest, or, or, and who told you that?
Speaker 2: Both my parents.  I, I should say that even though my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] and father [Charles Ogletree, Sr.] were separated in 1960, they were, with a couple of occasions when, when it didn't go well, they were friends and had a relationship the entire time, meaning my father would come over; he'd come over for dinner all the time.  She'd take him dinner to the, his house.  She'd take him to his medical appointments when he couldn't go.  She'd go through his mail and help him pay the bills.  But they both told me my responsibility.  And I had to make sure that people were up and were going, people were going to school, people were getting their things done.  And, but, but they told me--it, it wasn't an order; it, it was more of just a natural clarification.  We had an older brother, Curtis Reed [ph.], my mother's first child.  But Curtis, you know, dropped out of school, went into [U.S.] Military in the sixties [1960s], dropped out of the military and, and never sort of got back on track.  So it was obvious that I had the responsibility of, of being the, the one responsible for my siblings.  It was easy with Robert [ph.], the one right under me, 'cause we were just a year apart in school, so we were always going to the same place at the same time.  It was harder with the--it was easier with Barbara; she was the next in line; she was only a year behind us so, all three of us were actually in high school at the same time.  Richard [ph.] was not, and Rose [Marie (ph.)], the youngest, was not.  So, three of--it was easy for the three of us to spend more time together, and then the two of them, the two younger ones, have their own focus because they were in elementary school when we were all in the--when they're in middle school, we were all in high school.  But we played, all the boys played sports.  We were all in my--I was involved in Boy Scouts, but we were doing things outside that made it easier.  I played baseball, Richard and Robert played baseball; I played football, they did the same; I played basketball, they would do the same.  And so that was the, the sort of lineage that we used, in terms of how people were expected to do things, and it actually worked extremely well.
Story_ID: 174855
Speaker 1: Now, how large was Merced [California]?
Speaker 2: Merced then was a community of I would say ten or fifteen thousand.  By the time I left, it was in the twenty thousands.  It's probably fifty thousand now.
Speaker 1: But your whole, you, that's where you lived the whole time?
Speaker 2: That, I, I, we never moved out of that city.  We moved to the county.  We never moved out of Merced from the time I was born in 1952 until my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] moved when she remarried, and in 1996 she moved Reno [Nevada].  But the siblings went back and forth.  I was the first to leave; I left for Stanford [University, Stanford, California] in August of 1971.  My brothers, Richard [ph.] and Robert [ph.], went to the junior college, but they both went into the [U.S.] Military in the 1970s and both spent their career in the military.  My sister, Barbara, stayed.  She actually went to school.  She became a member of the sheriff's department; she was a police officer.  And we'd always have these interesting conversations back and forth with her role of trying to lock people up and my role of trying to get 'em out, the lawyer versus the police officer.  But we always respected each other's role.  And she stayed there, got married, had a child, and was murdered on August 17th, 1982, which sort of shocked the whole family, of all the people.  We were all, you know, the brothers had been in the military; I'd been all over the world.  You know, who, you know, who was the safest?  Barbara, she's at home; she's in the community, and then she gets murdered by someone who has yet to be identified.  The family clearly has our views about who was responsible, but the, the investigation led to an arrest that, of her ex-husband that was dropped because they couldn't prove enough evidence to hold him.  And no one's been charged now, more than twenty years later.  And the younger sister, Rose Marie [ph.], she moved to various places.  When she was married she lived in Tennessee; she lived in Stockton, California.  She lives in Reno, Nevada, now.  And she was the one who kept--she lived with my, she lived with my mother off and on.  She lived with my mother in Merced as an adult; she lived with my mother in Reno, and then she got her own place.  So my mother was the sort of anchor in Merced who stayed there longer than all of us, and until she moved, we were all sort of celebrating her there.  We actually had her sixtieth, sixtieth birthday party in November of 1993, and all of us came back.  She had no idea we, we all flew in separately and surprised her with a big birthday party with her sisters and her siblings.  And just three years later she, she had not been married from 1960s to 1990, so she functioned those whole thirty years managing relationships and responsibilities as a single parent, as an independent woman, and as the matriarch for a lot of people.  And she moved and married Calvin Robinson, who she knew.  He was also, had lived in Merced.  And they lived in Reno.  She died just a, a year and a half ago, December in 2001.  So we sort of have celebrated her life all this time.  She died on December 8th.  And she did celebrate her birthday November 8th.  We were able to, to have that last moment with her in 2001 on her sixty-eighth birthday which was terrific for her and for us.
Story_ID: 174856
Speaker 1: --Did people tell you you were special?  Do you remember that ever being identify--I mean as, as a young person, did, did they?
Speaker 2: People said that, and I just discounted it because I didn't know what special meant.  People always sort of, to, to push me to do other things, to leadership positions, to take challenges, and I never even thought about it as--I'm just doing what, what I'm doing; I never had a reason.  It, it was not that you were a favorite but that you have something that, that is going to be important.  And I, I just started seeing certain things academically, that there weren't many other, in some cases any other, African American or minority students in some of the sort of upper level courses I took.  And I just thought that they just chose not to take them; I didn't realize, and I didn't wanna take them.  I was urged: Charles, you need to do this; you need to take the geometry; you need to do this; you need to take this science class.  And I did it because I was urged to do it, not because I had a natural inclination to do it.  And even the idea when I was in high school of getting involved in student government, that wasn't my idea.  Some of the black students said we should have somebody black run, and so they persuaded me.  I was gonna run for vice president of the student body.  The dean of students and the student body president came to me and said, "You shouldn't run for vice president.  You should run for president."  I said, "What?"  He says, "You're a leader; you've done all these things on campus; you're an athlete; you're a scholar; you're very much involved in the school's livelihood as a citizen; run for president."  And I was, I was startled 'cause it had never occurred to me to run for president.  I, it's like, you know, that's for, you know, the person who wants to lead.  And they pushed me there, and I didn't even realize the significance of it until I won, that in this school that had been around for generations, that I was the first black to ever be the student body president.  I didn't know that that was important or that it had happened until I was told.  And I didn't run, interesting, on--and the campaign didn't have anything to do with race other than saying that I run a campaign of unity.  And my theme was I want everybody involved in the school's success.  And I, what I did was to identify the people who I play football with.  I said when we play football we're not all the same.  We have a quarterback; and we have a, a guard; we have a center; and we have a defensive lineman; we have a tackle; and, and we have a linebacker.  And we can't be effective unless we all come together.  If we're all apart we can't succeed.  And that theme sort of caught on.
Story_ID: 174857
Speaker 1: And so those were role models, people who were in education, like Mr. Lee [ph.]--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: --Mr. Lee, who was the, my teacher at Galen Clark Elementary School [Merced, California] and Gayther B. Hanes [ph.], who was our principal.  And it was also not just that they were role models, but Mr. Hanes was Native American.  And so for the first time, I appreciated culture because every year he would have a ceremony, and his son, Cal Hanes [ph.], who still does cultural presentations, would make us understand that there were people here long before there was an America.  And that was a remarkable insight, for this principal to take the time to explain to us, who thought we were from Merced [California], that there is a bigger world; there's a place called Africa; and there's a place called Asia; there's a thing called a Native American.  And so those were the sort of early influences in some respects.  But in terms of the motivation, it, it's no doubt that I wanted to be successful, and I refused to fail.  But there wasn't a doctor or a lawyer who said son, I, I want to show you the ropes so that you can think about this.  There wasn't someone who was a professional who said you, you--I wanna help you make it.  I, my limited exposure--I, I, well, I didn't even mention, I mean, what, what, what, what influenced my life?  It wasn't just hearing the train at night and dreaming or hearing the cars and imagining.  I had this foolish notion that reading was fun.  I went to the library on J Street [Merced, California] right down the street from my house.  And the worst thing they could have done was to say we have a contest.  Every time you read a book you get a star, and I wanted those stars.  And I read, I mean read, I read book after book after book.  It was a game, right: how many books could I read?  But what I was doing, I was absorbing knowledge, and I was imagining places; I was learning about events.  It did--it didn't change me culturally, but it created an intellectual curiosity as a young kid, that, wow, I would be interested in doing that; I should try that; I should think about that.  And for some reason, even at that young age, before I realized math was math, I really enjoyed numbers.  I really enjoyed problem solving, and I did it very well.  If I'd been told to do it, I probably would have resented it and rejected it.  But since I was allowed to do it, and it was fun, that made all the difference.  So it was growing up in an environment where seeing a world other than the one I lived in was transformative.  The world I lived in was poverty.  It was painful.  It was depressing.  It was, you know, tortured family.  It was little opportunity for hope.  There was no one who'd finished high school yet, no one who'd thought about college, no one who had a serious job that was respected in the larger community.  And so I had to look what, sort of within myself and also outside to find targets--never thought about college and never thought about running for student body president at the high school.  The fact that other people motivated me was, was, was important, and the college was significant.  I was going to finish high school, marry my childhood sweetheart, have a family, and be a postal worker.  That to me, how, what can get any better than that?
Story_ID: 174858
Speaker 1: Mrs. Jackson [ph.], she was a white woman who was my counselor in high school.  She looked at my grades, and she said, "Charles, you're going to go to Stanford [University, Stanford, California]."  And she gave me all this argument.  She says, "I'm a Stanford graduate.  It's an excellent school.  I'm sure you can get in with your grades.  You should do that."  And I had no idea what she was talking about, but I tried to be smart and, and, and tell her why I wasn't gonna go.  I said you know, I appreciate that, but I don't wanna go that far from home.  I really like being here in California, and I don't wanna be away from my family, going all the way to Connecticut and, and the cold weather and all that.  I'm really happy here.
Speaker 2: Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 1: No, Stanford.
Speaker 2: Stanford, okay.  She was--oh--
Speaker 1: She was saying Stanford.  And so for me, I was thinking of Stanford's in Connecticut 'cause I didn't know.  I'd never heard of it.  It's right down the street.  I had no idea.  And she said, "Charles, you fool, Stanford's not in Connecticut.  It's in California.  It's right up the street."  I, I, I was so embarrassed, I was so embarrassed.  And so I applied, and then I went to Stanford.  I drove up to see the campus, and I, I--the campus was just overwhelming.  And college to me is gonna be all these white kids.  I said I don't know if I could, I, I don't know if I want that environment.  I just went through that in high school, and I, do I, do I wanna do that again?  I went to the admissions office, and I met this guy.  I guess his name was Rick Turner [ph.].  And I walk in, and here is a black man at Stanford in the admissions office.  I said oh my God, that's fantastic.  It's not just a black man, a black man with a mustache, a goatee, and a beard.  I said wow, black man with a natural.  And what really floored me, this black man had a, a leather bag bigger than a woman's purse.  I'm saying, I'm--this is--and he didn't have on a suit and tie.  I said this is out of this world.  And, and, and he talked to me, and he encouraged me and urged me, and that sold me.  After I saw, gosh, this brother here, I went back and completed the application and decided to do it.  I also was, was interested in Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  I'd heard of Howard.  And I sent the request to get an application from Howard.  And ironically, the day or near the time I was finally leaving from Stanford after being admitted, I got a notice from Howard that they'd received my request for an application but no application.  And so, I don't know whether I would have gone.  I'm not saying that I would have or wouldn't have, but it, it, it, it was so far away, and I--but it was just interesting.  I wanted to see what a black school was like, a black college life.
Story_ID: 174859
Speaker 1: So I went to Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  They had a black dorm, Roble Hall.  I was able to stay in the black dorm.  They had students from everywhere.  Met my wife, Pam Barnes then, Pam Barnes, who is from Compton [California].  She grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, but she was from Compton High School [Compton, California].  So I met all these real people who were black.  And I met my lifelong friends, people who now are the closest people to me in life.   And it was that sort of experience.  It was, even then, as my wife always tell me, says, you know, you're destined.  I said no, no.  She said no, she said God has this plan for you, and I know--'cause I kept asking: you know, how do you think I ended up at Stanford?  She said God, that was God's plan that I'd go to Stanford.  And first year--yeah, I'm trying to contribute to a few things.  And the black students say, "We need new leadership in the Black Student Union [BSU].  We want you to be it."  I said, "I'm only a freshman."  "Yeah, but we need new leadership."  So I'm urged to and decide to run.  I become the freshman president of my spring year of Black Student Union.  First year I'm there [HM] Angela Davis is about to be tried.  She's held in a, a woman's detention center in Palo Alto [California], right across the street from the Stanford campus.  We created an organization called the Stanford Students for the Defense of Angela Davis and All Political Prisoners.  As the chair, I get to go to jail to meet her, and I go to tell her we're raising money; we're raising consciousness.  We're just college students.  We wanna help you in your trial.  I--and she'd overwhelms me, this beautiful black woman, this big, big afro, smoking a pipe, and looking at me like the scholar, genius she is.  I'm just overwhelmed.  And I told her we're gonna in, you know, we're gonna help her.  And she said, "Well, I appreciate that, brother, but you don't need to help me.  I'm gonna be all right.  What you need to do is to help others who can't get the sort of focus and attention I get.  There are a lot of political prisoners in America, and you need to focus on raising the consciousness of others."  Now that was nice advice, but it was troubling to me because when she told me this, we already had, you know, we--these were the days of silkscreen t-shirts.  We already had them.  We were the Stanford Students for the Defense of Angela Davis.  So we had to go back and create new t-shirts, Stanford Students for the Defense of Angela Davis and All Political Prisoners, right.  And that in and of itself, say oh my God.  But, I did that as the BSU president--

Speaker 1: The second year the students urged me and some other came to recruit me to run for student body president.  That year Stanford [University, Stanford, California] had its first African American president, Doug McHenry, and the co-president was Diane--what's Diane's last name--Geocaris, Diane Fields Geocaris.  And so they urged me to run as a, for the next year.  And so I was elected one of the Stanford student body co-presidents in my, at the end of sophomore year and start of my junior year.  So we were going to the trial the second year, support [HM] Angela Davis at this.  And we actually went down to the Rose Bowl when Stanford was in the Rose Bowl.  We pulled out this, unfurled this big banner that said "Free Angela Davis."  It was funny, because as we were doing it, we did two things.  Now that the statute of limitations is over I can talk about it.  We spent our winter vacation going down to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], making the banner, but we needed to have some cloth.  What did we do?  Well, we took about ten sheets from Stanford from different supply rooms, strung them together, and painted this beautiful sign that we had to smuggle into the Rose Bowl.  And as they were playing the national anthem, we were seated, we had tickets as stu- students when Stanford played.  We had, we unfurled the banner, and some of the other Stanford alumni were helping us hold it up 'cause they thought it was something like "Go Stanford."  And then when they, when they started looking what they're holding up, it said "Free Angela Davis," they started trying to tear it down and pull it down.  But it was a fascinating experience to go from, you know, being this little kid at this overwhelming college to then organizing my peers and colleagues to go to Stanford's celebratory participation, the Rose Bowl, but to make a political statement about Angela Davis.  So it was a remarkable series of events that, that we had.  And so motivation, it's clearly from God, but--and also know that I'm, I'm on the, the, the shoulders of Big Daddy [maternal grandfather, Willie Reed] and Big Mama [maternal grandmother, Essie Reed] and my parents [Charles Ogletree, Sr. and Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] and all these folks who sacrificed before to lay the groundwork.  That's where I am; that's where I'll be, and I just hope that I can make the kind of contributions that will give the next generation some shoulders to stand on to do what they must do to go forward.

Speaker 1: When we last ended, you were talking about how you had, you know, you were, had gone to Stanford [University, Stanford, California] and how you got involved immediately with the Black Student Union, and how your, you know, your first thing--your meeting with [HM] Angela Davis.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, you know, how you went to her and (laughter) you know, you had T-shirts already printed up--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  We had to start all over.  Right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So I want you--and, you know, how you went to the--I think you were at the, the game--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Rose Bowl, Stanford was in the Rose Bowl.
Speaker 1: The Rose Bowl, and, you know, pulling and people were starting pulling down the flag [sic., "Free Angela Davis" banner].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So I would like you to start sort of at that point again and continue about how, even, you know, those first years, you know, were at Stanford because you even said that you originally wanted to go to, you know, Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And, you know, ended up at Stanford.
Speaker 2: Well, Stanford University was a real cultural awakening for me.  No one in my family had finished high school, forget about college.  And to go to a prime academic institution, one that had a great reputation, and to be around a lot of smart people was a real challenge.  And yet, I felt comforted in the sense that at least it was near home.  Stanford was two and a half hours from Merced [California].  It seemed like an eternity away, but it really was a reasonable distance from home.  And while at Stamford, what I realized was that I had this unquenchable thirst for both knowledge and activity.  I wanted to learn what the world was about, but I wanted to be a player in the world as well.  And so I don't think I could have picked a better spot for me.  The Black Panther Party was very vigorous in Northern California and Oakland [California] and other communities in, in Northern California.  Bobby Seale, Huey Newton, Eldridge Cleaver, all the people would come to Stanford campus and give speeches.  We would go up to Oakland for meetings.  At the same time, we also had, every year, African Liberation Day.  And we would go to attend that, and--at parks, a park in San Francisco [California].  At the same time, we would go to hear the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and this young prophet by the name of [HM The Honorable Minister] Louis Farrakhan who we really didn't know, at Temple 26B [sic.], I believe it was in Oakland, California.  And so we were surrounded by this sort of black consciousness as we were a few black students at this predominantly white, very prestigious university.  And so being involved in the Black Students Union, as the president there, being involved in the university politics as the co-president of the student body, being involved in regional politics, being concerned about issues of development in South--Africa, all of Africa, was a fascinating time for me to be at Stanford.
Story_ID: 179514
Speaker 1: At the same time, I was serious about my studies.  I went to class.  I did the research.  I questioned my faculty members.  I wanted to know more than I'd learn in a case book, more than I'd learn in the class discussion.  And so this, trying to connect the real world to the theoretical world was something that captured my attention, even in my late teens when I was at Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  And what made it remarkable is that I had a wonderful mentor that opened my eyes to not just the black consciousness struggle, as I knew it in the United States, but the black consciousness struggle in African and the diaspora.  Just before I arrived at Stanford, and we arrived in 1971, Stanford had hired Dr. St. Clair Drake, an incredible Pan-Africanist, Africanist, a man I learned so much from.  Most people remember that he was here in Chicago [Illinois].  He wrote the phenomenal book, 'Black Metropolis[: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City]', he and Horace Cayton.  He was an anthropologist and a sociologist, and he was brilliant in those two fields.  He could have been a political scientist, he could have been an economist, I mean no matter--whatever field, he was just a brilliant man with a huge pepper--salt and pepper colored beard, always with a cigarette and, and dangling from his, from his lips; always with a pen in his hands, writing something, and conversation never ended, and riding the campus on a bicycle.  He didn't drive, you never saw him driving.  You saw him walking, but he was a bike man.  It's amazing seeing this guy in his fifties then, riding around campus, carrying a stack of papers under his arms and books in his, in the tray on his bike, riding the campus.  And he'd stop for five-minute conversations.  He, he would enthrall you for forty-five minutes.  And so--and he started talking about Africa and drew me into Africa as well.  So even at Stanford, I began to understand the larger connect--context, the connection between Africans in America, Africans in Africa, and Africans in other parts of the diaspora.  It was the first time that I really appreciated that I was not from the United States or from California, or from Merced [California].  I was a descendant of slaves from Africa, and St. Clair Drake made that absolutely clear and changed my whole perspective on life.  The first thing he did was also make it possible for me to go to a conference in Africa.  I'd never traveled outside the United States.  I'd never really traveled around the United States.  I'd flown once when I was in high school from Merced to Washington, D.C., but Drake called me in and said, "Look, you have this interest in Africa.  And I want you to do something."  I said, "Dr. Drake, what do you want me to do?"  He says, "Well, I want you to do me a favor.  I want you to deliver a paper for me."  I said, "Where?"  He says, "Well, we've been talking about this Pan-Africanism Movement.  There is a conference, there's a conference called the Sixth Pan-African Congress [Dar es Salaam, Tanzania]."  Now, what I knew from Dr. Drake and others is that there had been five other conferences about Africa with [W.E.B.] Du Bois, [Kwame] Nkrumah, other great American and African leaders, talking about how do we create an independent African continent?  They met outside Africa on many occasions because they didn't--there was no place to meet in Africa in the early 1900s.  There were really few independent nations.  And this sixth one was going to move from, we need to get rid of slavery in Africa.  We need to get rid of colonialism in Africa, to we need to deal with neo-colonialism, that is, black leaders who were just as bad as the colonial leaders.  And we need to talk about a new self governance among African nations.  So he was asked to come.  He says, I've been to Africa before.  He knew Nkrumah, he knew Jomo Kenyatta, he knew Julius Nyerere, he knew leaders of all Africa.  And he said, "I've done that.  I, I've been part of that.  You go."  And the funny thing is that when he wanted me to deliver his paper, we should be clear.  He literally wanted me to deliver his paper, not present it.  Now, I'm a college student, but--and I, I have to clarify that for history's sake because I did deliver his paper, which was a terrific paper.  But he really wanted an excuse for me to go to Africa.  And I was part of a delegation of over two hundred African Americans who went.  They included Dr. James Turner, who was chairman of the African Studies Program at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and who was a significant member of the Pan-Africanist Movement, included the, the matriarch of the reparations movement, Queen Mother Aduley Moore, from New York [New York].  She was on that flight.  And every movement of, cultural nationalists, Socialists, any other group of Africanists were part of that delegation.  We left from New York.  We insisted on flying, not in the normal set but we wanted third-world pilots.  We're not gonna take the usual European pilots and use your European plane.  So we got a plane, a 747.  It was Air India, I believe, and we also had third-world pilots.  And so we were ready to go.  People were dressed in their African attire.  We were the largest delegation coming of Africans from the United States.
Story_ID: 179515
Speaker 1: And you know what happened in the '70s [1970s], in the '70s [1970s] when you fly anywhere, but certainly flying across the Atlantic Ocean, we hit turbulence, and boy, you, you couldn't believe these Negroes, "Oh, my God, why do we have these third-world pilots?  The plane's gonna crash."  All that faith and commitment was lost in a moment's notice.  And it was amazing, everybody was freaking out because, you know, turbulence is normal, but a lot of those people hadn't flown before.  And they were over the ocean, and they thought we were gone.  And it showed that their faith may have been broad, but it wasn't very deep in this cultural identity.  There was one person who road through the whole thing and didn't say a word.  It was Queen Mother [Audley] Moore.  She was just stoic.  She was just sitting there.  And it was remarkable.  Of course, we landed.  We were fine, but there was this sense of--to me that was the most ironic moment that, that we lost all of our identity over the, the Atlantic Ocean just before we landed in Africa.  And when we were there [Sixth Pan-African Congress, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania] talking about issues of, you know, African independence and self determination and economic development and the end of imperialism, she was saying, well, you fools aren't talking about the real issue for us.  And the real issue for us as Africans in America is reparations.  We said, reparations, what is that?  And she was introducing in the '70s [1970s], long before it became popular, the whole idea that America owed a debt to Africans who came and built this great country.  She talked about all the structures in Washington, D.C., the White House, the, the [U.S.] Capitol, the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, Washington Monument, slave labor was used to build all these great things, but not a single plaque, no reflection of that.  Randall Robinson's recent book, 'The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks' recounts what Queen Mother Moore told us decades ago.  And she said, we shouldn't be focused on affirmative action or civil rights.  It's too modest.  We have to pay the debt, and she says, there's a debt that's owed, and it's billions of dollars for our centuries of labor.  That's what we should be talking about.  And it's amazing that she was the leader of that movement when I was a college student.  It was very powerful, and, but no one took it up, outside a very narrow and focused community.  But that, to me, was another awakening.  Stanford was just not the education and the, and the books and the classroom.  It was the education, meeting people who had fundamental ideas about how the world should be and who were not afraid to express those ideas.
Story_ID: 179516
Speaker 1: Now, what year was it when you went to Africa?  What year--was it your sophomore--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: It was my junior year.
Speaker 1: Junior year.
Speaker 2: My junior year at Stanford [University, Stanford, California].
Speaker 1: And what was the first year that you took a class with St. Clair Drake and what was the class?
Speaker 2: I met St. Clair Drake when I had started at Stanford in 1971.  I started sitting in his classes as a freshman before I took any of his classes.  It was an anthropology class that I first went in 'cause I'd heard about him.  And I wasn't even registered in the class, but I, I just found myself drawn to him because you'd sit there and this guy could give a lecture for fifty minutes without a note and without interruption, that was just full of depth and full of context and full of history, personal stories, and at an intellectual level that had you saying, oh, my God, never stop.  So I was in the anthropology class and then the sociology class.  But then he hired me as a researcher because he was the head of the African American Studies department.  And I was the Black Student Union president.  So I was more a research assistant for him than a student.  I ended up being part of his work, and that's where we really developed a meaningful relationship, with him, Dr. Ron Bailey, who was an assistant in the office and who then went on to teach at Tennessee State [sic.] and a few other places.  And so that's what drew me in.  And it was also--this is later, but I just want to give the context now.  It was Drake who was the--he was sort of the mentor that I remember bringing me into Stanford.  He also sort of gave the final message to our group when we left Stanford.  He was a source of inspiration and comfort, the early years, when we were all there, without apology.  We, we were parts of affirmative action.  And I proudly say that.  Some people say, "I made it there on my own merit."  And I, you know, my sense is that I would not have been at Stanford if there was no effort to have a program to reach out.  I don't think Stanford even knew that black people were in Merced [California].  I don't think it knew where Merced was, even though it was only two and a half hours away from the Stanford campus.  And I know that's significant because there weren't any black students from Stanford going, a decade after I left.  So, it's, it's sort of more accidental, but they did outreach, and my counselors helped for that to happen, but being at Stanford with Drake, even though we were there, and we had the grades to get in, and we had the test scores to get in, we ended up confronting issues of racism outside the classroom that made us question whether we deserved to be there.
Story_ID: 179517
Speaker 1: A prominent scholar who was a physicist.  His name was William Shockley and another professor named [Arthur] Jensen from [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California].  Shockley was at Stanford [University, Stanford, California], created the transistor, Nobel Prize reading--winning physicist.  He decided he'd, had another hobby.  One that he had no qualify- qualifications for, but something he seemed deeply interested in.  William Shockley started saying, you know, this genetics suggest that blacks are intellectually inferior to whites.  And here we are, this first generation of significant numbers of blacks, coming to Stanford and having a highly recognized scholar make comments about whether we had the capacity to do the work there.  And so we--at the first time, we were already upset about Shockley.  And what I did is I actually organized a debate with Shockley.  And we were able to get a black psychologist, Professor Cedric Clark who was also a member of the Nation of Islam, a Black Muslim, and he changed his name to Cedric X.  He debated him and another psychologist from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and we had this public forum with hundreds and hundreds of students and faculty and community at this forum.  And what made it so dramatic is that, when Cedric X came in, there were also a hundred members of FOI, the Fruit of Islam.  And these white folks were saying, "Oh, my God, what are they doing?"  The Fruit of Islam carry no weapons, but they saw all these black men, very disciplined, very clean cut, three--nice suits, walking and standing around for security.  And it, it was just an amazing scene to see the Fruit of Islam, Professor "X," the other faculty member and Shockley.  And the debate was amazing.  In hindsight, I wonder whether or not it was a useful experience for this reason.  It was important to show that Shockley's views were flawed, as they were.  And that was shown at that event.  But as I think about it now, did we give him another forum for his odious ideas, even though the ideas were proven to be false?  But for me it was a wake-up call because it meant that even though you were legitimately at a place like Stanford, you still had to defend your presence there every single day and in every single way.  And so it was remarkable to have to go through that Shockley experience.  And we had to prove it in the classroom, that yes, we belong here.  But there were always those who doubted it.
Story_ID: 179518
Speaker 1: With [St. Clair] Drake, it came up again.  So we came in with this [William] Shockley experience.  Before we left, we had it all over again.  Our senior year, 1975, our president, Richard Lyman, who had been there during all the demonstrations, the anti-war demonstrations, the demonstrations following [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King's [Jr.] assassination in '68 [1968], announced that the commencement speaker for our class was going to be none other than Daniel Patrick Moynihan.  We were shocked and dismayed because Moynihan, within that decade, had made a name for himself by raising questions about the stability of single-parent, black families.  What made it so offensive to us as Stanford students is that many of us were from single-parent, black families.  And as we were going to celebrate with them in June of 1975, here we are graduating from Stanford, graduating with honors and graduating with all these societies, that we had made it despite all the barriers, it was to us, a direct slap in the face to have a Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a symbol and the substance of challenges to our capacity, to be our commencement speaker.  We started something at Stanford that was, at that time, not going on anywhere else.  I helped to start the very first, what I called, black resistance graduation.  Stanford had its graduation on Sunday, but we called all our parents and told them, Moynihan's gonna be the speaker.  We object to that because he doesn't respect the fact that you, our parents, raised us, and that we could flourish despite not coming from a two-parent family.  And so we're gonna have our own ceremony before graduation.  And we want to let you know before you arrived here that we're gonna do that.  We'd like you to come.  And when I wrote the letter, I wasn't sure what was gonna happen.  I didn't tell my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] until after I wrote it because I thought she would have said, "Junior, what are you doing?  We've been waiting all these years.  Boy, are you in trouble again?"  I said, no, this, this is important.  We have to do this.  And so what we did, we organized a black graduation, and we brought all of our parents in that Saturday before.  And our speaker was none other than Dr. St. Clair Drake.  So you had these grandmothers and grandfathers and mothers and some fathers and brothers and sisters, aunt and uncles, and we literally started as a protest to the Harvard--Stanford graduation, a black graduation.  It was a powerful evening.  It was an emotional evening.  There wasn't a dry tear in the room because we explained why we are gonna protest.  And what we told them, we want to let you know, we're gonna graduate tomorrow because we've earned it.  But we're gonna walk out the moment Daniel Patrick Moynihan takes the stand to speak.  We're gonna walk out silently, but emphatically.  We're gonna walk out.  We're gonna turn our backs and walk out because of respect for you.  And so they, they were deeply touched by that and amazed that their children were so committed, and that even the happy celebration of graduation was now being politicized because we were making a statement about who we were and our respect for our families.  So that was Saturday night.  Sunday, we went to the graduation.  We, we put together a beautiful statement that--and I, I just found a copy of it that describes exactly what we were, why we were walking out.  And we went through the morning ceremonies.  We went through all the protocol, the pomp and circumstance.  The president introduced Moynihan--and we told our parents, you don't have to go.  We're gonna go.  We stood up, got out of the line and walked out.  An amazing thing happened.  Parents started walking out and grandparents started walking out.  And then white students started walking out and Hispanic students started walking out and Asian students, Native American students.  And hundreds of people, when we thought there'd be a hundred of us walking out, there were hundreds who walked out, enjoying our movement that had not been organized.  We didn't tell people, and we handed out leaflets to tell them what we were doing.  And, as I was going out, there was this one particular woman, Mrs. Edwards.  She was the grandmother of Belinda Edwards from Atlanta, Georgia.  And she, and as I was going, she says, "I need some help, son."  I said, "Excuse me?"  She said, "I need help, I'm leaving too."  I said, "Ah, ma'am, you don't have to leave.  You know, I know it's gonna be difficult for you."  She said, "Look, I marched with doctor--I marched with Dr. King.  I've been in protests before.  And if you young people are going to do this, I'm gonna do it."  So I took her arm and marched out with her, and it was a powerful thing for me because she was accustomed to this.  I mean she was very comfortable with it, and we thought we were in trouble.  We were out of line, and here was this seventy-year old black woman saying, hey, I'm with you.  I want to be a part of it.  And so for us, it was a powerful event.  The most interesting thing is that one of the most popular guys in our class was a white guy.  His name was Richard Kelley.  He grew up there in, right outside Palo Alto [California].  He was on the Stanford basketball team.  He was 7'1"; you couldn't miss him.  We walked out.  Richard Kelley got up and walked out with us as well.  So you see all these black folks and suddenly you see this big, tall white guy, this lumberjack walking out too.  And to us, it was a just sense that the community understood that.  And so it was a validation of what we meant.
Story_ID: 179519
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that today, every single year at Stanford [University, Stanford, California] and now, at institutions across the country, black students, Asian American students, Latino students and Native American students have graduations for their families on Saturday before the Sunday commencement.  They do it as a sense of pride.  They have no sense--they have absolutely no sense that this was started as a protest.  They do it just in the sense that it's important for us since we don't have a chance to come together as a community to, to have a moment with our families in addition to--it's not in opposition to, it's not a protest.  It's to complement what happens on Sunday.  And there have been press reports recently about all the sort of segregated events, and black students to themselves, but there's a sense of pride that we are from Stanford, and we're of Stanford, but we're not Stanford or Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] or Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.] or Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], and that we have an identity that is above and beyond the institution where we get our education.  And so it's just interesting that something that started in a sort of subtle and almost spontaneous way has now become ingrained and a central part of, of completing your, your educational process at a place like Stanford.  And the fact that [St. Clair] Drake was there at the beginning to open our minds and there at the end, giving a critique of [Daniel Patrick] Moynihan and why it was important for us to appreciate that, was a challenge for us to go on and do other things.  So those Stanford days, in my view, are, are the most important and valuable days of my life.  I don't think that there is anything that's more important in terms of my learning experience that happened than that Stanford, those Stanford years.  In those four years, I must have packed forty years of knowledge and information and experience into it, and that made everything else so wonderful, so overwhelming and so possible because of the grounding that I got at Stanford in 1971 to 1975.
Story_ID: 179520
Speaker 1: Now, what other thing did you learn from St. Clair Drake?  Was there other things, either from an academic perspective or, you know, he was--I mean you got with him so early on, and he sort of took you under your wing.  He's a legend here in Chicago [Illinois].  I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, what was amazing about St. Clair Drake is that what he made me see as a student was that race mattered.  It was something that was hard to understand because you had the Black Panthers on the one hand.  You had [HM] Angela Davis on another hand, you had all these things, but he had a sense to talk about it as an intellectual issue, not just as a political issue.  And he wanted us to be able to be activists, outside the classroom, but to be thought leaders in the classroom.  And so he made me have a much deeper appreciation that Africa was not about Tarzan.  It was not about savages, it was not about a backward civilization, but it was about the cradle of civilization.  It was about community and family.  It was about giving and forgiveness.  And so, he also made me, instead of writing the thesis that I'd thought about, about the Panthers or about race relations and civil rights, he also convinced me that my thesis should be about something that's both intellectual and provocative.  So I wrote my senior thesis under another professor, at his urging, about South Africa and Zimbabwe.  I didn't even know that they existed until I came to Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  But because of his influence and the work that he'd done, he said, "You've got to look at these issues at greater depth.  You can't just read a book or watch a movie and get a sense of South Africa.  You've got to study it, and you've got to understand its flaws and its strengths.  You've got to do the same thing with Zimbabwe."  And so at his urging, I worked with Professor David Abernethy, an expert on, on Africa.  And wrote an honors thesis my senior year, which was actually my--I graduated in three years, my senior year--I graduated in three years, my third year at Stanford, and wrote an honors thesis.  And it was on, it was called The Efficacy of Sanctions as a Instrument of Political Change.  And I said, in Zimbabwe and Mzansi [ph.]--South Africa was known as Mzansi.  And I looked at the history of those countries, that they were dominated by colonial rule.  South Africa was under the grips of colonial rule.  So was Zimbabwe, and said that you needed to have real sanctions because you need to cut off the economic access, strangle the power and ultimately, those nations will get rid of apartheid as they practice it.  And the black majority will have a chance to have democratic principles applied.  That was my thesis, that's my argument.  And I predicted that, that this, this change should not take forever.  It will happen in the 20th century.  And it was interesting, my professor gave me an A minus on my senior thesis.  And his main criticism was that the paper was well written, but my suggestions that the white minority regime would respond to sanctions within that time--and this was 1974.  And I'm saying, that, you know, within a decade or two.  He thought that was sort of romantic and took away from the real focus.  And so his view was that, it's a nice argument, Ogletree, but it, it just--it's too romantic.  It, it's not realistic.
Story_ID: 174870
Speaker 1: I was so pleased with this paper [honors senior thesis] because I thought it, it expressed both the, the--for me, it was the, I, I was restrained because my view before I wrote the paper, and before listening to [St. Clair] Drake, was that, hey, sanctions, that's ridiculous.  Give those Africans some guns.  Let's get rid of these white folks.  We're the majority, they're the minority.  Why do we have to go through this whole process of diplomacy and economic sanctions?  That's ridiculous.  Let's go to war.  And he said, "Ogletree, that's a good idea, but they have the guns and the bullets and the trucks and the tanks, and the blacks have nothing.  They would slaughter them."  And so I didn't--I accepted Dr. Drake's view, which was the right view, although I didn't like it.  And so he persuaded me to stay to the more rigorous idea of a prolonged diplomatic, economic process to change Africa.  And so it was amazing, after getting the, the thesis, I still--I graduated with honors and Phi Beta Kappa [from Stanford University, Stanford, California], but then, of course, a few years after I left, Zimbabwe was free.  Colonial rule was ended.  And then in the '90s [1990s] South Africa was free.  By then, in 1991, I joined the Stanford Board of Trustees so I was traveling to Stanford regularly.  And February, 1990, is when Nelson Mandela was freed and apartheid came to an end.  It was a direct result of other work that I did--not just me, but thousands of people.  But I was on the Trans-Africa Board with Randall Robinson.  He was the president, and Randall Robinson organized, along with Mary Frances Berry, Sylvia Hill, and a few other people, [HM The Honorable Reverend] Walter Fauntroy, to get arrested in front of the South African embassy in the '80s [1980s] because they said, we have to do something dramatic.  And the dramatic thing was to--we'd rather go to jail in order to make sure that South Africa is free.  It's called the choice--the lesser of two evils.  We'd rather break the law in the United States in order to ensure legality and moral order in South Africa.  And so I represented Randall and these other folks as they were getting arrested, and all the charges were ultimately dismissed.  But South Africa was in the news again, and as a result of those demonstrations, during the [President Ronald] Reagan administration, of all times, economic sanctions were applied to South Africa, and they started to have some impact.  And so with the sanctions affecting South Africa, with minority rule being challenged as a moral around the nation, and with demonstrations against South Africa mounting everywhere, [Frederik Willem] de Clerk in 1990, in February, said South Africa's apartheid system will end, as we know it.  And Nelson Mandela will be free.  So when I went back to Stanford for a board meeting in 1991, I said, "Professor [David] Abernethy."  "Oh, Charles, how are you doing?"  I said, "I'm doing fine.  I have a question for you."  He said, "Yes."  I said, "You remember my honors thesis?"   He said, "Ah, I don't quite remember."  I said, "Yeah, I wrote about South Africa and Zimbabwe and about economic sanctions."  He said, "Oh, yeah, that was very good paper."  I said, "Well, you gave me an A minus."  He said, "Yeah."  I said, "Well, remember I said that one of the issues would be South Africa and Zimbabwe would be free because of economic sanctions?  You thought that was an exaggeration."  He said, "Ah, that's, that's true.  You were right; I was wrong."  I said, "Well, I think you owe me an A plus now."  And he only, he just sort of laughed and smiled 'cause he knew it was true.  And so I'd rather be vindicated later.  I said, "You don't need to change the grade, as long as I've changed the course of history.  So I--when, when we both pass on, it ought to be clear that I was right and you were wrong, when you have to ultimately be judged about what happened in South Africa."  But that was part of Drake's impact on me, to look at issues in a much more compli- complicated and multifaceted way--
Story_ID: 174871
Speaker 1: I wanted to solve the problem in Africa tomorrow and to him [St. Clair Drake], he said, you--you got to have a plan, and it has to be a rigorous plan, and it has to be subject to criticism.  His favorite word was, you have to believe in critique and criticism, whatever you're trying to do, your argument has to be subjected to critique and criticism if it's going to have any success.  And I didn't like my arguments critiqued, and I certainly didn't like them criticized.  And it was that sense of taking a much more critical look at what you do and what you say that is an invaluable lesson that I learned from [St. Clair] Drake.  Drake also influenced me in another way.  And that is, when I finished [at Stanford University, Stanford, California] in three years, I didn't know what to do because I, you know, I had a four-year undergraduate scholarship, but I hadn't applied to any graduate school.  I hadn't thought about it.  And I thought I'd have a fourth year scholarship, and I said, well, I'm, I'll get a master's degree.  I might as well do that.  My wife, who I would marry in 1975, was still at Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  So I said, where am I gonna go?  We're gonna get married in a year.  I'm gonna stay here.  And so I told the institution I wanted to stay.  I'm gonna take a master's just for another year just to bide some time.  They said, great.  I said, well, I'm taking my courses, and I got a bill, a financial aid bill--I mean a bill for my term courses.  I said, no, I've got a four-year scholarship.  Why are you charging me?  They said, no, read the fine print.  You, you had a four-year undergraduate scholarship.  You're no longer an undergraduate.  I said, I'm being punished because I finished early.  They said, you had a four-year undergraduate scholarship.  This doesn't apply.  If you'd stayed here as an undergraduate, we had money, but now that you've finished, we--you know, you don't have any undergraduate scholarship.  We went back and forth, and I did get some graduate scholarships, and--but my focus was on international relations.  Well, I had moved completely away from, sort of civil rights issues and, and went to the--it was a political science master's, but it was really an international relations.  I was talking about Sino-Soviet relations.  I was talking about issues in the diaspora.  I was talking about issues in Latin America.  It really was a fascinating time to learn about the world, and not just about the, the continental North America.  And so that was an important influence of Drake as well.  And as I was finishing my fourth year, I talked to him about what I should do.  And he was actually quite influential because I was thinking about going on to become a scholar in international relations.  And he said, you know, you really are interested in politics and law.  You need to get out of the Ivory Tower of writing and research and follow your activist heart.  You need to become a lawyer.  And other people, I'd go--you know, I'd been involved in the [HM] Angela Davis trial.  He knew that.  He knew some other issues that were legal.  I was debating.  Is it law?  Is it politics?  Is it law?  Is it politics or international relations?  And it was interesting that in the '70s [1970s], he would urge me to go into law as opposed to going into research and social sciences and humanities to try to influence a broader audience and how they think.  But I, it was interesting that, instead of saying, you should be like me.  He was saying, you should be what your heart is telling you, you should be.  And, I, I thank him for that because if he'd told me, get your Ph.D. in anthropology or in political science and sociology, I would have done it in a heartbeat.  And so, he, he was, in a sense, saying, I give you the permission to be what you want to be and do something that I think would be more useful to you and perhaps more valuable to our community if you do it well.  And so he was an incredible influence in that sense as well, pushing me in a direction that I wanted to go as opposed to pulling me in a direction that I thought he would insist that I would go.  And so I owed every ounce of sort of my intellectual curiosity to, on the one hand, my grandmother [Essie Reed], for--as an uneducated African American woman who always made sure that people thought in a disciplined way and to this Pan-Africanist, St. Clair Drake, who made sure that your arguments were subject of serious criticism and, and  critique.  And I think that's what made the difference in terms of moving from Stanford and being involved as an activist in a, in a broad level, to going to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and being more focused and committed in, in these legal issues that have consumed my life for the last, almost thirty years.
Story_ID: 174872
Speaker 1: You know, I want to ask you two other questions as it relates to the Stanford [University, Stanford, California] experience, and one is, on your honors thesis, you know with the--how did you come to the theory about sanctions at that point?  What was your basis for that?
Speaker 2: I became interested in sanctions as an issue in Zimbabwe and in South Africa almost by default.  Professor David Abernethy, who was my thesis advisor, taught a course on South Africa--Southern Africa and the politics of Southern Africa.  And we had fierce debates in class about what was the right way to change.  And I was incredibly impatient.  My view was, as, as I said to others, this is absurd when 87 percent of the population is black and 13 percent is white, when 87 percent of the resources are controlled by whites and only 13 by blacks.  That's just immoral.  And the United States needs to send [U.S.] Military troops over there.  We need to take power back.  We need to do something with force, the Africans need to rebel.  I, I just was not at all patient with the idea that if you don't let them trade, it will make a difference.  I was also interested in sanctions because I learned something else, and I wrote a lot about this in my paper.  The sanctions were being ignored by many nations.  Portuguese, Portugal had been a colonial power in South Africa for a long time.  They weren't following the sanctions.  Japan was not following the sanctions in any meaningful way.  Israel, an American partner, was not following the sanctions.  So I was getting frustrated.  Here are all these nations who were talking about equality and justice and opportunity, and yet they were supporting the apartheid power.  On the other hand, I was outraged that so many American corporations, Coca-Cola--I mean, and this was another part at Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  I was concerned because Stanford was investing in a number of, of American multinational corporations that were in South Africa.  On the one hand, we were demanding that the end of apartheid happen in South Africa.  On the other hand, we were also, in many protests at Stanford about sanctions.  We wanted the university to take their money out of South Africa so that it would, it would stumble economically and be forced to change.  And those fights were brutal.  A lot of, a lot of institutions took money out.  They divested because of the protests in the early '70s [1970s].  Others refused to and continued with the practices that, that they'd been involved in for a long time.  And so we were demanding some change.  And the more I read the, the economic sanctions statutes, the language was powerful, but the reality to me was that it was not gonna happen.  It was too protracted.  It was too prolonged.  It was too diplomatic, too deferential and too respectful of peaceful, gradual change.  And I, I, I thought that was not the right thing to do.  And so I took the strongest sanctions that had been proposed in the United Nations and said that if the United States would employ the United Nations view, that is, really strict sanctions, that would cut off all sorts of resources, vital to South Africa's survival, that would make a difference.  The United States was no where near that in the 1970s.  Richard Nixon who was in the White House then, was not that committed to it, and even after I graduated from Stanford and [James Earl] Jimmy Carter was in office, there was not an appetite in my view, even in a Democratic administration, the first we'd had since Lyndon [Baines] Johnson, to really apply sanctions and to address the issue.  Africa was not a priority nationally.  South Africa was not a priority nationally.  The third world was not a priority nationally in the '70s [1970s], and so at least I thought with the United Nations, there was a way to raise these issues of sanctions, even if it meant a much more gradual process.
Story_ID: 174873
Speaker 1: And even though I wrote that, that sanctions would bring an end to apartheid in the 20th century, I wrote that intellectually.  Emotionally, I just thought it was not vigorous enough, not stringent enough and not demanding enough to really make a difference in South Africa in a short period of time.  So I wrote the thesis that I thought was intellectually honest, but for me personally, I, I thought it was not the right way to go.  I'm glad it happened the way it did because what I saw shortly after I graduated from Stanford [University, Stanford, California], things like the Sharpsville Massacre and a number of brutal, brutal and destructive actions by the South African government because of these, the Casspir tanks, where they would just go into the black community, bulldoze them out, that the weapons that the blacks didn't have, and, and the innocent destruction of life of women and children that even though the population had substantial numbers, they had absolutely no power.  There was no way to do that.  And the great leaders.  Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo, all those folks were in exile or in jail.  And the movement was really external and underground, and it was not a true, patriotic movement in the sense that there were no attacks on the South African government with any regularity.  You know, you didn't see any explosions, you didn't see any takeovers.  It was very much an underground movement that, that, that was strong in rhetoric, but very weak in, in the power to bring down the regime.  So I was very dismayed that so little was happening and whenever there was an effort to make a change, the result was that blacks would lose their lives.  So that, that ultimately was not the right strategy, to try to fight fire with fire, when one side had the tanks and the other side had the sling shots.  It just wouldn't work.
Story_ID: 174874
Speaker 1: Now, Charles, the other--the second question, what prevented you from going off track?  Was it St. Clair Drake?  I mean this is a time of a lot of turbulence, and you were--a lot of people got active and went off or they were even damaged by the movement.  And I, and yet you excelled, you know?  And you came into an environment that you had never even been in at the beginning (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  Well, Drake was so important, and he did things, I think, intentionally, that I never realized.  I mean I didn't ask to be his researcher.  He brought me in and made me do that.  And I think he probably saw that I was on the, the tip of this iceberg that said, you know, education is irrelevant; going to class is irrelevant.  If I really want to make a difference, my people need to be out there doing something right now.  And his idea of bringing me in and taking me under his arms, was important.  There were two things.  I mean he sent me two places.  One was Africa, when the Sixth Pan-African Congress [Dar es Salaam, Tanzania].  At the same time, he sent me to another conference later on, a progressive, youth leaders conference in Cuba when I was at Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  And I was one of two African Americans in a delegation of almost two dozen progressive leaders, college leaders around the country.  And I think he was trying to say, I'm gonna give you the opportunity to be involved in the world, but I also I want you to always remember, you've got to do the work.  You've got to be disciplined in order to make a difference.  And his point was, you can hold demonstrations, which I did.  I marched with Caesar Chavez.  I marched with the Black Panthers.  I'd gone to the African Liberation Day Movements.  I'd gone to Temple 26B in Oakland [California] at the Nation of Islam.  I was active outside the classroom, and I was very involved at that time, and what almost caused me to drop out, it was not those events, but a very dear friend of mine, Eugene Allen [ph.], and Eugene Allen was the, for me, the essence.  He was a young man I grew up with [in Merced, California]. He didn't smoke, he didn't drink, he didn't curse, you know, he was the model of all the young men that I grew up with.  And then he ended up in this incident between him and white woman he was dating, where a coach gave him a hard time, and then Eugene threw a bottle with gas in it, then was charged with arson for burning the coaches, outside of his house; went to a juvenile camp.  There was a murder.  Gene didn't do it, but he didn't say who was, and he was convicted.  He went to San Quentin [State Prison, San Quentin, California].  There was another murder.  He was convicted of that murder.  And I was there, meeting with him, going to prison in Northern California, and I felt that if I can't save Gene, then my life is largely irrelevant.  And so I was three quarters out the door at Stanford, trying to figure out how can I help Gene.  And it was St. Clair Drake who said, "You can't help anybody if you don't have the skills and the preparation."  But I, I was very much torn, very torn because I figured that, you know, Gene shouldn't be there, I mean of all of the young men who grew up in our community.  He was an African American who did not deserve to be in prison and certainly not on death row, and that's where he was, as a young boy.  And so Drake gave me the discipline and said, "You really can't help him unless you have some tools."  And I think that was a big point.  I said, well, let me go to law school, and maybe I can do something.  And, and I was involved in Eugene's case as a student at Stanford in the '70s [1970s].  I'm involved in it now in the 21st century.  I've gone to his hearings in California.  I've tried to get him paroled.  I'm working on some other projects, and so ultimately, Drake's influence was to say, you're not finished yet.  You have some interesting ideas.  You have a lot to give, but you're not ready to be a useful servant of, of your people without having some skills and talents and abilities that can make a difference.  And so it, it was that--
Story_ID: 174875
Speaker 1: And I also was mindful of the fact that, even though I had good reasons, I thought, very good reasons to say I'm gonna get involved in the struggle and not stay here at this institution [Stanford University, Stanford, California], I'd had a hard time explaining that to my grandmother [Essie Reed] because she was so proud to see one of her children finish high school 'cause she didn't.  And neither did my grandfather [Willie Reed] and neither did my father [Charles Ogletree, Sr.]; neither did my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] or my older brother [Curtis Reed].  And so for them, it was, wow, mission accomplished from high school, but he's in a college, in a university and none of us have done anything like that.  And she was already bragging about it, and so was my mother and so the bragging rights were, oh, we got a boy whose in college, in one of those big universities.  They didn't know where it was.  They would never, ever see the campus.  They had no idea what I was doing, but they knew it was something unusual in our community; not just finishing high school and going to the community college up the street, but going to another city and getting a degree and diploma.  Those things were things that were like, whoa, that's really important.  And so I, I had to deal with, how could I explain it to them because they had sacrificed so much and taken so much abuse in their own lives that I don't think my explanation would have been acceptable, that I, I'm, I'm fighting for you to change the--well, no, no, no.  If you want to make a difference, do what Malcolm X said, education is the one thing that can't be taken away from you.  That's what you need to do.  And so I realized that I had a huge battle in order to overcome their, their arguments.  And so I decided I was gonna hang in there, and they were right.  I was young, I was immature.  I was ambitious to save the world, and I didn't think that I could do it at that, those, those institutions.  What I didn't realize was those institutions were giving me a foundation, and that my professors were giving me the groundwork, and that my experiences outside were creating the impetus to make a difference, that wouldn't happen at Stanford, wouldn't happen at Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but it would certainly happen in the real world once I got out there.
Story_ID: 174876
Speaker 1: Now, your sister [Barbara Ogletree], did she also--she was murdered, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Around that same time?
Speaker 2: Right--later.
Speaker 1: Later, later.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: When you were in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes--after law school--
Speaker 1: After law school.
Speaker 2: --when I was in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you get married to Pamela [Barnes]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --right before law school, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay as part of your--okay.  And you, you with Pamela had shared this activist life (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, okay, what--was there any--where did you apply to law school?  What was, I mean, what was your decision 'cause really you're still a West Coast--I mean you're a West Coast, okay an international boy but you're (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Definitely West Coast, absolutely.  Going through the law school process was challenging, but actually, for me, it was a lot easier than I'd imagined.  I wasn't sure where I wanted to go.  It was helpful that a number of my mentors at Stanford [University, Stanford, California], Doug McHenry, Hillary Shockley, Cynthia Kennedy, Tom--I can't think of Tom's last name, now, Channing Johnson, there're at least a half a dozen people who were all at Stanford, had all gone to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And so I would see them.  They may come back for a Stanford football game, during, once during their, their multiple years at, at Harvard Law School.  But they'd been Stanford undergraduates.  They're going to Harvard Law School.  And so they were encouraging people to think about Harvard.  At the same time, a good friend of mine who was also an undergraduate, Tyrone Powell [ph.], who'd gone to school at Manual Arts [Senior High School, Los Angeles, California], a Southern California high school, was applying to medical school.  He was pre-med.  Dr. Woodrow Mars [ph.], also at Stanford, and his wife, Debra Mars [ph.]--they had just been married, they were applying to medical school.  And they were talking about Harvard.  But I was looking at Harvard, Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Stanford, Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], I think USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], I can't remember--I, I applied to a couple of, maybe Berkley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and USC were the other California schools that I was looking at.  And what happened is that, to my surprise, Harvard was the most aggressive in trying to recruit, using the graduates, sending information, and there were others, other students at Stanford who were interested in Harvard, including a particular student, David Moyer [ph.].  David's one of my best friends.  He was white.  He grew up in Oakland [California].  He went to the same high school [McClymonds High School, Oakland, California] that my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] had gone to before she dropped out.  So--and he always considered himself multicultural.  I mean he, he lived in the black dorm.  He was the director of a couple of our black plays, just a very progressive guy.  And he was interested in Harvard, and so, and he sort of kept nudging me on, that, you know, do this, do this.  He knew he wanted to go to Harvard, but he also wanted me--to make sure that I would do it.  So I applied, and Pam had decided she was gonna take a year off before she did anything.  We were gonna be getting married after, after graduation.  And I applied, and a very strange thing happened.
Story_ID: 174877
Speaker 1: I got the letter back, and it seemed that--well, I know it came earlier than a lot of other people.  It said, you're accepted.  And I was debating what to do.  I didn't want to tell anybody.  I didn't know how to deal with it, and I almost felt embarrassed by it, saying, gosh, I've been at Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  And here I am at the--Harvard's [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] now admitted me.  How is that gonna look?  I'm, I'm interested in all these issues, and I'm going to Harvard?  I can't do that.  I can't--that, that, no.  And I finally, after a day or two, showed the letter to Pam, she said, "That's great."  She says, "You gonna go?"  And I said, "Nah, I don't think so.  I'm not gonna go to Harvard, you know, I'm, you know, the challenge was to see if I can get in, but I'm not gonna go."  And she let it sit for a day, and then came back and said, "Oh, you said, you're not gonna go to Harvard.  Why?"  I said, "You know that I'm interested in all these things and, you know, Harvard ruins people."  She said, "What?"  I said, "Well, you remember that, you've heard that saying that Harvard's ruining more Negroes than bad whiskey."  I said, "I don't want to go through that.  You know, Harvard's just, you know, it's all the way on the East Coast.  I'm a, I'm a California boy, you know."  And her comments were shrewd and, and brilliant, and she knew provocative.  She said, "Oh, you, you think it's too hard.  You don't think you can do the work?"  I said, "What, what?"  She said, "You know, Harvard, that's a top school, that--said, it's gonna be real tough.  You, you--maybe you can't handle Harvard."  I said, "Ah, nah, nah, it has nothing to do with handling Harvard.  I can handle Harvard."  She said, "Well, why aren't you going?"  I said, "It's on the East Coast."  She said, "And you can't leave California, you can't face new challenges?"  I said, "Yeah, I've been around the world."  Said, "Well, what's wrong with Harvard?"  And I said, "I don't know, but, you know, all kinds of people are, are thinking about that, but I think I can do more."  Said, "Well, it sounds like you just don't want to face the challenge."  And, boy, my blood started curdling then.  And she's telling me that I'm a coward, that I'm afraid.  And so it was, it was absolutely out of reaction to Pam's, what I call, sort of pushiness and, and badgering.  I said, okay, I'm gonna prove to you I can do this.  And so she was delighted.  And, and she, and what she forced me to think through the reasons to accept the challenge, rather than to come up with sort of indefensible reasons to not take the challenge.  And Harvard was different.  It was clearly--it was the funniest experience I've ever had, the way we arrived there.  We were married in August, and--August 9, 1975.  And we were gonna drive out.  And it was a very interesting experience because we, we went from California.  We stopped in Las Vegas [Nevada], New Mexico, Oklahoma, had a whole series of experiences driving across the South, southern route for the first time.  And we had a friend, which really helped, a great friend from Stanford, Larry Terry [ph.] was already at Harvard.  He was at the Harvard Dental School [Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts].  He found an apartment for us.  We'd never seen this apartment, so we were sight unseen.  But Larry said, I got a place for you in Cambridge [Massachusetts].  It's reasonable.  Of course, we're moving, we had no furniture, right.  We had a few goods that we collected from the wedding, and we were gonna drive.
Story_ID: 174878
Speaker 1: Well, we're [Ogletree and his wife, Pamela Ogletree] driving into Boston [Massachusetts], and we've never been there before.  I never visited Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I had no idea--I didn't even know where the campus was located.  And this is August.  And we're driving through, and we see all these barricades and detours as we're driving.  And we're going over these bridges and all this.  And we call the landlord where we're staying and tell him that we're in Boston, and we're on our way.  And so Marty [ph.] says, "Where are you?"  We said, "Well, we're here at this, certain street, so and so."  He says, "Oh, you need to come over that bridge.  You need, you need to get out of there.  Let me tell you where to go."  And he gave me some quick directions.  What we didn't know is that we'd just driven through South Boston.  We didn't know that Boston had had riots and demonstrations because of busing.  We didn't know that whites were angry and violent against black children and their families who were coming to the school system [Boston Public School System, BPS].  We were completely oblivious to this.  And we had enough gas that we didn't have to stop in a place and get some directions.  And we, we had no idea that we were in harms way until we got there, and they told us where we'd been.  And so that was a rude awakening that with all the things at Stanford [University, Stanford, California], here we were at Harvard, that was our introduction, that, as much as you're coming to Harvard--you can't come to Harvard without appreciating that you're in Boston.  This is the place where, people call it the cradle of civilization in the United States.  This is the place where Crispus Attucks gave his life in the war against British control [Revolutionary War].  This is the place that was supposed to be progressive in terms of issues of ending slavery and speaking out against it in the abolitionist movement.  But this is a place in the 1970s, 1975, where black kids were being told they couldn't come to schools with whites because whites didn't want integration.  And this is more than twenty years after Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  This is not 1950 or 1960.  This is 1975.  It made no sense whatsoever.  And so, that was part one, the community, I mean that aspect of Harvard.
Story_ID: 174879
Speaker 1: And we were also in a wonderful community.  Pam [Ogletree] loved the apartment.  It was a little first floor apartment with two bedrooms, a tiny kitchen and a bathroom.  And there, there was four units, one opposite from ours, and then the landlord lived upstairs.  There was another unit upstairs.  We were in an incredible neighborhood.  We're the only black family there, it's just the two of us, but this was East Cambridge [Massachusetts], Portuguese, Italian, Irish.  And so we had these experiences as well.  It was really remarkable that, not only were we unique, but we were having cultural experiences.  We would see on weekends--I can't remember if it was Saturday or Sunday, but I know we'd see people walking down the streets carrying these statutes of the Virgin Mary, and you were supposed to walk out and put money on it.  Now, we didn't know what we were doing, but we said, hey, we had to respond and not be the only people who would do that.  My neighbor next door to our right was from Italy, spoke very little English, clearly from the old country.  And he was a funny man because he really tried to articulate, but he couldn't because his Italian accent was so sharp.  But he would have us over, and I'm a first-year law student [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And he would insist that we drink this wine.  This is wine he was making in his basement.  He'd take the grapes and make wine.  And it was awful, but for him, you know, he wouldn't show that he remembers the old country, and he knows how to mash the grapes and all that.  And then--but that was part of being part of the community.  We'd go up to the corner store owned by Portuguese, and they loved our son, who was born the next year, but we stayed in that house for all three years.  But in the second year, our son was a year and a half, and the only thing he learned to, to say was ice cream.  And so the store owner had made a bad habit of giving him the free ice cream.  And so every time he came, he'd ask for an ice cream.  But after that, we had to pay for it.  And so whether it's ten o'clock in the morning or ten o'clock at night, the owner is, "Oh, your son wants an ice cream, your son wants an ice cream."  We said, "My God, what, what is he doing to this kid, right?"  But it was a wonderful cultural neighborhood for us to have a working class experience.  Nobody there worked--nobody there was a professional class person in that neighborhood.  We were the students, but everybody else were families who would work at the city or the state or in some--but they were people who worked hard, who were living paycheck to paycheck, who were very ethnic and very, and very receptive to, to our being in that neighborhood.  So it was a wonderful experience on the one hand.  And we'd look--I actually looked forward to that.  That was one part of the existence, the, what I would call the town part of the Harvard existence--
Story_ID: 174880
Speaker 1: --And then I'd go to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and you'd see these families, the Forbes, the Kennedys, the Rothschilds, I mean you'd see all this wealth, and it was palpable.  The people would talk about their success and talk about their families and they had multi-generational beings at Harvard.  Ah, yes, my father works for so and so or we own so and so, and it was remarkable to me that this was the case.  And then they'd have these questions where you'd get a dialogue.  People were being friendly, and they would say, "Well, what, what does your family do?  What does your father do?"  And, and I would say, "Well, my father's [Charles Ogletree, Sr.] in the trucking industry.  He's in transportation."  I didn't tell them he was a truck driver.  That would have been too embarrassing.  "What does your mother do?"  "Oh, my mother's [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] in--she's in the housing business."  I didn't say she was a housewife.  I mean they, they were divorced by then, and I didn't want to say they're divorced.  My father's a truck driver, my mother's on public assistance.  She's at home.  Right and so we created these existences just to get, get on because I thought right then if I said something about class that would put me a notch or two below people, in their impression.  And I wasn't gonna let them characterize me in a way that was, was not right.  And I didn't like law school at all because I thought it was too infinite.  I thought that it was too indeterminate.  And I wanted the answer to the question, how do you solve this problem?  How do you answer this puzzle?  And the answer was always, it depends.  The answer was always on the one hand or the other hand.  And there was a rigorous refusal to be tied down to a position, and a discipline insistence on seeing the multiplicity of issues that you had to address.  And it drove me crazy.  I was a political scientist.  I was result oriented, and here we were, we were supposed to be theoretical and take a step back.  And said, "What would be your arguments, Mr. Ogletree, in representing the railroad when they failed to clean the platform, and eighty-year old Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Pauls, Paulsgraph [ph.], slips on a banana peel and breaks her leg.  What would the argument--what would the railroad argue?"  And I said, "Well, the railroad should be liable."  "Well, no, let's look at the facts.  Let's step back.  Did Mrs. Paulsgraph see the banana?  Could she have been more cautious?  Did she contribute with her negligence?  Is the railroad responsible if another passenger dropped it?  Don't they have to provide reasonable caution to passengers?"  And I see these arguments, and I'm going crazy.  Wait a minute, the railroad has all this money.  She has none.  She's broke her hip, and we're talking about the railroad doesn't have to pay?
Story_ID: 174881
Speaker 1: But what I learned is that it was a remarkable way of making me understand that law was an instrument that anyone could capture and use it to achieve their means.  And that was a remarkable awakening.  And I didn't realize that fully until the spring of my first year [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I was involved in PLAP, the Prison Legal Assistance Project, where we represented inmates in prison.  And it was a remarkable organization where students would go and represent clients in disciplinary hearings.  And these were people who were already convicted, so we didn't put them in jail.  They were already serving time, so we weren't responsible for that.  But they would get into trouble within the institution.  And when I went to represent one particular client, and he was charged with making what they call "home brew."  Home brew is illegal alcohol.  And what would they do?  These prisoners were brilliant.  They would take orange peels or any kind of substance, put sugar on them, and they would actually ferment over a few days.  And they put it under their bed, and this fermented gobbly gook would create a form of an intoxicant.  So they were making their own alcohol.  And my client was charged with having an illegal substance in prison.  And I was in the middle of a property class with Frank Michelman, I love him to death.  He was my property teacher.  And we were learning a subject that I just did not understand.  It was called the rule against perpetuities.  What does it mean?  I can't tell you what it means.  It means that there are rules against having something last forever.  That's a short and incomplete and inaccurate definition, but it was one of the most challenging--I'm not gonna say, boring, with all respect to Frank Michelman, one of the most challenging aspects of law I'd ever taken.  But I knew the point was that you can't do something without some time constraints as part of, part of the rule.  And so at the hearing, there're three people.  There is what we call the white shirt, who was an officer, who's usually educated.  There's a brown shirt, which means it's usually a guard.  And then there's a social worker.  Those were the three people.  You had to get two out of the three to vote with you.  The social worker would always wring her--usually her--her hands and try to be supportive and say great things, even though they would always rule for you.  Now, why was that important?  It was important because if the client was convicted, that means he would go into sixty days of isolation.  He couldn't go out for recreation.  He couldn't have visits.  He would be punished in addition to his sentence with being deprived of privileges.  And that was important for somebody serving time.  So I needed to get two out of the three votes.  I knew the guards would never vote because a guard was bringing the charges, and they would always vote against us (unclear).  The white shirt usually voted against us, but in this particular case, the white shirt also was a student at Northeastern [University, Boston, Massachusetts] taking a criminal justice class to get a master's in criminal justice.  So he needed to know a little bit about law, a little bit about something.  And so I said--I asked for the evidence.  And they said, "Well, it's destroyed, right.  This happened ten days ago.  And we don't have it."  And I said, "Well, you can't prosecute my client for making illegal brew if I can't examine it to make sure it's illegal, and I can't make my case."  They said, "We never had the brew.  That's not (unclear)."  I said, "Well, I object because this violates, this violates the rule against perpetuities."  And I, and the moment I said it, I said, oh, my God, this has nothing to do with property or--I knew it was absolutely crazy.  And I just said that, and I just paused.  And the white shirt, Harvard law student, he must of known what he's talking about.  He remembered something about rules of perpetuities, he says, "Counselor, I, I disagree with your approach, but this does violate the rules against perpetuities.  I think we do have a jurisdictional problem.  Let's recess."  Came back, they dismissed the case, right?  And my supervisor, Morton Gideons [ph.], the faculty supervisor said, "So what the hell were you talking about?"  I said, "I don't know.  I don't."  He said, "The rule of perpetuities is about properties, it has nothing to do with the criminal sanction or suit."  I said, "I, I--it just popped in my head.  We were talking about this in class."  He said, "Look, that's brilliant.  It's brilliant, but it's wrong, it's wrong."  And so they dismissed the case.  And I tell that to students all the time, said, "Look, I'm not saying--I said, you got to be creative and think about how law works.  And there are two lessons out of this is that, law has many opportunities, many avenues, and you have to be able to learn how to master it.  And the second point, don't use this rule against perpetuities line again because they know it, right."  But it was a wonderful way to--for the first time for me to see, you know what, this isn't so bad.  This isn't that difficult.  And, in fact, you can be empowered by it--
Story_ID: 174882
Speaker 1: I got involved in student government [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I got involved in student organizations.  I, I became an editor for the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review and started to see law in a broader context.  The first summer I worked at Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro in Washington, in, in San Francisco [California].  It's huge law firm, but I, I said, I'm coming back to California.  Let me work, and I took the job because some people at Stanford [University, Stanford, California] knew that I'd gone to Harvard.  There were some Stanford people at Pillsbury.  There were some Harvard people at Pillsbury, and they had a wonderful class.  It was unusual because Pillsbury and most big firms only hired second-year law students.  But I was among three or four first-year students who, who were hired.  And it was a phenomenal experience for me.  I, I hated doing the, the regular, sort of boring transactional work, but I also was able to work on the criminal case--the pro bono case.  And so for me, that was fascinating.  And I really liked the experience and learned a lot from it.  And I was at home.  For my wife [Pamela Ogletree] and son, it was a miserable year because he was born, we were in San Francisco at an apartment in Daly City [California].  And what I never knew about San Francisco, even though I grew up in California, San Francisco's the worse place to live in the summer because every single day it's foggy and cloudy and cold.  Now, you'd think--San Francisco in June, terrible, September beautiful, October, beautiful.  But for some reason with the weather, the, these clouds are always hanging over.  And my family's in Daly City.  And, and my wife was becoming depressed because here's the summer, the first summer back at home with a small child, and she couldn't go out in the stroller because it was cloudy, damp and ugly.  And so she actually spent weekends down, occasional weekends down in Southern California where her parents were in Corona, California, just to get some sunshine.  But that was the first summer.  It was a very rewarding summer.  The second year I got involved in a lot of interesting things and started taking some other interesting faculty--
Story_ID: 174883
Speaker 1: I want to take you back though to the first year [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], [HM] Charles [Ogletree].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean who were your professors?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and before I--do you think you came to law school with an agenda?
Speaker 2: When I started at, at Harvard Law School, I was in a hurry to pick up what I had started in college [at Stanford University, Stanford, California].  I wanted to be a lawyer to do one of two things.  I was either gonna sort of transform the criminal justice system.  That was based on my [HM] Angela Davis experience and seeing a client who was innocent and having competent lawyers made a difference.  Or I was gonna be involved in international law to try to democratize developing nations to make sure that the third world had its due at the United Nations [UN] and in other forums where it would happen.  So international or criminal justice were the two things I was gonna do.  And I had an interesting group of first-year professors, who helped shape some of that.  The most interesting of all was an international icon.  It was Professor Milton Katz.  He was my torts professor, rigorous, disciplined, focused, only do it his way.  And I actually, when, when--he was our oldest professor.  He was probably high fifties by then, and the remarkable thing is that we became the best of friends.  He taught torts, but every once in a while, he would slip into a conversation about something else because he was also an international lawyer.  He worked on the Marshall Plan.  He knew Marshall Stimley [ph.], Henry Stimley's mother, legal giants around Harvard who he had trained with.  And so he would talk about something, and then start talking about international--and I would always sort of get into in more depth.  And he was, to me, it was fascinating.  He'd catch himself after a few minutes because he was the [Charles] Kingsfield [character, 'The Paper Chase' by John Jay Osborn, Jr.] of Harvard Law School in that sense, that is, that he was very disciplined and very focused so even though we'd start talking something other than torts, he would find himself coming back to torts, even though what he, when he didn't talk about torts, it was fascinating.  For criminal law, I had a brilliant young professor in his second year, Richard Parker, an idealist.  He'd worked for the Children's Defense Fund with [HM] Marian Wright Edelman.  He'd worked with Jerry Fruge [ph.] and with, with Clark--Cliff Alexander [Clifford Alexander] in a government position for a year.  But he, he was a Harvard Law School gradate, clerked for the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  But he came back to teach, young, very idealistic.  And he had us enraptured because he was so committed at that time.  For contracts, we had our only woman professor.  And her name was Sally Neely.  She was terrific.  But many of my classmates didn't think so.  It was her first year.  She went to Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  She was teaching contracts, and the students gave her grief.  They criticized everything she did because she didn't teach the way Parker taught or the way Katz taught or the way somebody else taught.  And so they gave her a lot of grief.  And as a result of that, she, she got very low student evaluations.  And the next year, she resigned.  That--it's not publicized much, but the class of, my class of '78 [1978], ran away one of the few women who had been brought to Harvard in the 1970s.  And she didn't make it more than two years.  She's a very successful lawyer in California now, and I've run into her at judicial conferences over--she's very happy.  But she did not like what happened to her.  Her graduate, her upper-level contracts and remedies courses were brilliant and high, high references, but our, our class gave her grief and, and very low ratings.
Story_ID: 174884
Speaker 1: The civil procedure class was a, an anomaly.  We had a visitor.  The guy was Jan Vedder.  He was a [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California] professor.  He was visiting at Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and it was the most amazing thing.  He spoke in a monotone.  He never stood up.  He never wrote a single word on the chalk board.  He sat at a table, on the platform in a chair, opened a book, "Mr. Harrison, let's discuss Smith versus Alright [ph.].  What does that case present?"  Not grueling, dry humor, rye humor, and some people loved it.  It drove me crazy because I couldn't imagine a professor sitting, not writing, and I'm thinking, what are we supposed to get from this?  Right, and some people loved it.  For me, it was like, this doesn't seem like a class.  The element of--he was over six--very, he was 6'2", very tall man, very resonant voice.  It seemed like a wonderful--I mean an amazing waste of talent to be sitting there.  And it wasn't even [Charles] Kingsfield [character, 'The Paper Chase' by John Jay Osborn, Jr.] where he was drilling us.  I mean, he had all this sort of dry humor to make it interesting.  But I just couldn't quite figure out what, what was going on with him.  Frank Michelman was our property teacher.  Frank was brilliant, smart.  It was a tough topic to teach.  It was a spring course.  And also I took con [constitutional] law, which was unusual in the first year.  But back then, Harvard gave you an elective.  And you could take one course, and Richard Parker was teaching con law.  And he allowed the first-year students in it, so I took my constitution law class the spring of my first year, instead of waiting till the second year.  And I had Parker a second time, which was also quite amazing.  And the best part about it, at least for me, was that--I actually went to Parker because I said, you know what, I'm frustrated because I'm learning, but I don't feel like I'm doing anything.  And I said, "I don't know if should finish law school."  And he said, "Be patient," because I, I was ready to drop out.  I just said, I, I'm just not getting it.  I'm not going anywhere.  We're not doing anything relevant.  And he and Professor [Milton] Katz were the two people who I sort of admired as mentors.  And they made an incredible difference because they did encourage me, at that time, stick with it 'cause I was, I was sort of this, still this political animal, thinking that things aren't fast enough.  I'm sitting here talking about jurisdiction and kids are being thrown off buses in South Boston [Massachusetts].  It just didn't--it made no sense in the world to me.  I'm sitting here talking about issues of adverse possession and property and people are, are being submit--subjected to police harassment.  And it, it just felt like I was in the wrong place.  And I was sitting there as a student when the world was moving on.
Story_ID: 174885
Speaker 1: It helped that I did finally get a call 'cause as the BSU, the Black Student Union president, from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Boston [Massachusetts] my first year.  They wanted black law students to come over to their office on Columbus Avenue and to write down complaints of black families who had been victimized by police or white South Boston [Massachusetts] citizens or others who had been harassed, to file complaints with the police department and other places.  And so we finally found a way to spend a couple of hours a week doing something very relevant because--and that, that, that was reassuring, that I could be in a position to give something back.  And as the years went on, we did more of those things, but the first year, it made an incredible difference.  Of course, the disappointment was that this is the first time I got Bs because I was an A student and my sense was, wait a minute, there's something wrong with this picture.  But it also was helpful because what was not the case was that I sort of realized that--it was frustrating because I went and talked to a professor about it.  He said, look, you know, worry not about your grades; worry about whether you're learning.  And that has been something that's very important for me and to talk to other students, to give them the sense of how important that was.  And it was also important to see that I would go somewhere else outside the classroom and perform in a way that, that made an incredible difference.
Story_ID: 174886
Speaker 1: And, and then as I started delving into the things that interested me, it made an incredible difference.  And I started seeing that in the second year [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I, I was still torn so I started taking these international classes.  Professor Lewis Sohn was a professor teaching United Nations [UN] law.  I was taking his class.  At the same time, I was not registered in it, but I was sitting and taking also Clyde Ferguson's [Clarence Clyde Ferguson, Jr.] class on issues about human rights.  And so, then I said, wow, this is amazing.  Now, I'm doing things that are really relevant to me.  I was finally taking Gary Bellow's class.  Gary Bellow would learn--turn out to be my most important influence in terms of my career because he had been a public defender in Washington, D.C. at the same place where I'd have my first job.  So here was this icon, Gary Bellow, I can't believe this guy who won all these trials, who represented Cesar Chavez, who's represented  Black Panthers, who's a California lawyer, who Ronald Reagan calls an enemy of the state because of his success in changing--transforming the legal services in California.  He was actually my teacher.  And it was phenomenal.  And it was at that point that I began to realize that, wow, I'm in--I'm around all these people.  And what really capped it off, there was this very quiet and, and respectful, but absolutely powerful professor at Harvard that I met that made everything different, and that was Derrick Bell [HM Derrick A. Bell, Jr.].  The light bulbs came on, light bulbs came on when I met Derrick because he was doing, not the work that I wanted to do, but focused on the issues about race and racism in American law.  And, boy, how important it was to see a black man say, these things are important.  You can't become a lawyer and try to understand the [U.S.] Constitution if you don't understand race.  So he validated all the things I'd been thinking about.  And for me, that was the defining moment that, if you're gonna be a lawyer, you have to not be paranoid but aware of how all these other issues that are important to you are also important in the context of law.  We didn't talk about race in torts.  We didn't talk about race in criminal law.  We didn't talk about race in property.  We didn't talk about race in contracts.  We didn't talk about race in crim--civil procedure.  But they were relevant to every single one of those topics I'd taken the first year.  And Derrick Bell just opened up my mind to the possibilities of race and the necessity of seeing how the legal system works in the context of race.  And at the same time that he was talking about that, we were also exposed in a, in a subtle, but important way to what I learned was critical legal studies.  Here were these scholars, Richard Parker, Duncan Kennedy, Morton Horwitz, Jerry Fruge [ph.], who were talking about the fact that the legal system is not based on fairness and justice, but on power.  And those who have power will influence outcome.  So decisions aren't made on the basis of what is the morally right thing to do.  They're made on who has the power to influence decisions.  They were considered a left-wing, extreme ideological aspect of law and yet, they were bringing it in a perspective that made me understand the legal system in a way that I had not appreciated it at all before.  So that was very important.  And at the same time, this all became even more dramatic, particularly in my second year, because I was taking these courses and meeting these people, but something else happened.  I ran and was elected the National President of the Black Law Students Association [BLSA].
Story_ID: 179521
Speaker 1: When I was elected the national president of the Black Law Students Association [BLSA], there was this case [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978] out of California that was emerging that would sort of transform my life in, in ways that I could never imagine.  This medical student named Allan Bakke, he'd applied to the University of California, Davis medical school [University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, California].  And he was rejected.  He was rejected more than once.  And although history doesn't do justice to the fact, to the real case, the fact of the matter is that the record shows that, even though he had decent scores, there was a personal interview.  And people interviewed him and, and said no.  It wasn't that he was rejected on his numbers.  He was rejected on the entire package.  But one of the people in the UC Davis office sort of encouraged him to complain, which is a little-known fact.  And so he decided to bring a lawsuit.  And so his suit was to challenge a plan that UC-Davis created to give African American, Native American, Hispanic  and Asian applicants to medical school some preference in the affirmative action plan to increase the number of minority doctors and to address the California's [University of California System]  admission of its own history of past discrimination, that is, that we have denied people simply because of their race access, and now, we're trying to correct that historical practice by giving opportunities to qualified students.  And so Bakke had this case, and he took it up to the California State court system and we heard about it.  And the issue was, here was Allan Bakke complaining about affirmative action, and that he was gonna challenge the entire system.  Even though it was a medical school, it was clear to us that if the court, [U.S.] Supreme Court, granted cert [certiorari granted sub nomine, judicial review granted, under name] in this case, that the whole issue of affirmative action would be up for reconsideration.  And it could have a dramatic impact.  So I'd gone from what I call being the brown baby at Stanford [University, Stanford, California], you know, having people like [William] Shockley say that you folks don't have intelligence, that there're, there're issues about race and intellectual development, to having [Daniel Patrick] Moynihan talk about whether or not single-parent families in the black community can sustain themselves in, in the 20th century.  And now to go to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and have busing on the front end, and then before I leave, a whole challenge to professional schools admissions from minority students in the back end.  It was another sense in which race mattered.
Story_ID: 179522
Speaker 1: And so this, for me, was a mission as a law student [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] that we were gonna do every single thing we could to fight Allan Bakke's effort to destroy and dismantle affirmative action programs.  Our slogan was, "We Won't Go Back.  Send Bakke Back."  That, that is, that we, we're not gonna go backwards.  Send him back to a lower court.  The [U.S.] Supreme Court granted cert [certiorari granted sub nomine, judicial review granted, under name] in the Bakke case [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978].  And we [National Black Law Students Association, BLSA] got busy.  We organized national demonstrations, not just with students but with labor groups, women's groups, a whole series of progressive groups around the country, planned demonstrations everywhere.  Then the University of California [System] hired Archibald Cox, Harvard Law School, brilliant constitutional law professor person who was fired by [Richard] Nixon during the Watergate debacle and someone who was also a great labor lawyer.  He was the most brilliant man without question at Harvard Law School at that time, on the active faculty and the right choice for the case.  And so he was gonna represent California.  He was drafting his brief.  And I thought that I should go see Professor Cox.  I'd taken no classes from him.  I didn't know him.  I had sat in his con [constitutional] law class a few times in the back when I was taking con law from Professor Richard Parker.  But I thought it was my responsibility to go talk to him because the Bakke case meant everything to me, and I was speaking on behalf of the National Black Law Students Association.  His office was in the stacks at, at Harvard at Langdell Hall.  And you had to sort of know where to go because these were hidden offices basically 'cause they didn't want to be bothered.  And, and he, there was--these were not very attractive offices, but they were steeped with tradition, the legal giants would stay in those Langdell Hall offices, and that's where he was.  And so I went to see him, and I said, "Professor Cox, you don't know me, but I told you I wanted to make an appointment.  And I wanted to talk to you about the Bakke case."  He says, "Oh, yes, yes."  And he said, "Yes, I'm, I'm writing the brief and arguing for California and, you know, it's a challenge.  But I think we'll do okay."  I said, "I wanted to talk to you because I'm the national chairman of the National Black Law Students Association, and I have some ideas about the argument that I'd like for you to consider."  And he took out his yellow pad, and I know he was saying, is this Negro crazy?  Who is he to be asking me questions about the Bakke case?  And who does he think he is?  I don't know what he wrote, but my, my--I, I don't know why I did, but I said, I just want to talk about it.  We talked for at least half an hour.  And he was very forthcoming.  He was talking about some of the challenges, and, and what might work and what might not work.  And that the court was not a court that was necessarily going to embrace this idea, that there were some problems in the record.  And I had never been to the Supreme Court.  I didn't know what it was about.  And I, I didn't even know that he'd argued dozens of cases before the Supreme Court and was a brilliant and very successful litigator, that he had been a solicitor general, the nation's highest lawyer.  I mean he'd held every job you could imagine.  But here, Charles Ogletree, second-year law student, trying to tell him what to do.  And he listened.  And I have seen him since, and we joke about that.  And he, he--Clark Bice [ph.] who's the--retired now, but still at, at Harvard doing research--had me and my wife [Pamela Ogletree] and his new wife over for dinner.  And then the next night, he had over Archibald Cox, and he said, "Charles, I just wanted to call you.  I had dinner with Archibald Cox last night."  This was last year, 2002, "And I told him I had dinner with you."  And he said, "Oh, Charles Ogletree, he's a wonderful young man.  I'm so glad that we have him here at Harvard."  He said, "I just thought I should tell you that Archie Cox was giving you a compliment this year."  And it just reminded me of what a good relationship we, we have had and how touched I was that he would hear me and listen to me about this Bakke case.
Story_ID: 179523
Speaker 1: At the same time, emboldened by my conversation with Archibald Cox, I decided I would also go to Washington [D.C.].  We had a BLSA [Black Law Students Association] meeting there, and I tried to see Wade McCree.  Wade McCree, like Archibald Cox, was a Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate.  Wade McCree, African American, was a legal giant.  He had served on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals [United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit], a brilliant judge from Michigan.  And he was the solicitor general under [James Earl] Jimmy Carter, President Carter.  And so I said, this is no-brainer, Harvard man, black man, you know, someone progressive, Democratic administration.  So we had this conversation with Wade McCree about what the government was gonna do.  They also had at that same time in the office, they had the, head of the civil rights division was Drew Days.  So we had this conversation with Wade McCree, and I was astounded.  He said, we have not decided which side we're gonna support.  I was beside myself after that.  I was, how could this black man, Democrat, Harvard graduate, progressive judge, be uncertain about whether you're gonna side with the forces of good or the forces of evil.  There was no issue there.  And the reality was that Wade McCree was trying to be careful and trying to hear all the arguments.  And they wrote a brief that didn't satisfy my needs or expectations, but it was modest support for these principles of diversity.  The most successful thing that happened is that I did attend a meeting at University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], sponsored by Harvard, Pennsylvania, Columbia [University, New York, New York], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], all the Ivy League schools, and they were writing a brief to support the Harvard Plan, that is, that we have a highly selective plan for--and it focused on diversity.  It brings all these benefits.  And I remember Louis Pollak who was, who had been the dean at Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut], I believe, was the dean at Pennsylvania, invited me and others--I remember Professor [Ralph] Smith was at University of Pennsylvania Law School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Ralph Smith, he brought us there.  And we had all these wonderful people, and we had a Bakke strategy.  And so I felt emboldened that, that the institutions were behind it, the civil rights community was behind it, even if the government, the Carter White House and the Wade McCree, solicitor general's office was reluctant, we were still gonna be successful.  What did we do?  We had a series of demonstrations in Washington D--around the country but they ended up in Washington, D.C.  And we had marches and speeches all night before the argument.  And we were very vigorous in our protests.  And we stayed out there all night.  And, and I got in line, with other students who were part of the demonstration, and I actually was able to get in to hear the Bakke argument.  And it was a fascinating thing to watch, to be in the [U.S.] Supreme Court for the first time.  They wouldn't let me take my placards in.  I couldn't take any of my buttons.  I had to take all of the stuff that I was there with, and, "No, sir, you can't, can't do that."  I, I felt stripped 'cause I thought I was gonna make a statement.  They said, "No, you can't do that."  And it was amazing sitting there and realizing also that this court that we were listening to was all male and all white with the exception of Thurgood Marshall.  So that was sort of amazing, and they looked very old and very feeble and uninterested and not very active.
Story_ID: 179524
Speaker 1: And I thought the lawyers could have done a better job, the judges could have done a better job.  They were talking about all these little technical aspects.  I wanted them to say why aren't we gonna have black students?  And isn't it historic and isn't it important for past discrimination.  Thurgood Marshall asked some great questions, but the others were moving to other issues.  And it was very troubled--very troubling to me to see what was, what was going on there.  And I left very frustrated because I thought that they were talking about all the wrong issues and I didn't, I didn't get a sense of what the court was going to do.  And that's all the case.  They don't announce the judgment, and I was not very happy with it.  And so we waited and waited and waited and waited, and the decision finally came down in Bakke [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978].  And it was interesting.  We were celebrating because we said, we won, we won, five to four, we won, affirmative action is here to stay.  And it took a while for me to look back and realize, you know, hmm, after reading it, I said, we didn't win.  We lost because the court [U.S. Supreme Court] said that the UC-Davis Medical School [University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, California] plan was unconstitutional.  It was a quota system.  They said that Allan Bakke would be ordered to go to medical school.  Justice [Lewis] Powell who wrote the opinion, joined by four others, said something else, saying that, but you can have programs that promote diversity.  And so it was a very narrow thread that--and it talked a lot, and even attached to the opinion, about the Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] Plan, saying that race is one among many factors.  And so it, it carved out Harvard's plan as one that was acceptable, but it really said, past discrimination, as a legal justification for these programs, is not persuasive in this case.  And you have to come up with some other race neutral argument that will survive strict scrutiny, which means that if you're gonna use race, it has to be scrutinized at the highest level.  You can't use race either for or against someone without it surpassing high constitutional scrutiny.  So for me, that was sort of an amazing awakening that the law was incredibly powerful.  Here was the future of, of the race in this one little decision.  That's why we were so active and so vigorous in the Bakke case [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978] because we were there.  We were gonna get a degree.  We were gonna get jobs.  We were gonna be successful.  Our life was set, but there were generations coming behind us that would not have that opportunity if [Allan] Bakke shut the door.  And this to us, this was our abortion case.  This was our Roe versus Wade [Roe v. Wade, 1973].  You can't turn back the clocks of time.  It was also important for me because this was 1978.  We, the, the Civil Rights Act was in 1964, the Voting Rights Act was 1965.  And in 1965, people were beaten.  John Wilk--[HM] John Lewis was beaten crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama].  In 1968, [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated.  We hadn't even had a decade of progress, and they were talking about turning the clock back.  That, to me, was unimaginable in terms of what could be happening.  And so, it was clear to me that law was incredibly powerful and, and made all the difference in the world, and that lawyers made all the difference in the world--
Story_ID: 179525
Speaker 1: And so, for me, it was time to think about my career, think about what I was gonna do as a lawyer; time to say, okay, you've got to make a difference.  And I was torn again, which direction?  Is it gonna be criminal justice, is it gonna be international; is it gonna be civil rights?  I had all these possibilities.  But I spent my--much of the third year working on--the Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] writing almost a special issue about Bakke.  And we had justice--right, back then, Judge Constance Baker Motley was one of our lead scholars, writing about it, about the importance of Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] et cetera.  And then I began to see what I had never seen before.  Brown had symbolically opened the door to racial progress in 1954.  But my view then was that the moment Brown was announced, its significance was almost nonexistent because when the [U.S.] Supreme Court said that we insist on integration in public education in America as an imperative, it took away that bold statement by saying, we can only do it with all deliberate speed, which meant with no speed at all.  That is, we will have racial progress at the moment our political leaders and our white citizens are ready for racial progress.  And for me, I never understood Brown, when it was decided I was just a child.  It took me three years of law school and Bakke to realize that, you know what, we have never ever, ever made an unequivocal, concerted and principled commitment to racial justice in the law, despite pronouncements by our highest court.  And here we are nearly fifty years after Brown and as remarkable as it seems, and as important as Brown is and necessary, my sense then was, my God, we have not even had a chance to start to address two hundred and forty years of slavery in this country, and we're cutting back with the first efforts to promote civil rights and racial justice.  It was a rude awakening about America.  I got over, people like me got over.  We were going to the Harvards and the Yales [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and the Stanfords [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and the Princetons [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].  And we were becoming lawyers and doctors and people in business and educators, and yet, the overwhelming majority of our people were still suffering from malaise and depression from an America that was not responsive to all of its citizens.  And we were the symbols of success, but we were also the symbols of failure.  If only a few of us were getting through, if only a few of us were getting over the horizon, and we weren't letting the ladder back down or letting the rope over, bringing somebody else, that our modest successes were ultimately a sign of our community's failure.  And it was that sense that we had not done enough.  Being successful on our own was not nearly enough; achieving the highest levels of accomplishment was not nearly enough to transform America's sense about race.  So that to me has been sort of a life-long challenge, that I'm gonna become a lawyer, and I'm gonna try to use these tools to do something that's absolutely fundamental and essential to the progress of people of African descent.  I can do no less.  That's the challenge that, that a Harvard Law School degree imposed on me, and that's the challenge that I embraced when I stood there in June of 1978, and said, okay, now, you're a lawyer, it's time to do something.
Story_ID: 179526
Speaker 1: So you're saying that Bakke [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978] brought it all together for you.  Now, you had mentioned previously, and I don't know if you knew at the time, you said that there, that Allan Bakke had been encouraged to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: Do you know by whom?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When Bakke was denied his application the second time [to University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, California], one of the white officers in the admissions office told him that there was a program that had admitted some minority students with qualifications on the standardized test lower than his, and encouraged him that he might want to get a lawyer.  And Bakke took that advice and did it.  And it was clear that there was at least a sense among a lot of whites about this reverse discrimination, that no one wanted to take responsibility for the past, no one wanted to accept the fact that there was a history of discrimination.  No one wanted to accept that extremely qualified blacks were denied access, not because of income or region or religion or anything other than race.  And, and that whatever progress we'd had was very modest and very recent in trying to integrate the professions in our communities.  And so, it was a dramatic and breathtaking event when a white admissions officer says, I think you've got a lawsuit because I think we're vulnerable.  And it shows you that the incredibly painful path that people had to go through by these very willing and eager students trying to, not only go to Davis Medical School and Stamford Law School [Stanford, California] and Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] to service their communities.  That was the plan, not just to get an education, but to give back to their communities.  But there was a sense that these opportunities were for the, the privileged, based on test scores, not based on issues about compassion, teamwork, sensitivity, commitment to the community, a whole host of other imponderables that you can't test on.  But what these minority students expressed and evinced in a lot of ways, that was what was missing in the formula.  And that is what I think says a lot about what we went through in the '70s [1970s] and continue to struggle with in the '80s [1980s] and the '90s [1990s] and the 21st century.
Story_ID: 179527
Speaker 1: Now, did you learn at that time or did you know the origins of the Harvard Plan and how it had come about?
Speaker 2: I learned about the Harvard Plan in an interesting way.  I met a wonderful man who was the principle author of the Harvard Plan.  He was a graduate of Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  He was the president of Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  He was also the special assistant to President Derek Bok at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and he worked at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  That was [HM] Walter Leonard.  Walter Leonard was at Harvard in the '70s [1970s] and part of the '80s [1980s].  And he was the one who was charged by President Bok, who became president of Harvard when he left Harvard Law School in 1971 to look at Harvard's admissions plan and come up with a way to find a means of outreach to generations of minority students who had been neglected before.  And it wasn't easy--it wasn't difficult for Walter Leonard to do that 'cause he knew, hey, he, he's, I know, there's a Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], there's Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama], there's Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama].  There was a whole generation of places that aren't Harvard, Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and Stanford [University, Stanford, California], where the vast majority of our black doctors, lawyers and educators and people in business and every other field had been educated because of segregation.  And there are brilliant people there in brilliant institutions, and we would be foolish not to go seek the best and brightest with enormous potential to also come to Harvard.  And he also knew that those folks ended up at those schools from segregated high schools.  And so his point was that we have to go out.  People aren't gonna come here.  They're not gonna come to Harvard.  They don't know anything about Harvard, and there's no outreach.  So that was part of what he did.  At the same time--it's not even reported much, Harvard Law School did something on its own and involved everybody from Dean [Albert] Sacks to [David] Dave Shapiro, to Charles Fried to Allan Dershowitz to Phil Michelman [sic., Frank Michelman], and it had people in the class like Judge Reginald Lindsay, who's in the federal court.  It had [Rudolph] Rudy Pierce, a former judge and a very successful lawyer.  It had Will Sanders [ph.].  It had Reginald Lewis, the most distinguished black graduate from Harvard Law School.  It was a precursor to the CLEO [Council on Legal Education Opportunity] Program.  Harvard Law School brought back African American college students from around the country for a six-week summer institute, taught by Harvard faculty.  They said, look, this is to prepare you for law school.  Let me be clear.  This is not an admission to Harvard Law School.  We're not even suggesting that you would be eligible or qualified to go to Harvard Law School.  We think that you might want to think about law school.  We want to give you a sense of how do you prepare to do that.  And the program was incredibly successful.  Out of that class of thirty or forty people, at least a quarter of them did apply and were admitted to Harvard Law School and were incredibly successful.  And so what Harvard demonstrated by its own efforts was that if you give people a chance, they can succeed.  And that's exactly what these programs meant.  And the same way the law school opened up, and said, if you give these people a chance, they will succeed.
Story_ID: 179528
Speaker 1: [Reginald] Reggie Lewis was at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 1968 at a time when it was unthinkable that a critical mass of people would be there.  He came from Virginia Union [University, Richmond, Virginia].  He didn't come from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] or Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  He came from a black school in Virginia.  And he was not a typical student that Harvard would have found.  But what happened?  He came to Harvard.  He made a difference.  He started his law firm.  He created Beatrice [Foods].  And he gave Harvard Law School the largest contribution of any alumnus at that time of three million dollars and now his name is on our international library, the Reginald Lewis International Law Library [sic., The Reginald F. Lewis International Law Center].  That outreach program brought us Frank Raines, a multi-millionaire who is now the president of Fannie Mae [Federal National Mortgage Association], who also came to Harvard, Harvard outreach to get him.  It brought his Ken Chenault to Harvard Law School who's the president and CEO of American Express. It brought us Loretta R. Grant [ph.].  She's the first African American woman to serve as the deputy attorney general to run the tax division in the [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton Administration.  And she served longer than any of the other members of his cabinet.  It brought us Randall Robinson from Virginia Union to come to Harvard Law School who ran TransAfrica.  And John Payton who just won the Michigan affirmative action case [Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003], who argued the Croson case [City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 1989] and who's a partner in a [Washington] D.C. law firm.  And so you could, you can see the list goes on and on and on of people who, because of this outreach, because of this Harvard Plan, who went to Harvard College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Harvard Law School or Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts] or, and other schools around the country, and they were able to make a difference.  And [HM] Walter Leonard is an unsung hero who wrote a book about blacks at Harvard and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and how the interaction between those two organizations was so important in Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and Bakke [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978] in every forum to promote race relations.  And so it's, it's that remarkable synthesis of two different communities coming together as one to create opportunities and create a really incredible multiracial society, and, and that is what makes Harvard Law School excel today because it has a foundation of thirty years that's showing fruits now that few anticipated, but that many are able to celebrate.
Story_ID: 179529
Speaker 1: Now, were you aware when you came there, the history of African Americans at the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were, okay.  Is that because you had studied it?
Speaker 2: I learned about the history of African Americans because I was interested in one particular African American--well, I was interested two particular African Americans.  The first was George Ruffin--George Lewis Ruffin or George Ruffin Lewis.  George Ruffin Lewis.  Oops, I keep getting it wrong.  George Lewis Ruffin, the [Justice George Lewis] Ruffin Society.  George Lewis Ruffin was the first African American graduate of Harvard Law School.  And there's a society in his name.  The Ruffin Society, and it's based in Massachusetts.  And I learned about that because we were trying to start a black alumni association at Harvard, so I was trying to get a list of who'd gone there.  And these names started popping up.
Speaker 1: As part of BLSA [Black Law Students Association]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  The second reason is Charles Hamilton Houston, and I didn't know Houston well.  I'd heard of him because Thurgood Marshall kept mentioning Houston, and people kept talking about Houstonian principles.  I didn't even know that he was black.  I just knew that somebody named Houston had influenced Thurgood Marshall.  And what I learned is that Houston was the most distinguished African American to ever attend Harvard Law School  His father, Charles Houston, was a--William Houston, was a Harvard--was a, was a lawyer, had his own firm in [Washington] D.C.  Their moth--their family brought money to, money together, and Houston went to Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts], victim of all kinds of segregation and discrimination, but he excelled at Amherst; admitted to Harvard Law School, couldn't live in the dorms, couldn't participate in the dining facilities; had a whole separate existence in the early 1920s.  Houston was the most celebrated and talented Harvard Law School graduate, period.  His grade point average was higher than any of his colleagues.  He graduated--he was the first African American ever to make the [Harvard] Law Review.  And he stayed on to get the first S.J.D [doctor of juridical science] which is the highest degree that one can ascertain in the field and study of law.  He still couldn't get jobs at law firms in New York [New York] or Washington or anywhere else because he was black.  What he did, he did two remarkable things.  He went back to Washington, D.C. and he taught at Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  He trained Thurgood Marshall.  That was his student.  He trained [HM] Oliver Hill.  That was his student.  And they had a remarkable competitiveness.  They were classmates, but they were from different fraternities, and you talk about a rivalry, as much as they loved each other as students, they were from different fraternities.  And so Thurgood was from one side, Oliver Hill's from the other side, and so they were competitive in every single way--
Story_ID: 179530
Speaker 1: What was amazing is that both [Thurgood] Marshall and [HM Oliver] Hill were just brilliant students, but they had this sort of fraternity rivalry, but the glue that held it all together was Charles Hamilton Houston.  He was what he'd call a social engineer and committed to progress of the people's issues.  And his philosophy was that you're either a social engineer or you're a parasite on, on the people's cause.  So you, you were one or the other.  And that was his challenge.  And so he trained these lawyers, and, and he used Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] as a laboratory to train a group of the top lawyers to transform America.  And it was amazing because they were not only learning the law, but they were applying it.  They were going to court with him.  They were going to the medical examiner's offices to see an autopsy in terms of how to handle a criminal case.  Thurgood Marshall worked on a case I've written about, the George Crawford case.  They were the first all-African American team to defend somebody in a death penalty case when they went to Loudoun County in Virginia to defend George Crawford.  And then he did something that was very controversial, in addition to coming to Howard Law School--this is the last thing I'm gonna say about Howard Law School--he transformed Howard Law School as a vice dean.  He changed the admissions criteria to make it much more stringent, and the majority of people who applied were no longer admitted.  And it created a firestorm.  People said, what do you mean we're not good enough to go to Howard?  He says, Howard has to be best.  He brought some of that "Harvardian [ph.] standards" and "meritocracy" ideology to Howard, that was very controversial, but he raised the standards and made the school quite respected and quite successful.  So he did the groundwork at Howard.
Story_ID: 179531
Speaker 1: But the second thing he [Charles Hamilton Houston] did that was remarkable, and why he was so important to me as a model of a Harvard Law [School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate, is that he also did the groundwork for Brown versus Board of Education [of Topeka, 1954].  His idea was that you can't confront segregation as they tried to do in the 1930s directly.  You have to confront it indirectly.  So he trained Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston [sic.], Constance Baker Motley and [HM The Honorable] Robert Carter, Bill Coleman [HM William T. Coleman, Jr.] and Charles Black, Judge [Louis] Pollack and Henry Weinstein, and so many others, Lewis Ruddick, I mean just a ton of people, to start looking at segregation and started to prove that segregation could not work.  Well, if you aren't going to let me come into your school, you have to pay for me to go to another school.  That was expensive.  If I can't study in your classroom, you have to build another one for me.  If I can't live in your dormitory, you have to build another one for me.  He made segregation, like apartheid, so expensive economically that segregationists couldn't afford it.  So his point was to cripple it from within and then promote integration as an alternative on the outside, as an alternative theory.  He also worked very extensively with Harvard faculty.  People like Frank Furger [ph.], Paul Freund with the, Erwin Griswold, he started talking to these people who had been on the faculty, and who he knew about bringing a wholesale challenge to segregation.  And so he used his Harvard education and credentials and his practical experience in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], which he then ran its legal component, and his intellectual development at Howard Law School to come up with the strategy to dismantle Jim Crow, to end segregation and to promote integration.  Remarkably, and sadly, he put together the team, the cases, the arguments up until 1950 and he died in early '50 [1950], '51 [1951], before the case was decided in 1954.  Many say that he killed Jim Crow in this sense with his remarkable legal career.  And some say, Jim Crow killed him because his health deteriorated and he wasn't able to fulfill his mission.  He died at a very, a relatively young man.  What was wonderful and touching is that when Brown was decided in, on May 17, 1954, Thurgood Marshall gave credit to Charles Hamilton Houston.  He said, look around this room.  Charlie Houston, Charlie Houston may not be here, but he's touched each and every one of us in some way in our lives to make this case a success that it is.  So we are here because of Charlie today, and he has made all the difference in the world in making this case.  So our names may be on it.  We may be credited with it or associated with it for history, but Charles Hamilton Houston's fingerprints and footprints are all over this case of Brown versus Board of Education.  And it was that sense of Houston's enormous role and his lack of significant connection in the overall Civil Rights Movement that is America's loss and the world's loss.  When we think about what happened in 1954, we give credit to Thurgood Marshall for making the argument, but he would say, all credit and praises are due to his mentor, his teacher and his role model, Charles Hamilton Houston.
Speaker 2: Do you know what influenced him?  What his influences were, Houston (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Houston was influenced by racism that he experienced growing up in Washington, D.C., racism that he experienced in the [U.S.] Military when he was a member of the military and the discrimination that he faced in higher education at Amherst [College, Amherst, Massachusetts] and at Harvard Law School.  He wasn't bitter by it; he was just determined.  And he said, I'm gonna take these experiences and not complain and not be bitter and not insular.  I'm gonna take them and turn things around to make a big difference, and he did.  And that made all the difference in the world in terms of what motivated him.  And his eagerness and his excitement and his dedication was contagious.  And those who worked around him were bitten by the same bug and had the same deep level of commitment that made an enormous difference in his life.  And it--more importantly, an enormous difference in the lives of people who continue to promote the Houstonian principles of jurisprudence as a way to think about how do we come up with a strategy to deal with race relations in the 21st century.

Story_ID: 174899
Speaker 1: And now I'd just like to take you to your, you know, your third year [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and what, what was Charles Ogletree, you know, sort of thinking, and what were your, what were you wanting to do?
Speaker 2: When I entered the third year of law school a lot of things were on my mind.  What impact would the Bakke [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978] case have on the future of African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American presence at professional schools?  I was concerned about whether I was gonna be a lawyer who made a lot of money and tried to solve the problem or a lawyer who tried to do a lot of good and tried to solve the problem.  And it turned out that even though I was a husband and a father with a young son, and my wife [Pamela Ogletree] was pregnant with our second child, meaning that money meant a lot, I knew what I wanted to do in my heart of hearts and that was to do public service.  And so I interviewed in Washington, D.C., at what was known as the best public interest office in the country, the D.C. Public Defender Service [PDSDC, Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].  It's a very elite and demanding office that represents in, in, indigents charged with criminal offenses, and adult and juvenile cases, and trials and appeals.  And they interview many, many people and hire very few.  And I wanted to go there.  And I interviewed, told 'em what I was interested in, and they made me an offer, which I thought was just remarkable.  It meant I was not going back home to California, as my family had, had hoped.  It meant I was not going to a law form--firm, as my family, my parents [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson and Charles Ogletree, Sr.] and siblings had wished, that I'd have all this money.  But I was changing coasts, changing careers, changing directions, and trying to get involved in public service, and PDS, as it's known, was the place to go, and so, I talked to my wife; I talked to my little son and, and said we're going to not go back to California.  We're not going back home.  We, we're staying three thousand miles away from home.  We're going to Washington, D.C., for the first time to live and start my life there.
Speaker 1: Now, Charles, why had the public defender's office, who was in charge of it then, and why had it developed such an elite reputation?
Speaker 2: The public defender's office had developed a reputation actually in the sixties [1960s], when amazing lawyers like Gary Bellow, who was one of my mentors here at Harvard Law School, had worked there.  It was one of those offices where the lawyers were fighting to promote reform in criminal laws before there was reform.  They were fighting for this before there was a Miranda decision [Miranda v. Arizona, 1966], before there was a Gideon vs. Wainwright decision [1963], before the Mapp vs. Ohio decision [1961] about the exclusionary rule, all these progressive efforts to give the accused a fair trial, all that was in a very embryonic stage.  And so Gary was a professor here.  I was taking his course in the third year, and he was a big influence on me.  I also didn't know any Harvard law graduates.  Gary had been there in the sixties [1960s].  I didn't know anyone in the modern era from Harvard in the late sixties [1960s] or in the seventies [1970s] who had gone before me, but I knew about this office because of its reputation.  It was then headed by Patrick Leahy--[J.] Patrick Hickey, I'm sorry, an, an attorney in Washington, D.C.  He was the director.  And for the first time in the agency's history, it had an African American deputy director, Frank Carter [Francis D. Carter].  Frank Carter was and is an amazing lawyer, African American, born in Washington, D.C.  He'd actually clerked for a chief judge, [H.] Carl Moultrie, of the Superior Court [of the District of Columbia].  And he'd applied to be a public defender in that office and wasn't hired, an amazingly incredible, talented lawyer who didn't get hired by the office.  But when they finally realized that this office, which represented all these talent--all these clients who were African American, if the office didn't look at all like the people that they represented, they went out and urged Frank to reconsider and leave a successful private practice and become the deputy director.  And so, Frank accepted the job.  And when I joined the agency, the year I arrived in 1978, Frank was promoted to the director when Patrick Hickey resigned as the director.  And so for me, what could be better, Washington, D.C., an African American director--I was hired with a class of fifteen entering lawyers.  Two of us were African American; the other one was Laura Christine Strudwick [ph.].  Now she's Laura Christine Strudwick Turner.  Chris grew up in D.C., also clerked for Judge Moultrie, went to Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.] and became a public defender.  And there was one Hispanic, David Garza [ph.].  So out of the fifteen of us, there were three people of color in the, in the class, and that was sort of ironic.  If twenty percent of your lawyers are diverse and 90 percent of your clients are African American or, or Latino, there still was an imbalance.  But for me, it was important to be there to try to be an agent for change, to try to be a successful lawyer, and to try to serve that community that desperately needed people who believed in them and who would represent them, and that's what I did.

Speaker 1: Had you settled in your mind the, your interest in politics versus law as a, as a method for change?  Had you come to terms with that, do you think (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's very interesting.  I was still debating what I was gonna do when I grew up.  And my wife [Pamela Ogletree] kept telling me you are grown.  You need to decide what you're going to do.  And in my views, I'm, I'm still not grown up.  I may be grown, but I'm not grown up.  And what I mean by that is that I have not resolved the issue between law and politics.  I'm a lawyer, but the, the interest in the political system is inescapable in everything that I try to do.  And I knew going to Washington, D.C., I would be a lawyer, but politics would be a part of anything that I did.  And that became obvious immediately when we started to see the way that African American clients were treated, concerns about police brutality, excessive use of force, concerns about whether or not people were being profiled back then, concerns about whether or not people would be able to have, you know, the right representation, lawyers who were committed to them.  And so immediately Washington, D.C., became a microcosm of the challenges that, that I saw politically in the country, and it was a challenging time.  Even though [President James Earl] Jimmy Carter was in the White House, in the late 1970s, there still was a sense that politics played an enormous role in, in the legal community.  And that was so evident in one of the early cases I tried as a lawyer.  I ended up being assigned to represent a young Iranian who had been involved in demonstrations in Washington, D.C., allegedly assaulting a police officer, when there was reaction to the Ayatollah Khomeini and the Shah of Iran [Mohammad Reza Pahlavi], all the challenges of that period of the time.  And my fear was: here was a person from another country in the United States from a country that was often hated and despised in America.  And I wondered could he get a fair trial with his color, with his ethnicity, with his nationality impact him.  And I had the good fortune of being in trial before a judge by the name of Henry Kennedy.  Henry Kennedy was a Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate, an African American.  And his brother, Randy Kennedy [HM Randall Kennedy], is, is a colleague of mine at Harvard Law School.  He [Henry Kennedy] had been at magistrate, and now he's a superior court judge.  And I asked him if I could do an individual voir dire, that is that when you select a jury, you get a chance to ask them questions about whether or not they had any bias or, or favor of a, of a person or a witness that would impact the trial.  And he thought long and hard about it.  And I told him, given all the news about Iran, given the fact that people are gonna resent that this, this client is alleged to assault a police officer, he's a foreigner, can I ask the jurors individual questions to make sure we didn't have any bias.  He agreed.  And it was amazing what we experienced in that examination of the jurors.  What I found most amazing, which sort of changed my thinking about guessing about people's values, I assumed, you know 'cause I'm an African American, that I'm gonna have some sympathy for the black jurors.  And although they were respectful, the black jurors were the most upset about this.  How could this man come from Iran?  How could he protest?  And why should we give him any respect, given what has happened in, in, in his country?  We couldn't do that in his country.  We would be executed, and it's true.  Iran would--had a very regressive form of government then.  And the people who turned out to be the most useful were the white jurors because they were saying that, that they wanted to show this man that he would get a fair trial, that they, they were waving the flag.  And this is a case where, ironically, I was looking for white jurors to give a fair trial to a person they despised as opposed to black jurors who had an inherent bias because they thought the person had violated the freedoms that were there.  And we went to trial, and the client was acquitted of all charges.  And for me it was a sense that politics and law were always mixed and collected.  And it made me aware as a young lawyer: don't just go into a courtroom thinking you know the facts and the law; you've gotta understand every single circumstance, every single possible consequence, every single nuance of the system and not simply what's going on between you, and the clients, the witnesses, and the prosecutor.  And that was an eye-awakening experience for me about the relationship between law and politics--
Story_ID: 174901
Speaker 1: Now, was that your first win, the case that you first won?  You had a whole sequence of, of successes there at public defender [Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: I was very fortunate because I won a lot of trials.  And in fact, there are two outstanding African American lawyers, Michele Roberts, who was voted by Washingtonian magazine to be the best lawyer in Washington, D.C., not the best black woman, not the best African American, but the best lawyer.  And Washington is full of great lawyers in all those major law firms.  She was a great lawyer, went to Berkeley Law School [University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, Berkeley, California].  And the other one was Dennis Sweet from Jackson, Mississippi, who went to George Washington University, George Washington University School of Law [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.].  And Dennis had been an intern of mine the year before he finished law school and was hired.  They were a cut above any lawyers I've ever seen in their ability.  And so they would come to trials to watch me and always had a contest.  He's gonna lose this one.  Did you hear that evidence?  He can't possibly win this one.  And I didn't know that they were coming trial after trial, saying, you know, you know, he said it good.  Let's see what happens.  And I just kept winning trials and winning trials and winning trials, and it was a combination of factors.  First, I believed in every client had the right to zealous representation, every.  I didn't put clients on who would have committed perjury.  I didn't make clients make choices that were not in their best interest.  My goal and my philosophy is very simple.  As a good lawyer, I was always the thirteenth juror that is that there are twelve jurors deciding the case, but I wanted to be in the jury box in every case, that is: what are they thinking?  What do they want to know?  What do they need to know?  What questions would they like to have raised?  And so I always had peripheral vision as a lawyer.  I thought like a prosecutor.  What are they gonna present?  How do I understand their arguments?  And I also had a sense that you had to focus on one major issue in the case, that is if the juror had--jury had a reasonable doubt, just one doubt, then that would be enough for an acquittal.  In many of my cases the clients didn't testify because I was their mouthpiece.  I could say it better than they could say it.  I could say it with force, with passion, and with the facts and the law in my favor.  And so I, that's what I did.  And it's ironic.  There was one prosecutor who I tried two cases against, and both have been acquittals of the same client.  And the third case was one where he was willing to plead guilty, and the pros--I wanted to say can you give us a settlement?  Let's get a plea.  And the prosecutor said, "No.  I think your client was guilty of those other charges, and he's gonna have to go to trial."  I said, "Wait a minute, he wants to plead guilty."  "Well, we're not gonna give him any kind of offer unless he wants to plead to a life sentence."  Well, he didn't want to do that, so we were forced to go to trial on a very serious charge, and it was a very tough case.  But the irony of it is that sort of set the tone was we went to trial in this rape case, and this client was acquitted a third time.  And the prosecutor was beside himself, and, but, but that was the, the sense.  Even though the government had a lot of evidence, we had a lot of sense of where the weaknesses were in that evidence.  And they overreached, were too aggressive, stretched the sense of their evidence; and we capitalized on errors, and he was acquitted.
Story_ID: 174902
Speaker 1: The irony of all of this is that when I finally did lose a trial, it is reported that the prosecutors had a, a party for the prosecutor, saying, they were saying, "Tree lost, Tree lost. "  Said, "Can't you say David won?"  I mean the, the, the guy who'd work so hard to, to win this case.  But it was, it was an irony.  And that's what it was about.  And one of the cases we tried--I, I had a lot of success with, with Gary Coleman, another phenomenal lawyer.  It was a client charged with solicitation of prostitution, claiming that he was a pimp.  And this was a trial that was one of the first major prosecutions in [Washington] D.C.  They'd gone after the prostitutes but not allegedly the pimp.  And my client's, as a matter of public record, Wesley Oliver [ph.], we represented him.  And the facts of the case are not that complicated.  They tried to call all these prostitutes in.  They all had prior convictions.  They had issues about credibility.  Our client testified that he was not a pimp, that he was a player, not a pimp, and that he was a, he had a little car, that he was a painter, and that he had, was a laborer.  And the only problem was that he dressed modestly, but you know, he wore shoes.  And after the fact, the juror said you know, those were some nice shoes for somebody who's a painter, to have those three hundred dollar shoes, and those jeans, and that, that little modest shirt.  But that jury came back after, gosh, deliberating a couple of hours and found him not guilty of all the charges.  That's the interesting part, but it got even more interesting after the trial.  The jurors came to us and asked us if they could have a party with us.  They wanted to celebrate this case.  And so that night after the verdict, all the jurors invited us to one of the juror's home, me, the lawyers, the client, Wesley Oliver, and threw a party for this guy because they thought that, you know, that he shouldn't have been charged, and it was ridiculous.  And it, it was for me this sort of affirming the one thing to have an acquittal, but to have that community.  It was a diverse set of jurors, black and white, male and female, the young and old.  But they said this case was ridiculous.  And it wasn't simply just doing their job and going home but saying, you know, we want to affirm the fact that we thought this was amazing.  And Washingtonian magazine ended up doing a long story about this case, and so it was those stories.
Story_ID: 174903
Speaker 1: And my, my philosophy was that I was a client-centered lawyer.  That meant that clients were in the middle of my life.  And my wife [Pamela Ogletree] was often reminded of it because clients would call at all hours of the night.  They would come to my house.  They would let me know when they had challenges.  I've written about this.  And there--many people disagree with me.  The normal philosophy about lawyers, you have to be detached and neutral in order to accurately and fairly evaluate evidence.  I think lawyers are too detached and too neutral, particularly criminal defense lawyers, except those with paid clients.  Those who represent poor clients are too detached in my point of view.  And I had a philosophy that lawyers should be a friend of the client, that you should have empathy for the client, and that you should also see it in a sense of heroism, that you should be the, the, the hero or shero [ph.] for your client.  And that is a challenge that I think makes lawyers stronger and better, and that's what I did.  And so, my, I'd see my clients at funerals and at weddings; I would see them at Rock Creek Park [Washington, D.C.] and at DuPont Park, Fort DuPont Park [Washington, D.C.]; I've seen them in the community.  They would see me, and they were people to me, not criminals.  And I believed and still believe you can't judge a person by the seventeen seconds that were involved in defense.  The fact that a person committed a robbery doesn't mean that he or she is forever a robber.  They have other qualities, other challenges.  And I teach my students as I was taught.  I was hired as a lawyer, but I'm a counselor; I'm an advisor; I'm a psychologist; I'm a social worker; I'm a friend; I'm a critic; I'm a comforter.  You know, I'm all those things and that sort of sense of understanding the role of lawyering was part of my philosophy in the courtroom and outside the courtroom.  I was not just their lawyer when they were standing at the, the, the gates of judgment.  I was their lawyer when they were thinking about other things, like--and I'll, but I'll all, also say and I also had a sense that a lawyer should be involved in after care.  So many times when a case is over--congratulations, Mr. Smith.  Go your way.  My sense was, Mr. Smith, let me talk to you.  This has been a traumatic situation for you, and you've had a difficult life.  But let me tell you, you've got to think about what you're going to do now.  You gotta think about where you're going to live.  You gotta think about getting a job.  How can I support you?  And what was wonderful at the public defender service [Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], unlike many agencies, we had something called the offender rehabilitation division, so that we didn't just go to court when people were in court, but we could help people find a job, drug counseling, mental health counseling, family help, dealing with, you know, anger management, getting them back in school.  And it seems to me that we saw our role as not just simply being advocates for the poor in the courtroom but advocates for human beings for a quality of life outside the courtroom and in the community.  And our point was, you know, you know, you live in this community; we live in this community.  We want you to go back, but we're not gonna let you go back without understanding you have a responsibility to be a citizen now that your case is over.  And we're gonna help you as much as we can, and that's what I continue to advocate and continue to believe in.
Story_ID: 174904
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe the [Washington] D.C. that you were operating in.  You know, Marion--was it [HM The Honorable] Marion Barry--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was mayor.  And did that have--I just wanna have some context, you know, of the D.C. that you found.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, what was really amazing when I first went to the interview at D.C., what impressed me most about the Public Defender Service [for the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] [PDS] is that this was Chocolate City.  This was an African American city in the nation's capital, overwhelmingly black in the mid-1970s, late 1970s.  It has changed with incredible loss of black community members because of a host of issues.  And I even, naively, misunderstood who I saw.  When I went to do my interview, I met a woman named Rachel Cox [ph.], a black woman.  I met a man named Robert Reed [ph.], a black man.  I met a, a man named Chuck Ruesell [ph.], a black man.  And I met a black woman, Barbara Corporal [ph.], Connie O'Bryant [ph.], and Joel Bra, Brauner--Bronner [ph.], Frank Carter [ph.].  And I said wow, this place, look at all these black lawyers.  I mean, and, and some of them, Chuck and Bob, were in their fifties and sixties and et cetera.  I said wow, this is amazing.  I interviewed and I went back excited, said I'm gonna join this place.  It's very diverse.  Black folks were important, and when I came back, 'cause I didn't have time to really talk to all of them, I realized later that Connie O'Bryant was a lawyer; Barbara Corporal was a lawyer; Joel Bronner was a lawyer.  All those other black people were not lawyers.  You know, Rachel Cox was in charge of personnel, but I didn't know that.  I saw this nicely dressed black woman who talked to me about PDS, and she was not a lawyer.  Robert Reed was head of the investigative division.  He was not a lawyer.  He was a former police officer.  Chuck Ruesell was a social worker who ran the offenders rehabilitation division.  And so I, I naively thought this agency was gonna look like the city.  And it did, but it was not all lawyers.  And that was the first thing, that there're all sorts of professionals who were at PDS.  I also noticed I'd never seen this coming from Merced, California.  I'm walking in Washington, and the postal worker was black; the person cleaning the streets was black; the person homeless was black; the person driving the Mercedes [Benz] was black; the librarian was black; the teachers were black; the carpenters were black.  I had never seen the diversity of blackness in my life.  It was absolutely just affirming that, wow, here is everything about the black community, and I was just enriched.  I said this is where I wanna live.  This is where I wanna work.  I'd never imagined that, and I certainly hadn't seen it in anywhere in California; I hadn't seen it in Merced; hadn't seen it in Palo Alto [California]; I hadn't seen it in Boston [Massachusetts] or in Cambridge [Masachusetts].  And so it was amazing that a city could be so black and so diverse and having people from the lowest ends to the highest ends.  Marion Barry was the mayor of D.C.  There's a majority African Americans on the city council.  The chief judge of the Superior Court [of the District of Columbia] was [H.] Carl Moultrie, an African American.  The chief judge of the D.C. Court of Appeals, which is like the supreme court of Washington, D.C., was Ted Newman [HM The Honorable Theodore Newman, Jr.], a Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate, and mentor, and an African American.  The chief judge in the federal court was Harry Edwards, who was a former Harvard Law School professor, a [University of] Michigan Law School [Ann Arbor, Michigan] professor who'd been appointed by President [James Earl Jimmy] Carter to be on the, the D.C. circuit court.  He's a chief judge.  The chief judge of the district court was Judge [William] Bryant, an African American Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] graduate, who was trained by Charles Hamilton Houston.  And so, the heads of the courts were--now, the courts weren't incredibly diverse.  I mean there weren't a lot of black federal judges.  There weren't a majority of black superior court state judges, or there weren't--I think there may have been two or only maybe one at that time--two African Americans, [Judith] Judy Rogers and Ted Newman, on the D.C. Court of Appeals, the state supreme court.  So the judiciary was diverse as well.  And so I saw Washington, D.C. operating in an environment where talented, gifted, excellently qualified people were running the city.  And that to me was a major boost in terms of what D.C. was like.
Speaker 1: So, D.C. was in many ways like being a kid in a candy shop for you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was absolutely was.  You can go to Filene's in northwest Washington and see diversity.  You can go to southeast Washington, where we called Anacostia [Washington, D.C.], where African Americans were, go to the Giant Foods store and see African Americans there.  You can go to southwest along the waterfront and go to some of the restaurants there, and you'd see African Americans at Hogates or some of the other places that were there.  You can go to northeast where the, you know, Catholic University [of America, Washington, D.C.], the major cathedrals, and you'd see these incredible homes for African Americans.  So, it was, whether you were the most wealthy or the poorest, there were black, there was blackness throughout Washington, D.C.  There were whites there and, and mainly in the more affluent areas.  And we were living in southeast and in northeast Washington, D.C., near--Lincoln Park was our first house at 1713 C Street Southeast.  And we moved to northeast and into a similar area later on.  But we were there, and it was an amazing place to live--
Story_ID: 174905
Speaker 1: (Cough) What was the case you lost?
Speaker 2: This, this was a case of an individual charged with murder, where it was a co-defendant case, and the jury was out I don't know for how long.  But it, it was a case, actually, like every case, I'd hoped to win, but the jury came back and said no, that we think these men were involved in a, a couple of murders in Rock Creek Park [Washington, D.C.], a murder in Rock Creek Park of an individual.  And it was a reckoning for me because I knew I had to lose, I was gonna lose trials, but it was, having it happened that, that sort of was, was a wakeup call.  And people remember the wins and talk about, wow, you won a lot of cases, but I remember the losses because there was never a case that I didn't think I could win, no matter how daunting the task or overwhelming the evidence.  It was the challenge of it.
Speaker 1: But, now, why was, why was, why did you consider it a wakeup call?  That's what I'm just wondering.  I mean you can't win (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because my sense is that, I guess my sense is that I, I felt in every case I've got to do everything I can to help this client.  And, and I think that there was never just a sense of confidence, a sense--the wakeup call was I started saying, did I do enough?  Did I work hard enough, et cetera?  And then people start saying, man, you know, everybody loses cases, you know, wake up.  You've been winning cases that no one should have won.  There was a case of an individual, Skip Adams-Taylor, a client, a white client who actually we thought had some mental health problems.  We had an insanity defense in this case.  He had already been convicted of a similar murder in Virginia.  And the judge, over my objection, let that evidence come in, in the case where he was charged with committing a murder of another woman in Washington, D.C.  And we actually asked for a bifurcated jury that is that we try the case with a jury deciding guilt or innocence.  But then we'd be able to pick a different set of jurors who may have already been biased, who'd heard all the evidence, to decide whether or not he's insane, a set, a different issue.  And after we put the evidence in, and we really cross-examined, I, I cross-examined the government's witness pretty hard.  And I, as we were waiting for the jury to come back, I said, "Judge, when we're gonna, we're gonna pick the next jury."  And Judge Smith said, "Oh no, no, this jury is fine."  I said, "Wait a minute.  We have twenty-four jurors.  They've all heard the evidence.  If they come back and convict, aren't we gonna be able to pick another jury.  That's why we have twenty-four jurors."  He says, "Ah, this jury's fine."  I think he was convinced that the client was gonna be convicted and then let the jury decide insanity.  The jury came back after a day of deliberation.  And they came back and found Skip Adams-Taylor not guilty on the merits.  The judge was incensed.  The prosecutor was sick.  And we were able to walk away in a case that no one imagined could be won.  I think that's, that, this, the, this is called the Parakeet Murder Case, where, in the first Virginia case my client, who was gay and didn't wanna have sex with this woman, actually, apparently bit off the head of a parakeet to distract her, hoping that she would not pursue the interest in sex.  She didn't and then he ended up, according to the government's evidence, strangling her, killing her on the spot, taking stuff out of her apartment, driving her car out of Virginia, and was later arrested and was sentenced.  He, it didn't go to trial--
Story_ID: 174906
Speaker 1: Did you ever, did you ever think you were on the wrong side, that you felt good about the victory but bad about the person?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a, that's a really amazing question about my sense about the role that I was playing.  I have always said and firmly believed that, that from the once sense of, of the role, I could theoretically be a prosecutor, theoretically.  What, what are the practical and pragmatic problems?  They are two.  First of all, I could not advocate for the punishment that comes in the criminal justice system, that is finding someone guilty because the evidence is, is unambiguous and clear.  If that happens, that happens.  But the sentences are, are so just outragently [ph.]--outrageously punitive and egregious that I, I couldn't sentence anybody.  And so you can't be a prosecutor if you don't take it all the way.  So the judge declined my--the defendant has been found guilty.  Okay, let's admonish him or her; give them probation, and give--now, now, let's get them what they need.  That's not the way it works.  It's like, let's punish them.  So I couldn't do that.  And I never thought I was on the wrong side because the one thing that I learned and understand is that in order to have a system that's transparent, that there has to be not the appearance of justice but justice itself.  And there are so many people who don't have lawyers who advocate for them, who presume the clients are guilty until prove, proven, proven innocent, who don't appreciate that the burden of proof is on the government.  And I wanted to fight for those people who couldn't fight for themselves.  The government's always represented.  They've always had resources.  They've always been able to get an overwhelming number of people to plead guilty or be found guilty.  My sense is that somebody has to be a gatekeeper.  You can't take my client into that level of confinement without going through me, and I was the filter.  And, and that's what I tell public defenders, that, that don't be an advisor, but be an advocate.  An advisor says well, you can do this, you can do that.  No, no, no, advocate for a person's right to a fair trial.  I've had clients who were guilty.  I've had clients who did things but also had justifications or excuses, self-defense, defense of others, mental infirmity, or a whole host of reasons that we don't always think about, alibi in cases.  And so for me this was the natural, easy, and correct role.  And I, I think that one of the advantages is that unlike a prosecutor who represents the commonwealth, the people, the state, they don't get to know their "clients," because a victim is a witness not a client.  They represent the people and not the person.  I represent a person, and so I get to know that person.  I get to know, yes, there was a crime that's alleged, but I know--I get to know about the infirmities, about the challenges, about the hopes and the dreams.  And I really teach my students today that don't assume that you know enough about the client simply based on what you've read, based on the past.  Everyone in here is, is a person.  A client may be an artist; a client may be an incredible deep thinker; a client may be someone who has skills in terms of organizing, and that's the side of it that I see.  And why?  Because since I have left the Public Defender Service [for the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], I have represented every kind of client, not just those who are indigent but some who are very prominent, who are lawyers, and doctors, public officials, and private entrepreneurs.  And there is no one who is beyond the law.  I get calls at night about my son has just been arrested.  Can you help me?  Even people who think they're, they want to be punitive, they are punitive until their son or daughter or they find themselves in a compromising situation, and then my phone rings.  And they will say ah-ha, can you help me, Professor Ogletree?  Can you help me, Tree?  Can you help me, Charles?  Because--and they need help at that moment, and that's why I do what I do, because for me there is no other way around it except being an advocate, a consistent advocate, a zealous advocate within the bounds of the law on behalf of any client who comes forward.

It's called, Beyond Justifications: Seeking Motivations to Sustain Public Defenders.  This was my tenure piece, and it's an article that's used in almost every public defenders' office and many other public interest offices now, you know, long after it was published.  And I wrote about that very question because I had to decide whether or not I could do this work because I had a, a crisis in my life.  When I was a public defender in the early 1980s I was struck by an incident that, that, that was unimaginable.  All my brothers and sisters, there were four guys and two girls, we, we, we'd gone to different walks of life in the seventies [1970s], except my oldest sister.  She's younger than me, Barbara Ann Ogletree, Barbara Jean Ogletree, who was married to Barbara Jean Scoggins.  And she stayed in Merced [California].  She became a police officer.  And my mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] called me in 1982.  She said, "Junior, Barbara's dead."  I said, "What?"  She said, "Barbara's dead.  We found her this morning in her house.  She'd been stabbed to death."  And I went right into a, a, a zone of inquiry: what happened?  Who was involved?  What time was it?  What do you know?  Have you talked to the police?  And I became a prosecutor.  I wanted to know everything.  I was a victim for the first time, and I just--the police officers were guys I went to high school with.  I sort of asked them about the evidence, who had they interviewed.  I mean I was out there making sure that every avenue was pursued aggressively.  I put up a reward that, asking for information and to pay those who would find the, the person responsible.  I was on the phone even in Washington [D.C.] with prosecutors who I tried cases against and won, asking, she's a police officer, can, can there be a federal investigation.  I did everything I could.  And I asked myself, in light of how you feel about this, can you ever be a public defender again?  You know, can you step back into a court room?  And many of my friends, like Michele Roberts and Dennis Sweet, who I mentioned before said look, what you've gone through we'd understand if you just walk away from this, that this is a very traumatic event.  And then I thought about my sister, Barbara Jean, and, and thought about what she would do.  She and I often debated and teased each other about our profession, professions.  I would tease her about putting people in jail, and she'd tease me about gettin' 'em out.  But ultimately, we respected what each person had to do.  She would put, put people in jail, but she was a police officer who would make calls for people, for their family, provide cigarettes and small change for the canteen.  That's the area where prisoners can buy food and snacks in prison.  She would encourage people in the community.  And she saw what I was doing, representing people, but also out there trying to make sure that there was aftercare after your case is over, get back in the community, be law abiding, be a responsible citizen.  And my sense is that, as much as she would be troubled by the fact that I had been murdered, if I were in the situation, she would still say I've gotta do my job and try to help people so that my brother won't be hurt, than the other way around.  And I talked to my family, talked to my parents and said you know what, if I really believe in what I've been doing, then I have to do it.  And so, it, the challenge was that I actually had a case very similar to my sister's murder.  And I said can I represent this client?  And it was clear not only that I could, but I could do so zealously.  And so I tried cases after that and continued to try cases beyond that.  It was for me an, an affirmation that if you really believe in what you're doing, if you're really deeply committed, then there should be no impediment to being a zealous advocate.
Story_ID: 174908
Speaker 1: And that became clear as I left the Public Defender Service [of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] and started to see myself doing other things, representing Randall Robinson and those arrested during the South African demonstrations in 1980 that led ultimately to Mels--Nelson Mandela being free in 1990; when I represented people like John Gotti, not because I believed in any crime that he committed, but I, but I believe that John Gotti should have the same rights as any accused person; when I represented Tupac Shakur, the rap artist, when he had his criminal cases in New York [New York], and California, and other places, because he, too, deserved to be viewed as a person; when I represented Anita Hill when she testified for the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 against Justice Clarence Thomas; when I represented Desiree Washington, the black, Miss Black Rhode Island, when she was raped by Mike Tyson in 1991 in Indianapolis [Indiana].  And she brought a civil case against him, and I represented her.  And that case was settled favorably, and the, the--represented [HM Reverend] Al Sharpton when he was arrested in Vieques and, and came back from Puerto Rico here.  And so, there are those sorts of clients, and my sense has always been that every single client is gonna get every bit of my representation.  I represented Frank Carter, the former public defender deputy--I mean the director.  He was Monica Lewinsky's first lawyer.  And [Kenneth] Ken Starr wanted the lawyer to turn in his evidence against the client.  And that was one of the cases that I, I took on.  And so for me it was always a sense that if you are committed to zealous representation of a client, you can't second-guess what you're gonna do.  And my point is that the motivations that sustained me was empathy, to see myself as that client, to respect their, their wholeness and not to narrowly see them in the context of what they're charged with, and to a sense of heroism, that sometimes you have to step up and represent the condemned, the despised, the unpopular, the hated, because if we don't have a society where the least of these--the most awful person can be represented--then we don't have a true democracy.  And that was my philosophy as a public defender that I learned and developed, and that's my philosophy as, now.  And that's what I try to encourage students to do who are going into law.  I, I train prosecutors and defense lawyers.  I train people who are gonna become judges 'cause my whole sense is that you try to teach them a sense to be professional, to understand the craft, to be highly ethical, but to be deeply committed to doing justice for each and every individual client.  And that is what I've always tried to do.  And as long as I'm capable that's what I'll always try to do--
Story_ID: 174909
Speaker 1: Now, now, and your, your sister's [Barbara Jean Ogletree Scoggins], with her murdered, was the, did you ever find the person?  Was the person ever found?
Speaker 2: The, the, the--I have always believed that I know who is responsible for my sister's death.  And it, it, it is, it burns in me today that she was murdered in 1982, and more than twenty years after her death no one's been charged or convicted.  The reward's gone up.  Some of the people that the police suspected have passed away that might have had valuable evidence.  And it's one of those: I'm not gonna give up; I'm not gonna give in; I'm not going to concede that it's over.  And every year in August, on the anniversary of her death, was a reminder we're, we're still here; we're still paying attention.  I was just in Merced [California] September 5th, 2005, opening of the, the tenth University of California campus [University of California, Merced, Merced, California], and the first one in Merced, and reminded people again that, that we haven't forgotten about Barbara.  She's still in our prayers.  She's still in our thoughts.  And we still need to find out what happened.  I'm asking, as we enter the 21st century, the government to re-examine the evidence, to use DNA to see if they can find anything from the articles of clothing, to try to do something.  But I'm not giving up.  And even if the person responsible turns out to not even be alive, at least so there's closure.  My mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] has died; father [Charles Ogletree, Sr.] has since died.  She predeceased both of them.  And I was really hoping that they could pass on with this being resolved, and they weren't able to do that.  But I know they're up in heaven saying Junior, what's happening with Barbara?  And I'm telling them the book is not finished.  I'm still gonna be committed to addressing these issues, finding out who's responsible, and making sure that person is brought to the halls of justice, even though I could not, would not, and will not advocate for the death penalty or any punish within.  My punishment, my resolution is closure, not, not to all of a sudden let the emotion of my wanting justice for my sister override the more sober judgment, that the conviction is important.  The punishment is a matter that should be in the hands of God and, and others.
Story_ID: 174910
Speaker 1: Now, how did the teaching of law school come into your purview?  How did that, was it--
Speaker 2: I've always been a lawyer and a teacher.  When I'm talking to a jury I'm teaching.  And when I was at the Public Defender Service [of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] I started giving lectures at, bar sessions about defense advocacy, about legal ethics.  And actually I started teaching evidence class at the old Antioch School of Law [later, University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law, Washington, D.C.], which was a progressive law school for usually older students who'd worked for a while, who wanted to do nothing but public interest work.  And I, I got a taste for teaching.  And then I was invited to teach at American University, Washington College of Law [Washington, D.C.], and I taught.  I'm full-time public defender.  I taught a course at night on race and justice.  And it was for me an outlet 'cause I wanted that, and I was satisfied with that.  And then [James] Jim Vorenberg, the dean of Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], when I was still a public defender started calling and sent Lloyd Weinreb, who was a professor at Harvard, to come down to Washington [D.C.], have dinner with me, talk to me: we'd like for you to join our faculty; we'd like to have you teach, particularly in the area of criminal law but also trial practice and legal ethics, the things that you have been doing.  And when they came I was very flattered.  And, and I know, you know, you don't apply to Harvard to get a job; Harvard comes after you.  And they came after me, and, and I was told if you tell Harvard no, there will be consequences.  And I thought about it, thought about it.  I said you know, I really love my job.  I really love my job as a public defender.  And I'm flattered that you want me to teach at Harvard, but thanks, but no thanks.  And I thought it was over, it was gonna be over.  Jim Vorenberg called me.  The dean said, "Well, I'm really disappointed, but it's not over yet."  And then, ironically, there was a huge issue at the public defender service 'cause Frank Carter was stepping down.  I was deputy director, and I was in line to become the director.  And there was an enormous amount of controversy in the office at the time.  And some board members wanted an outsider, even a nondefense lawyer to be the director.  And as I went through the interview process, I was amazed that they asked the judges who would be a good choice.  And apparently they got dozens of letters from judges all over: Ogletree is the person to run this office.  They asked members of the bar, and they said Ogletree should be the director.  But the leadership of--the board of directors at that time didn't want me to be the director.  They thought that the agency was too independent from the board because we didn't want the director, the board of directors to tell the director who to hire, right, because you hire the person who's gonna be an advocate, not the person who just wants a job.  We didn't want this to become a dumping ground for people who weren't, weren't interested in indi--zealous, indigent defense.  And so they ultimately chose the director, and the director was a former prosecutor.  And she took up the position in eighty--I think was in '84 [1984], early '85 [1985].  And there was sort of a revolt in the office, and it was clearly time for me to leave.  And Jim Vorenberg called back and said, "You wanna come to Harvard?"  I said, "Well, I, I don't think so.  You know, I'm gonna stay here."  And, and he said, "Charles, I, I want you to know that I have three votes."  I said, "What?"  He said, "I have three votes."  I said, "What do you mean?"  He said, "I know you've been busy, but I've talked to your wife, Pam [Pamela Ogletree], had a chance to talk with your son, Charles, and your daughter, Rashida.  They would love to come to Cambridge [Massachusetts] and visit for a while.  There's no commitment; you don't have to stay."  And indeed, he had talked to my wife, and she was interested in going back to graduate school.  And he, you know, called my bluff.  And the family said let's go.  We don't have to stay.  It'll be nice to go somewhere else.  And we kept our house.  We can always come back.  And so we came, and, and that's the end of the story--
Story_ID: 174911
Speaker 1: --But the beginning of the story, because I, when I was here I said--in fact, the students, the BLSA [Black Law Students Association] chapter, the Harvard Black Law Students, had two farewells for me 'cause I said I'm going back to Washington [D.C.].  And they kept, you know, "Oh, Ogletree's going back."  And then Robert Clark came in as dean [of Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  They said, "Oh, this conservative.  What's gonna happen?"  And Robert Clark and I had conversations.  He had a different judgment about that.  And he, he came and said, "I'd like for you to stay."  And I said, "Well, I'll stay, but I, I need to have an institution.  I need to follow my dream.  I need the Criminal Justice Institute, something committed to not just practice but theory, practice, and scholarship."  And Bob Clark said done and gave me millions of dollars, let me hire a staff, create an agency that's published books like 'Beyond the Rodney King Story: An Examination of Police Conduct in Minority Communities,' [sic., 'Beyond the Rodney King Story: An Investigation of Police Conduct in Minority Communities'] major conferences with everybody from Rubin Hurricane Carter talking about wrongful convictions.  We've had [HM] Angela Davis here.  We had, you know, issues on juvenile justice.  We had issues on police misconduct, Johnnie Cochran.  Just hundreds of people have come to be part of the program over the course of the years.  And so, that was the incentive to come here, and I came in 1985.  This is 2005, and twenty years after saying I'm not gonna stay; I'm not gonna unpack my bags, I got tenure with a unanimous vote, which was very encouraging from this faculty.  I've got a chair, the Jesse Climenko chair, which is a wonderful bonus.  And coming here, I also have started the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice, which now lets me raise up Charles Hamilton Houston, Washington, D.C., a native African American who was an honors graduate and valedictorian at Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts], who was the first African American on the Harvard Law Review, who went back and transformed har--Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and trained people like Thurgood Marshall, and [HM] Oliver Hill, and Spottswood Robinson.  And he's the one who killed Jim Crow, who brought down Jim Crow segregation and, and trained all the lawyers that won the Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] case in 1954.  So, from a skeptic about staying here from the ambivalence I still have about should I be here or somewhere else?  I'm here doing the battle, fighting the good fight, trying to make sure that we are as committed and as interested as ever.  And I am going to continue as a lawyer, as a teacher, as an activist to, to be involved in what makes our community better and stronger.
Story_ID: 174912
Speaker 1: Can you tell me--I'd like to just--in 1985 when you came here [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], what was the--it's different.  You had been on the front line and you know, grit, I mean, really grit.  I'm not saying gritty office, but sort of, you know, of that every day.  And coming back to a place of ideas and concepts and a place that you had gone to student--gone to school as a student, tell me what, well, one, who were the, who were the other blacks on the faculty at the time, and was that first year a difficult adjustment.
Speaker 2: When I, when I arrived in 1985, first it was difficult for one particular reason.  I came in September, which didn't work for my family, because my, my kids were in, in school and in preschool.  And they weren't gonna come until they finished in December and start school here in January.  So I was commuting back and forth, with my family still in Washington, D.C.  The second thing is that it was a challenge because when I was a student here, there was an abundance of riches.  We were getting black faculty, Derrick Bell [HM Derrick A. Bell, Jr.], who'd come in 1971, was here, Harry Edwards, who'd came in 1976, was here, and Clyde Ferguson [Clarence Clyde Ferguson, Jr.], who had come in 1975.  There were three African American tenured faculty not tenure track.  They were tenured.  So by 1978 we had three black faculty.  I said that's fantastic.  We're gonna have ten in the next few years.  When I came back in 1985, Derrick Bell had left.  He left in 1981 because he said Harvard had not done enough to promote more black faculty, so he was at [University of] Oregon [School of Law, Eugene, Oregon].  He was a dean at Oregon.  In 1982, Clyde Ferguson had a heart attack and died, very young man.  That was a shocker.  In 1978, Clyde--I mean Harry Edwards was appointed by [President James Earl] Jimmy Carter to be on the [United States Court of Appeals for the] D.C. Circuit.  He was gone.  All three of the people who were on the faculty when I was a student were all gone.  The only tenured member of the faculty when I came in 1985 was [Christopher] Chris Edley, and he was tenure track.  He had not received full tenure.  Chris had been a classmate of mine.  The others who were on the faculty when I came back, Randy Kennedy was hired.  He had not been tenured yet.  [HM] David Wilkins came a little later.  And so it was amazing coming back and having one black faculty, Chris Edley, becau--and students were protesting.  There was an actual concern that when Derrick Bell left who was gonna teach his course.  And the students organized there a whole teach-in a separate course.  And there was a debate about whether Jack Greenberg, who was NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and [HM] Julius Chambers, also there, should teach a race course together, huge debates about that.  And the students were just incredibly resistant to the idea of Harvard in the 1980s not having black faculty.  So I came, and then David Wilkins came, and Randy and Chris were here, so there were four of us on the faculty.  But we were startin' all over again was the point.  Harvard had looked so promising in the 1970s.  And it was sort of ironic that in the early 1980s they were rebuilding all over again.  They'd taken three steps back and were just beginning to take a step forward.  And then later on Scott Brewer came in the nineties [1990s], and thankfully, Derrick, Derrick Bell came back.  But he said you know, you've hired all these men, but there there's no women.  And you've had all these black women and women of color visiting, and you haven't made a single offer.  I insist that you offer some woman a position, or I'm gonna be, consider myself constructively fired.  I'm gonna leave because you won't do your job.  And he left and went to NYU [New York University, New York, New York], a huge student protest, amazing disruption, and for me it was a personalized loss.  Derrick was my mentor.  And I even asked him, and he talks about this in his book 'Confronting Authority' ['Confronting Authority: Reflections of an Ardent Protester'].  I said look, Pam [Pamela Ogletree] and I love this place, I love working with you and Jewels [Jewel Hairston Bell], Ed's first wife who, who later died, and we're committed to you.  And so when you resign, I'm prepared to resign.  I've talked to Pam about it.  And he said, "Charles, stay here.  You need to be here.  You need to continue the struggle.  Someone needs to be inside to make sure that we continue the, the pressure on the place," and so I stayed.  And we continued to talk to the faculty about how important it was to have diversity.  And then I couldn't be more pleased that talking to [HM] Lani Guinier, who is at University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and urging her to come, urging her to visit, being very supportive.  Judge Leon Higginbotham [A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.], who was here as a visiting lecturer, whose wife, [HM] Evelyn [Brooks] Higginbotham, was at the, the university, history and African American Studies.  We urged Lani Guinier to come, and she came.  And we appointed the first black woman at Harvard Law School in the early nineties [1990s], and it was a victory that we finally got over that burden.  We have since appointed [Kenneth] Ken Mack, also Harvard Law School graduate and a clerk from Judge Robert Carter, one of the Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] lawyers, and Ken joined the faculty.  And we are slowly making progress, many more women.  We have some diversity but not as much as we'd like.  But it was Derrick Bell who was a catalyst to say you can't stop just with me.  You've gotta make a commitment to the larger community.  And we're still hoping that these numbers are the beginning and just the first step and not the, the culmination of this process.
Story_ID: 179532
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to--
Speaker 2: Arriving at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 1: Yes, very good.
Speaker 2: --as a law professor.  It was an amazing experience because I had no idea what to expect.  I had taught at Antioch Law School [later, University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law] in Washington, D.C.  I taught a class at the American University Washington College of Law [Washington, D.C.].  But a full time teaching position was something I hadn't imagined, and certainly a full time teaching position at Harvard Law School was something I hadn't imagined.  Jim Vorenberg, who was the dean, was wonderful about it.  He said, "Look, you need some time to get settled in.  What I want you to do this fall, the fall of 1985, you can sit in on [Charles] Charlie Nesson's class to get a sense of how the Socratic Method works.  And you won't have to teach until the spring when your family comes and you get settled in."  So that seemed fine, and I so I met with Charlie, who I really didn't know that well from the law school days.  He's, you know, known as a brilliant lawyer, worked on the Ellsberg paper [Daniel Ellsberg, Pentagon Papers case], worked on Dr. Kenneth Edelin's defense when he was prosecuted for an abortion in the 1970s.  So Charlie was a, you know, well-known lawyer in addition to a classroom teacher, large criminal law class, 140 first-year students.  And Charlie introduced me and said, gave a little about my background and said he will be here for occasional comments.  And the first day he called on me to talk about issues about, you know, self-defense, and next day, issues about insanity.  And, and, and so, and then he said you know, why don't you teach the class next week?  You know, you know all this.  And here is the topic; here are the cases.  Why don't you teach it?  I agreed to, to give the lecture, and he, he sat there.  And then I started noticing something weird as, as we went forward.  Charlie stopped coming.  And I said oh, that's the way they do it at Harvard (laughter).  You get a couple of days in the classroom; you know, he supervise you.  You're on your own; go for it.  And I was giving the lectures, and talking to the students, and meeting with the students.  I said wow, this is challenging, but you know, that's what Harvard's all about.  What I hadn't realized, and didn't realize until much, much later, is that Charles Nesson was actually involved that fall in a major, serious civil case involving families from Woburn [Massachusetts] and in other parts of Massachusetts who's, who, who had been suffering from various forms of cancer because of what they believed to be the polluted water from W. R. Grace [& Co.] and other companies, federal court case in Boston [Massachusetts].  And indeed, there is a book called 'A Civil Action,' a best-selling book, and there is a movie made called 'A Civil Action' about this trial.  And Charlie was there.  In fact, he's known in the book as Billion Dollar Chardy--Charlie because he believes the case would be worth a billion dollars, based on his assessment of the damages.  And so while Charla--Charlie was out there appropriately trying to save the dignity of these families, I was in the classroom teaching his criminal law class.  And, and I later learned that was not the expectation (laughter).  You're not, you know, it's not baptism by fire.  It's not you're thrown into the ocean and try to swim.  But it, it really helped me because, what was great is that I knew how to teach; I knew how to get information out of students, because the, many of the same skills you use in the classroom I had been using for a decade in the courtroom, that is, I was convincing jurors to understand issues, to simplify concepts, to sometimes have conflict in order to resolve issues.  And so it turned out the students and I were verily engaged in an amazing learning experience.  And so that was my first experience.
Story_ID: 179533
Speaker 1: I was a little bit more ambitious than I should have been, because as a public defender, I worked Monday through Saturday.  I worked seven days a week.  I worked weeknights and weekends because the work had to be done.  And it was odd coming here to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and seeing, looking around at five o'clock and people were gone.  Or on the weekends, maybe a person would come in and out of the office.  And I thought, I'm paid to work, I'm gonna work.  And people always said you're doing too much, but for me, I learned those habits that when you have time, you keep working.  And it turned out to be a good thing because not only was I able to teach and it had an impact, I was the second recipient of the Harvard Law School Albert Sacks-Paul Freund Excellence in Teaching Award [Albert M. Sacks-Paul A. Freund Award for Teaching Excellence].  It's an award given by the entire graduating class of the law school.  I received it in 1993, the same year I got tenure.  And so it was clear to me that I was having some impact on the learning of a wide range of students.  I was so pleased by that.  So that's what the experience was like, being around colleagues.  I was a practitioner.  Most of them had no practice experience.  I had worked with real clients.  Most of them had done appellate work and not trial work.  But you know what?  They respected what I had to bring, and they have been incredibly supportive throughout my time here.
Story_ID: 179534
Speaker 1: There are two questions: One, [HM] Charles [Ogletree], in your, in the development of, I mean in your first year, were you have, expecting to develop a syllabus?  I mean how did--what were you doing, and how did you know exactly what to teach in the order to teach it?  Because--
Speaker 2: One, one of the great things about the experience here [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], the criminal law class, [Charles] Charlie Nesson had a syllabus, so I could follow his syllabus.  And that was the class for the fall.  In the spring, I was gonna teach a class on the ethics of criminal practice.  I had taught a similar class at Washington College of Law at American University [Washington, D.C.], so I had a sense of what I wanted to do.  And the students were incredibly excited about that, and that helped tremendously.  And so that was one class.  The other classes, students said we wanna teach--we want a class on prisons.  I said all right; I'll teach a class on prisons.  So I, I created, I, I grabbed case books, read articles trying to figure out what were the various issues.  And since I had worked in the Prison Legal Assistance Project at Harvard Law School, PLAP, I knew what those students were interested in.  And so, each time I created it, the benefit is that I had friends and colleagues here.  At that time, Lloyd Weinreb taught criminal law.  I could look at his case book and outline.  Alan Dershowitz did the same thing, [Philip] Phil Heymann, and, and so, Jim Vorenberg.  I had all these folks who had taught and were extremely helpful in sharing their information.  Dan Meltzer was extremely helpful because he, too, not only had taught, but he'd had some practice experience in Washington, D.C., before coming to Harvard.  So, that was very helpful in terms of figuring out what I wanted to do, but I also put my own imprimatur on it, that is that I brought in cases in, in my lectures, cases that I knew about.  I changed the facts to protect the identify and privacy of the clients.  But I could see the dilemmas of an insanity case 'cause I had Skip Adam-Taylor.  I could see the dilemma of self-defense because I had clients with self-defense claims, and I could see alibi cases.  So I took all those elements and put them in there so that my hypothetical cases were real, but they helped the students understand the cases in the case book that were decided in earlier times.  So, it was a remarkably rewarding experience to, to, to be a, a new, young teacher at Harvard Law School, having less than a decade earlier been a new, young student at Harvard Law School.
Speaker 1: Now, had you established because of the work that you had done teaching in D.C. your teaching style?  And was there any conflict between the practitioner and the theoretician, you know, which--
Speaker 2: It's interesting that the, my teaching style did, did not change and has not changed in the twenty-five years I've taught, not only twenty here at Harvard, but when I was teaching at Antioch [School of Law, later, University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and at American University.  And that's because I understand the idea of asking questions that require people to think about how to respond to it.  I understand the Socratic Method.  And indeed, what's interesting is that the questions that I were most concerned about as a lawyer were irrelevant to a case, that is that, I had theoretical questions all the time about insanity defense and how it would work.  But my job was to, how does it apply to this client, not, you know, there are thirteen varieties of diminished capacity; which one fits, and why is this one more acceptable than the other one?  So I was already engaged in that intellectual debate as a lawyer, even though it was not essential and sometimes not even helpful to my representation of clients.  So, it turned out to be quite natural.  And the reality is that when you think about teaching criminal law, when you think about teaching about crimes and defenses, when you think about teaching criminal procedure, you know, what's the authority of police and how far can they go?  I had lived that day after day, case after case, client after client, issue after issue.  So, unlike some people who come to read a case and try to figure it out, I had confronted all those issues, all those questions, all those ideas.  And it turned out to be wonderful for me to be able to do what I'd been doing at the, my office in the public defender's office [Public Defender Service of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], or in my living room in Washington, D.C., or testing it out on my children at home, and that is these theories like, you know, why should this person get away when they commit a crime just because someone threatened them or just because they felt imminent fear of bodily harm?  And I began to learn how that made a big difference.  And it was incredibly comforting to know that what I was talking about was theoretical, but it also was practical because I'd lived it, I'd practiced it, I'd learned it, and I could offer something the students would not have in other classrooms.

Speaker 1: Was that, was there anything about the first year besides, you know, people not working as, as many hours?  Was there anything else that was sort of surprising about the culture [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  I mean this is a, a culture that you knew as a student but not as part of a faculty or you know, or, or staff.  And I, and I'm just--it seems like you just glided on in--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you glide in, but I was, I would say, more of an observer early on than a participant.  And how did that, that happen?  There's the lunchroom, and there is a table.  And the table had the heavyweights at that table, and it took me months before I would sit at the table.  You're welcome; you know, there was no barrier there.  But it was like, that table had Archibald Cox--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --sitting there; it had Paul Freund sitting there; it had my torts teacher, Milton Katz, who had been--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --part of the Marshall Plan.  It, it had other great giants.  And in other areas unrelated constitutional law it had Louis Loss, in terms of his work on, on securities.  And so, I looked at that table and said wow, you know, that, that must be a very heavy private conversation.  And then finally I got the nerve to go over to the table at lunch and sit down before the seats filled up.  And it was a fascinating discussion each time about some, some news of the day.  It, it was about the [President Ronald] Reagan Administration, and what was amazing is that there was always a way to be critical and to deconstruct whatever was going on.  Whether these faculty members were conservative or liberal, they all had a criticism of thought by others.  And so it was interesting to see how they would deconstruct a speech that the, the, say the unity speech by President Reagan, how he didn't do this or did that.  It would be amazing how they would look at something like the, the local government and how the, the, the governor is handling the issues.  It would be amazing how they'd take on a story in the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and pierce it.  What was also interesting is that they included me as well 'cause they would say well, you're a lawyer; how would you handle that, or what do you think about what this lawyer did, or what do you think about judge so and so?  And so that was interesting that they found a way to ask a question, not in a, a pejorative way or in a, in a, a simple way, of, of, of, of: yeah, we're just including him so he won't feel bad.  But they wanted to know.  These are things that they didn't know, or didn't appreciate, or didn't have a sense about it because they had not been in courtrooms in ten, twenty, or thirty years or more.  And so there was a perspective that I could add that, that was very helpful.
Story_ID: 179536
Speaker 1: So what was different about your experience, [HM] Charles [Ogletree], then the experience of Derrick Bell [HM Derrick A. Bell, Jr.] here [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  And that's, you know, because you paint such a different picture, and even, you know, [HM] David Wilkins would be more similar to you.  And I'm just wondering, you know--or even Clyde Ferguson, though I, you know--what was, what do you think was different, or was it different?
Speaker 2: My experience, and I think every other African American faculty member at Harvard Law School's experience was different because Derrick was the trailblazer.  Derrick was alone, and Derrick was unique in another way.  Derrick did not go to Harvard Law School or Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].  Derrick had been an exceptionally gifted lawyer in the Civil Rights Movement with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Derrick was brilliant, a law review, you know, top of the mark from, from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], but he was not of Harvard.  And so he was not--he felt it.  And he also wanted to talk about the issue of race, which was very uncomfortable for a lot of people.  And Derrick said how can you talk about constitutional law and not talk about race?  And so, and he didn't, he, he didn't see the need to talk about the Commerce Clause if you couldn't talk about the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendment and what they meant or should have meant when it con--came to the issue of slavery, and equal protection, and citizenship.  Those were issues that were central to Der- Derrick Bell's thought.  And so no one can imagine how much he had to suffer through to be the one and to always be recognized.  You can say that's Derrick but you saw that's Derrick, the African American faculty.  Faculty saw it, alumni saw it, students saw it in the classroom, people saw it when he walked around the neighborhood.  He--it took a while for people to understand when he walked in the lunchroom, that he belonged there, when he walked into the library, which, since it hadn't happened before.  Who was this guy?  Well, I'm a faculty member--when he walked down to a restaurant.  I mean, so he had to go through all the slings and arrows, and he took all the hits for us.  I mean he, in a sense, established credibility and legitimacy for African Americans being on this faculty.  And so when we came, the difference was when I walked into that lunchroom, for example, my dear torts teacher from my first year in 1975, Milton Katz would have said, "Hey, Oglethorpe."  Now it's Ogletree, but he said it affectionately.  It wasn't like he, he--and I didn't wanna correct him.  But he, he was, he said hey, he was saying hey, Charles, you're my student from years ago.  Richard Parker had been my criminal law professor.  He was just a few years older than I was.  Gary Bellow had worked as a public defender, had been very successful.  He knew about my accomplishments.  So I came almost in a cocoon that protected me because the faculty knew me.  They knew me from my years here; they knew me from my practice.  And so I was not only accepted but acceptable in the eyes of Harvard Law School.  David Wilkins had gone here.  Randy Kennedy was known 'cause he'd gone to Yale.  And Chris Edley, also a product of Harvard Law School.  And then [HM] Lani Guinier came, having established a national reputation.  And so that's the difference that we came here riding on the shoulders of Derrick Bell.  And as many challenges as we had, producing tenure articles, getting respect from clients, they were, they pale in comparison to what Derrick had to go through.  And that's why he is my number one mentor in the legal profession.
Story_ID: 179537
Speaker 1: Now, your tenure article was on, what was it?
Speaker 2: Being a public defender--
Speaker 1: Being, being--
Speaker 2: It was, it was about the, the issues of ethics and, and when I talk about how do you sustain yourself as you asked.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: How can you do this?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And it turned out to be, it, it, in a sense, many now see it as, as a classic rendition of the complications of being a good lawyer, trying to be a good friend, and trying to sustain that ability over a very long period of time.
Speaker 1: Now with that, Charles, I mean, did you have trouble defending your, I mean, to, to having--did--or to proposing the topic and having it excepted?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  In fact, you don't propose it, because the one thing--it's ironic--about the academy is that you write what you believe in.  It has to be thorough; it has to be well-documented.  And my biggest challenge in writing this article was, uh-oh, I disagree with Charles Fried, who's on this faculty [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Now how do I treat what he's written, because my view is different than that?  I'm in a conflict with Alan Dershowitz, a criminal lawyer, because he thinks that lawyers must be detached from clients.  I would say, I think Phil Heymann, who is a prosecutor, is going to agree with my analysis but maybe think that I'm, I'm overly critical of the ethics of prosec- prosecutors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I balanced all those things.  You know what?  My view was that I've gotta write the article with the depth of conviction and commitment that I believe in because I can't write an article to serve other masters.  It will never work.  And when you try to have a recipe, I've got some of his views, and her views, and their views, et cetera, it goes nowhere.  So I knew where I wanted to go, and I just had to make sure that I did all the research.  And that's one of the big challenges for new scholars.  Sometimes you get so intimidated by other people you can't do that.  But I, I said you know, if I'm gonna write this article, I've got to take on Charles Fried.  I can't hide it; I can't ignore it.  And, and, and if I don't discuss it, the impression will be I didn't read it, or I don't have an opinion on it.  I did read it, and I did have an opinion it, and it had to be dealt with.  And I think Fried--and the good thing is that ultimately, the critiques that I had, other people then and thereafter had them as well, so that was one of the comforting things.  So, but, I knew what I wanted to do.  And I, there were several articles.  That was just one.  And I was also working on a much longer piece that would be published and then ultimately the book.  So, it worked out exceptionally well.
Story_ID: 179538
Speaker 1: --The reason I'm asking this line of questioning is you've--I've, I've always heard as a student that faculty, visiting faculty coming here [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] found it an unfriendly place.  And, and, but you're, you know, you're saying, because you are a product of the place, that it was not, you know, it was, you did not have that experience.
Speaker 2: That is true--
Speaker 1: This--
Speaker 2: --but does not complete, it doesn't complete the picture.  It, it's true for a variety of reasons, not just because I went here.  But I, I would say, and, and I would accept the challenge of anyone: I don't think there's anyone on this faculty who has had as diverse a set of relationships with other faculty as I have had, whether they're liberal or conservative, whether they're deeply religious or agnostic, whether they're women or men, whether they're black or white.  Whether they're products of Harvard or not, the one thing that--the gift that God has given me is I think incredibly generous people skills.  And that's why when I taught my first year alone, the next year Charles Fried was the Solicitor General [of the United States] in the [President Ronald] Reagan Administration.  And I invited him to come to Harvard Law School to, to teach in my criminal law class about some criminal law cases going before the [U.S.] Supreme Court, and he readily accepted.  And it was interesting because I, I knew Fried casually, and, and, but we got to know each other better.  And he came, and we had a very rich debate and discussion.  And many people said you know, he's conservative; he's in the Reagan Administration.  Charles and I are good buddies.  We disagree on things.  We disagreed on John Roberts' nomination, but we were not disagreeable about it when, when he was nominated for the chief justice of the Supreme Court.  And one of the ironies of it, it was one of the lighter moments in my criminal law class.  Because I told my students then, as I do now, said I'm Charles Ogletree.  Feel free to call me whatever you wanna call me, Professor Ogletree, Charles; you can call me Tree.  But the only thing that I have to insist, do not call me Chuck.  I am not Chuck.  That's somebody else, and don't call me Chuck.  And as Fried came to the class to give his lecture about [United States v.] Salerno [1987] Supreme Court case about preventative detention, and he was explaining it, and he says, you know, and as my good friend, Chuck knows--and the class just started gaggling, just cracking up, and he had no idea.  Why are they laughing, right?  Because here he was, I'm his good friend, and he's calling me Chuck.  The students knew there was something wrong with that picture, and that's why you, my epithet--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --yeah, my email, no Chuck.  That, it starts from Charles Fried.  And now he tells me now he's yes Chuck, and I'm no Chuck.  But, but, but that's how it started.  That's the relationship.  It's a meaningful relationship, and that's why it, it was very helpful to me, and I think it's because I've been around so much.  I get a chance to see people at nights and on weekends who--here and there, and it's across areas.  And it's just been incredibly helpful.  And it's very different than a, someone who's coming here.
Story_ID: 179539
Speaker 1: Anita Allen [Anita LaFrance Allen-Castellitto] came from, from Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.].  And she had been here [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but it was very different for her.  Regina Austin came from the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and I'm sure it wasn't the most comfortable position one could imagine.  And so there were a string of women and men.  [Charles] Chuck Lawrence was here.  Gerry Lopez [Gerald P. Lopez] was here.  And you can see all these diverse, and talented, and gifted, and brilliant people of color who, you know, are just incredibly established and accomplished in their own right.  But it did not work the way that it should have worked, and I blame institutional inertia for a part of that, because I think we can be more receptive to some than we are to others.  And it has a huge impact on people's sense about whether or not they want to be here.  The other point, and the final point is that what I learned, fortunately or unfortunately, is that we are eighty or so independent players.  We're not a law firm.  We're not a team.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We have very different styles and interests.  And I was amazed that some people had never had colleagues in their home or gone to other colleagues' home for dinner.  There was not--I just was saying, well, let's get to dinner, said oh, there's a whole protocol and hierarchy.  And people didn't do that as much as I had imagined in [Washington] D.C.  In D.C., I could call Dennis Sweet, or he, he wouldn't call.  You got, what you got to eat, right?  You know, we're on our way over, or Michele Roberts, or Frank Carter, or [James] Jim Kline and [James] Jim McComas, who were classmates of mine.  It was more spontaneous, because whatever was mine was theirs and vice versa.  Here, there was much more of a protection of that privacy zone out, outside the campus, off the campus.  And I can imagine what that meant for a visitor coming to Harvard and being in an office, staying in an apartment or something, and not having the same extent of social relations.  It has changed, thankfully, and people feel better about it now, but we still have a way to go to make everyone feel at home and welcomed.
Story_ID: 179540
Speaker 1: Now, I noticed that you also established yourself of--established and practiced, a small pract- is that common, [HM] Charles [Ogletree], that, that's--
Speaker 2: It's interesting, my practice--
Speaker 1: Jessamy, Fort & Ogletree.
Speaker 2: Right--what, when I came here, I talked to Dean [James] Vorenberg, and at least I think I, I was smart enough to realize if you're gonna cut a deal with Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you'd better cut it at the beginning, not an understanding but a deal.  And the deal was that, Jim I wanna teach these class, but I also have to be involved in practice issues.  I want to be able to teach classes where students can do what we call clinical work.  If I teach a prison law class, I want students to then be able to go through PLAP [Prison Legal Assistance Project] and represent prisoners, do post-conviction work, look at whole issues of penal reform, not just teach a theoretical class but to have in addition to that some practical componenet.  And he agreed, and he supported my creation of the Criminal Justice Institute.  It was my product, and it, it has been nationally--internationally successful with major conferences, with major publications, and that's what I wanted to do.  And I, I said I needed to be able to handle cases.  I'm not gonna have a full caseload.  But I needed to continue to have a practice.  I could not retain the name of my partnership in Washington, D.C. I was a partner in the firm of Jessamy, Fort & Ogletree, with Ron Jessamy, Joanne Fort, and myself.  And we had a, a very broad commercial and litigation practice.  I did criminal work; I did appellate work; and once I joined the faculty, I had to become of counsel because Harvard would not allow any faculty member to be a named partner and have a full-time job.  So it worked out well for me and allowed me to do cases.  And once I landed here, one of the first cases I did was going back to Washington, D.C., and working with Randall Robinson, who was the founder of TransAfrica.  And he had this idea that we had to do something dramatic to make sure that there were sanctions against South Africa because South Africa had an apartheid system worse than the Jim Crow slavery we've ever seen in, in America.  Nelson Mandela had spent twenty-seven years and was in jail in the 1980s when, when we were starting this movement.  But Randall, and Sylvia Hill, and Mary Frances Berry, and [HM] Walter Fauntroy got themselves arrested.  And because Fauntroy was a member of [U.S.] Congress it drew immediate national attention.  And we represented them, and we were able to get them released.  But it also had another practical effect, which made it great as a lawyer, to be able to go in and say Charles Ogletree.  They knew that I was a former public defender, but now they say, they were saying Professor Ogletree.  I said no, I'm just Charles Ogletree.  I'm, I'm the lawyer.  They said no, you're at Harvard now.  And so there was a range of credibility brought to it because of that.  And it was another good side effect for me of this case in particular, and that is when Fauntroy went into the D.C. jail, he was amazed to see the roaches, the filth.  And so he said this is outrageous.  Clean this up.  And the jail got a new painting.  There, there were pesticide--I mean there were all sorts of sprays put in there so that it became habitable for prisoners.  So one experience from a political arrest against South Africa changed the jail for thousands of D.C. residents who would go through there in the course of days, weeks, and months.  And that was a positive impact of what we had.  And so, that's one of the great things.  I could teach criminal law at Harvard Law School, but then I could tell my students about the defense of necessity and a choice of evils.  Why did they get arrested?  Well, they say it was necessary.  And getting arrested at the South African embassy is a lesser evil, a lesser legal doctrine, than breaking the law of trespassing.  Compare the, the different interests in the law, and, and so it became a, a teaching experience and a learning experience--
Story_ID: 174922
Speaker 1: Can you talk about how you came to first meet Randall Robinson?
Speaker 2: I met Randall when I moved to Washington [D.C.] in 1978 and became a public defender.  I knew through John Payton, who was a year ahead of me and who was in Washington, D.C., finishing his clerkship--he was in Washington, D.C., then--that Randall had gone to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And I knew of Randall for two reasons: he worked at the Roxbury Multi-Services Center [Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts] when he was here in Cambridge [Massachusetts], a community program.  He also started when he was a law student a program looking at issues of, of Africa in, in his dorm room as a first-year law student.  And then I knew him particularly because he had worked with Congress- Congressman Charles Diggs from Detroit [Michigan], because I had worked with Diggs while I was in college at Stanford [University, Stanford, California] on RAINS, Release for Africans in Need in the Sahel.  They were raising funds for all the poverty, and, and, and Randall worked with him.  So, we were raising money and funds out of Stanford to get back to Washington to go to the Sahelian region of Africa.  So I knew him as someone deeply committed to public service.  And after I'd been in D.C. for a few years, he asked me to join his board.  And I've, I've been on the board now, gosh, it must have been for, for more than twenty years because of Randall's generosity.
Story_ID: 174923
Speaker 1: But you had had your own interests and had done your own research in Africa too.
Speaker 2: It's interesting, when I was in college at Stanford [University, Stanford, California], my life was phenomenal.  It was great being a, a student in, in that environment.  It was great doing remarkable things like attending [HM] Angela Davis' trial, getting a chance to meet her, learning more about criminal justice.  At the same time I had this huge conflict: am I gonna do criminal justice or international relations?  And I, and I say international relations because in addition to Angela Davis, I was able to go to Cuba with a student delegation and meet with Fidel Castro and travel the country and talk about, you know, progressive economics and issues of culture and power.  That was mind-opening.  I was able to go to Tanzania because of St. Clair Drake, the great Pan-Africanist who wrote this great book, the 'Black Metropolis,' ['Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City'] with Horace Cayton.  They were at Roosevelt University in Chicago [Illinois].  He was the head of African American Studies at Stanford, and made it possible for me to go in his stead to take a paper that he'd prepared to the conference [Sixth Pan-African Congress, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania], and be there in Tanzania and see people like Queen Mother [Audley] Moore and James Turner, the head of Africana Studies at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and all these brilliant Africanists who were there.  And so I didn't know what I wanted to do.  And it was a Stanford law professor and Berkeley law [University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, Berkeley, California] graduate and former chief judge of the district court in California, [HM The Honorable] Thelton Henderson, who opened my eyes to law 'cause I was trying to decide what I was gonna do.  Should I stay at Stanford?  Should I continue my studies, get a Ph.D.?  I've, I've got my bachelor's and master's in political science, but it really was international relations.  And he said you need to get out of this ivory tower.  You need to do something that where you have a passion in law.  And so that's what persuaded me to move from just the, the dilemma between international relations and, and law and to focus on going to law school.  It, it has been a blessing ever since.
Story_ID: 174924
Speaker 1: Now, talk about that, the case with--more about the case that you did with Randall Robinson and TransAfrica, you know, Mary Frances Berry and--
Speaker 2: Sylvia Hill--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and [HM] Walter Fauntroy.
Speaker 1: Walter Fauntroy.
Speaker 2: There were two cases.
Speaker 1: What, what was going on?  You, I want you to put it in--
Speaker 2: Here, here is, here--
Speaker 1: --historical context.
Speaker 2: I, I think the, the historical context is very significant.  Nineteen fifty-four [1954], the Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] case was decided.  Nineteen sixties [1960s], the Civil Rights Act was passed, in '64 [1964], the Voting Rights Act in '65 [1965].  We had all this evidence that we had arrived.  We had overcome through law the problem of discrimination, of Jim Crow segregation, of American apartheid.  And at the same time, we saw another group and of a much larger group of Africans like us on the continent of Africa who were still if not enslaved in the closest thing to it with apartheid, where they had, when they were eighty, more than 80 percent of the population but lived on 13 percent of the land.  And the 13 percent of the population owned and controlled eighty, more than 80 percent of the land.  So it was a system of subjugation.  Nelson Mandela, who was not known in the United States as he should have been, challenged that system, fought for democracy.  And because of his views, luckily because of international pressure we learned in the sixties [1960s], it kept him from being executed for his freedom fighting, but it sent him to jail from 1962 for twenty-seven years.  And so Randall, who had traveled throughout Africa and the Caribbean, you know, the black diaspora, thought that if you don't bring down South Africa, you can't begin to bring down other forms of colonial rule or neo-colonial rule in, in Africa, the whole continent.  And so, his idea was just an idea, but he said you know what?  You know, this is an idea, is with smoke and mirrors 'cause we don't have the forces behind it.  We're gonna get arrested at the South African Embassy.  And he, and Walter Fauntroy, and Mary Francis Berry set an appointment as, you know, diplomatic going over to have the tea and talk about the issues.  Then when they finished their meeting they said, we're not leaving.  And they thought that, you know, are they gonna arrest us, or throw us out, or leave us here and ignore us?  And luckily for them, the South African ambassador got enraged and called the police, and they were arrested.  It became a front-page story.  And that's the beginning of history.  It's just like Rosa Parks in 1955.  Staying on the bus was a, a small act.  It wasn't like every detail was planned, but there was something that had to be done.  And no one realized that that act would last a year, but from December 1st, 1955, when this happened, a, a year later Jim Crow segregation on buses died in Montgomery, Alabama.  Randall and this arrest did the same thing 'cause they were released.  And we were negotiating with the U.S. Attorney then about what they were going to do.  And they said we won't make a decision when the case came up for a preliminary hearing weeks later.  We found out the day before, we're gonna dismiss the charges.  Why?  Because the South African Embassy didn't want to come in as the aggrieved plaintiff and to have a trial because that would put South Africa on trial.  And when they were dismissed, then we found another ten people to go the next week; and then a labor union wanted to bring a hundred people; and, and then a California group would bring three hundred people; and then college students would bring 250; then members of [U.S.] Congress would come.  And it was really amazing, because after a while, and, and the government wouldn't dismiss 'em on the spot.  We'd have to wait, and then they'd tell me two days before, tell your client they don't have to come in.  I had to keep addresses.  People were coming in from out of town.  It sort of almost got hilarious.  It did get hilarious after a few months because there were people who wanted to get arrested by appointment, that is, you know, I won't mention any names.  But there are some prominent people who we both know who live in places that we're both familiar with who said look, I've got a dinner speech tonight I gotta give in someplace.  So, I can get arrested at ten, but I've got to be on the three o'clock flight.  So, we, we--you almost made a mockery of the justice system.  You get arrested at ten, get processed, you know, one o'clock, gotta be released, you know, because so and so had to get on that jet, you know, run person run.  And that person had to run and, and get there.  And some of them didn't realize that when they're arrested they'd at least have to go to jail.  And they were saying, you put me behind bars?  Well, yeah, you said you wanted to get arrested.  But we had celebrities, and entertainers, and athletes, clergy, you know, bishop, people like Bishop [Desmond] Tutu.  And so, churches started bringing in members.  And so it became a twenty--the end of the 20th century Civil Rights Movement, not about Washington [D.C.], not about America, but about South Africa, a place thousands of miles away in a different continent.  And then Congress started getting in the mix of it because they kept seeing this, these lines and these people coming to get arrested, volunteering to get arrested.  And the police were saying, do something.  You know, we can't keep arresting all these people.  And they, finally, introduced a bill for sanctions against South Africa.  And President [Ronald] Reagan said I will surely veto it 'cause I'm not gonna be told by Congress what to do.  And he did veto it, and Congress went back and did their job and overrode his veto.  It's the first time in a century, in a century that we've ever had legislation on foreign policy that the president has vetoed then have that veto overrode by Congress.  It was a remarkable, unimaginable, and certainly from the moment we started, unpredictable, historical event.
Story_ID: 174925
Speaker 1: Now, what year are we talking about, [HM] Charles [Ogletree]?  And then the other thing is, who were some of the other key players?  You know--
Speaker 2: It, the effort to end apartheid in South Africa was hot and heavy in the early 1980s in Washington, D.C.  President [Ronald] Reagan was heading toward his second term.  And 1984 and '85 [1985] we were then being ab- being able to see the signs of the impact of, of this movement, and it, it was a very difficult time in Washington, D.C..  But in addition to what Randall [Robinson] was doing, raising the consciousness with Sylvia Hill, who was also on the TransAfrica board, and Mary Frances Berry, who was on the board, and [HM] Walter Fauntroy, who was the representative, the non-voting delegate from the District of Columbia, you started to see [U.S.] Congress take an impact.  [HM The Honorable] Maxine Waters was heavily involved.  [HM The Honorable] Charles Rangel, who's always been interested in international affairs, was deeply involved.  [HM The Honorable] John Conyers [Jr.] was deeply involved, so the caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] was involved.  And you're also thinking about 1985, now that we have the luxury of having had [HM] Carol Moseley Braun and now [HM] Barack Obama in the U.S. Senate.  There was no African American representation.  There may have been one woman, maybe Nancy Kassebaum, but there was no women involved in the Senate.  It was a virtually all-white, all-male dynasty, and the challenges were enormous to try to get things to change.  We also had thankful for Randall's support.  We, at the same time, we had two parallel tracks.  People don't remember this.  At that time, there was no national holiday for [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That started in the early 1980s when Reagan was elected.  He said no.  And Stevie Wonder, to his credit, would organize, as [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson and others.  And we were there on the [U.S.] Capitol.  I remember my son [Charles Ogletree, II] was on my shoulders.  He was born in 1976.  He wasn't even five years old, and we're out there marching in January on Capitol Hill.  It was rememorable [ph.], because it was cold; it was snowing; we were freezing.  And the press was saying that crowd is fired up out there.  You know, the more--we were fired up about Dr. King, making his birthday a national holiday.  But we were fired up because it was freezing.  We said why in the world are we in Washington, D.C., in, you know, 30-degree weather, with snow, in January?  Because the cause was that important.  And so it was that sense that Reagan generated the protest to make Dr. King's holiday a national holiday, which happened, and at the same the protests to end apartheid in South Africa, which happened.  And we were getting encouraging words from South Africans saying thank you.  What you are doing, even if it doesn't succeed, is generating incredible courage and support and hope in South Africa that maybe there will be a better day.
Story_ID: 174926
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna ask about three--two, two people and the importance of also the colleges, the student move--the student groups with South Africa.  But I haven't heard you mention [HM] Harry Belafonte, and I haven't heard you mention Reverend Leon Sullivan.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay and I would like you to address that, okay.
Speaker 2: One, one of the amazing things about what was happening in South Africa, this was a multifaceted movement.  There were inside strategies and outside strategies, and there were people who were doing things domestically and people doing things internationally.  Indeed, Reverend Leon Sullivan was one of the amazingly brilliant visionaries about South Africa.  His concern was we have to have a plan, a plan that is written out, that's sustainable, that's comprehensive.  And he came up with the Sullivan Principles, and it, it turned out to be a remarkable set of principles, saying here are things that we can agree upon, that we need to do these things to build a bridge between what South Africa needs to do and what we in the United States need to make sure happened.  And those principles became, in a sense, the foundation of how do we transform South Africa from apartheid to democracy.  At the same time, one of the strongest voices, an outsider voice, was Harry Belafonte.  Harry Belafonte was loved for his great music, loved for his performances.  Everybody said this is a man that we love because he's so charitable, so warm, so generous.  What, what people didn't realize until he started making noise was he was also so committed to the cause of the liberation of African peoples everywhere, from the Caribbean throughout the world.  And it shocked the world that Harry Belafonte, who they wanted to see as someone singing, and dancing, and acting, was out chanting and protesting and demanding justice.  And he is one of the least known but most influential voices for African liberation in Africa, in the black diaspora because his voice has been consistent.  It doesn't matter who's in the White House, no matter who's in [U.S.] Congress.  He has been critical in policies that undermine people's unique individuality, need for independence and judgment.  And he also was on the TransAfrica board.  He's on the board, he's back on the board right now.  He's joined the board again.  And what amazed me in working with Harry--just had a meeting with him, a gathering of the elders to talk about what we have to do on these issues--is that he would travel to the Caribbean, and people would say oh, that's Harry Belafonte.  We just saw him.  That's how we learned the calypso.  And so he'd generate that excitement, and then he'd talk about: why aren't these people able to grow their bananas?  And they're forced to grow drugs because you won't give them their land.  Why are these folks dying?  Because they, they don't have clear water to drink.  Why are these folks dying?  Because they're exposed to the most minor forms of, of diseases, but they don't have medication to take.  And so he was able to--when he came to town, it was gonna be on the front page of the newspaper.  If there was only one television station in that Caribbean city, it was gonna be interviewing Harry Belafonte.  So he, unlike anybody else, lifted these issues up to prominence.  And anything that ran in the Caribbean was certainly gonna run in the London newspapers, even if The Washington Post, New York Times tried to ignore it, it was an international story even if as our press often ignored it or tried to belittle it.  And so, Leon Sullivan and Harry Belafonte are two of the giants, who had other things to do, who had already had claims to fame, but who thought that raising the consciousness and the re- responsiveness to what happened in the Caribbean was essentially their goal.  And I'm, I'm grateful to both of them for paving the way for so many of us.
Story_ID: 174927
Speaker 1: Now, TransAfrica, can you talk about it and its purpose and its sort of legacy, you know?  Because it was built from an idea, as you said--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --started here at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Well, TransAfrica is the brainchild of no one else but Randall Robinson.  Randall went to college in Virginia.  It think it's Virginia Union [University, Richmond, Virginia], an African American college, HBCU [historically black college or university], came to Harvard Law School.  It was the first experience he had with white people.  And it was a daunting experience, not because of the academic challenge, 'cause he was academically gifted, but because he saw all these silver spoon, naive, and uninvolved people who were powerful.  And he also was amazed that studying all these issues in the classroom, learning all this law, it's as if the entire legal system was constructed around the borders of the United States.  There was no talk about the, the Caribbean; there was no talk about Europe; there was no talk about Africa and Asia and South America.  And so, he was very interested in the world and certainly the black world.  And he, as a first-year law student he started the idea of getting information and, and, and, and action on an African agenda, and he stuck with it.  And then he decided that he wanted to create an organization called TransAfrica, you know, through Africa, across Africa.  And it was a lobbying organization designed to make sure that our [U.S.] Congress, our corporations, and everyone was aware that there is a large continent that's powerful, critical, essential to the global community that needed to be recognized and appreciated.  And he started in a small, little office in, on, on 8th Street in Southeast Washington, D.C., in cramped quarters, with volunteers, and started writing letters to people asking for checks.  And, and it grew from a, you know, a storefront with volunteers and not enough money to pay electricity to ultimately an organization that had thousands of members, raised millions of dollars, that impacted everything from apartheid in South Africa to democratic elections in Haiti to the rights of banana growers in the Caribbean area to the criticism--criticizing dictatorships throughout Africa, neo-colonial dealers to talk about issues of race injustice, not just in Africa but in Venezuela and in Peru and in Brazil and in other parts of the world.  And Randall built it, and he also had an inside/outside strategy as well.  He had, he had--I was on the board.  I couldn't write a check.  You know, I had no money.  I mean, I could write very modest checks.  But he had a number of people.  [HM] Harry Belafonte was supportive; he had [HM] Earl Graves [Sr.]; he had--of Black Enterprise--he had Ed Lewis [HM Edward Lewis], who was then the publisher of Essence magazine; he, he had other prominent people like [HM] Danny Glover, the great actor and performer, on the board; he had [HM] Harriet Michel, who runs a national organization helping with issues throughout the Caribbean.  And, and so he had this mixture of people who were great in raising funds, then another group of people who were very interested in raising policy, then another group of people who were interested and could you get you in, in, into the door and get things done, another group of us who could provide some academic scholarship that might influence thinking on, on issues.  So he had a, a, a very broad global plan that, that was incredible.  And when Randall Robinson called people answered.  So he went from that little 8th Street Southeast office in Oakley [ph.], burnt down because of a fire, to a brilliantly constructed office in Northwest Washington.  It was a former Russian embassy and indeed has a beautiful Arthur Ashe library because he also had Arthur Ashe.  Arthur Ashe and Randall both grew up in Virginia.  And Arthur was a big supporter, and Arthur's wife [HM Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] would continue to support it.  And, and his portrait hangs in the TransAfrica office as a monument to a quiet activist.  Arthur Ashe, where people, you know, knew of him as a tennis player, but he also had a lot of dignity, and pride and trying to look at issues like the children in, in Africa's rightful place in our society.  And so Randall took this organization, and he would, you know, get corporations to come and, and pay, you know, money for dinner to do their business.  We had newsletters, journals that were published with scholarly articles, public forums for the community, information sessions for members of Congress--
Story_ID: 174928
Speaker 1: --And it, and the Randall Robinson impact even came up in the confirmation hearings of Chief Justice John Roberts.  How?  Roberts was in the [President Ronald] Reagan Administration in the early 1980s.  Randall sent one of his policy newsletters to William French Smith, the attorney general.  Smith sent it to his assistant and the council for the attorney general, Ken Starr.  And Ken Starr sent it to John Roberts, said you are our civil rights guy.  You should write a reply, a thank you letter, to Mr. Robinson for giving us this, you know, subscription, free subscription.  It was here's our mac- newspaper, newsletter, and I'm giving you a free subscription.  I want the attorney general to know what we're doing.  Roberts wrote a memo back.  He says well, sometimes silence is golden.  But I have to say that I don't think we should write Randall Robinson any sort of a thank you letter or giving the impression that we support him, because here's a guy who supports Marxism.  And he was talking about the, the government of Namibia.  And you remember, everybody called South African freedom fighters Marxists because they were fighting against these totalitarian governments.  And he also said, I don't think we should do it, even though his brother, Max Robinson, is a prominent anchor on ABC News.  That shouldn't influence us at all.  So even John, the young, bodacious John Roberts was critical of Randall Robinson when Randall was extending the olive branch, saying government, we disagree, but here is information we think is important about policy in Africa, and I'm gonna give you a subscription free.  Roberts turned it on its head and said not only should we not be sympathetic, we should be very careful.  This is a bad guy.  So, you never know how these circle are gonna crisscross.  But that was an example of Randall's influence and impact.  Thank God that despite Chief Judge Roberts and--Chief Justice Roberts and all these other reluctant individuals, Randall Robinson was able to get [U.S.] Congress to finally pass the laws that, that led to the end of apartheid and had the direct consequence.  Nelson Mandela was free on May 2nd, 1990 [sic., February 11, 1990], because the sanctions had become so powerful.  The international momentum to free Mandela had become inevitable.  And Randall Robinson stands at the top of the heap of those people who for almost a decade had a strategy, stuck with it, made it happen, and is one of the uncelebrated but absolutely essential and critical reasons that Nelson Mandela was free and became the first African-elected president of South Africa and made all that difference--
Story_ID: 174929
Speaker 1: Yeah, because when you think of that, that was ex- you know, it was, it was a movement [to end apartheid in South Africa] that seemed to come out of no, you know, nowhere--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and just broke open, you know, and catapulted to, you know, success.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: And I won't say out of nowhere.  It had been many years in the making, but--
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting because Randall [Robinson] said, and he still says, humorously, but, but seriously, that this was a movement of smoke and mirrors because when they got arrested, there weren't another twenty people ready.  Right, they got arrested.  It could be a one-day story, but they said well, let's try to do this again.  I said Randall, you can't keep getting arrested.  No, no, let's get someone else to do it. He wanted to do it.  I said you know, you, you can't keep getting this done.  And Randall was right.  John Payton was the, the, the sort of legal guru there [TransAfrica], legal strategy, because he would tell you the hard cold facts; you can do it, but you can go to jail, right, which was true, theoretically, for me.  And, and, in John Payton's view: it's not theoretical.  You can go to jail.  I wanna be clear: you can go to jail and for a long time.  Your organization will not survive if you're in jail for six months.  It's true.  But the, the fact of the matter is that there was this sense.  And it really wasn't a hard choice.  What Nelson Mandela had done for us by standing up in a place where, unlike United States, you could be executed for protesting.  You could be called a terrorist.  Civil Rights Movement didn't have that sort of response.  We had to stand up for Nelson Mandela.  And Randall understood that if it took his life, that he was gonna at least be the first person, like Crispus Attucks, the first one slain, the first one to go, as Crispus Attucks died here in, in the American Revolution in Boston [Massachusetts], that, that he was prepared to do that.  Thank God it didn't happen, but, but imagine what he had to sacrifice.  Here is a Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] educated law graduate, prominent person, but he's saying it's not worth anything.  If I, if I can't stand up for my principles, then none of what I've done is worth sacrificing.  So, he set the tone for us, and, and people just started coming.  And what was amazing, there has not been another movement--I shouldn't say that.  Movements have tried to emulate that because of that--with, with not, without the same level of success, that is, what he did in the eighties [1980s], you know--just think of when we've been able to say, you know, we're just gonna keep getting arrested until something changes, you know.  That, that might have been the case in the fifties [1950s], but now there was not as many people arrested in a series of events in one place or one issue and Civil Rights Movement or anything post what happened in 1980s.  But that's what Randall did, thousands of people all, and they were all arrested.  It's not like they would just give you a ticket.  You had, you had to get arrested, taken down to police precinct, fill out the forms, get a notice to come back to court, and, and do, then do it.  It wasn't a, just take a photo and walk away, and so that's why it was so effective.
Speaker 1: Now who was representing all the people arrested?  I mean who, who was, or who was getting them--that's--I mean it's one thing to get arrested, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --someone has to--
Speaker 2: We were--I was coordinated--
Speaker 1: I mean the Civil Rights Movement, it was the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] right?
Speaker 2: There were a number--I was coordinated, but we had a number of lawyers from law firms who were volunteering, if people came to court.  We had a, a, a whole cadre.  Now, the thing about it, those lawyers who were coming, were coming cautiously, not because they had a conflict, but the lawyer whose expertise is patent law said, "Ogletree, I'll come down to the court, but I don't know where to stand.  I don't know what to say.  I don't know what to do."  I said, "You know, just, just look serious.  Bring your best corporate suit and your brief case, and the rest will work.  Just, just mimic whatever you hear."  And so that didn't have to happen, because most times the cases were dismissed.  But there was a lot of remarkable volunteering, African American lawyers, the, the Washington Bar Association of Black Lawyers were very actively involved, the National Bar Association.  But just everyday lawyers in Washington, D.C., working for law firms were there as well.  And they were very, very interested in making it happen.
Story_ID: 174930
Speaker 1: Can we start to talk about how the Anita Hill came, case came to be and your involvement.
Speaker 2: It's, it's very interesting, 'cause in 1991 I was preparing my work for tenure [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I got it in 1993.  And I got this call when I helped the people prepare Anita Hill.  She had no lawyers, and she was going to testify against Clarence Thomas in Washington, D.C., against--before the [U.S.] Senate.  And I did a mock cross-examination of her.  And she was saying, "Charles, that's not true.  I didn't say that.  That's not true.  They're making it up."  I said, "I know, Anita.  I'm preparing you for what exactly will happen in the Senate.  They will make things up.  They will say things.  They will try to degrade you in significant ways."  And I said, "I wish you guys the best of luck, and I gotta go back to Cambridge [Massachusetts].  Good luck in your hearing that's coming up on Monday,"--on, on Thursday--and this was Wednesday.  And so I went back to my hotel, getting ready to leave.  And I got a knock at my door at 5:30 in the morning, and there were these two black women who were friends of Anita Hill's.  And one of them was Emma [Coleman Jordan].  And it was so interesting because I was saying, "How did you get to my room?"  She said, "We lied."  I said, "Well, what did you say?"  "We told them that we were your relatives, and a family member had died," (laughter).  "So, they gave us your room number."  They, you know, 'cause they, they couldn't get up to the fifth floor, where I was.  And they said, "We just need you, and we, there's no black men at all who are lawyers who are representing Anita Hill, none."  And I said, "Okay, and you want me to be one of the lawyers."  I said, "Well, I gotta go back and do this tenure thing."  They said, "Okay, that's no problem."  I said, "Okay, I'll see you guys in a couple of hours."  They said, "Well, there's one other thing."  I said, "What?"  "Well, we're having breakfast with the white lawyers, and you need to go down and tell the white lawyers that you're gonna be the lead counsel."  I said, "What?"  And they said, "Yeah, we, we want you to represent her and be her lawyer," and I, I agreed to do that.  And I had this very difficult conversation with the white men.  And there is a photograph with all of us who represented her, and it's just striking because you see black women, black men, white men, and I'm the only black male in the, in the crowd, crowd, and only black male in the crowd.  And I was very under, under--trying to understand what was going on.  And I found out later that the black men were supporting Clarence Thomas because there was no charge of improper sex; it was harassment, et cetera.  And they were staying away from her; they, they were supporting Clarence Thomas doing what he did.  And they said everybody hits on a woman.  And I said well, you know, this went too far.  This was a subordinate, Anita Hill was, to someone who was her boss, Clarence Thomas.  And so we had the hearing, and I was there advising her what to do, and my natural instincts were taking over.  And I never realized that until after the fact, because the photographers were taking pictures every time she testified, every time he testified.  And I saw one with me whispering something in her ear and with my yellow note pad over the microphone so that the press couldn't hear it.  And that became a classic photograph, you know.  I was in the lawyer's mode trying to represent her.  And then when I saw that they were going to talk about all things and talk about that she made up these things about pubic hair, and the coke can, even though Clarence Thomas had told her that, I said you know, this doesn't make--and I met with a senator who was on the committee.  And I won't mention his name.  I say his because they were all white and all male senators.  And he says, you know, "Would your client be willing to take a polygraph test?"  I said, "My client?"  I didn't know Anita Hill.  The people asked me to represent her, but I didn't know her.  And I said, "Sure," and I went and asked her.  I said, "Anita Hill, would you be willing to take a polygraph?"  She said, "Yeah, I'll take one."  I said, "Oh, damn, what if she's lying?"  I, I just didn't know what was going on.  And she agreed to take it.  And what happened is that when other witnesses were on the stand, I snuck out of the hearing, took her with me, saw this expert, take a polygraph exam- examination.  And he told me two things that sort of shocked me.  At first he says, "Well, I've been watching the hearings.  And I have to tell you, Charles, I, I believe Clarence Thomas."  I said (laughter) "We're in trouble, right?"  He said, "The second thing is that I know people may not be happy with my results, but I need to have you pay me right now, before I take the poly-- before I give her the polygraph examination."  And I hadn't even talked with Anita about this.  I said, "Okay."  And I wrote a check for a thousand dollars to him.  And I found out later that he ca--this was on Saturday.  He deposited that check the same day.  He got it stamped to make sure it was, it was gonna pass through, and then he came back with the results.  He says your client passed with flying colors.  There, there's no deception; she's not telling any lies; she's very truthful in what she had to say.  And that was great, and so, and I, I said, "Anita, this hearing is a waste of time.  They've made up their mind what they're gonna do, so we're gonna come over.  We're gonna have a press conference outside."  And we had a press conference right outside and saying we've got this polygraph examiner.  He's examined Professor Hill.  He's gonna give you the results.  And he went through de- detailed, detailed answered questions from the press.  I said thank you very much, and then we went back in, but we, we was done.  The last vote was fifty-two for Clarence Thomas, forty-eight against him.  And the National Bar Association of Black Lawyers took a vote before that about whether to endorse, you know, black man on the [U.S.] Supreme Court replacing Thurgood Marshall.  And they voted 125 against him, and 124 in favor of him.  One vote made the difference.  And a lot of black men were on the negative side, saying, you know, let's not get involved with Clarence Thomas.  But some of them were saying that he's the man.  We should support him because he's a black man, and he says he's gonna be different.  We took the--they took the vote.  They were not endorsing him, and I thought that was a great thing from the National Bar Association.
Story_ID: 174931
Speaker 1: In the same time, I, I, I was not gonna get involved in the hearing.  I wrote a piece that was published I think in The Washington Post about a little bit, you know, you should know about Clarence Thomas before you support him and about some of the things he did before that.  And that piece was published in the paper.
Speaker 2: So you did that, you did the piece before you got asked--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to, to--
Speaker 1: I was not gonna testify against him; I was not gonna be a lawyer against him.  And I, I thought he had some challenges, but I think that the, the, I said the [U.S.] Senate can hear that.  And I only became a lawyer when women, black women approached me who were friends of Anita Hill and asked if I would represent her, and I said I guess I will.
Speaker 2: So, Charles, give--I would like to have some context for this, because, you know, this, this trial--you had significant trial experience from your public defender days.  And you had already instituted the Criminal Justice Institute--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, early, it was the early days of the institute, you know, at Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  But this trial really catapulted you, you know, to the large stage.  And we're also seeing, you know, for the highest court [U.S. Supreme Court] in the, you know, in the land, the highest court in the land.  We're seeing a very, you know, a public, really spectacle, and very emotional, I mean on all sides.  I would like you to talk about how, you know, had you appeared before a congressional hearing like that before?  Had you had that role before, and can you tell me--
Speaker 1: It was very interesting because a lot of people knew me from being on television generally, the Fred Friendly programs ['Ethics in America'], but not in the sense of being before [U.S.] Congress and the hearing.  And this was different, and it was very, very much a challenge.  But you know, I got into my trial mode, defending the client.  That's what I did for many years as a public defender, and that's what I was going to do going forward.  And the thing that caught my attention was that I would call home every night and let my wife [Pamela Ogletree] know.  We would meet as a team, talk about issues.  I would call her in Cambridge [Massachusetts].  And one night, it was about midnight, and, and my daughter, who was a young girl, Rashida, she said, "Dad, can I talk to you?"  I said, "Rashida, you should be in bed.  It's almost midnight."  She says, "But, dad, I just wanna tell you one thing."  I said, "What, Rashida?"  She said, "I believe Anita Hill."  And it struck me: here's a young black girl, up watching these hearings, and it, it transformed her life.  And she, like her father, like me, became a lawyer, worked at the Public Defender Service [for the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] for five years.  And then she's been through the [U.S.] Department of Justice, the Special Litigation Unit, ever since.  And that's my youngest child of two children.  I was very impressed that a woman understood, a black woman, a black girl, understood what this was about.  And that made a big impact on the people making the film about Anita ['Anita'].  And that became a big part of the film, to, in the sense that there is a black girl who influenced me to understand how deep and how serious and how important this was.
Story_ID: 179541
Speaker 1: What, who was actually on the team?  Can you talk about on her [Anita Hill] team, and who were the sort of the key, key people who were part of the [Senate] Judiciary Committe at the time during the hearing?
Speaker 2: It was very interesting to think about both our team members and the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Our team, we had gentlemen from Oreg--not Oregon--what's the state, West Coast states--Arizona, Arizona.  We had a gentleman from Arizona, and he brought in some of his associates there.  And we had people volunteering from around the area who wanted to help Anita Hill in one respect.  But again, no black men except me.  We had white women and black women.  The black women included a former student of mine, a, a mentee who was spending her time between UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and Columbia [University, New York, New York], Kim Crenshaw [Kimberle Williams Crenshaw].  And she didn't play a role, but she was very important.  I brought in Michele Roberts.  And Michele was sitting behind, and she was a public defender with me and was still in Washington [D.C.], was very good at what she was able to do.  And it was a small, mean but lean team, made a big difference.  On the committee, it was chaired by Senator [Joseph] Joe Biden.  And I was very disappointed.  I, I talked to Professor Hill in 2013, a year ago.  And she was saying that she has not spoken, and refused to speak, to any of the [U.S.] Senate members because she still has strong feelings about what they did or didn't do.  But Joe Biden was the chair.  And we had some tough Republicans, Alan Simpson, who was, said I have all these things coming over the, this sense of everybody telling me everything negative about Anita Hill.  And, and a congressman--a senator who passed away, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the district attorney there, was new to the senate, and he was leading all the questions.  He was a tough guy, drilling her as if he were--you know, they're supposed to get information and hear information.  But this guy was pushing and making sure that he was asking her tough questions, getting questions from his committee members, questions from his staff, things like that.  And again, looking at all these white men, and I thought one of the white men who made a big difference was from Alabama.  And when women see it now, they weren't born in 1991.  A lot of younger women are saying that guy is terrible.  And, and he was asking tough questions but giving her a chance to respond, right.  And his questions were, in a sense, were: did you make this happen because you were the cause of it?  And she said no, no, no, no, no.  And that's what he, what it meant, what he was doing.  And Howell Heflin, asked in a very direct way, you know: were you a despised woman?  Things like that, asking the questions, and she said no, no, no.  And he was building her credibility up.  This wasn't the chairman, but he was also on the Democratic side was the senator from the Northeast here, Vermont.  And he asked--and he's the one who came in and asked me these questions.  But having Senator [Patrick] Leahy ask these questions was very good.  And some of the folks had asked no questions.  But some of the negative questions were actually from Democrats.  And the remarkable thing is that after the hearing people were saying, twenty years later saying, you know, I made a mistake by voting for him [Clarence Thomas], people who were in the fifty-two as opposed to the forty-eight.  I made a mistake voting for him.  He's turned out to be just as conservative as we thought he was gonna be but even more conservative than we imagined he would be.  And so, it doesn't help us.  He was confirmed in 1991.  And I see a lot of the folks; I speak to them.  Orrin Hatch from Utah, we've had conversations.  And we disagree on Clarence Thomas, but we've learned how to be reasonable even though we have disagreements.

Speaker 1: Well, you know, you had also Senator [Edward] Kennedy on the--and he was somewhat neutered, I mean because of Chappaquiddick.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --you know, he could not--
Speaker 2: Well, it was more than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Senator Ted Kennedy was on the committee [U.S.] Senate Judiciary Committee, and he was the senior member.  He had been in the [U.S.] Senate for a while, and he was of little help to us.  He made some statements at the end, but he had the problem with Chappaquiddick number one; number two, his nephew [William Kennedy Smith] had just been charged with a rape when he was asleep or somewhere in the house.  His nephew was acquitted, but it was televised, and that was just a few weeks before this hearing, right.  And so, it was very disappointing to see Ted Kennedy.  And he had a strong statement at the end, but he had very little sway in, in the committee.  And, and it's interesting, because he was the force that made a big difference when Robert Bork was nominated for the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  He, he, Kennedy was the lead person, asking a lot of questions, very en- engaged, very dynamic.  But with Anita Hill he was muted in, in some sense.  He was unable to respond to us and help Anita Hill the way he would--cross-examined Robert Bork, he could not do it with Clarence Thomas at all--
Story_ID: 179543
Speaker 1: I, I, I gave Anita Hill as much information as I could and told her that I thought that the [U.S.] Senate [Confirmation] Hearing was gonna be like a trial.  She was a witness not a defendant, but she was gonna be treated like a defendant.  There's mixed--as if she were making accusations.  And so, and they brought everything in, and we had to make sure that they--we brought in everything about him, that, that she would talk about that, and she was great about that.  She talked about his showing her the coke can with pubic hair, his interest in trying to have her, take her, take her on a date.  And she said he didn't rape me, but this was sexual harassment.  He just kept pushing me to try to be his partner, and I had no interest at all in him as a person, as a male.  I had no interest in him, but he kept pushing the envelope.  And we started doing the research and said we know we might do a little investigation ourselves.  And we found out from a lot of people that the X-rated movies that he would check out from Washington [D.C.] and watch a lot, find out where he spent his time, what things he was doing.  And we knew that there was someone who knew about that and who told us about it.  And we went to try to get this person as a witness to talk about it, and he didn't show up at all.  And so, we went down every single avenue to make sure that they, the [U.S.] Senate had a full hearing.  Who was Clarence Thomas?  And it wasn't because he was a black man.  It wasn't because he was unqualified.  He had the qualifications.  The question is whether or not there were things that stood in the way of him being appointed to the [U.S.] Supreme Court that he had not been truthful about.  And they would not seem to explore that.  And, and I think that what changed it all, the difference is that Anita Hill testified once throughout the entire hearing.  Clarence Thomas testified three times: before it started; after she testified; and then he testified as a witness, the third time, three times before the Senate [Judiciary] Committee.  And he had phrases that intimidated an all-white male senate.  He says this is a hi-tech legal lynching of uppity blacks, people who think for themselves.  And it was a very dramatic, very powerful in a sense of the rhetoric.  And, and I say rhetoric not to downplay it, but it was very powerful, what he had to say.  And I think the white males were saying whoa, he's playing the race card.  We may, we, we should stay away from that, and they did because he did the job that he's supposed to do, right.  He was very challenging, very much in control, and made them understand that he was not going to have them in a sense belittle him.  And he called witnesses to testify about him.  We called witnesses about how inappropriate he was, women who had had a relationship with him before.  And what was interesting is that we were bringing in several other women who had encounters with him, and they were gonna testify about him as a lawyer, as a judge, et cetera.  And Joseph Biden said, well, we're gonna end the hearing today and just hit the gavel.  The hearing was over after we put in our evidence, and we were done.  Anita Hill went back to Oklahoma [University of Oklahoma College of Law, Norman, Oklahoma].  I went back to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I got my tenure a couple of years later.  She got her tenure, but she also had a problem because women were very organized after what happened to her.  And they were very much in her corner.  There were women, white women and, and with one black woman, Eleanor Holmes Norton.  And they came to end the hearing, and they had one senator, but all the rest were in the House of Representatives.  And they, they wouldn't let them come in and sit behind her.  They put them in a row in the back of the room where they were sitting.  They were quiet.  They were respectful.  They understood that this is the senate, you know.  They're having the hearings.  We're, we're observers; we're not participants.  But all of that was part of what was going on.  The press was very active every day.  They're asking for statements every day.  And we said no comment, we had no comment, no comment, trying to protect the integrity of the hearing.  And there, there was a lot of exchange, but it didn't go anywhere.
Story_ID: 179544
Speaker 1: So what about, you know, how was it decided, [HM] Charles [Ogletree], who was going to testify, like Jane--is it Jane Carr, Carr--James--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jim Carr, yeah.
Speaker 1: Jim Carr, Jim Carr.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was his--
Speaker 2: John Carr, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: John Carr, it's John Carr.  Because, you know, you're looking at--who, how, who decided that?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: You did.
Speaker 2: And the thing about it is that John Carr had known Anita Hill, had been at a practice with her, and thought that she was a respectful woman.  And she was--he was a character witness.  Other people who knew her from Oklahoma [University of Oklahoma College of Law, Norman, Oklahoma] who were professors, white women, they testified in her behalf as well.  That was very important, and I think that made a big difference.  The people who were testifying for Clarence Thomas were black and white male and female, about him as a boss and things like that.  And we had, we put these individuals on panels.  We had a panel of four or five women.  They'd have a panel of four or five women, four or five men.  But we were in a sense trying to respond to that, to build up her credibility, and to also raise questions about his credibility.
Speaker 1: Did you talk with people who knew him, you know, earlier in his life, like, you know, Ted Wells [HM Theodore Wells], who was his, his roommate.  But did you have any of that information about him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: We, we tried to talk to a lot of people, and, and a lot of people just didn't know, didn't wanna get involved.  I'm not gonna mention names.  They didn't wanna get involved.  And they were friends of his in college, and they were in a sense not involved at all in the hearing.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And they were saying, well, I feel you, bro.  I said you know, where were you (laughter)?  I needed you, you know.  You know his proclivities; you know what he likes and what he's, what his interests are.  And he had the same kind of rock 'n' roll.  He was a mentor to a lot of people, because he was a little bit older than folks when, when they were in college.  But, he's the man, and they were very reluctant to be critical or negative about what he was able to do.
Story_ID: 179545
Speaker 1: Let me ask this because really what was at stake was this, this, this, the seat, you know, the seat on the court [U.S. Supreme Court] and what that represented, you know, for the black community.  And he [Clarence Thomas] was coming behind Thurgood Marshall.  And do you think that a--have you ever thought over these years that maybe a different approach could have been taken, you know, maybe not the Anita Hill approach?  Could there have been--was there not enough on his record that, you know, could have been challenged successfully?
Speaker 2: A lot of people were asking about, you know, why get involved in this case?  And, and my sense is that, hearing from these women, black and white women, there was a problem about his character, whether he was suitable for the Supreme Court.  And that you'd bring up with anybody.  It was brought up with Robert Bork, who didn't make it, the other just--other people nominated for the Supreme Court who didn't make it.  That was very important.  And remember, we were a witness; we weren't the defendant; we weren't--
Speaker 1: But you became--
Speaker 2: This was a trial--
Speaker 1: --the defendant.
Speaker 2: --but the reality is that it took a whole new sense because the, the white men on this [Senate] Judiciary Committee had never dealt with this issue, race and gender.  And they thought that when he's talking about hi-tech legal lynching of uppity blacks, talking about males, what about Anita Hill?  It was a hi-tech legal lynching of her by the senators, who happened to be white.  And they didn't understand gender at all.  They didn't understand race and gender, how that made a big difference.  And Anita Hill's grandparents and other people came that made a, made a difference.  But it was a very tough point, but the reality was that it was a historic point because of the people going in a sense in his favor.  And, and you can see the tide has turned from 1991 to 2014.  It's made a big difference.  And we're happy with that.  We just wish it, it had happened in a different way.
Speaker 1: Right.  So after, so after that, what--you're, you're, you're elevated in a different way.  Even though you're saying you had been on TV before, this really, in some respects people are seeing, you know, you really as much as, as Anita Hill because who is this black man, you know, representing her?  And so what happens?  What, when you returned to--well, let me ask you, immediately after the hearing, what is the, the feedback that you're getting immediately after the congressional hearing?
Speaker 2: Positive because people are saying here's a black man supporting a black woman who was harassed by a black man.  So there's a lot of positive feedback.  There was a little bit of question from the white male Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] faculty, because they're saying, you know, you're, you're coming up for tenure.  You spent all this time in Washington, D.C.  I said wait a minute.  This was Columbus Day weekend, and it's Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.  I came back on Monday.  I didn't spend, miss any classes; I didn't miss any time, and so this made no sense at all.  And they backed off, and now they're saying oh, we're, we're in your corner.  I said well, you weren't in my corner (laughter) at the time.  You were in Clarence Thomas' corner, 'cause, you know, you liked the fact that somebody who's black and conservative is going to the Supreme Court.  And we didn't attack his politics.  We attacked his character.  And I, I think that made a big difference.  And a lot of things happened, and, and I was very happy with Professor Hill that women embraced what she was doing.  And, and that created a national scene.  And she has thousands of letters and emails and cards that people sent, women from around the country, women and men, but mainly women.  And that made it very big, that people understood, and that, that became the impetus for the Women's Movement.  We had more women elected to the United States Senate, more to the House of Representatives.  It changed, it just changed the whole way that the people thought about women.  And, and even the senate said, you know, we need to talk about this.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And now we see it going the other direction slowly but surely the fact that equal pay for equal work.
Story_ID: 179546
Speaker 1: And even my mentee and president of the United States, [HM] Barack Obama, was talking about, you know, making sure that women had equal pay for equal work, even though in his administration it's overwhelmingly male and white, with the exception of [HM The Honorable] Valerie Jarrett, who's one of his top advisors.  And women have not been treated fairly.  Now, the good thing is that he did consult me on the [U.S.] Supreme Court vacancies, and he appointed two women that I knew very well, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan.  Elena Kagan was dean.  She was the solicitor general, dean at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  She was solicitor general.  She was a few years behind me 'cause I remember her as a student in the eighties [1980s] when I was teaching at Harvard.  And, and I thought that she had everything.  She'd never argued a case.  She'd never been on the bench.  And so, you can imagine the questions were, you know, have you done this?  Have you done that?  And I think what broke it all up was when a Republican cong--a senator asked her a question, you know, you know, Anita Hill, can you tell us--'cause they're talking about the bombing--tell us what you're what you're doing on Christmas.  She says, "Well, you know, I, I was probably doing what every Jewish person was doing.  I was going to a Chinese restaurant."  Everybody cracked up, right.  And, and it was true.  She was at a Chinese restaurant.  I don't, I don't know, but it was probably at Chinese restaurant somewhere while the rest of the world was celebrating Christmas.  But that's, the, they had a sense that this is a person with a sense of humor, smart, capable, young, is gonna make a big difference.  And with Sonia Sotomayor, she used all of her roots, coming from Puerto Rico, going, being a Latina and what that meant as a district attorney in New York [New York], being a, a, a superior court judge, working her way up to the circuit court, district court, circuit court, and then nominated by President Obama to the Supreme Court.  And she's been the life of the party, doing a great job on the Supreme Court as well.  So, that changed the whole idea, and I, I think that, you know, whether he has any more appointments, I think that'll, that will make a big difference.  It made a difference with President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton, 'cause he appointed first Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court and then later, a year later, appointed Stephen Breyer.  But the whole idea was, when women represent over half of our population, they should easily represent over half of our Supreme Court.  And it, to me, it, it's shameful that we only have three representatives as opposed to five of the nine justices on the Supreme Court.  And I think that will change.  I am confident that right now that President Obama would continue to make sure that diversity is important.  And I'm just waiting for the opportunity for him to appoint a black woman to the Supreme Court.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Story_ID: 179547
Speaker 1: One other thing with Anita Hill, really, she shrunk from view, you know, because she really I think for whatever her decision was, and maybe you know about it, you know, she really would have become the poster child for the Women's Movement.
Speaker 2: You know, I think a lot of people don't realize that Anita Hill was not active in the Women's Movement.  And, and people were grabbing her, hoping that she would lead it.  And her point was that: I'm a law professor.  I teach my students these different courses. And I know 'cause I'd met her in competitions at the BLSA programs, the Black Law Students Association programs, when she was a professor at Oklahoma, University of Oklahoma Law School [University of Oklahoma College of Law, Norman, Oklahoma].  And she always had a team ready for the appellate arguments.  They were remarkable, and that's what she loved doing.  And people kept pressing and pressing, and then finally she said you know, I've learned a lot.  Women are in my corner.  Women are treated differently and unfairly.  And so it, it took until the year, into the 2000s for her to move from being just a person who happened to be a woman to someone who really was involved in the Women's Movement.  This movie, 'Anita,' captures that and tells what she's done, what she's willing to do, and how important it is for girls.  And, and, and when she's spoken around the area, it's very important that, that not only women but young girls are saying I believe Anita.  She made a big difference.  It changed my daughter [Rashida Ogletree], made her wanna become a lawyer and want to be a public defender and later [U.S.] Department of Justice.  And I, I think that's what it's all about.  Do you--each one teach one. That's what she was doing, and people have been following her ever since.
Story_ID: 179548
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the Criminal Justice Institute [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], 'cause I don't think we had talked about that and the, you know, that you were named director in 1990.  So, you know--
Speaker 2: Earlier.
Speaker 1: Earl--I had 19--"establishes and is named director in 1990"--
Speaker 2: Dir, director then, yep.
Speaker 1: Right, director, okay.  But let's--so, can you talk about the beginning of this?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was recruited by Jim Vorenberg, who's the dean at Harvard Law School, and asked me to come to Washington--come to Cambridge [Massachusetts] to Harvard Law School.  And I loved my job in Washington [D.C.], and so I said I'm not that sure. But if I wanna come, I wanna come and I want to not only be a professor, I, I was being a, a tenure track professor.  But I also wanted to make sure that we--I can bring this issue 'cause I've been practicing as a lawyer as a public defender, and he said sure.  And I, I brought the Criminal Justice Institute.  And I had four people there, and all of them were in a sense, tenured, which means now they're permanent slots at the Criminal Justice Institute.  It's still in existence, and women and men, black and white.  It was to me the opening opportunity.  If I wanted to do that, I wanted to do something that relates to the work I was doing.  I was teaching criminal law, but I also wanted to make sure that we were representing clients, particularly clients in the criminal justice system.
Speaker 1: You know, Charles, I still, still at this time there's been a big paramount shift now.  But at this time, and even, well, even though the trend had started earlier of clinical practice, you know, in a place like Harvard Law School, because it was not an easy thing at the be- sort of at the beginning.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, while there--so, I want you to sort of talk about that within the context of the law school faculty and the things that were--'cause it's, Mary, Mary Prosser was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, right, very active, and you've written books with her.  But, but, so I just want you to talk about sort of the, you know, early years of the Institute and what are sort of critical things and developing legitimacy--
Speaker 2: One of the, the things that really helped me when I started at Harvard was to have allies who understood the importance of it.  And one of the great allies, a great friend, was Gary Bellow.  He had worked as a public defender in the same office that I worked in, in D.C. at the Public Defender Service [for the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] before it was called the Public Defender Service.  He'd been working there in the sixties [1960s].  And this was a very talented person who wanted to use his skills to train people and, and he did that.  And so I hired the staff and they're--and what was great is that they would supervise students who represented clients in the criminal justice system, and they've gone on to teach now.  Abbe Smith is a teacher at Georgetown [University Law Center, Washington, D.C.].  She has a whole program, the same way that I started one.  Mary Prosser went to Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin Law School, Madison, Wisconsin], same thing, pushing, making sure that, that we're embracing that.  I've taught one of the people who's still here in Massachusetts, [William] Bill Talley.  He was one of the first people I hired and another person that was in that first group.  I've been in touch with him, and he was the white male, the token white male, who made a big difference that.  And he was with us doing incredible work and now has his own practice, his own firm in Boston [Massachusetts].  And it was great having these four people doing the good work, two men, two women, but very much supervising students and make, make a big difference--
Story_ID: 179549
Speaker 1: So how was, how was the, the, how was it funded (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well let me, I should say, and the thing about it is that what was great about it is that since Jim [Vorenberg] was still the dean, he was supporting this idea of having the Criminal Justice Institute [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And he was replaced, as people may recall, by Robert Clark.  And Robert Clark was, you know, no business; he's not having this.  And, and Robert Clark and I had it out.  I said look, these folks have been here.  They came with Jim Vorenberg's blessings.  You're the dean now.  And he says well, you know, but you know tenure is a tough thing.  But he, I got him--Robert Clark and I got an agreement, and he in a sense made sure that we had the support so that now the program is endowed.  It's part of the school, the clinical program, which I was the dean of the clinical program, trying to build that up too.  And that was very important, because the whole idea is that a lot of people wanted to come.  And said I just wanted to supervise students.  I wanted to do some teaching, but I want to keep my practice.  And, and so a lot of people continued preach--teaching and practice and supervising students, and the law school saw how important it was.  I was surprised.  I had very little resistance from the majority of the faculty.  The majority of the faculty said we need to come into the 20, 20th century and figure out what we're gonna be doing.  And they supported this, endowed it, and we would, we were, you know, top individuals in the clinical family.  We had a whole clinical program that made a enormous amount of difference in terms of around the country.  Because Harvard was one of the country--one of the places that, that Gary Bellows started, but I went to all the clinical conferences and made sure that people understood that we were invested in that and made a big part of it.  And so, since then, we continue to have it--
Story_ID: 179550
Speaker 1: Dehlia Umunna is now the head of the Criminal Justice Institute [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  She brings in a lot of talented lawyers who've done a great job.  Those lawyers supervise students in court.  And I just talked to Dehlia last month in July, 2014, and she was saying our record is 9 and 0.  I said what you mean 9 and 0?  She says we have not lost a jury trial in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] or Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts] this year.  All the students have been great; they're well prepared; and we've got a unanimous record.  And before, we couldn't even get trials; it was so hard to get a case and a trial.  And what's nice about it, these are students, many of them are third-year students, and they've graduated.  They've taken the bar, but they wanna come back and represent that case of Amil [ph.], Jamal [ph.], or Sarah [ph.], or Aleta [ph.].  They, they get very committed to it, and they don't wanna give it up. And that's made the big difference.  And, and so, when we walk into the court now, say uh-oh, here are the folks from CJI (laughter).  They know we're coming; they know we mean business.  They know we're well-prepared; we've done the investigation; we've met with the prosecutors, get the research down.  We've talked to witnesses that the police haven't talked to since the day the offense was committed. And so we are ready for trial, make, makes a huge difference.  And every time I go over to court, I have to try to stop the judges, and the judge says, "Ah, there's Professor Ogletree.  Professor Ogletree, won't you come up?"  I'm, I'm, I'm saying, "I'm just watching, judge."  "No, no, I wanna introduce you to these people.  I want them to know that here is a guy from Harvard, and they're students from Harvard, and they're lawyers from Harvard."  I said, "I know, but I'm just here observing; I'm just a citizen today."  "No, man, you are great".  And, and the, and the judges, you know, I can't sneak into a courtroom anymore as much as I'd like to, 'cause I wanna see the students perform.  But I see them coming out with their clients and walking away.  And I also--you have to have a sense of what is the process that you follow.  And it's different from normal [ph.].  Don't ask your client who is poor, black, or brown to come to Harvard Law School 'cause they have never been to Harvard.  They grew up in Roxbury; they grew up in Dorchester, and, and they, they have no business.  And, and when they come to Harvard, they're often harassed by the police 'cause the police seem to know when you're not belonging in the community, even though everybody's around the subways, the Red Line around Harvard.  But it's made a huge difference to get the, our young people involved, get them going out.  And they'll, and the clients say, "I can't meet you at my house, you know.  I, I prefer not to do that."  And the difficulty, which is part of the training, is that I say: I just want you to be clear.  You represent the client, not the mother, not the father, not the aunt, not the uncle, not the grandfather.  And you, you can talk to them if you'd like to, but your client talks to you, and you represent the client.  And that creates difficulty, said, "This is my son.  He's only seventeen years old."  "Yeah, I know.  We represent him, and we're not gonna talk to you about his case.  He's not gonna talk to you about his case.  That's our job.  We've learned that the attorney/client privilege applies from the moment we are engaged to represent him, throughout his case, and even after that we believe."  And so, it's cre- created some difficulties because people want, you know, interview them in their house.  They want you to come there.  But we meet the clients at Burger Kings, at fa- any fast food place, or that restaurant, but not at their home, someplace that's a neutral zone.  And I want the students to get very comfortable with that, that, that don't be intimidated because you're going to Roxbury.  And, and we started this program in the late eighties [1980s], and it was finally funded in the early nineties [1990s].  And we have never, God bless it, never had an incident where someone's been raped, assaulted, robbed, killed, vandalized.  There have been some burglaries (laughter) of things they're leaving their car unlocked 'cause they're hard, a little hardheaded, right.  But, the safety issue's a priority for mine, and I always ask folks to make sure they go out in twos, to make sure that happens.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 175166
Speaker 1: So how was the CJI [Criminal Justice Institute, Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  How was it--you said it wasn't funded at the beginning.  How did you operate it, or--
Speaker 2: I operated as if it were funded, right.  What I mean by that: we had an office; we had materials; we were at the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]; and I brought in sta- staff with interviews, and I hired them.  And, and they would all participate in the trial advocacy workshops that I would have, have in September.  And then I was saying, you know, why have you here certain months?  Let's, I have you in a year.  And then I went to talk to the administrative dean, and she said well, you have to talk to the dean.  And I said--I went to see Robert Clark, and I said you know, these folks are here.  The salary would be low.  It was very low compared to what they could make, they wanted--their commitments to students, and it's, and he agreed to it.  He was reluctant at first, was saying, you know, we can't bring on many of your people.  And they were all tenured in the process because they were serving our students and that we, we, we had to turn people away.  Students wanted to be in the Criminal Justice Institute.  They wanted to represent clients.  But we could only have a certain number of students.  We could only have a certain number of clients, and we could only do a certain amount of work.  And we still have that--
Speaker 1: So when you--
Speaker 2: --making a difference.
Speaker 1: --say they were tenured in the process, they became tenured in this process of working?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, 'cause he was a tough cookie.
Speaker 2: Robert Clark was very clear about, you know, we can't bring anybody else on.  And I just thought differently.  I may have been wrong, but I thought differently.  And I wanted all these folks, my first four people to be permanent parts of the faculty, of the clinical faculty, and, and they made a difference.  And, and now it's, it's now done that there are four tenured clinical faculty who teach at the Criminal Justice Institute.  If one leaves or goes somewhere else, they're replaced by someone else.  And there's been no effort by the deans that followed Robert Clark to remove those folks from the office.  I think they're very important.
Story_ID: 175167
Speaker 1: So now, [HM] Charles [Ogletree], also and I've talked--you gained tenure and become a full professor [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 1993--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when you're forty-one.  Now, you had--what did that take to make happen?  Because there was also the controversy the year before with the [Harvard] Law Review journal.
Speaker 2: You know, it's, it's very interesting, what was great was that I, I didn't realize it at the time, but conservative, liberal, middle-of-the-road faculty were in my corner.  I didn't know that.  And the faculty vote was unanimous in my favor, no dissents, no, everybody, and I was very, very pleased.  My wife [Pamela Ogletree], daughter [Rashida Ogletree], son [Charles Ogletree, II], they all came.  We had a big celebration in the dean's office after that.  And it was a, a tough road to hoe.  And I think the reality is that after they looked at it and they said you know, we don't see any problems here.  We, we see what happened.  There was a review by the former dean of the law school and former president of the university, Derek Bok, and--I forget the second person, but there were two people who were reviewing it.  And they said we don't see any--
Speaker 1: You're talking about the law review journal incident.
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And just talk about--because there was--just talk about that.
Speaker 2: Right, well, there, there was a question about the thing, the article that I submitted to the law review, whether it was, something was wrong with it.  There, there's some charges of plagiarism.
Speaker 1: Of plagiarism.
Speaker 2: And, and, Robert Clark Looked at it, and everybody said we've looked at everything, and we see the original draft.  We--and thank God.  You know, you can, you can see the draft, and one of the students was trying to edit it, and edited some things out, and, and didn't put the footnotes in as they're supposed to be.  And the faculty voted unanimously to make sure that this was going through, got my tenure.  The article was published, and I published I, I would say, I would say, before and after, seven or eight pieces in the Harvard Law Review and in other journals as well.
Story_ID: 175168
Speaker 1: So that was just, it was just so that it was so close to tenure, you know--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --that this happened, that you know, I mean with really sort of a rising star--but the same thing, there had been these issues at the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] about diversity.  And, and you know, [HM] Derrick Bell, you know, having his own stand-in--I mean or, not stand-in, but, you know, he was trying to champion that, but had really ended up having an acrimonious departure when--
Speaker 2: Well, Derrick Bell was the first African American professor ever tenured at Harvard and came from another California institution in 1970.  And it was very interesting, Derrick Bell was recruited by Robert Bell [HM Robert Mack Bell] and Derek Bok.  They flew out to California and interviewed him, and he came.  And right then his passion was--you remember, Harvard in 1990 had no black women on its faculty, none, and Derrick was very concerned about that.  And Derrick says I'm gonna protest until you have some black women.   And students were in support of him, including that activist (laughter), my mentee, who became president of the United States, [HM] Barack Obama.  And then we had a press conference when he was doing it.  And it was nice to see the students were out there protesting for diversity.  I, I was joined by university professor, Cornel West, who was at Harvard then, the same thing, supporting Derrick Bell.  And it made a, a big difference.  And then Derrick left and, and went to NYU, New York University Law School [New York University School of Law, New York, New York] and taught there.  And the same thing, he says I don't want a contract.  I don't want to be a tenured professor.  I want a deal every year.  And I'll work for two years, and then I'll, the third year I'll take off.  And what happens is that he would teach for two years.  In his third year he would have produced a book, and so he would go around the country promoting his books, which were terrific books.  And I have most of them here at the house and in Cambridge [Massachusetts].  And I, and, and he made an enormous amount difference.  I met his first wife, Jewel Bell, who was a remarkable woman, very de- demanding, and, and always teasing, tease and chastise him, said, "Derrick, why do you always have to be the one?  You're in protests; you're in rallies; you're doing this."  But he was the one, and, and, and, and in fact, when he said he was leaving Harvard, I talked to my wife, Pam [Pamela Ogletree].  And I was just an assistant professor in the early nineties [1990s], has not been tenured.  I said, "Derrick, you know, I know how to try a case.  I'm a lawyer.  I will leave Harvard too."  And he says, "No, I don't want you to leave.  I want you to stay here at Harvard.  I want you to get tenure.  Don't join me."  And my wife and, and I and his wife and him, we discussed it, and he said, "Stay here; don't get involved."  I said, "But, you know, I've always been involved in things wherever they happen.  And I wanna support you.  I'll be happy to be tenured at Harvard, but, you know, I, I'm a lawyer.  I can do whatever I want to do."  And he persuaded me to stay and actually wrote his book, 'Confronting Authority,' ['Confronting Authority: Reflections of an Ardent Protester'] about this and, and about our, I thought was a confidential conversation, (laughter) but it's in his book.  Nothing's confidential with Derrick, which is fine.  But I was, I, I was prepared to go, willing to go.  And, and he made sure that I stayed at Harvard and I got tenured.  He was very happy when I got it.  I went to NYU, spoke at his program that he had every year, the lectures when he was at NYU.  I spoke when he was sick, and I was amazed with, when he had his very serious health issue.  And he was in the hospital, and so I was there teaching his class.  And would you believe in a robe and a wheelchair he wheels in, "Hey, Charles."  I said, "Professor Bell, you're supposed to be in bed.  You're, you're sick."  He says, "I wanted to hear your lecture," (laughter).  And, but, but, and, and, and it just inspired me even more.  I said here is a man putting his life on the line to make sure that it happens.  And the good news is that there's a, a bench with his name at NYU.  There's a celebration that his wife was, new wife, after Jewel died, Janet Bell, [Janet] Dewart Bell, put at NYU.  And we honor him every single year, every time that the--there's a national organization, the le- the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defense Fund.  Every time they have a big event, the Bell event is the day before or the day after it so it doesn't conflict with the thing that the LDF is having as well.  But he is great man, great hero, and will always be remembered.
Story_ID: 175169
Speaker 1: Well, you're getting--so when you got tenured, who, who else African American was tenured at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'd--[HM] Derrick [Bell] had been there.  Harry Edwards was there, who I'm gonna see in a couple of days, but he left.  He got tenured--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --before he'd came to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but he left after a short period of time there, and another African American male who was terrific, and he was international work.  I actually took a class from him and made enormous amount of difference.  Chris Edley was there before I came, and he was tenured.  And [HM] David Wilkins and I came about the same time, but we were un- under the tenth number.  I think we're the seventh.  I think I was the seventh hired, and David was the eighth or something like that.  And a couple more black men came before [HM] Lani [Guinier] came in 1998.  And then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --now we got--
Speaker 1: Lani Guinier?
Speaker 2: Lani Guinier came in 1998.  And now we've, we, we have Lani Guinier, Anete [ph.]--Annette Gordon-Reed is there.  She's splitting between Harvard Law School and other places where her legal--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --history work is admired, and also Tomiko Brown-Nagin, African American woman from University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].  She's teaching at Harvard Law School, but she's also teaching other place.  And an African American woman by the name of Intisar Rabb, R-A-B-B, very prominent lawyer and has one of the chairs for teaching Muslim rights and things like that.  And she's done an enormous amount of work.  And my mentee, who was a student of mine, Ron Sullivan [Ronald S. Sullivan Jr.], is a clinical professor, and he's running the Criminal Justice Institute now that I created.  And I'm still the emeritus, not--I said, "Why am I emeritus?"  He said, "'Cause we have to raise money."  He said, "We have to put your name on the stationery."  I said, "Oh, I see."  But he's running that, and we're, we're bringing some more people in.  It makes a big difference.
Speaker 1: So how many, how many tenured completely, because you have Kennedy too.  There's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, [HM] Randall Kennedy is--
Speaker 1: Kennedy.
Speaker 2: --tenured.  And--
Speaker 1: Wilkins, David Wilkins.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And also the young man who was the last African American clerk for Thurgood Marshall, he's on the faculty as well.  And he teaches rhetoric, among other things that I--I'm not saying he teaches rhet--the class is called rhetoric, but he uses a lot of ways to think about law in a different context.
Speaker 1: So how many are tenured now?
Speaker 2: There, I, I think there are ten.
Speaker 1: That, I mean that's really--
Speaker 2: That's a big difference--
Speaker 1: --phenomenal.
Speaker 2: --from--
Speaker 1: I mean think about Bell.  I mean that's a big--
Speaker 2: When I was a student, there were, there was always one.  Bell was there, then Bell left.  Harry Edwards was there, then Harry Edwards left.  And you know, you, you you, you, you, you couldn't get critical mass, but now there is a critical mass.  And, and [Kenneth] Ken Mack is there, a tenure, got tenured a couple of years ago.  So--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --a lot of progress.
Speaker 1: So, Charles, how does that compare to other law school faculty in, in--
Speaker 2: It, it--
Speaker 1: --the diversity realm?  That's, I'm just wondering Yale [University Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], or at Columbia [University Law School, New York, New York], or, you know, Stanford [Law School, Stanford, California] or--
Speaker 2: It's doing well compared to other schools that are in that genre.  Schools who are doing better are people, places like Georgetown [University Law Center, Washington, D.C.] and other second-tier, third-tier schools getting more women and more wem--women on their faculty, more women and more men on their faculty.  But we have more than Yale, more than Stanford, but I'm pushing Stanford, my alma mater, as an undergrad to make sure that they have more folks of color.  And, and, and they're making some progress and other schools, education school and things like that making a difference.
Speaker 1: Talk about the impact of that, you know, what impact it has either in terms of--because, you know, at--I wanna say, you know, like NBLSA [National Black Law Students Association], which you were very, you know, you used--now it's called NBLSA, but it was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --BLSA.  You know, black males are a fraction--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of, you know, the law school.
Story_ID: 175170
Speaker 1: So I'm just wondering, you know, at a time when you see this diversity occurring, you know, at, at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], what is happening with the pipeline of the students coming into the profession?  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: One, one of the sad parts of the pipeline for African Americans is that it's stuck when it comes to African American men, and that's everywhere, except Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and the colleges like Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] where we see significant numbers.  But right now, the ratio of males to females has changed from what it was in the sixties [1960s], and the seventies [1970s], and eighties [1980s], and nineties [1990s].  It was overwhelmingly male, with very few female being brought into the system; now it's just the opposite.  A significant number of females, black females, are being brought into the system as students, as researchers, as faculty, as clinical instructors.  All those things women are making a big difference.  You just can't find, and, and schools are looking but can't find black men.  And I've been twisting arms, because what happens is that we have a lot of black men who are admitted to Harvard, and they'll come.  But then they'll use that admission to then be admitted later on to a place like Yale [University Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] to go to school and because they, they get the sense that oh, Yale is different.  There's no, no grading the first semester and smaller classes.  And so all these things that a young person's saying: oh, those things are great; I wanna try it; I, I wanna make a difference.  And we're losing them because of that.  And, and, and the people who are coming from Yale are making a clear difference.  [HM Randall] Randy Kennedy went to Yale Law School, and he's teaching at Harvard.  He says, you know, Yale was interesting, but I'm glad that I'm at--Harvard's made a huge difference in my life.  I'm doing what I wanna do.  I can teach what I wanna teach, and the colleagues are very helpful.  I'm publishing books.  And Randy's always publishing a new book, and they have been incredibly helpful, things like that.
Speaker 1: But this trend, so this is a trend related to Harvard Law School you're saying.
Speaker 2: It's a trend that is related around the country when it comes to black males and graduate schools.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We just don't see significant numbers; they're disappearing.  And that--I, I teach a course about that, in the sense about the cities, about where are the black men?  You know, where have they gone?  They're not going to college.  They're not going to graduate school, business, law, engineering, you know, education.  Think of all the fields that they were in before.  They're short-lived now.
Story_ID: 175171
Speaker 1: So now I wanna, I wanna go through some of your publications and some of your tri- you know other trials.  So, the Rodney King, you know, you co-authored the Rodney King story.  And I want to ask you, you know, if this was another, I mean extremely high-profile case that had a lot of emotion around it.  And this, this will tend to be the, the trend in your career, you know, where there is going, you know, forward.  But can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I didn't know Rodney King.  And I talked to all of my members of the Criminal Justice Institute [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] about whether or not they wanted to be involved in that because I saw the case, and what really impressed me was George H. W. Bush saying what happened to this young man shouldn't happen to anybody.  And we need to go out and--I don't know if you people remember, but [HM] Wayne Budd, African American male, was one of the people that George H. W. Bush sent out to Los Angeles [California] to, in a sense, to figure out what was going on.  And people were upset about what happened.  And what's interesting is that a lot of people don't know this, and this is in the book that we wrote, 'Beyond the Rodney King Story' ['Beyond the Rodney King Story: An Investigation of Police Conduct in Minority Communities'].  A lot of people were focused on Rodney King, and people thought they were protesting, burning and rioting because of Rodney King.  Rodney King was part of it, but the impetus was a black woman who had been shot and killed at a Korean grocery story.  Her name was Latasha Harlins.  That happened just before.  And then the mayor of Los Angeles said, "Calm down, we're taking care of this, it's gonna be fine."  But the, the, when Latasha Harlins was shot and killed by this Korean woman at the little grocery store, the Korean woman was convicted and of manslaughter.  But the white woman judge gave her probation, no time in jail, and so people were brimming, and all that happened.  And if you look at, it's all in the book if you look in the book, but look at Los Angeles.  What happened is that the black owners, the people were angry, and they're saying black-owned, black-owned, right.  And so, you know, don't go into this store; don't burglarize this store; don't steal from this store, and they didn't.  People just kept moving, and they were just targeting Korean grocers, and, and people didn't realize that was the story.  It wasn't just Rodney King.  He was the impetus, but it was because Latasha Harlins had been killed earlier, and that made a big difference.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did you learn about that case, I mean with these high-profile cases like that?  That's what I'm--you know 'cause he ended up--I mean then there's the, his trial, but then there's the aftermath of Rodney King as a--
Speaker 2: It, it made a big difference because it said that we're not only a local organization or a state organization, we're a national organization, and our reach has to be broad.  And people bought the book, 'Beyond the Rodney King Story.'  People were finding out what happened.  They had perspectives that they didn't know about before.  And this was a piece that I thought that we had to say and had to make sure that people understood it.
Story_ID: 175172
Speaker 1: But this also drew a lot more attention to police brutality.
Speaker 2: It, it, what happened is that--
Speaker 1: I mean this is sort of the--
Speaker 2: --the police--we started following the issue of tasers, of chokeholds, and that's when I had the, the real introduction to and met Johnnie Cochran, 'cause he was the chokehold expert in California.  And he was in a sense making sure that people were fairly treated, and he had case after case after case.  And the police had just got a routine of using chokeholds in California as if it was the way to, in a sense, disable black men, but they were killing black men.  And we were able to make sure that there was attention drawn to this and the, the fact that this person was photogra--a photographer [George Holliday] was actually taping when Rodney King was tased by these police officers.  That made a big difference.  Now and the problem was that if you look at the film, people were outraged.  And that's why President George [H.] W. Bush was outraged and wanted to make sure it was done.  But the, the police officers had, I think, outstanding criminal lawyers, right, and they knew exactly what they were doing.  And we were looking at--and you heard the (unclear) talk about all the times that Rodney King was tased and beaten, and you can count the strikes against him.  But the police lawyers, defense lawyers, slowed down the videotape, and they said here is the first one.  And you see Rodney King getting up, okay.  And, and boom, you see the second one.  You see Rodney King getting up.  He's a big man, a black man.  He's over two hundred pounds.  He's over 6'0" tall.  They had all these things about, you know, we were trying to defend ourselves, and he kept moving.  And the reality is that Rodney King was, the whole idea was--he said it was, it was like, oh, you just stung me and, and rallied.  All those police officers were acquitted and found not guilty because the lawyers did a, a very good job.  And Rodney King became, in a sense, the symbol of what was going on.  And they were acquitted in that sense, but he did ultimately win a, a judgment.  And then all of us were shocked and surprised that he drowned in a swimming pool and passed away.  But he said the words that we still embrace whenever we think about stopping the riots.  It's, he, he was, after being tased by the police officers and a victim of all these things, he said, "Please stop the riot," during the riot, and says, "Can't we all get along?"  "Can't we all get along," those were his words.  He didn't say much, but he said enough to let people know that he was very concerned about what was going on, and that, that made all the difference in the world.
Speaker 1: Well, it helped sort of quell--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --all the furor--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which sort of got out of control.
Story_ID: 175173
Speaker 1: I wanna ask about the Tupac Shakur--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --trial.  How did that, how did that come your way, and, and is this a case, [HM] Charles [Ogletree], that people are starting to immediately reach out to you?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's, it's interesting, people started reaching out to me then and after the Anita Hill, which happened in '91 [1991].  And I remember, and the reason, I, I didn't realize it until later, Barbara Walters knew that I represented Anita Hill.  And somehow she had some contact with Desiree Washington, who was raped [by Mike Tyson], and I, and I say that, and I was on the other side.  Here I am defending a woman, when I'm normally defending someone who's charged with raping somebody.  And this was a classic case because Barbara Walters told her, you know, this, this is the guy who represented Anita Hill.  You should go see him.  And so she was in Rhode Island, and she came to my office.  And young, naive, you know, had no idea what was going on.  She walked into the office, and she said, "Oh, my God!"  I said, "What?"  She says, "You're black."  (Laughter) And she had no idea who I was.  She just, Barbara Walters had, you know, said this great lawyer from Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He has the experience as a lawyer.  You should hire him.  And she was very honest, said you're black, and she had no--Charles Ogletree, the name didn't register.  And she wasn't reading the press, and she wasn't, you know, involved with the New York Times or The Washington Post or The Wall Street Journal or, or any, any of the television.  So, it was, it was, it was in a sense funny, but she was very honest with what she was able to do.  And because of that, we were able to get a resolution that turned out to be extremely helpful to her, changed her career and changed people's perception of her.  She moved back to California.  She's moved away.  She's married now.  She has a family, and she's been, been able to put this whole thing behind her.  I think that's very, very important.  With Tupac, I got the call from a, a brother in New York [New York] who said you know, "Can you help Tupac Shakur?"  I said, "I, I have his album; I, I listen to his music."  He said, "No, no, no, can you help him?"  And he was in jail then, and I went to New York to see him several times.  And every time he would come out a little bit later and I'd say, "What were you doing?"  He says, "Oh, I was just writing."  I said, "Oh, writing letters to your,"--"No, writing lyrics."  He wrote all the lyrics of all these songs in jail.  And when he came out, got him released, he wrote it had to--he produced after--well, I'll, I'll get that--he had about ten albums ready to go soon as he came out of prison.  And what was interesting is that I remember his twenty-fifth birthday, and I gave him a Harvard Law School sweatshirt.  And I said, "Tupac, you can wear this, and you're gonna be a legend."  And he says, "I know.  I'm giving up the gangs, and I'm having all this issue with Biggie Smalls.  And I'm gonna--Biggie Small.  And Biggie's from the East Coast; I'm West Coast, and I'm, what I'm gonna do is have a big competition with him.  And so I'm gonna, we're gonna, and whosever album wins, you know, the music wins, they will own the United States."  And so--
Speaker 1: So, he's telling--
Speaker 2: --that was the plan.
Speaker 1: --you this?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was his plan, right.  And then he goes to Las Vegas [Nevada] and some folks jump him.  Now, here's the problem with Tupac: Tupac had this problem with, he wanted to be a gangster, but he wasn't a gangster.  He didn't carry a gun.  He wasn't killing people and all that.  And it was hard to make that clear to him, right, that you can talk about gangster, but people think because of your lyrics that you are a gangster.  And so, some folks were jumping on him at a casino in, in Las Vegas.  He was fighting back, and then he was riding in a car as a passenger.  And they pulled up, shot, and killed him.  Well, he was in, in a coma for a long time, in a hospital for a long time.  I got a call.  I was in class, and one of my students who was a Tupac fan said, "Professor, I hate to tell you this, but Tupac Shakur is just, just shot and he's in a coma.  They think he's gonna die."  And he was in, in the hospital for a number of weeks but then passed away.
Story_ID: 175025
Speaker 1: So, I wanted to ask about your relationship with Alan Dershowitz.  And I was just thinking, you know, 'cause a lot of the, the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] faculty are very, very talented.  But there are a much smaller number that are high-profile in the, you know, in the larger community.  So, Alan Dershowitz had been that person really that I--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --could think of in the, you know, in the law school.  And you know, in a more traditional way, you know, and you talked about him earlier, was Archibald Cox, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'cause he had that huge visibility.  But here, here's Charles Ogletree, and I'm just wondering what was the relationship?
Speaker 2: Well, it's very interesting.  My relationship with faculty has been great.  I remember Archibald Cox when he was a senior faculty member at Harvard Law School and having discussions with him.  I remember him when I was a student and he was still teaching at Harvard Law School.  And I remember he was gonna argue the Bakke [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978] case.  And I went to see him for the first time when all of the senior faculty were in the stacks in Langdell [Hall].  And I went to see him and I said, "Professor Cox, my name is Charles Ogletree.  I'm a second-year law student.  I haven't taken any of your courses.  I've heard about the courses.  You're teaching con [constitutional] law and labor, and, and everybody's impressed.  But I wanted talk to you about the argument that you're gonna have before the [U.S.] Supreme Court in a week."  He says, "Oh, the Bakke case?"  "Yes, I wanna give you some idea"--
Speaker 1: Charlie, I'm gonna stop this, because you've talked about that already.
Speaker 2: Okay I--
Speaker 1: Let, let, let's talk about--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Dershowitz--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I talked about--and he was a great colleague.  Alan was someone who lived in what's called the secure unit on the fifth floor of Harvard Law School at the new building.  And I joined him in the Hauser, H-A-U-S-E-R, Hauser Hall.  And his office was right across from mine.  I'm on the left side when you walk in, and he's on the right side.  And you have to be buzzed in to get in because of all the threats he would get.  And I said I don't mind occupying an office there.  And the difference between our offices is that my office, I may have pictures inside of family and clients and events.  And his office he'd have clippings of newspaper, hate letters and things like that.  And I'm saying whoa.  And, and, and he still puts them up, and it's interesting.  Alan retired after teaching at Harvard Law School for fifty years, from 1963 to 2013.  And it's a legacy.  And we've, we've had exchanges but always friendly exchanges.  'Cause remember, I represented Desiree Washington when he was the lawyer, he was going to be the lawyer for Mike Tyson, right.  And I, I was so impressed, and I had no house on the [Martha's] Vineyard [Massachusetts] then.  And I said, "Alan, do you mind if I stayed in your house?"  He says, "Well, all my papers are there.  As long as you don't look at them, that's fine; you can come to my house."  And I stayed at his house, and I didn't look at his papers.  And we had a conversation.  He came back, and we had a conversation a year ago.  He said, "Yeah, yeah, I looked at the camera, and you, you didn't take anything," joking, but it was very friend, very friendly.  But we've been on opposite sides, but we've always been close friends in, in a, in a big way and in a sense that he's come to my lectures; I've gone to his lectures.  He's--we're both on the panel lecturing here at the Vineyard in a week.  And that's part of who he is and part of who I am, and we've been I would say the closest of friends ev- ever since I first met him.  And his daughter was actually a student--not his daughter--his niece, Rana Dershowitz was in a class that I taught a long time ago, many years ago.  And she works now for the, the Olympics [United States Olympic Committee], and she's based in Colorado.  But Rana Dershowitz and I had lunch three months ago, and that is a way that I, I get a chance to stay with his family, talk with his family.  I see him all the time out on the Vineyard when I'm here.  He comes to my programs; I, I come to his.  And he's still controversial 'cause he's a big believer in the First Amendment beyond the, what would most people.  And he's a big defender of Israel.  So we'll have some short discussions I think about the bombing in Israel and the Gaza Strip now.  And the thing about it is that people want him--he has a big following--and want me, 'cause I have a big following, to make sure that we engage in a respectful way.  We may disagree, but we're not disagreeable.  And so, whether it's we go to the sports events together; we'll go to lunch together; we'll have conversations together, but he's a great man.  And I think that even though he's retired from teaching--he's only seventy-five; he could still do an enormous amount of things--make a big difference.

Speaker 1: [HM] Charles [Ogletree], what about your work on reparations?  Can you talk about why you took the charge, you know, with that?  And, and, and that sort of--well, there's--yeah, let's talk about reparations, and I wanna talk about the Tulsa Race Riots too.
Speaker 2: One of the interesting things about reparations is that people were surprised, said why is he getting involved in it?  Well, I've always believed in it.  I've always believed that we are treated differently as a people.  And our ancestors expected, they made this made this great country.  They built the White House; they built the Washington Monument; the Lincoln Memorial.  All these things were built by the hands of enslaved Africans, and I think that makes a big difference.  And the whole issue was that both here in Massachusetts but also by others, we're pushing for something to make sure it happened.  And the crystallization was in 1988, I think it was, when the, the Civil Liberties Act was passed by [U.S.] Congress to make sure that the Japanese Americans on the West Coast would get reparations, if they were still alive, for their interment in, in, in camps during the Second World War [World War Two, WWII].  And I thought that made a lot of sense.  And my point was, that's good.  And then [HM] John Conyers [Jr.] in Congress introduced HR40, it's House Resolution 40, and that had a lot to do with reparations, saying that--and all he wanted to do when he introduced this was not give blacks reparations but study it.  And he has had no support of substantial numbers either from African Americans who were in the House of Representatives or whites or women, black or white, in, in the Congress.  And, but he's, every year he introduces the bill, HR40.  It made a big difference.  And we were talking about this, and I was on the board.  Randall Robinson's the TransAfrica, and we were talking about the reparations.
Speaker 1: And Randall had written a book, 'The Debt' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And Randall had written a book, right, 'The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks,' right.  And, and I have that book, right.  And we were having a press conference and have--selling the book.  He says, "Well, you know, we need to move for reparations.  I believe in it.  And we're gonna make sure we're gonna have this reparations go forward."  I said, "Well, who's gonna lead it?"  He says, "Professor Ogletree."  I'm looking, I'm saying what?  (Laughter) That's the first time I'd heard that.  He hadn't consulted with me.  He hadn't asked me about that, but that was a big issue.  And so I was chosen as the person to do it, and I'm happy to do it, and I've been pushing it.  And I, I've been giving public addresses too, said there are--we have the same problem right now in 2014 that we had when we talked about the, the slaves coming over: black men can't find work.  They wanna work; they're able to work; they're committed to work, and they can't find jobs.  And, and people are walking around.  It's not just kids either.  I respect the fact that [HM] President [Barack] Obama pushed My Brother's Keeper, and I was hoping that he would have My Sister's Keeper as well, make sure that our daughters have the same point of view.  And then I was at an event this year with [HM] Reverend Al Sharpton in New York.  And a forty-six year-old African American male said, "I appreciate My Brother's Keeper.  I think that's great.  I think it's important to help the young black and brown boys."  He says, "But I'm, I wanna work.  I haven't been in trouble.  I haven't committed any crimes.  I've been looking for work, and I can't get hired anyway."  And that just stuck me that, you know, we have to make sure that we are giving opportunities for all these folks who are deprived of 'em.  In my own sense, I've said this over and over and over again, I said I'm not looking for reparations.  I'm middle class or higher.  I've done well.  My wife's [Pamela Ogletree] done well.  My kids [Rashida Ogletree and Charles Ogletree, II] who are grown have done well.  My grandkids, they have a house.  They're in good schools.  They get a meal three times a day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  They're learning to be smart and gifted.  And, and so I'm not asking for them for myself, but I--and I, I'm also not asking the traditional idea that every African American who's a descendant of slaves should get a check.  I think that's a, not a meaningful way to do it.  And so my proposal, and it's only my proposal--I'm not saying that I'm the leader of this, but people can decide what they wanna do--that we should make sure that money is spent in terms of health, in terms of jobs, in terms of education--when I say health, I also mean mental health--in terms of public safety.  We should have a lot of money committed.  And so, people who are poor who are looking for work, who are trying to get in schools and can't, who are stuck in the ghettos and not able to get to the suburbs, they should have the opportunity to do what others have had the opportunity to do.  And I come from a very poor family, a family had nothing when I was a young kid.  And my grandfather [Willie Reed] taught me everything I know today, right, how to be resourceful and how to make sure you do for yourself.  And so, so that's why I'm a big fan of reparations.  It's, it's, it's important, and I think it should--
Speaker 1: So do you--
Speaker 2: --happen.
Story_ID: 175027
Speaker 1: Because when, actually when we did your last, when we sat down with you last, you were very much on the speaker's circuit about reparations, and then that sort of lulled.  Now, it's--now we start seeing it again, not that it has--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --completely gone away.  But it's starting to be talked up just, you know, re- really, within the last year again.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think it's, it's talked up because now reparations are happening around the country.  A lot of the Africans, descendants from Africans in the Caribbean area in--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You mean around the world?
Speaker 2: Around--I was gonna say in Africa--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and in Europe and other places they're making a lot of more noise, and they're getting reparations, which I think is great.  And we're getting much more attention to it.  And I can't think of a year that I don't go to Washington [D.C.], and I'm [HM] John Conyers' appointment for the Congressional Black Caucus.  I'll be there again in September, and reparations is always on the agenda.  And so we talk about it, and everywhere I go people--I get a call from a young man from Los Angeles [California] who rides around in a truck, talks about reparations, Mr. [John] Peoples.  And he is very much dedicated to it. And they see me as the face of it.  And I said don't let this suit and tie fool you because I'm just as committed in 2014 as I was in 1980 and 1990 and going forward.
Story_ID: 175028
Speaker 1: Now, [HM] Charles [Ogletree], what about when you wrote your, your, in 'All Deliberate Speed' ['All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half-Century of Brown v. Board of Education']?  You know, that was both autobiographical but the, you know, a reflection of Brown vs. Board of Education [of Topeka, 1954] and you being an affirmative, you know, being the beneficiary of affirmative action and Brown.
Speaker 2: It was very interesting, this book was not the book that I had sent to my publisher.  The book that I sent to my publisher was about being a public defender.  And, and the, and the, and the guy said, my agent said you know, this is 2003, and what you've written is great, and I'd love to have it published.  But you know what, next year is gonna be the fiftieth anniversary of Brown, from 1954 to 2004.  Write a book.  And he had no say in terms of what the title was gonna be, what the content was gonna be.  I said well, you know what, you can write all these books and, and they'll have an interesting perspective.  But I'm gonna write about it how "all deliberate speed," what that means and what it meant with the [U.S.] Supreme Court in Brown.  It meant no speed at all, and that was something that Thurgood Marshall didn't know.  He had to be educated by his secretary, who understood what it meant, all deliberate speed.  And then I talked about, you know, I, I, I had never thought about race the way I said you know, it's very interesting.  I was living in the south side of Merced [California], and I had, and I rec- recognized that going to the north side and what that meant.  And we went to some of, me and some of the other African American boys, then teenagers, we just went to a church which had all these white Catholics.  I know they were shocked to see us, but they was on the north side.  Nothing, nothing was on the south side except liquor stores and places to buy cigarettes and one little supermarket, right.  Everything's on the south--the north side of Merced, and nothing's on the south side.  So, we went there, and I--they were obviously in shock to see these well-dressed black boys coming to their church and worshipping.  But our point was that, you know, the church should be open to everybody.  And, and the point I made, and it's in the book, is that the church is one of the most segregated places in the nation.  You know, people separate every Sunday, even though they may see you the rest of the week.  And that's what the book was about.  And, and it talked about Stanford [University, Stanford, California]; it talked about Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Because at Stanford we had the whole issues with race; at Harvard, it was right in the middle of the busing boycott, when I was there; '74, [1974], '75 [1975], '76, [1976] were the years of the boy--busing boycott.  And, and I saw whites who were complaining about the fact that blacks were on buses, being, integrating the white schools.  They were throwing rocks and all sorts of challenges.  And I, I, I, I, I'm pretty sure that, in my own sense, I probably made a mistake in that book, because I was focusing on poor whites who lived in South Boston [Massachusetts] and other places.  And I was thinking about, you know, I should have talked about the whites who were sending their kids to suburban schools, because they are the ones who are trying to get away from the community.  And I thought that would make a big difference.  So, and now, I know there are friends of mine who are judges, black judges, and they, they have courts in South Boston and other places, and they have no difficulty; everybody is happy to see them there.
Speaker 1: Well, you're talking about the paramount change that has happened--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --in Boston in that time since the, the controversy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Since--
Speaker 1: --of busing.
Speaker 2: --yes, yeah, since--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) controversy.
Speaker 2: --'74 [1974], '75 [1975], yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but the thing that I think also that's significant about the book, 'cause there've been a lot of discussions about Brown then, there's, what, what is significant about your book is that, you know, at a time, and this is like mid-2000s when the book comes, comes out--
Speaker 2: 2004, yep.
Speaker 1: --there are people, African Americans, that are not necessarily acknowledging that they, that they're a beneficiary of affirmative action, and there's a, a backlash against, you know, affirmative action--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because the, the Michigan case [Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003] was, was--
Speaker 2: Two thousand three [2003].
Speaker 1: Three, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so this is all, you know, happening.  There's a, a different thing, so you at least stand up to say, you know, that this, this is what has, you know, I'm the beneficiary of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And, and it's not and just me alone--
Story_ID: 175029
Speaker 1: It's very interesting because I said we're all beneficiaries.  It doesn't mean that you're unqualified, but I know that there are people--there was no one that I knew that was black that was from Merced [California] that had gone to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], no one, right.  And it was great that someone came after me, but the whole idea was that it just wasn't possible.  And you had to say I'm a beneficiary of affirmative action, make sure that happens.  Now, and I got into problems and arguments with my classmates who said, "What you mean? I'm, I'm, I'm not an affirmative action baby.  No, no, no, that's not me."  I said, "Well, I am.  I have no problem with that."  And, and we were having a debate, I said me and Earl [ph.] and other people, we're all affirmative action babies; we grew up with affirmative action.  He said, "No, I'm not, I'm not, I"--and Earl got in the same way I got in, and you have to perform well to make sure that's gonna happen.  And that's why I'm teaching there now, because people were very respectful of what I had to say, what I had to write, what I had to do.  And, and I think that I, I will always say and will always believe that I'm an affirmative action baby, that is that, you know, you have to keep the door open to get, for me to get in.  But, my philosophy that I've said in every talk I give is that now, when you go through the door, leave the door open so someone can follow you.  And that's happened; I've had generations of students who have followed as teachers, as business folks, as lawyers, as public interest.  I just met a woman here on the [Martha's] Vineyard [Massachusetts], Lacey Schwartz, who was a student of mine decades ago.  And she was here, and gave me her card, and she says, "I want you to see my movie."  I said, "What about your--you're, I said you're lawyer?"  She said, "Yeah, professor I pay my dues; I'm admitted to the bar; I make sure that my license is active," she says.  "But I love movies," and she has one of the movies in the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival.  And she said, "I want you to see it."  And it is a terrific movie.  And she says that's--
Speaker 2: This is--
Speaker 1: --what I wanna do.
Speaker 2: --this is the film festival that you're--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Going on right now, right, going on right, just, just finished, right.  And she has her film here, and they'll take a look at it.  And I'm gonna get a set of all the movies I didn't get a chance to watch.  But that's the whole idea, to make sure that the next generation--she, remembered; she says, "You've taught me so much when I was in law school, and you taught me to be different.  And that's why I went into film working, and that's why I'm the producer; that's--I have my own company now."  And she is very impressive, and I remember her as a law student, how great she was then, and how great she is now.
Story_ID: 175030
Speaker 1: Can we talk about the, the start of the Charles Hamilton Institute [Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race & Justice, Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Because this was--
Speaker 2: Charles Hamilton Houston--
Speaker 1: Houston, sorry--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Institute.  Everybody stops--
Speaker 1: I'm--why did I do that?
Speaker 2: No, no, there--
Speaker 1: I know that.
Speaker 2: --there are thousand people who say the Charles--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Hamilton Institute.
Speaker 1: Right, no, no--
Speaker 2: There is a Charles Hamilton, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, Charles Hamilton Houston Institute.  So, this became really a passion project for you.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And can you talk about that, because you even said at one point you didn't know who Charles Hamilton--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Houston was?  You know, and so can you talk about he and his significance and what you wanted the institute to, to be?  Now, when you start this, have you left as J--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --I'm still, still--
Speaker 1: So you're still the--
Speaker 2: --founder and executive director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I started the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute in October 2005.  And we're gonna have our tenth anniversary celebration in Washington [D.C.] October 9, 2014, honoring, who else?  The attorney general, [HM] Eric Holder, and another person who is a Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate and a Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] graduate, Alan Haymon.  We're gonna give two awards.  And Alan has been supporting me at the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute.  Every single year he gives me seventy thousand dollars.  Why?  I don't know, not fifty, not seventy-five, not twenty-five, but seventy thousand dollars every year.  And he hates the publicity, and, and he doesn't wanna be recognized, right.  He's given me over half a million dollars in the ten years.
Speaker 1: That's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's very, very impressive.
Speaker 1: That's very impressive.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and--
Speaker 1: And, and for people who don't know--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --you should give a little--I could give--
Speaker 2: I was gonna say Alan Haymon, everybody knows him.  They think they know him.  They think he's eighty-five years old.  'Cause Adam--Alan started these concerts in Boston [Massachusetts], right, when he was in college.  And he started this idea of entertainment when he was still going to high school in Cleveland [Ohio].  He's from Cleveland, Ohio, and he came to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And he knew [HM] David Wilkins, you know, a lot of folks who were doing the nay--knew David Wilkins because of the Harvard College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  They were at the college about the same time.  And he has been an, an entertainer.  Now he loves boxing, and so he has had some of the top boxers in the nation.  And I'm going out to a fight that one of his boxers, Floyd Mayweather, Jr., is giving in September.  And Floyd has won over sixty bouts, undefeated.  And, and so, Alan is a business guy, and he understands, understood it.  And I remember when we started, I, I was very close to Don King 'cause Don King represented Mike Tyson and other folks, and he'd always invite me to fights.  And he's sort of almost disappeared.  He's of much lesser significance.  But, Alan has been terrific.  And, and Alan doesn't give interviews; he doesn't give any kind of contacts, but he's a smart, very successful, very powerful African American.  And he's done an enormous amount of work to building up the community, and I think he's going to go even further.  He's worked with Showtime; he's worked with HBO [Home Box Office], and he's always negotiating for fighters, for television, for what, wherever the show is gonna be, for all the assets, that make, make a big difference.  And he has a, he has had a number of champions, and now he has over one hundred fighters in his corner.  And that's, that's sort of what he's transitioning to.  He's still--
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was the--
Speaker 2: --doing entertainment.
Speaker 1: --largest, largest con- one of the largest con, concert promoters.  It was Alan Haymon Productions.
Speaker 2: It's, he still is.  And I'm--that's why people think that--people who weren't even born when he started think that he must be an old man.  And, and Alan is younger than I am; he's in his, in his late fifties.  But he's very effective and I think he's making, making a big difference in terms of what's gonna happen--
Story_ID: 175031
Speaker 1: So the institute [Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race & Justice, Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so why was it the passion to do the institute?
Speaker 2: You know, one of the things was that I didn't know a lot about Charles Hamilton Houston.  I had heard his name because his name was mentioned by who else?  Thurgood Marshall, and I'd met Thurgood Marshall.  My wife [Pamela Ogletree] and I went to see him in 1993, after he retired from the [U.S.] Supreme Court in 1991.  And he was talking about Charlie Houston and talking about Charlie Houston taking him on all these cases.  And what made a big difference was he told me that, part of what I knew, but he, he finished my sentences.  Because I knew that he grew up in Baltimore [Maryland].  My wife's in Baltimore.  I, I knew that Marilyn [ph.] was his, his, very much tied to it.  I knew he'd gone to Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], and I knew that he'd gone with [HM] Oliver Hill.  And, and they were very clear: Thurgood Marshall was number one, and Oliver Hill was number two in the class, top, top people.  I think it was an all-black male school then.  And they were phenomenal.  And, and, and I'll, I'll tell you about this case in a minute.  But what was interesting is that Oliver Hill I, I had come to speak at Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I went down to Virginia to speak in Virginia where he was.  And he took me to see the governor when we were talking to try to avoid an execution in Virginia.  And he always said, all the times, he says: Thurgood Marshall was number one; I was number two; we were both, we were both frat [fraternity] boys; he was in this fraternity; I was in a different fraternity; we were all, always competitive--always talking about that.  And then Thurgood Marshall died in 1991, and Oliver Hill was born in 1907 and lived a hundred, to be a hundred years old in 2007.  And in 2000, when I had him come, he said yeah, Thurgood Marshall and I were top students at Harvard.  I can't remember--I mean Howard--I can't remember whether he was first, I was first, and one of us was second.  I think it was him.  So he changed the whole story 'cause Thurgood Marshall was dead.  I thought that, that was cute.  But who's gonna challenge a hundred-year-old guy who's saying that I was number one in my class?  But he, he was very much active.  And Thurgood Marshall told me how much he was influenced by Charles Hamilton Houston.  He was their teacher, and he wasn't credited with that because, even though it was a black school, the leadership outside the school was white.  And they wanted to make sure that they were taught differently.  And so Charles Hamilton Houston was the one, the first one to say the lawyer is either a social engineer or a parasite.  You have to choose.  And so, he took Thurgood Marshall to Virginia on trials.  And they went to integrate the University of Maryland [School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland] as lawyers.  Charles Hamilton Houston was the lead lawyer.  Thurgood was his assistant, and they were able to integrate the school for the first time to have a black student there because of the lawsuit they brought.  And I always say I don't know what Thurgood Marshall said.  It was something like--to the people of Maryland: How you like me now?  Right, in a sense he was making things happen.  And he remembers that case.  And he, he was talking about all of his cases and how Charlie Houston had a big impact on it.  And most people know about Thurgood Marshall.  Nobody knows about Charles Hamilton Houston, right.  And Charles Hamilton Houston was born in 1895, the same day the W--same year that W.E.B. Du Bois became the first African American graduate of Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], in 1895.  And it was very important that his legacy continue.  And, and I--and he had, he, he was only fifty-four years old, born in 1895, died in 1950.
Story_ID: 175032
Speaker 1: I met his [Charles Hamilton Houston] son, who I've had here, Charles Hamilton Houston, II, a wonderful man.  But I learned a lot from him, and I said I wanna make sure that his legacy is continued.  So I got Dean Robert Clark and Houston's daughter and his son to come to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and to have a portrait of him made.  And now if you go into the Harvard Law School Library, there's a photograph in the corner on the first floor where the student area is of Charles Hamilton Houston.  And there's a plaque there explaining when he went to Harvard, et cetera.  And he was on the Harvard Law Review in the 1920s, right.  And what, why did he do that, and what inspired me?  Houston had no interest in law until he was going to the First World War [World War One, WWI].  He had already, was an honors graduate from Amherst [College, Amherst, Massachusetts] and ready to go.  And the white office--the white soldiers didn't respect the fact that he was their commander because he had, already had achieved it.  And he says I'm gonna get me a law degree.  And he came to Harvard and, and was the first African American on the law review, did an incredible job there.  And you can't tell because his complexion was so light, he looks like the other white guys, but he was the black guy.  And he had that same influence, and he took his skills back to Washington [D.C.] and back to Howard [University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and taught people like Thurgood Marshall, [HM] Oliver Hill--
Speaker 2: And he raised the standards (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, exactly--
Speaker 2: --of Howard.
Speaker 1: --in a lot of ways.  First of all, he required--he wanted to make sure it was an accredited law school, number one; and number two, he didn't, didn't hesitate to flunk somebody who wasn't prepared; and number three, he wanted to inter- integrate learning law and practicing law, make sure that people understood.  That's why Thurgood Marshall went to Virginia with him, and they couldn't stay in hotels back in the 1930s and went to Maryland with him, to integrate the schools.  That's the kind of person he was, very impressive, and I wanna continue that legacy.  And people said, and they always say Charles Hamilton, or in New York [New York] they say Charles Hamilton Houston [how-ston].  There's a Houston Street.  I said no, it's Houston, Houston.  And so that's made a big difference.  And every way that I can, I try to make sure that we remember him and praise him (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Really, in many ways the Brown [vs. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decis- the Brown, the work on Brown was his dream.
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.
Speaker 2: It was, and people don't even understand that they associate Thurgood Marshall.
Speaker 1: Well, what's great with it is that he started this dream in the 1930s, the whole idea of integration, the thirties [1930s], forties [1940s], and fifties [1950s], even though he died in early, died in 1950.  And Char--and Thurgood Marshall said all of these lawyers wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Charlie Houston.  And he, he explains how he trained them to be great advocates of court, trained them about the law.  And they knew the law A thru Z but trained them how to be advocates of the law, and that was very important.
Story_ID: 179551
Speaker 1: So, I want to ask you about your role with the Obamas--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and first as, you know, when you first met them individually, okay.
Speaker 2: I, I first met Michelle [Obama] 'cause she started at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] the year after I started.  I started teaching in 1984.  I'd been there before teaching in trial advocacy workshop after I graduated.  But I was full time in 1984, and she started in '85 [1985].  She was the--and she graduated in 1988, three years.  You start the fall of the first year, and then you finish the spring of the--summer of the fourth year.  But I met her first, and she was the most talented and gifted woman that I had seen at Harvard Law School.  I was convinced then that if it's anyone ever gonna be elected to the United States Senate, who is a black woman, it's Michelle Obama.  She was slick, smart, well-dressed, and she was very active in the Har- Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, representing poor women, usually black women.  And she would get them two things--a number of things, but two things in particular: made sure that they would get the benefits that they were entitled to, to make sure that the--public assistance.  And she, would go, go to court and make sure that, that, you know, this is a woman with three children.  She's raising them by herself; she's trying to feed them; she's trying to school them, you know, make sure that money happened.  That made a big difference.  And, and it's interesting that the judges were saying well, you know, Ms. Robinson--that was her name, Michelle Robinson--you, you look very nice today.  She'd say I, I know, but I want you to talk to my client, Your Honor.  My client wants to make sure that she's able to get the tenant rights.  And she's entitled to be in this public housing.  She has three kids or four kids, and she's by herself, and et cetera.  And the landlord's asking for money.   She doesn't have any money.  I want her to get back into public housing.  And, and that was--(unclear)--and, and people who know her at the Legal Aid Bureau made a, appreciate that, and they tried to invite her to come to their hundredth anniversary.  She couldn't come, but she wrote an outstanding piece about her time there and how important it was, the celebration.  And, and I, like I said I, I, I, I had nothing but great dreams for her, that she was gonna be incredibly successful, and I still think she's gonna to do that.  We had a little bit of a problem when--I was a senior advisor when [HM] President [Barack] Obama was running for office in 2008.  And you remember she said this: this is the first time I felt proud to be an American.  And she said something close to that; it wasn't exactly the same.  But her point was that all of us have said you know, this is, this is, this vindicates my commitment to whatever it, it is.  But people turned it around, and the conservatives came after her in a big way.  And so we said Michelle, just chill for a minute.  And we were pushing Barack Obama as the president, and of course, our strategy with him, and I'll come back to it, was that we need to focus on three states.  And we had to make sure that he gets Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, two out of the three, because Hillary Clinton was known because Bill Clinton had been president, and she was in a sense the First Lady and, and very powerful, very active.  She made it possible for him to become governor; she made it possible for him to become president; and I think that she'll be elected in 2016, no question about that.  But that's Michelle, in terms of how great she was, and she, when she came back she played a big role.  And women just loved her, and they still love her.  One of the most popular women not in the United States but in the world, that's how great she is, right.  And she's always had a passion for children, exercise, health; all those things are important.  And her, this Let's Move organization is very great.  And she's the one, if you see her on 'Jimmy Kimmel [Live]' on any of those shows, she's doing the dance steps; she's in an outfit; she's working out; she's always very good, and I like that.  And, and, and she's a big wo- when I say big, she's large compare- she's not a petite woman.  She's a large woman.  She carries it extremely well.  She's not at all ambivalent about it.  And I have to tell you that there's only one other woman who I have this sort of engagement with.  And like Michelle, every time I see Michelle, she say oh, professor, and she'll grab me and squeeze me.  And I say oh, why is this big woman squeezing me, picking me up?  And she's taller and, and stronger, and healthy, but she really likes it.  She's, she's that way with everybody, hugging and embracing.  And she's very much wants to be active.  She's very an ex- extrovert, no question about that.  And, and there's books about her.  I hope she'll write her own when they're out of the White House.  But she's very much concerned about their two girls [Sasha Obama and Malia Obama] and wants them grow up without all the pressure.  They're in schools in Washington, D.C.  They wanna stay in Washington even after the president finishes his second term in the White House.  And they still have their house in Chicago [Illinois].  And I'm, I'm glad the president is not going back to Hawaii, but he, you know, he goes to Hawaii for the holidays, for Christmas and things like that.  But his home, the home the girls know and where Michelle's mother knows, who's with them in Washington, is in Chicago.  And it would be great to have him back there and have all of his papers there and have people come to a Barack Obama museum [Barack Obama Presidential Library and Museum].  Whatever you wanna call it, it's gonna be great.
Story_ID: 179552
Speaker 1: Now what about [HM] Barack [Obama], the president?
Speaker 2: He is smart, and I, I say that without any second thoughts about it.  He know how to engage with anybody.  He always is cool.  You never see him upset.  You never see him angry, and that he's negotiating, whether it's with international leaders or with a young black male who comes to visit the White House and says, can I touch your hair?  He bends his head down and makes sure that he can touch and feel it, like, it's real; yeah, that's me, right.  And he's had some great plans, and so My Brother's Keeper I think is important, although I think he needs to go further, and I think he is gonna go further.  I talked about it.  He was smart, I think, in naming the first African American attorney general, [HM] Eric Holder, done a terrific job.  He was smart in naming Elena Kagan to the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  I thought that was great, a woman who had no experience before, but he made all the difference in the world.  He was smart in naming [Sonia] Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, and that's part of his early choices.  So--yeah, yeah, and so I think that gives you a sense of what he's able to do.  And people who around the world, until recently, really loved him and sensed that here's the first African American.  And he's, he's, his point is that I'm not focusing on the fact of race, but it makes us so proud, finally.  And we can stop calling Bill Clinton the first African American (laughter) supreme--first--
Speaker 1: President.
Speaker 2: --African American President of the United States.  And Bill Clinton was like that, and people called him that, that.  But Barack Obama is the real deal, and I, I'm convinced that he'll show all that in the next couple of years.  I see him regularly.  I talk to him regularly, and we agree on a lot of things.  We disagree on a few things.  I won't talk about the disagreements, but I think it's important to see what he's willing to do and what he's able to do.
Speaker 1: So, what has been your role in the administration and even beforehand because there are not many people, Charles, that--well, I mean there--well, you knew them before they were even, before--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean that's, I mean there are not many people that knew them as students in that way, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, knew them as, not only as students, but I knew Barack before he was a state senator--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --in Illinois, because I was having an event in Chicago [Illinois], and he invited him--I invited him.  I saw him, and I said why don't you come on over?  And he came over and met some people.  And one of Pam's [Pamela Ogletree] friends from business school was saying, Emily Hilliard Smith [ph.] said damn, I should have taken a picture with him.  Who, who knew, right, in the 1990s that he was gonna be the president of the United States of America.
Speaker 1: And it was such a meteoric rise.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Meteoric.
Speaker 2: Well, well, would you--but I saw it coming, right.  I mean the, the, the, from the community organizing in Chicago were, were a lot of--well, it's a lot, but a significant number of black folks were not ready for that.  And I saw it when he was running and had the support of a lot of the white senators that he should run for the United States Senate from Illinois, and he did that overwhelmingly.  And I, and I saw his debates that he was just amazing, and I thought he was on his way.  And then what really made the, it happened was 2004.  He was here and I was talking about him, how, how important it was to have him on the [Martha's] Vineyard [Massachusetts].  And he came to my event before we started the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute [for Race & Justice, Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 2004.  And he also--this was after he gave the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Boston [Massachusetts] in, in 2004.  He was great.  And he said, he's dropped it a little bit now, but he said it in 2004, and he also said it several times.  He says: I'm a kid from Hawaii.  My father's--my mother's [Stanley Ann Dunham] white and from Kansas.  My father [Barack Obama, Sr.] is African and from Kenya.  And he talked about that, how important it is to be biracial and how, what that meant to him and what he was able to do.  He said and only in America could this happen.  And my grandfather [Stanley Dunham] was, worked in the [U.S.] Military, and how he was influenced by those things.  And, and I, I, I really appreciate the fact that he has not forgotten where he came from and his roots.  He rarely mentions his father now 'cause he only met his father one time.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But his mother was the one who always taught him about race, and taught, taught him about music, and taught him about leaders like [HM] Harry Belafonte, and Lena Horne, and other folks.  And he, he, he talks about that dismissively, but he remembered it, right, and he was five, six, seven, eight years old when she was telling him all these things.  He remembers every single detail.
Story_ID: 179553
Speaker 1: Right, but, [HM] Charles [Ogletree], you also played a role not only in the campaign.  I mean, what, can you describe the role that you played and, and also the Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] community?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's very interesting.  Before he ran [HM Barack Obama] for office, he came to Harvard.  He was older, smart, and he would come to my classes when I started Saturday school.  And that was the idea, to give students a hand up to be prepared, because a lot of the African American students and some of the "first-generation" students, they had no idea.  They didn't have a mother, father, aunt, uncle, cousin, somebody else who'd gone to Harvard, and they didn't know what it meant to go from college to law school.  It's very different.  And so I had these classes, and I had, would have faculty members from Harvard Law School come and teach torts.  And I would teach a criminal law section, teach evidence, teach civil procedure, teach contracts, teach property, and get a, just a sense of what the overview is, to be prepared for that.  And I told them there are some lessons I need you to learn and that you need to im- implement as soon as you go.  First of all, make sure that you get a chance to meet your professors by taking them to lunch the first week.  Said, "The first week I won't know him or her."  I said, "Yeah, you'll know enough.  And they'll, there are a lot of people in your class.  Make sure that happens.  Also, make sure you raise your hand the first week."  "Well, well, I don't know anything."  I said, "I know.  I get 90 percent of the answers from people, and they don't know anything either, right.  And so it's, it's, but you have to be one of those gunners," as I call them, and other people call them people who raise their hands to be heard in class.  And they have--and you say okay, and you said thank you.  And you never say that's wrong, and, and you know it's not right, but you, you keep moving and say that's, and he said terrific point, good point.  And then Barack [Obama] was one of those folks who would sit in the class in Saturday school, and he would, in a sense, run it.  He would, you know, answer the question that's asked by someone.  And then he would say and yeah, Sara, you know, she had a good point.  Sara's view is that you should, you should recognize her.  And Anthony, Anthony was really important, and John, I said Barack, you know, I'm teaching this class.  He said uh, oh, okay, I, I, I was just, you know.  I said I'm teaching this class, all right.  And so, but everybody said he, people recognized him.  He came a little bit older, and a little bit more experienced, and had a lot of confidence, having spent time in Columbia [University, New York, New York], time as a community organizer before coming to Harvard.  And the professors liked it.  [Laurence] Larry Tribe said he remembers him coming to office hours, and he wrote down his name, Barack Obama.  He says it's still in my book 'cause the guy was so smart.  He really understood what was going on.  And he's carried that with him, and I, I, I still see that today.  I see him all the time.  I served as the special advisor during the campaign.  I would go places that he would come and sort of warm up the crowd and make sure that they were ready for him.  I would talk to the black community 'cause remember, the black community had never heard of Barack Obama.  Who is this guy?  Right, because--and he was skipping over.  He wasn't in all these primaries around the country, and he wasn't known.  They did know Michelle Obama, right, because she was visible and out there, and she was, let me put it this way, authentically black.  'Cause you know, the history of slavery, family had come up through all of that, had gone to these schools in Chicago [Illinois], and her parents, family was trying to give her a better chance and make things happen, went to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].  And, and the Republicans went after her.  She wrote a thesis in Princeton, which was a terrific thesis.  This, a survey of African American graduates of Princeton about race.  It wasn't her views; it was others, but the, the, the, the conservatives and the Republicans turned it around and said Michelle wrote this ball--bambat--bombastic thesis about race, and she's a racist.  And I said no, no, no, you got her all wrong.  And she was out there and doing it, but Barack Obama was always settled, always calm.  And he had a little bit of, he had a little, he had a fair amount of dissension among some of the blacks at the Harvard Law Review.  There were a few blacks who were in the law review, and there were a lot of whites on the law review.  And the, and everybody wants to be on the "masthead," you know, that they, they would carry the names of the individuals.  And one of the women, Cristina [ph.], I would see her regularly.  She would come by and she would just complain.  "Professor, Barack Obama's not treating us right."  I said, "Well, let me, let me talk to him.  Let me see what's going on."  And he was saying, "I was just teach--I was choosing people who would carry the job."  And I didn't realize how important it was until I was getting an--I was retiring from the Henry J. Kaiser [Family] Foundation board.  And they showed this video with my daughter, Rashida [Ogletree], with my son [Charles Ogletree, II], with my wife, Pam [Pamela Ogletree].  And then they had a video from Barack Obama.  I said where is that coming from?  And this is when he was running for president, before he was elected, in the back of a bus.  And they had a videotape, and he was talking about Saturday school.  He was talking about how much I meant to him and Michelle, and he's talking about how much I, I was in his corner, and it just floored me.  I said how did you find him?  They said oh, we got, we got this.  And they went and got it done, and he gave a wonderful talk about I was not pushy but very informative to those people in the classes that were available and trying to make sure that folks were coming.  He told the whole story.  I thought that was very amazing.
Story_ID: 179554
Speaker 1: Let's, let's talk about you, [HM] Charles [Ogletree], or Tree, how a lot of people call you, and the role that you've played, I mean in, in people's lives.  I mean you are viewed--so how do you think people view you?
Speaker 2: You know it's very interesting.  I wasn't sure how people viewed me, particularly when I was in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And one of my best buddies, who's also from Cleveland [Ohio], actually Shaker Heights [Ohio], is Dominic Hozan [ph.].  And Dominic Hozan was saying you know, these black folks, they're not gonna elect you, elect you as their national BLSA [Black Law Students Association] chairman by the name of Ogletree.  And I, and it reminded me, I said I remember when I was in the Boy Scouts in high school.  And some white and some black guys saying they were from a black family, and they were saying what kind of slave name is Ogletree, cracking up, cracking up.  And I said oh, man, I gotta get rid of Ogletree, because they--you know, you know, Williams, Jones, Smith, you know, Johnson, you can think of a thousand names but not Ogletree.  And, and, and that's where Dominic gave me the nickname Tree, and I ran on that.  And I've been called, called Tree since the seventies [1970s] because people, it's shorter, and I have to tell this story.  One of my favorite Harvard Law professors was Milton Katz.  He taught me torts, and very smart, and he was in the Second World War [World War II, WWII], he talked about.  And he would get off and start tell--and we'd love him talking about the Second World War.  Then, you know, he'll catch himself, and he'd say well, well, let's get back to torts.  And then he was a senior member of the faculty when I joined the faculty, and he was an amazing guy.  He's passed away now.  But he always called me Charlie.  He would introduce me: "This is my, my, my former student.  He's on the faculty now, and I like, I really like Charlie Oglethorpe."  And you know, he was, had to be close to ninety years old.  And I said am I gonna correct him?  I said no, so he died calling me Charlie Oglethorpe.  And I said I'm never gonna correct, you know--you know, he's a senior, and he's so excited about Charlie Oglethorpe.  I said I'm, I'm gonna be Charlie Oglethorpe.  Just, that's not too bad.  And so, that's when I switched to Tree said you know, call me Tree.  And all, the faculty, everybody calls me Tree.  My only insistence, and you should know this, is that I tell all of my students you can call me Tree after you graduate.  And there was one student calling me Tree when he was still in the law school.  I said, "No, no, my name's Professor Ogletree."  And he said, "Okay Tree."  I said, "No, no, Professor Ogletree."  And, and, and he was sort of shocked.  I said, "Now you heard other people call me, those are graduates; those are lawyers working with me.  You know, no one calls me Tree except people who've been with me and they've graduated after that."  And so, that, that's why I got that nickname.
Story_ID: 179555
Speaker 1: Where are you at this point in your life, [HM] Charles [Ogletree]?
Speaker 2: This, this is a, an important point.  I just turned sixty-one in December of last year, December 31st.  And I'm gonna teach for a while.  It's no question about that.  But it's, it's hard to--I'm, I'm, I'm at the top of my game.  When I say that I'm not being bold, but everywhere I go, everywhere on this island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] I've gone people get upset with me.  I'm going to breakfast, and somebody will come over and say, "Oh, Professor Ogletree, I met you in 1990."  "Oh, Charles, I met you in 1983," and everybody else around me, "Man, you know, why didn't they say that to me?  I've been teaching--I'm seventy-five years old," the people who were around me.  "And I'm seventy-three, they haven't, they haven't talked to me."  "I'm sixty-nine, they didn't talk to me.  They want to talk to Charlie and Tree and Ogletree."  But, I, and that's, I, I don't even realize that, and, and I certainly don't try to capitalize on it.  And I try to be as humble as possible.  I went, went over to the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival and ran into a bunch of people who knew me that I didn't recall, didn't know, or who wanted to meet me and ran into, like I said students who were--moved from law to doing films now.  And I, I, that to me is great news.
Story_ID: 179556
Speaker 1: But, no, but how do you want--what, where, what do you want to do at, from this point?  You're still, like you said, you're still extremely young.
Speaker 2: You know, it's--
Speaker 1: I mean you're, you're young in our world--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --you know, which has--
Speaker 2: --right.
Speaker 1: --been the '70s [1970s], '80s [1980s], and '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And no one could have said that they had mentored, you know, or I mean, you've mentored so many, Charles.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is the other thing.  I mean everyone, you know, people who were just--like I'm, I don't think I was like three years behind you or something, like that but you've mentored so many people.  And so, and you--now you know, can say you mentored, you know, the White House--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --people residing in the White House.  But what do you want to do from this point on?
Speaker 2: I, I want, I want to continue mentoring, but I also want to make sure that other folks who are mentored becomes mentors, right.  They need to understand that the whole idea is that I'm trying to--I can't handle it all.  And the whole idea is to make sure that there is an evolution that people are talking about, and that, that's what I wanna do.  Another thing I wanna do, and wife [Pamela Ogletree] reminds me that I'm pushing too early, I, I, I don't see the need to financially support, as, as I think about it going forward, my children.  My son's [Charles Ogletree, II] very successful.  He's now working at Florida State [University, Tallahassee, Florida] and went to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  He's in Tallahassee [Florida] with three kids, twelve, ten, and the baby should be seven in early next year.  My daughter [Rashida Ogletree] is thirty-five, with her first child.  She got married four years ago.  Her daughter will be two at the end of April--end of August.  And so, they're fine.  They got their house; they got a car; they eat three times a day; they're taken care of.  And so I'm, I wanna make sure that my grandkids all think about college; that they're, have a pile of money available for them when they are able to do that, and I wanna support them.  I, I'm sure their parents are gonna say, you know, that's our responsibility.  I said no, but this is the, the grandfather's gift to his grandchildren, making that happen.  And you know, I, I want to do two things: I wanna go around the world and speak and be heard.  There's no question about that; but also I just wanna go someplace to be quite.  And, and Pam's taught me that, saying, Charles, every single place we go we spend three days because you want to talk and speak, et cetera, or somebody wants you to speak and talk.  We went to Ghana in the heart of Kumasi [Ghana].  And as we were walking through, doing a tour, there was some kind of celebration going on.  And they said, "Oh, that's Professor Ogletree.  Professor Ogletree, would you say a few words."  I'm saying, "You know, (laughter) in Ghana?  I don't know what you guys are talking about."  "Just talk about, you know, the struggle and reparations.  You're the reparations man, right?"  And so I talked about it and talked about slavery, and, and that was great.  And we went to South Africa, the same thing happened.  We were going places and people were, in a sense, recognizing this is guy--I did something with Bill Clinton and former President Nelson Mandela.  And it's wherever we go, it's recognized, and I wanna make sure that happens.  But I, I also wanna go to places we've never been.  We want, wanna go to Greece; we wanna go to Rome [Italy]; we wanna go to Brazil again.  We've been to Brazil, places like that.  That's, that's gonna be the, the, the idea of ending, hoping to be unknown, unknowable, and undercover, enjoying those trips.
Story_ID: 179557
Speaker 1: And writing more.  This--I've written, authored or co-authored now at least a dozen books.  And since I can sit down and concentrate every--like when I'm here [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] I'll, I'll find some time to do some writing at home, and I'm thinking about something else, I'll start writing.  I'm on a plane and I'm writing.  I just, you know, write little slips, and I put all these things together and say oh, here's the story.
Speaker 2: Now what do you--what are some of the things you'd like to write about?
Speaker 1: I wanna write about [HM] President [Barack] Obama while he's still in office.  I wanna write about Nelson Mandela, as somebody who had an influence directly and indirectly about that.  I wanna write about women legacies.  We haven't talked much about that, how much that means, make sure that people understand.  A lot of people are writing about that, but I want to write about it as well.  And I want to write, at some point, another, this book turned into, 'All Deliberate Speed' ['All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half-Century of Brown v. Board of Education'] it's turning into an autobiography, but it was only the first half of my life, right.  And now I wanna write something that the, the second half and what that means and what we're gonna be doing.
Story_ID: 179558
Speaker 1: One, how would you talk about your journey?  And two, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: The journey is very interesting, and I want people--and I, I always say this now because people think that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.  That's not the case, right.  And so I'll just say let me tell you what was happening up until I was going to the sixth grade, right, and I had no idea about all these opportunities.  And it was that grandfather [Willie Reed], grandmother [Essie Reed], father [Charles Ogletree, Sr.], mother [Willie Mae Reed Ogletree Robinson] who had an influence, because my mother, when I got an, an award and was mentioned in the Washingtonian magazine I think it was, was saying I'm very glad to see he's there--a woman interviewed her--says but I was just happy to see him finish high school.  And I was just, wow, let me think about.  Nobody in my family, my family, had ever finished high school, and so that was part of the legacy.  I wanted to make sure that that continues.  So I, I want people to understand the, the humble but respected environment that I came from, and how important that was, and how important it is to have linkages.  I want them to know that there are people that I don't know that were looking out for me that were very important in you know, I've never smoked, never had a gun, a knife; you know, I stay away from that; don't use illegal drugs, anything like that.  And, and people kept me out of those areas as well that made a big difference by saying that, you know, you know, you don't, you don't need to come in here, man.  And they would, going to a party, or going to a meeting, or going to somebody's house, young men who were older than I was would always say he's gonna make it someday.  And they would make, wanna make sure that I was gonna be treated differently, keeping me out of those environments.  And so, that's part of it, and I just wanna make sure that people understand where I'm coming from.  And there's a restlessness, and I talk about that a lot, that after, I want to make sure that I'm giving folks a sense of what the background is and what the next thing is gonna be.  And we shouldn't stop at one president.  We shouldn't, we shouldn't say ah, we've done it.  No, no, we've started it.  We didn't finish it.  We've, we've done it, but we have to do more than that.  And there's a young man who is a student of mine, who's much more moderate than [HM] President Barack Obama, but has [U.S.] Military service in his background, is from Maryland.  He's the lieutenant governor now.  He's running for governor.  I'm sure he'll win.  His name is Anthony Brown.  And he doesn't like me saying this, but I, I, I think he, if he wants to, I think he'll be the next African American president of the United States if he wants to be that.  And I'm sold on the fact that Michelle Obama will be one of the first and few and one of many women to be president of the United States.  Now, I don't, I hope they don't see this for a year or so (laughter), but the, the reality is that these are folks who I've mentored with the idea that there's nothing I can do.  Now I have to tell you this: there is a woman that I was in, at Aspen Institute at this justice conference in July, and her name is Robin Lenhardt.  She's a professor in New York [at Fordham University, New York, New York].  And, and, and I hadn't even thought about this.  She says, she says let me tell you guys something, all these judges and lawyers and women and men at this conference.  It had to be a couple hundred, and she says, "Let me tell you about Charles Ogletree," and she says, "I never took a class from, him.  I didn't know him as a professor in a class I took. But I remember when I came to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], he was one of the first people I met, and he said, 'You know, Robin, welcome to Harvard Law School.  You're gonna be great.  I'm here to support you in any way that I can.'  And when I was graduating, he's the one that came up to me and said, 'Robin, congratulations on--I'm glad you're getting the honors, congratulations, and you should apply for clerkship.'"  She says, "Ah no, I haven't thought about it."  I said, "Robin, apply for a clerkship."  She said, "You know what, yeah, well, you know, well, okay, I'll look at the district."  "No, no, no, not the district court.  I want you to apply for a [U.S.] Supreme Court clerkship."  And she said, "Wow, wow, well, I don't know what I'm gonna do."  And she applied at the, the same time I was calling Justice Stephen Breyer and said, "Justice Breyer, I've got a brilliant person for you.  Her name is Robin Lenhardt."  And she said that she had been rejected by (laughter) him already.  And then when my reference went in, he interviewed her and saw her, and she was hired as a Supreme Court law clerk.  And, and what she's been doing?  Keeping the door open for the next generation to go through, and that's, that's all I've asked for, is to make sure that whatever I can do that, all that, those things would make sense.  The African American I mentioned on the faculty, so you'll know the name, Scott Brewer.  He's the one that came in.  He was the last person that clerked for Thurgood Marshall.  I'm not gonna say what Thurgood had to say about him (laughter).  Scott's a good guy, he's a good guy, teaches some interesting courses, and I like him a lot.

Speaker 1: So what, what, what do you want your legacy to be, Charles?
Speaker 2: Simple, [HM] Charles Ogletree was lifted up by others, and he wants to lift up those under him to make sure they enter the same way that he did and they leave the door open.  That's, it has, it has to be.

Speaker 1: What, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community as we sit here?
Speaker 2: Here's my fear.  When I wrote this book 'All Deliberate Speed' ['All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half-Century of Brown v. Board of Education'] in 2004.  We were looking on fifty years.  We had fallen down, and we're on the way up.  In 2014, ten years later, we are falling down, and somebody has to lift us up.  We just have to be lifted up.  And we have to talk to--and, and there are a lot of young black males who are dropping out of school not for academic reasons and not for disciplinary reasons; they're just dropping out.  They're not their grandfather; they're not my grandfather [Willie Reed].  They can't forget about an education and think they're gonna get a job working anywhere.  They can't do the work.  That makes a big difference, so I'm pushing to make sure that we respect this fact.  And we've gotta get people back into school.  We've gotta get them doing the work, gotta get teachers to understand how some people learn at different times and different ways.  And, and my wife [Pamela Ogletree], we're middle class because she made us that way.  She was pregnant and was, in a sense, talking to our son [Charles Ogletree, II] and daughter [Rashida Ogletree] before they were born.  She was very concerned about health and nutrition when they were young.  And, and, and I just remember all these things that, that, that are passed down.  I remember my son when he was very young.  I may have already said this, but my son was very young, and we went to Merced [California] before my father [Charles Ogletree, Sr.] passed way, and we had breakfast with him.  And my son was five or six years old was saying, "I want some hum [ph.]; can I have some hum?"  That mean ham.  And Pam and I said, "No, no, no, we don't eat any pork."  And my father said Junior--he called me Junior--"Junior, give that boy some pork; give that boy some ham.  I raised you on every piece of the pig.  Don't you tell me you don't eat pork.  I, I, you, you ate pork chops; you ate ham; you ate anything that come from a, from a pig."  I'm sitting and, and I'm wondering, and now I'm looking at my son with three daughters, and my granddaughters, but three daughters.  And he's very careful in what they eat.  And, and I have to in a sense bring them into the 21st century.  For instance, he, he and his wife--I love her to death--and they were saying, "The girls don't drink milk chocolate, and, and they don't eat these chicken fingers."  And the first thing I do is said, "Let's go to Starbucks and get some milk chocolate," and they love it, right.  I said, "Oh, let's go to McDonald's."  "We can't go there, papa."  "Yes, you can.  You're with me."  And they get the chicken fingers, right, and they're still alive, right (laughter); they're doing well.  But it just shows--and I'm doing it out of instinct, but I'm saying you know, I probably learned this from my dad, to make sure to take care of the grandkids, make sure that they're eating the stuff that was gonna make a big difference.  And, and, and I--
Speaker 1: You mean eating, you're, you're, you're spoiling them that's what (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That--they love it.  They love it, they love it because they can't do it at home.
Speaker 1: You're doing the grandfather duties--
Speaker 2: Absolutely--
Speaker 1: --for the--
Speaker 2: --right, right, and I get busted every now and then 'cause the little one will say, "Papa gave us some hot chocolate and some chicken fingers."  I said, "Oh, well, there we go, so much for keeping a secret."

Speaker 1: The other, the last, just last thing is about Pam [Pamela Ogletree], because--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --she's been referenced, but she has been a tremendous partner.  You--
Speaker 2: Oh, I met Pam, well, Pam grew up in Baltimore [Maryland].  And I, I didn't know her as a kid, but they moved from Baltimore to Compton [California].  And I met her the first week we were both at Stanford [University, Stanford, California], and we both had other interests.  I had somebody I left in Merced [California]; she had somebody she left in Compton, and we were talking about the relationships.  And we were good friends; we were good supporters.  And she got involved in everything.  I, I was, I was very amazed and shocked, doing things that I would be interested in doing, going places I would be interested in going, eating things that I would be interested in eating. And that's not expected; that's not automatic.  It was wonderful to see it happen.  And then, as we were leaving Stanford, I, I was admitted to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I was embarrassed by it.  I said, "I can't tell anybody."  I said, "Charles, you gotta tell somebody you're admitted to Harvard Law School.  That's a major accomplishment."  And so she convinced me to tell--I told my family, but I didn't tell any of the folks around me.  And so that was very helpful.  And then we were driving out, and I came very close to getting divorced.  Let me back up--came very close to getting an annulment.  In the old days, they had these telephone booths where you put a quarter in, so got some change.  And I just heard this conversation with father something about annulment.  I, I said, "What is that?"  I just remember because Pamela said, "Well, Charles, we should stop. It's eight o'clock."  And I said, "No, no, no, we only got three hundred miles to go," the next day.  And then, the next day the driver said, "Charles, we, you know, we should stop and get you set up at a hotel before it's sold out."  I said, "No, no, no, we only got a hundred and fifty miles to go."  And the hotels were all booked.  They said no occupancy, and the restaurants were all closed 'cause we were so late.  I said oh, man, these folks are racists.  They just don't like black people.  She said, "Charles, it has nothing to do with race.  It's you.  If we'd stopped earlier, we'd have a place to stay.  If we'd stopped earlier, we'd have a place to eat.  You need to stop and eat, and we need a place to stay," and so I slowed down.  And we actually stayed and went to Memphis [Tennessee].  We stayed in a hotel where the person [James Earl Ray] who assassinated [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] stayed.  I didn't realize it at the time, it was well after it, until we were leaving, but it was amazing.  And we went to parks and things like that.  And I was going to law school, and she took a year raising the kids, and then she went to business school.  And it, it's been terrific.  She's been the right hand.  We just celebrated our thirty-ninth wedding anniversary, and the big 4-0 is next year.  We're--and it's always on the [Martha's] Vineyard [Massachusetts], always in August, always on the ninth, and I think it will be great.
