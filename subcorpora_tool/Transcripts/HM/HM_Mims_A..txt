Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, can you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is A. Grace Lee Mims.  Lee is my maiden name, Mims, my married name, M-I-M-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, can I ask you--?
Speaker 2: I don't use my first name.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I should have asked you--
Speaker 2: I'm A. Grace.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I can tell you when I started using A. Grace.  I was born in Snow Hill, Alabama and my grandfather [William James Edwards] founded Snow Hill Institute [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute], which became a boarding school and we had kids from all over to come.  Since there were seven Lees, everybody in the community called us by our full names so I was--it was Arnold Lee when they talked about it so they would distinguish who they were so everybody called me Grace Lee.  And this girl was a boarding school person.  She came from somewhere else, I don't remember where.  But she asked me, what's your last name, Grace Lee what?  And I was taken aback.  And I said Lee is my last name and from that point on I started using A. Grace Lee but then people would realize that Lee was my last name.  And of course when I went to college at Hampton [Hampton Institute] [Hampton, Virginia] everybody would say, who is this person who uses her, her middle name?  She doesn't use her first name.  So I was A. Grace Lee of course, everybody knew me by that.  By the time I was a senior, another girl came who was a junior and she used her middle name as well.  But I was kind of a groundbreaker.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And ma'am, what is--oh, can you spell your name for us?
Speaker 2: A. Grace, G-R-A-C-E, capital L-E-E, capital M-I-M-S.
Speaker 1: All right.  And ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Phone number?
Speaker 1: No your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Snow Hill, Alabama, July 17, 1930.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm sort of, I don't know what I am.  I have my Masters in Library Science [Case Western Reserve University, 1953] and I had several jobs as a librarian.  But currently I had a voice minor at Hampton and I've always loved music.  I come from a musical family.  So I teach voice currently at the Cleveland Music School Settlement [Cleveland, Ohio] and I have a radio show that's called The Black Arts on WCLV FM, here in Cleveland.  And I started that in 1979 I believe.  So--1976--
Speaker 1: Six, right, Seventy-Six.
Speaker 2: Seventy-Seven--1976.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: So it's been a while.  And I give all the credit for the beginning of that radio show to the vice president who's now the president of WCOV, Robert Conrad.  He's known as Bob Conrad, C-O-N-R-A-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I always loved classical music as well as our music for black people, jazz and the spiritual and so on.  But I also loved classical music.  I'll have to tell you about that.  That's from my mother [Alberta Edwards Lee] and my father [Arnold Lee].
Speaker 1: Well we'll get to that.  I just wanted to ask you what your occupation was.
Speaker 2: Well I'm still telling you what my occupation is.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Because I had the radio show and I am a radio hostess, producer at WCOV of The Black Arts, which comes on Wednesday nights from 10 to 11.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I guess I'm all of those things.  I'm a librarian, and I'm not currently a librarian anymore, but I am a voice teacher and a radio producer personality at the present time.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: What is today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: This is Valentine's Day, don't you know that?
Speaker 1: I do, but we have to ask.
Speaker 2: February 14th, 2014.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?

Speaker 1: Oh you don't have to give your address.
Speaker 2: Oh, you don't want to exact address?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Don't do that.
Speaker 2: I'm in my home with this interview.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Which is in East Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.  Okay.
Story_ID: 55063
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions we always ask and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, they're kind of a warm up, first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  I can't say I have a favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color?  Not really.  It used to be red but it isn't anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I love spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well when my husband [Howard Mims] was living we did travel a bit and I loved the Caribbean, into several of the Caribbean countries, I loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Do you have a saying that you sign off of your radio show with?
Speaker 2: Not a phrase.  I just ask people--I just tell them who will my next guest will be and ask them if they will tune in to hear that for the next date.  It's not a favorite phrase of mine.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I was just checking.
Speaker 2: So I don't have--I don't really have a favorite phrase.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Many radio personalities have some kind of a phrase that they use that everybody knows them by, you know, so--
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now--
Speaker 2: My focus on my radio show is the artist that I'm featuring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going--
Speaker 2: It might be Marian Anderson, it might be Roland Hayes.  It might be Paul Robeson.  It might be Kathleen Battle or Jessie Norman or any of those.  And if I find a quote from them that's relevant to my show I will include it in my script.
Story_ID: 55064
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about the show when we get to 1976, but right now I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's [Alberta Edwards Lee] side of the family and your father's [Arnold Lee] side and then we'll put them together.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Her full name is Alberta Grace Edwards Lee.
Speaker 1: And can you spell that for us?  Can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Alberta, A-L-B-E-R-T-A Grace, G-R-A-C-E Edwards, E-D-W-A-R-D-S and Lee, L-E-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Incidentally, I'm named for my mother, Alberta Grace Lee.  Of course I don't have the Edwards because that's her maiden name.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Snow Hill, Alabama.  I think she was 1900--in February 12th.  I think it was--I think she was 1902.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family or how far back can you trace them and what sort of activities were going on in your mother's side?
Speaker 2: In as much as I was raised in Snow Hill, Alabama, most of my information family-wise comes from my mother's side of the family.  Her father, my grandfather, William James Edwards, founded Snow Hill Institute [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute] from which all of us, of my generation graduated and my mother and her sisters and brothers as well.  My grandfather was very poor and he had a disability but he was very smart.  And he'd heard about Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] because Booker T. Washington sent out his disciples throughout Alabama to various churches, black churches in Alabama to tell the people about Tuskegee, that they could send their sons and daughters there and they could work their way through and secure a college education.  The way my grandfather heard about it was one of the disciples came to our church which is African Methodist Episcopal, AME Church.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: The name of the church.
Speaker 2: St. Paul's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church.  And my grandfather felt that he was not appropriately dressed to be in the church because he didn't have the clothes.  He was, he felt he was ragged you know.  And so he listened on the outside what the disciple of Booker T. Washington had said about being able to go to Tuskegee and work your way through and my grandfather decided that that's what he would do.  So he went to Tuskegee, worked his way through.  Booker T. told them to go back to their homes and found schools for blacks because the blacks didn't have any schools at that time.  My grandfather did so, came back to Snow Hill and founded Snow Hill Institute in a log cabin and it grew from there.  And he married Susie V. Edwards and they had several children, one of which was my mother.  And she was very gifted as a pianist--
Story_ID: 55065
Speaker 1: Now I want to go back a little bit and ask you about--
Speaker 2: Well I was going to tell you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was going--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to go back to your [maternal] grandfather's [William James Edwards]--the founding of the school.  He was a student of Booker T. Washington's at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did he have any stories about Booker T. Washington that he shared with you because he knew him, right?  He knew Booker T.?
Speaker 2: He did but he, I don't remember any stories that he told.  But if you want to know about family background, my grandfather told us about Mike and Phoebe who had been their slave ancestors in Abbeville, A-B-B-E-V-I-L-L-E, South Carolina.  Mike and Phoebe belonged to different slave owners and when Phoebe's owner David Wrumph, W-R-U-M-P-H, I believe he spelled it, decided that he was going to move to Alabama, when it became a state, moving from Abbeville, South Carolina to Alabama, he took his slaves with him.  That meant that Phoebe and the children went to Alabama and left Mike with his slave owner in Abbeville, South Carolina.  But Mike promised Phoebe that he would join her and the children in Alabama.  He went to his slave master and asked his slave master if he could work for himself at night and for him as a slave during the day.  His master agreed.  I don't know what the master's name was but he agreed.  And Mike did that for several years, maybe four years, and gained his freedom and went to Alabama.  I'm not sure whether he walked or whether he caught rides on the wagons or what not, but he did join Phoebe and the children.  My grandfather said that if Mike could do this during slavery and do such an heroic thing to join the family we should never forget that.  So we as a family, which I know you're going to get to later but we became a musical group.  We decide to name our musical group The Descendants of Mike and Phoebe as a way of honoring Mike and Phoebe for what they had done for us.  And now we have a family reunion, it's called The Descendants of Mike and Phoebe.  We're going to have a reunion this year in Montgomery, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Now that is such an important story for a family to have so I just--so Mike and Phoebe, were they his--your grandfather's parents or were they his grandparents?
Speaker 2: No they weren't--they were further back than that. I'm not quite sure who they--how that works--
Speaker 1: Cause I'm thinking--
Speaker 2: --genealogy wise but they were further back.  And he--
Speaker 1: Do you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and my grandmother were distant, distant cousins because she was a--her name was originally Susanna (phonetic) Johnson and she changed it to Susie Verdell (phonetic) Johnson.  I guess Verdell might have been in there but she changed it to Susie.  But it was Susanna to begin with.  But she was younger than papa but--when they married because it wasn't unusual.  They were very, very distant cousins but they had the same chronology of you know being kin to Mike and Phoebe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was Snow Hill [Alabama], the place that Phoebe was brought by her master during slavery?
Speaker 2: That they joined once they came from Abbeville, South Carolina?  They wound up in Snow Hill, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so your grandfather, if your mother [Alberta Edwards Lee] was born in 1902, I guess your grandfather was born about 1880 or so?
Speaker 2: I don't remember his dates exactly.
Speaker 1: It had to probably be--yeah, so this Mike and Phoebe would have maybe been, Mike--or would have--and Phoebe may have been his grandparents, you know, that's what I'm thinking if they were around before slavery.  Grandparents or they'd be great grandparents.  So, but it's kind of lost in history as to what their actual relationship was?
Speaker 2: I have his autobiography and maybe I can look that up and tell you but I'm not quite sure at this point.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just trying to put it in perspective for whoever is going to watch this later on.
Story_ID: 55066
Speaker 1: So your mother [Alberta Edwards Lee]--so Snow Hill Institute [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama] is founded in the early 1900s?  Is that pretty much--?
Speaker 2: Before then because--it was founded before then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After he graduated from Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was what, 1890s or--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I can check--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --I'll have to check and see exactly when that was, it was founded.
Speaker 1: So Snow Hill--
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: But your mother was born on--and the Institute?
Speaker 2: In Snow Hill, Alabama, yes.
Speaker 1: And the Institute was already founded when she was born?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think so, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: 1902 is when she was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55067
Speaker 1: What stories did your mother [Alberta Edwards Lee] say--tell you about growing up at Snow Hill [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I don't remember any stories she told us.  All I remember basically about my mother was that she was extremely gifted as a child.  And she was a--
Speaker 1: [TELEPHONE RINGING]
Speaker 2: All right, so your mother was a piano prodigy.
Speaker 1: Oh I was telling you about my mother, yeah.  She was a child prodigy really.  And during the time, that time after slavery in the beginning of the early part of the [twentieth] century, the Republicans were the good guys.  They were very helpful in giving money and establishing funds and so on for black education.  That would be black colleges such as Hampton Institute [Hampton, Virginia] and Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee, Alabama] and also black high schools such as Snow Hill Institute [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute].  My grandfather, William James Edwards would go north every summer to raise money for Snow Hill.  One of his major destinations was Boston, Massachusetts and he went there many summers and while he was there, attended Harvard [University] to better himself.  And he decided to take my mother since she was so talented and enroll her and a couple of summers she went I think she was 14 and 15.  I know she went a couple of summers in the New England Conservatory of Music where she studied. So she had that opportunity. My grandfather had high hopes for her becoming a concert pianist but in the meantime my father [Arnold Lee] came from Tuskegee where he was an electrical engineer.  He was hired to come to Snow Hill to establish the plant and everything.  He fell in love with my mother who was 17 or 18 at that time and she was sent to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] which was well known for its music.  From Fisk came the Fisk Jubilee Singers who toured all over this country and went to Europe and the Work family was very famous for--at Fisk University.  At any rate they were very well known for their music at Fisk in Nashville, Tennessee.  So that's where my mother went to college and--
Speaker 2: Now this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --my father went over and eloped with her when she was a freshman.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  This is the family, the Work family (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --that John Work comes from, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  John Work.
Speaker 2: Famous John Work.  Right.
Story_ID: 55068
Speaker 1: John Work, II and III and all the Works.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: From Fisk.
Speaker 2: There's an organization in Chicago [Illinois] called the John Work Coral--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that's headed up by Delano O'Banion.  They sing the spirituals.
Speaker 1: They were so famous for preserving that spiritual, so famous, all over this country and in Europe as well.  They did a command performance.  And they influenced Samuel Coleridge Taylor who became one of the great, great black composers.  He was of English and African descent.
Story_ID: 55069
Speaker 1: So, but any-getting back to my mother [Alberta Edwards Lee], she and daddy [Arnold Lee] had fallen in love.  So daddy went over to Nashville [Tennessee] and they eloped.  Some gentleman over there had a mansion and they got married and they were going to keep it secret.  In the meantime, she let her next sister [Neva Edwards], sister next to her, my Auntie Neva wear her ring so papa [William James Edwards] wouldn't find out.  But a gentleman went to Nashville, somehow her--somehow knew about it, came back and told everybody in the little country town where we lived, Snow Hill [Alabama].  I heard that one of Ms. Stedward's, they called her Ms. Stedward's, daughters got married up there in Nashville.  So the story was out. Everybody knew who was in Nashville, it was my mother.  So the story was out so they had to admit that they were married.
Story_ID: 55070
Speaker 1: The family didn't start right away because daddy's [Arnold Lee] first job which is Spelman [College], you know the famous college in Atlanta [Georgia], that was his first job.  But his second job was at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And Florida was--he was the second bandmaster there.  You know they're known for their high stepping and everybody tries to mimic the Florida A&M band [Marching 100].  They started all of this stuff on the great marching and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Right, that was the first of the black college bands that I saw on television do that.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They performed I think for the Super Bowl or something.
Speaker 1: Oh yes.
Speaker 2: Back in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: They were great.
Speaker 2: And they--when Bob Hayes was there I think.
Story_ID: 55071
Speaker 1: But now, let me just--let's go to your father's [Arnold Lee] side and then we'll go--well bring them up to date.  So let's--
Speaker 2: I didn't know as much about my father's side.
Speaker 1: Can you--well the first question is, what was your father's full name?  Can you give that to us and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Arnold--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Wadsworth Lee, W-A-D-S-W-O-R-T-H Lee.  And his father had been named Arnold.  I'm not sure about the Wadsworth but his father had been named Arnold.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't remember his date of birth.
Speaker 1: Is he about the same age as your mother [Alberta Edwards Lee]?
Speaker 2: But he was older than my mother.
Speaker 1: He's older?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, older than mom.  And where was your father born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Selma, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the whole family--and the Lee family was very light skinned so I'm sure they had white people not very far back in their ancestry there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So any stories about what his ancestors were doing or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did--do you know what your father's parents did for a living?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: What your father's parents did for a living?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Did they live in town or did they have a farm or what--did you know?
Speaker 2: They, no they lived in town.
Speaker 1: Lived in town, okay.
Speaker 2: I knew that.
Speaker 1: Were they teachers?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really don't.
Speaker 1: All right. But they were able--
Speaker 2: They were not, I don't believe they were teachers.
Speaker 1: Was he the first person in the family to go to college, do you know?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure about that either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know he had another brother who was very talented musically.  And my father was also a musician.  He played the cornett even though he had selected electrical engineering as his major at Tuskegee [Institute] [Tuskegee, Alabama], but he was in the band and when he went to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], he was the second band master there.
Speaker 1: Now I'm trying to get his early life first.  And so he--
Speaker 2: I don't know that much about my--
Speaker 1: He goes to Tuskegee and--
Speaker 2: --father's side.
Speaker 1: Well just tell us what you do.
Speaker 2: Because I was--we were--
Speaker 1: So you said he went to Tuskegee, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes indeed.
Speaker 1: And he played the cornett.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he became an electrician too, he knew how to--
Speaker 2: He majored in electrical engineering at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he came to Snow Hill [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama] to establish the electrical plant there.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now let's see.  So--now was he, I was, something I was reading, was your father's family a part of Brown's Chapel in Selma?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Brown's Chapel, AME [African Methodist Episcopal]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Story_ID: 55072
Speaker 1: So your father [Arnold Lee] so far we've caught up with him and your mother [Alberta Edwards Lee], they elope and he's got a job at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] in music this time.
Speaker 2: First job was at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I mean after he left Snow Hill [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute], went to Spelman as an electrical engineer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because of course that's an all girls' school.  But then he went to, second job was at Florida A&M as band master.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he had--he was a double threat?  He could--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Electrical engineer and--
Speaker 2: You could say that.
Story_ID: 55073
Speaker 1: And daddy [Arnold Lee] really was a jazz fan too because he introduced us to jazz.  You know at that time you had Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, all of those great jazz people and we had all of that in our home.  We had that music coming in either by records or radio and then we had our mother [Alberta Edwards Lee] who was classically trained.  We had Brom [Gustav Brom], Chopin [Frederic Francois Chopin], Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven], all of this coming in, into our home. [TELEPHONE RINGING]
Story_ID: 55074
Speaker 1: So this is in the 1920s I guess when your parents go to Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  Your father's [Arnold Lee] a band master and now your mother [Alberta Edwards Lee], did she get a chance to finish at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: No she didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She finished at Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And became a teacher later on and director of the choir and so on at Snow Hill [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay, so all right, so your father is at Florida A&M and now did he teach that style of marching, the high stepping marching?
Speaker 2: I guess he did.  He was the second band master there so he had to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He loved it.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met?  I know you told us how they met but is there a story that they tell about how they--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --became acquainted?
Speaker 2: Okay, and the other thing is once they did get married and everything, when you think about their personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, their talents, what they look like, how they walk, how they talk, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 1: My mother. Why?
Speaker 2: (Laughing).  Because we were--our mother really raised us. You know we were in that, I would say that atmosphere of Snow Hill [Alabama] with my [maternal] grandfather [William James Edwards] founding a school [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, 1893] and being a small black community and my mother--and daddy very often his jobs were away from home.  So he would you know be coming back to us.  Once they settled in Snow Hill he didn't have a job there but away and different places in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So let's see.  So now when did the, how long was he at Florida A&M?
Speaker 2: I don't remember exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Or did he--so, but he eventually goes back to Snow Hill or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did he teach at Snow Hill?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he always had a job someplace else other than--?
Speaker 2: He had a job someplace else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were your parents still together?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he just worked--
Speaker 2: You know how divorce was back during that time don't you?  (Laughter).  Nobody divorced.  People stayed together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That sounded like it would have been a strain on the family for him being you know him being so far away most of the--
Speaker 2: No, that was very often.  You know there were--it wasn't like that it was that far away.  In Alabama you know you could get to places very easily. I remember several jobs he you know, one of his jobs was in Beatrice, Alabama you know and he was head of the band there and so on.  So it wasn't that far away.
Story_ID: 55075
Speaker 1: We knew daddy [Arnold Lee].  Daddy was you know a part of us.  He would gather all of his children there.  At one time he gathered a group together and called it One Man's Family, Arnold Lee, One Man's Family.  He toured around because the different kids had different gifts and everybody was taught.  He taught all of his boys how to play instruments.  Arnold [Jr.] [brother] played clarinet.  Clarence [brother] played trombone.  Bill [brother] at that time played ocarina.  Consuela [sister] of course was gifted like my mother [Alberta Edwards lee].  She played the piano and I sang.  That was before Lynn [sister] and Cliff [brother] came along.  He was calling it One Man's Family and we did a couple of concerts around in Alabama.
Story_ID: 55076
Speaker 1: Now what was your dad's [Arnold Lee] personality like?
Speaker 2: Very outgoing and it was very you know, he told a lot of jokes and things and I just think he was just, I don't know how to describe his personality really except saying he was outgoing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother [Alberta Edwards Lee], what was her personality like?
Speaker 2: More reserved but still warm you know?  She raised all of her children.  She saw that everybody got a good education and musical training.  Everybody learned how to play the piano.  And she was just a great person.   Everybody in the community adored her.
Story_ID: 55077
Speaker 1: Now can you name your brothers and sisters from the oldest to the youngest with--including yourself in the order and tell us something about each one.
Speaker 2: Arnold W. Lee, Jr., was the oldest.  He went to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], played clarinet, was in the band there, became a teacher.  He's passed on now.  And Clarence Bertram Lee.  Bertram was for that brother of my father's who was also very gifted but died early.  Clarence was also an electrical engineer.  He went to A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] in [Greensboro] North Carolina and played trombone and established his own jazz ensemble there.  Consuela is spelled C-O-N-S-U-E-L-A Edmonia (phonetic) Lee, was a great pianist, composer.  She was a pianist like my mother.  She went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and also studied at Eastman [School of Music, Rochester, New York], I think a couple other places.  But she was the one, the pianist who came back after Snow Hill [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute] closed and opened it as Snow Hill Institute for the Performing Arts.  She opened it as an art school and worked with the young people throughout that--throughout the county and established a group called Bright Glory, kids who played the xylophone and played--she was interested in jazz.  She could play jazz as well as classics and was a composer.  Then there was William James Edwards Lee.  He started out with the ocarina but later when he went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], a Morehouse graduate, string bass and he established the New York Base Violin Choir which included some of the great bassists of all time such as Milt Hinton [Milton John "Milt" Hinton], Richard Davis and so on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard of Richard Davis (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And he is the father of Spike Lee and worked on his, did the music in some of his films such as School Days.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he has a credit of Bill Lee in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's known as Bill, Bill Lee.  Then myself, I'm next, A. Grace Lee Mims and I went to Hampton [Institute, Hampton, Virginia].  It was Institute at the time, Hampton Institute with an English major, voice minor, and you're finding out all about me today.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Then was Leonard Lee, L-E-O-N-A-R-D, Leonard Wendell Lee was next.  He played saxophone, learned saxophone but went on to become director of I think it was psychology.  He went to Morehouse too and later became director of I think mental rehabilitation center in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  He had one son also named Wendell.  Then A. Albert Clifton, we call him Cliff, C-L-I-F-T-O-N, Clifton Lee, he was the baby of the seven Lee children.  He went to Xavier University in New Orleans [Louisiana], played trumpet.  Played--and he'd become--he taught in the New York Public Schools and became a jazz musician as well.  And he's the father of Malcolm D. Lee who is also a film maker.  He had two sons, one named Malcolm, one named Kenyatta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so this is the household when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Your brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: Lots of music.  Music, music, music.
Story_ID: 55078
Speaker 1: So did you all live in the same house in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course.
Speaker 1: --Snow Hill [Alabama] the whole time?  And--
Speaker 2: The house right next to my [maternal] grandfather's [William James Edwards] house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Big old house.
Speaker 1: All right.  Can you describe the house for us and the neighborhood and oh the, I mean the Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial] Institute and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well we had everything there.  Snow Hill Institute was [grades] one through twelve, so we had with the help of as I told you the northern whites, it was built into--we had two basic buildings there and brick buildings.  The main auditorium, the main building had an auditorium where we played basketball in the auditorium or it had vespers in the auditorium on Sunday nights where we--and the nother, another building was a home economics building which was also brick.  Then we had several on the campus with teachers' cottages and the principal when my grandfather left. We, our house was straight up the hill.  The red clay, it wasn't paved, red clay hill, just go right up the hill and my grandfather's house and our house, the Lee family house.  And then next door to our house was the Rivers' house and that road went on around the curve and there were other people spread all out in the community there.  But that--those were the main three houses on that hill and they had you know, on the campus was a basketball court.  And they played football and--on--we had an athletic field where they played football and we had a choir, we had everything.  It was just great.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were the buildings arranged in like a quadrangle or something or how were they?
Speaker 2: Just on a level--it was a main auditorium, academic building and then the--on a straight line down from that was the home economics building.  Later, on that same just straight line, there was, it was a smaller, wooden building.  And then the main road, down from the main road was a little store and then on a--same road, the road down beneath there were, the teacher's cottages, we called them, a row of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: And then down from that was another building where the, you know the cafeteria was.  It was also a wooden building-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --where they would go for their meals because--and there were dormitories.  There was a girl, girls' dormitory just beyond the little wooden house and on the other end of the campus there was a boys' dormitory.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the students that went to Snow Hill for the most part were residents, right?  They stayed there on campus?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Did most of the students stay on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes, but also from around.  They had a bus and they brought in kids from around Wilcox County was the county that Snow Hill is in.  And we were 17 miles from Camden [Alabama] which is the county seat for Wilcox County so they had their own school in Camden but would still be--the bus picked up anybody who was interested in coming to Snow Hill which was private at that time when my grandfather founded it.  Later on the--Alabama took it over.  It became a State sponsored school.
Story_ID: 55079
Speaker 1: Now is there any explanation for the name Snow Hill [Alabama]?  In Alabama you just don't think about snow so I mean is it--I mean do you know where the name comes from?
Speaker 2: I understand, now this is, this goes way back, that it was originally Snow's Hill, a man named Mr. Snow that had the plantation there.  Long time ago during slavery it was called Snow's Hill but they dropped the apostrophe s ['s] and it became Snow Hill.  That's what we were told.  I don't know whether that's true or not, but that's--
Speaker 1: Now was it, was the property--
Speaker 2: Not because of snow falling.
Speaker 1: Were any of the buildings there the original buildings that were there when Mr. Snow owned it?
Speaker 2: [shaking head]
Story_ID: 55080
Speaker 1: Alright.  Was agricultural--
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandfather [William James Edwards], I told you my grandfather founded Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial] Institute in a log cabin.  It was not inhabited by any white people at that time.  They were all black people who lived in Snow Hill [Alabama].  And we went--a mile away we were to go a little, where the train station was and the whites were out there.  Whites had stores out there and so on and we would go out there for getting on a train or so.  Now, so--and Mr. Lock [phonetic] had a store.  He was black and we often went to his store.  Well we you know traded at all the stores.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now was there a church on the property or near the St. Paul [African Methodist Episcopal Church] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Out to the station, which we called it the station.
Story_ID: 55081
Speaker 1: Out at Snow Hill [Alabama] there was, our church was there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: St. Paul's AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now was that an important place when you were growing up?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm, that's where we went--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for our service and where we joined.
Speaker 2: So I imagine the musical services there were pretty involved since you had so many musicians in the family, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was good music.  You know people sang the spirituals you know at that time and that's--we were founded--we were grounded in the spiritual at Snow Hill [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute] and it continued at Hampton [Institute, Hampton, Virginia] where we had Mr. Flax, F-L-A-X with--and our vespers would sing spirituals and we--and of course and the choir sang arrangements early--and Dett.  You know, R. Nathaniel Dett founded the music department at Hampton.  He had gone to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] but he was--and he discovered Dorothy Maynor [born Dorothy Leigh Mainor, former soprano, concert singer, and the founder of the Harlem School of the Arts].  Dorothy Maynor went to Hampton.  She was--he discovered her when she was thirteen.  She thought she was going to be a home economics teacher but had this gorgeous soprano voice and went on to--she was well known during the time of Marian Anderson, Paul Robeson, Roland Hayes, and Dorothy Maynor. They were the great concert artists, singers.
Story_ID: 55082
Speaker 1: Now what were you--did you like music growing up?
Speaker 2: Did I like what?
Speaker 1: Music?  Music?  Did you like music?  Did you really like music?
Speaker 2: When I was growing up?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Loved it.  We--I was never very good as a pianist but I could sing.  So I sang.  We had several--we had a group we formed--myself and Consuela [sister] and our cousin Augusta, we called Augusta, we formed a group.  But I loved music, always have.  Always have.
Speaker 1: And most of the music now when you were coming along, it wasn't--I mean gospel music was fairly new.
Speaker 2: No, we were grounded in the spiritual.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And as we grew older, Mahalia Jackson of course was a great gospel singer and we knew about her and Thomas A. Dorsey who wrote Precious Lord, take my hand.  And I sang that with our group, my arrangement and my sister's arrangement (unclear).  We did an--we did one album and that is on that album.
Speaker 1: Now he was from Alabama himself, Thomas Dorsey. He used to sing under the name of Alabama Tom when he was a blues singer--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a blues singer, right.
Speaker 1: --before he became a gospel--
Speaker 2: But he went to Chicago [Illinois] and at the--this, you know in--was Mahalia from--I don't know if Mahalia was from Louisiana or what but she was from the south and then she went north to Ala-to Chicago and met, you know and sang William--I mean Thomas A. Dorsey's music.
Story_ID: 55083
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you this for the benefit of those watching this in the future who have no idea what the difference is, what is the difference between black spirituals and--or the Negro spirituals and gospel music?
Speaker 2: The spirituals were created during slavery.  They were the songs that the slaves, talented, beautiful people--just in a--as an aside, I'll get back to your question.  But they brought over Antonin Dvorak, you've heard of him, the great Czechoslovakian composer, to establish a school of music here in the United States in New York.  It was called--I'm not sure whether it was the American School of Music or whatever at the time but it's now Julliard.  But he came over and over in Erie, Pennsylvania was Harry T. Burleigh, B-U-R-L-E-I-G-H.  As a child, his grandfather would take him around.  His grandfather was a former slave but he had been made the lamplighter in Erie, Pennsylvania.  He took his little grandson around with him and he would be signing the spirituals.  So Harry T. Burleigh learned all of those spirituals.  Harry T. Burleigh became a great baritone singer and some white people, rich white people in Erie sent him to New York to study under Dvorak.  When he got to New York, Dvorak heard Harry Burleigh singing these spirituals.  He would have him come to his apartment and sing these spirituals and he told him, you must arrange these songs for your people.  This is the music of America.  That's what Dvorak said.  And he was also impressed with the Indians, with their boom-boom, boom-boom, boom-boom, boom [making drum sounds] you know, and their drums and all.  But the white people who had brought Dvorak over didn't like the fact that he said the music of America is black.  Don't be telling us that black people have the only creative music with the spiritual.  But what did--have white Americans created?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hillbilly music, country western, that's all.  Everything else has come from Europe.  The opera, classical music, all of that has come from--and that's what they wanted him to create here, but Dvorak said the black people have it.  They have--and as you know from the spiritual has come jazz, blues, everything, gospel.
Story_ID: 55084
Speaker 1: Gospel is 20th Century music and it's generally composed music.  We don't know who wrote the spirituals, Steal Away, Swing Low Sweet Chariot.  Every Time I Feel the Spirit, I mean these are just some of them, you know.  The slaves did that because they were talented people who were captured in Africa and brought over here.  But they made this beautiful music.  And they didn't like what Dvorak said.  They sent him right on back to Czechoslovakia.  [Laughter].  Coming over here telling us black people have all, created all you know this music, it's American.  But anyway this is--that's the beginning of the spiritual, the difference between Gospel which is 20th Century music, composed music, it includes the latest of the current music that's going on.  When Thomas A. Dorsey was doing it, it was the blues.  But now it's rap or anything else you want to put in there.  That's Gospel.  But the spiritual remains the same.
Story_ID: 55085
Speaker 1: We've had the great comp--one of the greatest composers has been Harry T. Burleigh.  And I teach my students from--and his spirituals are still in print and you had R. Nathaniel Dett arrange the spirituals, Margaret Bonds, a woman composer arrange the spirituals, Florence Price, another woman arrange the spiritual.  We've had--and then we had this great gentleman Moses Hogan who went to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] and won a lot of piano competitions.  Everybody thought he was going to be a concert pianist.  Moses Hogan went back home, which was New Orleans [Louisiana], and founded a choral group and he would arrange spirituals.  I mean they could sing everything just like the Cleveland School of the Arts [Cleveland, Ohio] can.  But he arranged these spirituals for them. He would bring them in and one, I heard one interview, the lady said they were just applaud when he would you know play his arrangements of the spiritual for them.  But unfortunately, he died.  He had a brain tumor and died.  So I was saying the spirituals was in good hands with Moses Hogan but he died as a young man in his forties I think.
Story_ID: 55086
Speaker 1: But now did you have any favorite teachers at Snow Hill [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I did.  I had, Ms. Edmonds was in elementary school, E-D-M-O-N-D-S.  And I think she influenced me to go to Hampton [Institute, Hampton, Virginia].  They had quite a few teachers there from Hampton.  And in elementary school I know there was Ms. Edmonds.  Then I had Ms. Hettie Mae Johnson.  She was--I thought she, think she taught sixth grade when we, you know we moved along to different classrooms for the different grades cause it wasn't a very large school you know.  So the--that influenced me in terms of wanting to go to Hampton but it wasn't any conflict with my parents.  We were all going to college, poor as we were.  We didn't have any money, but we were all going to college and we all got scholarships and we had jobs that we worked at in college and went to--
Speaker 1: So I take it your father [Arnold Lee] didn't encourage you to go to Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] for some reason or--?
Speaker 2: Nobody went to Tuskegee.  He, you know daddy didn't--we didn't push him.  Everybody just selected their own college.  He just left it up to everybody to decide where they wanted to go.  Arnold [Jr., brother] went to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], Clarence [brother] went to A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], Consuela [sister] went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], Willie [brother], we called him Bill, we call him Willie went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I went to Hampton, Lynn [sister] also went to Morehouse and Cliff [brother] went to Xavier [University, New Orleans, Louisiana].  So I mean we all went to black colleges but it was no pressure on us.  We made our own selections.
Story_ID: 55087
Speaker 1: But well, but let's see.  I've asked you about the teachers.  So Ms. Edmonds distinguished herself.  I mean you really liked her as a teacher, but did, was there any--were there any other teachers at Snow Hill [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama] that you really admired?
Speaker 2: That I did what?
Speaker 1: Any other teachers at Snow Hill that you really liked a lot?
Speaker 2: Oh I liked all my teachers.  That was unheard of for you not to like your teacher.  [Laughter].  You liked your teacher.  And we had Ms. Bertha Pleasant, P-L-E-A-S-A-N-T, who was the librarian.  And I think that's where I became interested in becoming a librarian because of Ms. Pleasant you know.  I wanted to become--cause I was, I loved books, loved reading and so I wanted to become a librarian because Hampton [Institute, Hampton, Virginia] didn't offer library science.  You had to get your masters to get library science.  But I had an English major at Hampton and voice minor.  But then I came to Cleveland to Western Reserve University [Cleveland, Ohio], it's now Case Western Reserve, to take up library science.
Story_ID: 55088
Speaker 1: Okay, well I don't want to get that far yet. But now in your high school years at Snow Hill [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute], now you're at one place for a long time.  Did you--did your family travel to other parts of the country when you were in school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go to Boston [Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: No, never.
Speaker 1: --or any of the other--?  Okay.  So you just stayed basically in Snow Hill [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Stayed basically in Snow Hill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And traveled around in Alabama maybe but you know visiting relatives and so on.  My Aunt Hope lived in Repton.  We'd go down there to visit the--there.  But we really didn't travel that much.
Story_ID: 55089
Speaker 1: Now your [maternal] grandfather [William James Edwards] was still alive when you were growing up I take it?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And did--I mean what did you notice about him or are there any stories about your grandfather that you, you know can recall from growing up?  Was he still in charge of the school [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Everything, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He gave up the school I think in the '20s [1920s], because we had a series of other principals.  A Mr. Leydon Wilson  from Tuskegee [Institute?] was principal when I went to Snow Hill.  Papa was just a great man.  We just loved him.  He would--he was strict and he would--in his house there was a swing.  He would sit out in the swing and we would just love to hear him talk, you know.  And sometimes he would go down on what we called the campus and give speeches and talk.  He was just a great man.
Story_ID: 55090
Speaker 1: Now were there guest speakers on the--on the campus from time to time?
Speaker 2: From time to time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of them, of the--?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Well, yes I do remember.  We had Mrs. Bethune  come at one time.  She--and I remember that because she was so well known from Florida from having founded Bethune-Cookman College [University, Daytona, Florida], you know.  I remember her.  And we would--she would--she gave a talk and she would say years--it was something she was talking about.  She'd say years, years ago and we said that for many, many years around you know, mocking Mrs. Bethune.
Speaker 1: Now your father [Arnold Lee] you know went to Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] as well as your [maternal] grandfather [William James Edwards].  So did they have stories about Tusk--did they talk all--did they have a good relationship--?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  Daddy talked about the band person over there, Captain Dryer was his name, you know we heard about him.  But other--I really didn't--Papa didn't talk about Tuskegee, not, at least not to us you know, maybe--not to the children.
Speaker 1: Did they have any stories about George Washington Carver--?
Speaker 2: I think he came to Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama] at one point but I don't remember any stories about him.
Speaker 1: Do you remember meeting him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do not.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he was alive I think--until I think '46 [1946], I think till 1946.
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: I think he lived until about 1946, I believe.  So (unclear), you'd have been about sixteen when he passed away, yeah.  So I just wondered cause I know Booker T. Washington visited that campus and in the book [Mims' maternal grandfather, William James Edwards, wrote an autobiography entitled Twenty Five Years in the Black Belt] they--there's a--in one of the chapters there's a story of Booker T.'s last visit to Snow Hill and I was looking at that upstairs and you know just trying to find out what he thought.  And so--
Speaker 2: At one point I remember this--and I don't remember the year, but Booker T. Washington invited Papa back to Tuskegee.  It was his, it was commencement I think to talk about his success at Snow Hill 'cause he had built that school from a log cabin to it was now a campus, you know.  And in the audience was Andrew Carnegie.  And after hearing Papa talk about what he had done at Snow Hill, he wrote Papa a check for $10,000.00.  And at that time you know that was a lot of money.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's worth about twenty times--
Speaker 2: It would be like a hundred thousand today.
Speaker 1: Two hundred thousand today actually.
Speaker 2: You know what I mean?  So that story I know.  I'm not sure, I can't remember whether that was in his book or not.
Story_ID: 55091
Speaker 1: And Papa [William James Edwards] wrote his autobiography called Twenty Five Years in the Black Belt [c. 1918].  Black belt referred to the soil in Alabama.  It was rich, rich soil.
Speaker 2: That's it in your hand. Could you just hold it up a minute?  Just--yeah, there we go, yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Twenty Five Years in the Blackbelt. And when my sister went back to reopen Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial School, Snow Hill, Alabama] as a school of the arts, she had it reprinted in a paperback.  And she wrote an epilogue at the back.  Her epilogue was part of the story as well as the original.  An original had had an introduction by Daniel T. Williams at that time.  He was at Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] I believe.  I can't remember what his position was.
Story_ID: 55092
Speaker 1: Now did you have any--I mean could you afford to get bad grades when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Never thought about it.  Always, just came natural.  I was valedictorian of my high school at Snow Hill [Industrial and Normal Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama].  And so I never even thought about bad grades, didn't think about bad grades when I went to Hampton [Institute, Hampton, Virginia].  I graduated second in my class at Hampton. I'm just wondering, now was Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama] sort of like a cultural gathering place for the rest of the community there, you know?  You--I imagine some of the school--did Snow Hill have a library too?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had a library.
Speaker 2: You had a library.  So you had all--yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: But it was just a warm feeling.  The people didn't come on campus except for special occasions you know.  But there was a tree and around that tree was a bench and they would wait for the mail there and that--that's where all the community gossip and stuff would go on.  That's where the men said they heard Ms. Stedward's daughter got married. But anyway, everybody met and that was just down a slope from my [maternal] grandfather's [William James Edwards] house and everybody would gather around that tree for mail.  And the mail would--the Rural Free Delivery, FDR [RFD].  You know we had--and it was a white man who came--Mr. Stabler, he was very nice and he drove over and gave us--everybody their mail.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But people lived on over--it felt very you know, warmly towards the school but they weren't down there all the time.  I mean it was a school.  It was a school and it was for the people who came and were down there as boarding school students and teachers who lived with them in the dormitory who were the dormitory school masters as well as teachers.  So--
Speaker 2: I didn't ask you about the students but who were--are there any remarkable students who were there or people that are memorable that you remember from your Snow Hill school days?
Speaker 1: I don't remember any outstanding students when I was there.  My mother [Alberta Edwards Lee] had written information about the school and she gave it to us.  I think I gave you a copy of that.  But I can't remember anybody in, you know during my era that was--became famous except Bill Lee [brother] was probably, you know--Spike's dad Bill was somewhat famous with his composing and playing in jazz groups.
Story_ID: 55093
Speaker 1: So now did you have like when you were in high school were there various clubs that you belonged to in high school?
Speaker 2: I don't remember any.  We're not so--we weren't so much into clubs at Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama].  I did play basketball my senior year.  I wasn't very good but my best friend was a star, Bessie McNair [phonetic], she was great.  But I played and the boys all generally, my brothers played basketball and football.  So--but clubs, not so much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, didn't have many clubs.
Story_ID: 55094
Speaker 1: The clubs were at Hampton [Institute, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Now was there--
Speaker 1: I Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], I became Delta at Hampton.  And I was also a member of the Honor Society at Hampton.  And with the Deltas, I was the Dean of Pledges so (unclear) when I went over the next year I became the person in charge of the young, wannabe Deltas.  So Dean of Pledges.
Speaker 2: Now how did you choose Hampton?  What--you were saying one of your teachers went to Hampton at one time, is that--?
Speaker 1: There were several of them who were there.  Ms. Edmonds was one and Ms. Johnson was another that went to Hampton.  And I just was impressed with the, with going to Hampton.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At Hampton I was selected the homecoming queen and that was by popular vote.  That wasn't anything other than that.  And I was in the Alpha Kappa Mu Honor Society because of my grades.  As I told you, I graduated second in my class at Hampton and of course I was a Delta.  And I was, did I tell you that I was selected the Sweetheart of the Omega Psi Phi [Fraternity, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: For two years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They loved me so much that they made me their queen my junior and senior year at Hampton.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this is--now you graduated from high school what in '48 [1948], '47 [1947] or '48 [1948]?
Speaker 1: Fifty Two [1952].
Speaker 2: Fifty Two [1952], okay.
Speaker 1: From Hampton?
Speaker 2: No, from high school?
Speaker 1: From high school, '48 [1948].
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Snow Hill [Industrial and Normal School, Snow Hill, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Right, Snow Hill in '48 [1948].  So you're in--
Speaker 1: Hampton, '52 [1952].
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you're there from '48 [1948] to Fifty--
Speaker 1: Western Reserve [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], '53 [1953].
Speaker 2: All right, so in those four years, now did--okay.  So your major at Hampton was--?
Speaker 1: English.
Speaker 2: English, okay.
Speaker 1: With a minor in voice.  I was in the choir and I loved it, the choir and Howard was in the choir, my husband [Howard Mims] to be.  We--that's where we met, in choir.
Speaker 2: So it's Howard Mims, right?
Speaker 1: Howard A. Mims, um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now let me ask you this, did Hampton have a--were you in a touring choir?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: I mean did the choir tour to make money and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: I was in the main choir.
Speaker 2: Okay, Hampton choir.
Speaker 1: We toured and also sang on campus.
Speaker 2: Who was your choir director?
Speaker 1: Dr. Henry N. Switten who was from France, S-W-I-T-T-E-N.
Speaker 2: Now was he white?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  He was a white Frenchman and--
Speaker 1: I think Hampton's always had mixed race faculty.  (Unclear) Armstrong was the first principal.  He was white, former soldier.
Speaker 2: So who was the president of Hampton when you were there?
Speaker 1: Dr. [Jerome] Holland.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now okay, so the country is going through a lot of changes.  The army is integrated and the Korean War starts.  All this goes on when you're at Hampton, right?
Speaker 1: You were what?
Speaker 2: All of this goes on when you're at Hampton, the Army is integrated, Korean War is going on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know A. Philip Randolph [Asa Philip Randolph, former leader in the African-American civil-rights movement, the American labor movement and socialist political parties] is organizing--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in D.C.  There's, you know I'm just trying to set a stage of what's going on.  And did you--now did Hampton, did you have a chance to be on the radio when you were in college?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So Hampton didn't have a radio station or anything?
Speaker 1: [Shaking head no.]
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  I'm just checking.
Speaker 1: The radio began here in Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Okay, but did you--
Speaker 1: My radio experience because--
Speaker 2: Did you listen to a lot of radio in, when you were--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because that was the main way of communication was radio--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --when I was coming up.
Speaker 2: Were there many black you know radio hosts when you were growing up on the radio?
Speaker 1: I don't remember any.  I can't remember.
Story_ID: 55095
Speaker 1: So when you're on the verge of graduating from Hampton, what was your plan?
Speaker 2: What was my what?
Speaker 1: Plan when--
Speaker 2: Oh, I knew that I wanted to be a librarian so my plan, I had an opportunity to go to [Clark] Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  They offered me a scholarship but I chose Western Reserve in Cleveland [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] because by that time Howard [Mims] and I were engaged and I knew that was closer to Detroit [Michigan] that we would be able to at least see each other once in a while.  So I selected that and--
Speaker 1: Now did you work in Detroit for a while as a librarian?
Speaker 2: [Nodding head yes].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a young adult librarian.
Speaker 1: So at--
Speaker 2: Just about a year because Howard was drafted into the, you know Army.  Korean War [1950-1953] was going on at that time.  And we got married in Detroit but he was sent to Camp Chaffee, Arkansas and I went with him and became an Army librarian really at the camp under Rose Akers.  She was white and I was her assistant.  And then after we left, after Howard did his two years, we went back to Hampton [Institute, Hampton, Virginia] and Howard became, he was hired into the English Department, speech and I was in the library.  Then he decided to get his Masters at Western Reserve so I came to Cleveland and that's when I began working in the Detroit Public Library.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you join him at Case?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, not Detroit, Cleveland Public--
Speaker 1: At Case, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Cleveland Public Library.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 55096
Speaker 1: So now Case--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --Western Reserve [Case Western Reserve University] is the highest rated college in Ohio.
Speaker 2: Yes, definitely.
Speaker 1: And one of the highest rated in the country (unclear).  So you got your Masters in Library Science there.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, right.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers there?  Any memorable instructors or--?
Speaker 2: I can't remember their names right now but they were good.
Speaker 1: Okay.   It's a two year course of study?
Speaker 2: And I also worked at--this is when I was--I had a job at Case Western Reserve and I worked at the Cleveland Music School Settlement.  They had a library at the time and I worked in their library.
Speaker 1: Okay, Cleveland Music Settlement.
Speaker 2: And got a scholarship as well.
Speaker 1: Now what is the Cleveland Music Settlement?
Speaker 2: It's in University Circle right around East Boulevard.  I mean right around the, right around from the Cleveland Institute of Music on Magnolia Drive.
Speaker 1: Is it a music school or--?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I'm not from Cleveland and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Cleveland Music School--
Speaker 1: --nobody watching this is from Cleveland either so the name Cleveland Music Settlement doesn't necessarily mean, you know not to us so you--that's why I'm asking.
Speaker 2: The new man changed the name to the music settlement and--but I still call it the Cleveland Music School Settlement.  That's how it was known.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That makes sense.  So--
Speaker 2: They, you know it's a settlement.  The settlement, remember the settlement movement began, I don't know whether it began in Philadelphia or what but anyway when it started in Cleveland, this lady was interested in music so anyone can go there you know with--the rates aren't that high.  And they have a school for like a kindergarten, child development school as well as a regular music school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was--
Speaker 2: And you can go there from you know, from a child up to adult you know way up to 90 if you wanted to take lessons, you know, voice, instruments, whatever.
Speaker 1: So you say it was part of the settlement movement, settle--?
Speaker 2: It's a settlement movement, yeah.  Cleveland Music School Settlement is the original name.  Now it's just called The Music Settlement.
Story_ID: 55097
Speaker 1: Now this--now we're in the, I guess late '50s [1950s] by now right, or in the--cause you became the librarian at Glenville High School [Cleveland, Ohio] in 1963, from what I understand, right?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was there--they give me credit for building the collection in the area of black history and culture to the strongest collection in the State of Ohio.  And we also had what we call a black festival.  We called it Eusi SiKuki.  And the kids couldn't--
Speaker 1: Now can you spell that for us?  Wait a minute now.
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: E--Eu--Eusi.  E-I-S-U-A-U-C--E-U-S-I S-I-K-U-K-U.  [E-U-S-I K-U-K-U, Eusi means black, Kuku means people and language].
Speaker 1: S-I-K-U-K-U.
Speaker 2: I think that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eusi--
Speaker 1: Eusi SiKuku.
Speaker 2: E-U-S-I and then capital S-I-K-U-K-U, Eusi SiKuku, but it was the black festival.
Speaker 1: Now what--yeah, what does that mean?  What does the name mean?
Speaker 2: It meant black festival and I'm not sure but it was an African term that we found.  And we had contests for the kids and I created Quiz 100, which was a quiz that they could--kids could do.  They'd come to the library and pick up the quiz and fill it out for prizes.  And we had performances during that week you know and it was just great.  Eusi SiKuku.  We had guest artists come in, ministers who came in.  So it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when was this start--was this in the mid-Sixties that you started?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's about the time when, what they call the Black Arts Movement [c.1960-1970] starts basically, it started.
Speaker 2: Mid-Sixties.
Story_ID: 55098
Speaker 1: Slowly building up in the mid-Sixties.  So now what--I know your husband [Howard Mims] is really involved in the Black Studies Movement [c. late 1960s-1970s] and so were you as--did you and your husband you know, both feel that black history was important to be part of the public school?
Speaker 2: Oh very--definitely, definitely.  I started a scholarship fund.  The benefit for Hampton [Institute, Hampton, Virginia] and I did that.  Howard was president of our alumni association and I began the scholarship benefit.  We did that every year.  We brought in some great artists you know, Patti LaBelle and Barry White and blah, blah, blah.  So--and the money helped.  We helped over a hundred kids go to Hampton that way, you know, the money we raised for the benefit.  And Howard was very active in--at Cleveland State as--he was in the speech and hearing department but when, I think it was when Curtis Wilson left, he was in charge of the search committee and decided, wait a minute, I think that I'm well qualified for this job.  So he applied and was, you know was selected as the head of Black Studies for Cleveland State [University, Cleveland, Ohio].  And Black Studies was in charge of the African American Cultural Center that's part of it.  And when Howard passed, they named the Cultural Center for him [2004].  They had a big celebration and that's when my nephew Spike Lee came here and--for that dedication and at that time he had his book out and the Cultural Exchange in Shaker Heights had his book [Please, Baby, Please, co-author Tonya Lewis Lee, 2002].  And so he had a book signing as well.
Speaker 1: So this is not until the '80s [1980s] right, when this--?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: This is in the '80s [1980s] when the building is dedicated to your husband?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's when Spike became like famous in--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Eighty Five, Eighty Six.
Speaker 2: Well when the Black Studies was but you know this was after Howard passed that they--
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Right, right.
Speaker 2: --named--you know he passed in 1992.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh I see, all right.
Speaker 2: So maybe it was 1994 when they did that, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: We don't want to go that fast.  I just wanted to find out what was going on or what you were thinking in those days.  Now why was black history important to you?  Now it may sound like a stupid question but there were a lot of people in those days that were saying, we don't need to study black history.  Why are we studying Black History when there's too--why are we having Black Studies?  Why do you need a Black Cultural Center?
Speaker 2: Basically so our students would know where they came from and appreciate what had been done before them.  Just carrying on what I had been taught coming up in a black environment and black--with black educators and black culture.  I knew all of that so it was a matter of passing it on.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you thought that was an important thing to do?
Speaker 2: Yes indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's still important.
Speaker 1: Well you know a lot of people still, they'll say why should they learn that?  Why don't they learn computer science some more and forget all the cultural stuff and you know.  So in those days, now did you know Iqabod Flewellen here in D-in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: [Shaking head yes.]
Speaker 1: Tell us about him.  I hear he's important in terms of the--?
Speaker 2: I don't think Mr. Flewellen was necessarily an educated man but he you know what, I mean with degrees and so on.  But he certainly appreciated the need to know black history and he created, he had a collection of books and materials that were highly regarded.  And we had the African American Museum but I think he founded [Afro-American Cultural & Historical Society Museum, currently Cleveland African American Museum, 1953], it was named for him or whatever before he died and he was just a wonderful person.
Speaker 1: I know there was a family called the Ingrams that were involved in a black museum here in Cleveland too.
Speaker 2: Named what?
Speaker 1: Ingram.
Speaker 2: Ingram?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.  Do you remember them?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know the Ingrams.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually met them and were here--they founded a museum someplace downtown and a black museum in the early '70s [1970s], around '70s [1970s] or '71 [1971].
Story_ID: 55099
Speaker 1: But so you amassed this large collection of books by and about African Americans at the Glenville Library?
Speaker 2: Glenville High School [Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: High School library, right?  And--
Speaker 2: Cause it's--the Glenville Library is a public library.
Speaker 1: And Glen--the Glenville High School is the--has the largest black population I guess in, on the east side of Cleveland in terms of the student population?
Speaker 2: It's what?
Speaker 1: Was it the biggest black high school on the east side of Cleveland?
Speaker 2: I don't know--you know the east side is basically black.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.  But there are several high schools that had a different (unclear).
Speaker 2: So you had Kennedy which was black you know, and John Hay which is black, School of the Arts was basically black and Glenville was basically--you know so it's one of the great black schools in Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: On the east side.  East side is full of black schools.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Cleveland is basically divided between--
Speaker 2: It's divided by Cuyahoga River and on the west side you had the whites.  And now you know it's more or less integrated stuff but it's basically still--and our main arrival at that time was Collinwood which were basically white, white neighborhood.  And Glenville and Collinwood didn't get along when I was coming up, you know.
Speaker 1: Were there sports rivalries or something?
Speaker 2: I mean when I was employed there.
Speaker 1: Is that because of sports rivalries or what?
Speaker 2: I just think basically just everything.  White versus Black and you know scholarship and, everything because of--the people at Glenville felt that Collinwood got the choice everything, you know what I mean, and Glenville got the leftovers, you know that kind of thing.  So it was quite a rivalry there.
Story_ID: 55100
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you involved in any black organizations in town trying to create social change or cultural change?
Speaker 2: Well I was involved with--somewhat with the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.].  I've never been as active with the Deltas here as I was in college.  But I was involved with the--in the Western Reserve Historical Society, African American Cultural Archives I'll say, with that.  And later on I was--I've been involved with the Cleveland--as a Board of Trustee Member of the Cleveland Institute of Music.  An honorary--I was recently made Honorary Trustee of the Cleveland Museum of Art.  And we have a couple of committees there on African American Arts and Friends of African American Arts, there are two committees there that I'm involved with.  Trying to think of what else I was in, except you know Hampton, that was a big thing, involved a lot of my time and effort with the scholarship benefit and being a member also of the alumni association.  That's all I can think of right now.
Story_ID: 55101
Speaker 1: So during the days that you were at the Glenville [High School] Library [Cleveland, Ohio], were you involved in the Cleveland 70 Chorus [Cleveland Orchestra Chorus] too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cleveland Orchestra Chorus.
Speaker 1: Orchestra Chorus.  And this was headed up by Robert Shaw [1916-1999], right?
Speaker 2: Robert Shaw.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also I was selected to be in the Cleveland Orchestra Chamber Chorus which was a smaller group that Robert Shaw--you had to audition every year, you know to see whether your voice was still hanging in there.
Speaker 1: Alright, now what--describe your voice for us. What is your voice like and what--?
Speaker 2: I'm soprano.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And people said I had a wide range so you know that it was also I could go into the mezzo range but I was a soprano.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: I made one album, an album of spirituals and our group The Descendants of Mike and Phoebe made one album [A Spirit Speaks, 1974].  So, but that was when LPs were being made.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus and the Cleveland Chamber Chorus--
Speaker 1: Sang with the Cleveland Orchestra.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we basically did big works.
Speaker 2: Cleveland is a [unclear]--
Speaker 1: --town that's noted for classical music.  The Cleveland Symphony Orchestra was one of the best in the world at one time (unclear).
Speaker 2: The Cleveland Orchestra.  They don't put symphony in there.
Speaker 1: Orchestra, oh okay.
Speaker 2: The Cleveland Orchestra.
Speaker 1: Cleveland Orchestra.
Speaker 2: I came in, I was there when George Szell, S-Z-E-L-L was the conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra and Robert Shaw was conductor, did the choral stuff.  He left and went to Atlanta [Georgia] but--
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite work that you performed with the Cleveland--?
Speaker 2: Oh, all of them.  All of them were great.  I loved Brahms, Beethoven 9th, you know oh, many, many, many works that were chorus required with the orchestra.  I can't say that anyone was my favorite but I loved lyrical stuff.  I don't like way out stuff too much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55102
Speaker 1: Now The Descendants of Mike and Phoebe, now this is a family group and who's idea was it to put this group together?
Speaker 2: That's hard to say.  You know Bill [brother] and Consuela [sister] were the basic leaders because they were both composers and we did all of their works, their music, you know.  But it was a group thing like deicing on the name that was you know part of--cause we started out with just the three of us, Consuela, Bill and myself and then we added Cliff [brother] later so the three of us decided on the name, The Descendants of Mike and Phoebe [the group was named for her maternal grandfather's slave ancestors].  But I would say basically it was Consuela's and Bill's idea to do the family group thing.  And we had to hire a drummer because the family didn't have its own drummer.
Speaker 1: Who was the drummer?
Speaker 2: We had two at different times.  We had Billy Higgins was one of them and Sonny Brown was one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the Descendants of Mike and Phoebe were--so I know you quit your job at the Glenville High School Library to tour with the Descendants of Mike and Phoebe in 1973, right?
Speaker 2: [Shaking head yes.]
Speaker 1: And I mean was that a tough decision to make?
Speaker 2: Not really because that's--it's something you know we wanted to do as a family.  We wanted to get a--and Howard [Mims, husband] was our manager and we--he controlled everything from this house.  We called--it was the Lee-Fam Enterprises.  It was the Lee Family because Lee-F-A-M Enterprises and Howard was our manager.  And we toured with various colleges because I just felt that it wouldn't work if I you know had a regular daytime job to go to.  So it wasn't too much because it's something we wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you--was it pretty much year-long touring?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where did you--?
Speaker 2: Various times, from you know from time to time.  It wouldn't be you know you're not out on the road the whole time.  You'd be going to different, you know go to that college or that college, you know.  It was, I wouldn't say one night stand things but you're doing concerts not in clubs or anything.  So you have to get there and do a rehearsal and see that--what kind of venue you had to work in and then you'd come on back home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was--?
Speaker 2: That kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well what was the repertoire of The Descendants of Mike and Phoebe?
Speaker 2: Basically stuff that Consuela and Bill had written or arranged.  Sometimes we did spirituals with their arrangements and sometimes we did their compositions.  Basically it was always whatever Consuela and Bill had either written or arranged, that was our repertoire.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give an example of what a typical show might consist of?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  Well for instance the spiritual "Shout for Joy", that was one thing that Consuela had written--I mean arranged.  And "Sweet for Stone" was another one that she wrote.  And that was for Donald Stone who had been in SNCC, [Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee] and she traced him from her--I think it had, I think it was four movements in it but she traced him from a little boy in Snow Hill [Alabama], three little fat boys running around that was with Lynn [brother] and Cliff and Donald.  They were three little fat boys.  Then when he went to Atlanta [Georgia], he went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] too and there was a movement for his wife Flora and then lockdown which they sent him to jail because he had protested with SNCC.  And then "Home Again At Last" was the final movement when he got out of you know jail.  It was a great suite.
Story_ID: 55103
Speaker 1: So Donald Stone [cousin, active member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee during the Civil Rights Movement], he was a fellow alumnus of Snow Hill [Normal and Industrial School, Snow Hill, Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: He also was a writer and he wrote the book--he did a biography of Papa [maternal grandfather, William James Edwards] called Fallen Prince [1989]--
Speaker 1: Wait--
Speaker 2: And this is--
Speaker 1: You can hold it up a little bit.  Just--let us see the cover.  A little higher, little higher.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) piece at the end Larry [Matthew Hickey, The HistoryMakers videographer].
Speaker 1: We'll shoot them at the end but since she had it in her hand I thought let's look at it instead of having her look down at it which is good [to Matthew Hickey].
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is better actually.  So okay, so this is the book that Donald Stone wrote and so he's a close friend of the family I take it and (unclear).
Speaker 2: First cousin.
Speaker 1: Okay, first cousin.
Speaker 2: My Aunt Blanche's son.
Speaker 1: Alright, so he's actually in the family too?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: He's in the family not just close to--?
Speaker 2: He's in the family, of course.  He's in the family.
Story_ID: 55104
Speaker 1: Alright, so you were doing, like how many numbers would you do for a show you think?
Speaker 2: How many what?
Speaker 1: How many songs or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's hard to say.  I would have to come up with a program because I would always lead it off like you know that, "Shout For Joy" was one of the things that we would start with and I would sing several songs.  And then I would go offstage because they would do instrumental stuff and I would usually come back.  Very often we ended with that "Sweet for Stone" because "Home Again" was up, you know, upbeat.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So I did a lot, I mean I was onstage a lot.
Speaker 1: So the show, did it like follow a historical chronology maybe or did it take us from slavery to freedom or what?
Speaker 2: What, the whole--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --concert?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: They didn't really think about it that way, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because there were some things in it that had nothing to do with slavery per se, you know.  It was just a wonderful repertoire of stuff that Consuela [sister] and Bill [brother] had written and/or arranged.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That's why they called it a jazz folk ensemble because it was not all jazz but they could all play jazz and a lot of it was jazz but some of it was folk.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cause I don't consider myself a jazz singer.  I can't improvise too much so I had to have stuff that was written out for me.
Speaker 1: So what song--what songs were you featured in?
Speaker 2: I was featured in the "Sweet for Stone" and the ones I mentioned to you.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: There was an arrangement of, "I Want Jesus to Walk With Me".  That was one of my mother's [Alberta Edwards Lee] favorite spirituals and I was featured with that.  Consuela arranged that one and the others I'm, the "Sweet for Stone", I was featured in that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know your brother's music has been featured in Spike Lee's [renowned film director, producer, writer, and actor, known for films like Do the Right Thing and She's Gotta Have It] movies, your nephew's movies.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm, Consuela too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In School Daze [1988] they helped write the music for--
Speaker 2: The opening song in school days is "I'm Building Me A Home", it was about the building of a black college.
Speaker 1: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Was that a composition by--?
Speaker 1: I can't remember, "I'm Building Me A Home".  It sounds like it's a spiritual.  I'm not sure.  I can't remember exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You probably remember better than I can.
Speaker 2: I remember the song, yeah.
Speaker 1: Been a while since School Daze was out there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  [Singing].  I'm building me a home.  I'm building me a home.  I'm building me a home, it's like, it was like that.
Speaker 1: That's a spiritual, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  So how long did you tour with The Descendants of Mike and Phoebe?
Speaker 1: Oh, about ten years we did that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so till about 1983?
Speaker 1: And then sort of--money sort of dried up in the colleges, you know when Ronald Reagan came in and there wasn't as much money--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --to hire people.
Speaker 2: Yeah right.  He cut--a lot of things dried up then.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 55105
Speaker 1: So, now you started--tell us how you started "The Black Arts" Show?
Speaker 2: As I told you I loved classical music so WCLV [FM] is Cleveland's classical music station.  So I would always listen to it.  And they had of course all the, you know Italian, blah, blah, blah, but they had a program for the Jewish hour, Catholic hour; nothing for Blacks.  So I called Bob Conrad  and said, what do you think about having a program that features the contributions that Blacks have made to classical music?  He said come in and talk to me about it.  At that time the--they were down at Terminal Tower which is a big, tall tower downtown [Cleveland, Ohio].  And so I went down and told him what I had in mind and some of the artists I had in mind and he said well do a trial program for me.  I did that trial program.  I did it with Jessye Norman.  Jessye Norman.  And he liked it and he said I would like to have you continue to do this but you must do it at least six months.  I would, you know, you must agree to do it for at least six months and I've been there, what's it 37 years?  Is that 37?  [Laughter].
Speaker 1: Now this is--your first, your trial show is with Jessye Norman?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now was Jessye Norman as big a star then as she is now?
Speaker 2: Was she what?
Speaker 1: Was she as big a star then--?
Speaker 2: She was a big star at the time.  Yeah--
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: --because I had records and CDs to play, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But my first show turned, I did Leontyne Price, the first, you know when he--when I was on in May of 1976, I did Leontyne Price.  And every five years I repeat that because I--the title was Leontyne Price in Prayer, you know, and used a lot of Verdi Arias and things at where she would be--the heroine would be praying as well as at the end.  And I always try to use spirituals at the end of my show that would you know--songs that had prayer in them or in the title.  Like, "I Couldn't Hear Nobody Pray" or whatever.  So that's what I did.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And that's what I still do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did the station manager know who Jessye Norman was when--?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, everybody knew who these classical artists are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I try to pay tribute to them on their birthdays.  I find out when their birthdays are cause I just did Leontyne Price.  She was born in February, and coming up Marian Anderson's birthday, you know, I try to do birthdays.  And I did Joe Wilder who is a trumpet player who was the--a forerunner of Wynton Marsalis because he can play classical and jazz.  And he's 93, I believe now coming up.  I just saw in the New York Times that they're doing some kind of tribute to him and he's on up there now.  But I try to acknowledge them on their birthdays.  I usually do Miles Davis  and Duke Ellington, but I usually have classical artists.  And if new people are coming in all the time I try to you know, spotlight them as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you do like a weekly show--
Speaker 2: Weekly show, Wednesday nights from 10 [p.m.] to 11 [p.m.], weekly, one hour show.
Speaker 1: Now did the show ever interfere with your performances on the road with The Descendants?
Speaker 2: If they do, I you know, I'm not traveling anymore you know so--
Speaker 1: I mean in those days.
Speaker 2: In those days--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I could record, put it in, in advance, you know.  Like I said we weren't out for two and three weeks.  We would you know go to a college and, couple of days at the most, you know.  You do your rehearsal and the concert and come back home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it wasn't a matter of being out for a long period of time, no.  And certainly didn't interfere and if it did I would just tape it another day.
Speaker 1: So, now did you have children during this period of time?
Speaker 2: For--did my husband and I have children?  No, I don't have any children.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.  So you didn't have to worry about trying to take care of children and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --travel and all that.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 55106
Speaker 1: Did your nieces and nephews visit here any?
Speaker 2: Did they visit here?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Occasionally.  Like Spike for instance is you know if there's a specific thing.  Like he came to--whatever--he's there if I need him.  So he came for Howard's, for the dedication of the cultural center [Howard A. Mims Cultural Center, Cleveland, Ohio] for Howard [Mims, husband].  And they used to come more often but people are getting older now and it's harder to travel.  Spike was here I think the last time for Case Western Reserve [University, Cleveland, Ohio] students.  They were--for their benefit and he was the keynote speaker so he came for that and I went to that and he acknowledged my, myself and my other cousin from Detroit [Michigan] who came over, he acknowledged us.
Speaker 1: Well the reason why I was asking was because I wanted to know if you had any indication that Spike Lee or your other nephew, the writer for--
Speaker 2: The Best Man [1999].
Speaker 1: Yeah, The Best Man--
Speaker 2: Malcolm.
Speaker 1: Malcolm, yeah, if you had any idea that they had, that they were going to be involved in movies when they were little, when they were little kids rather than after they got famous?
Speaker 2: If they're going to be what?  I didn't understand.
Speaker 1: Did you see them becoming involved in film prior to them growing up and actually becoming involved?
Speaker 2: Oh, not as kids, no of course not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when Spike was starting out we, you know when he needed money to get started we helped him financially with whatever we could. But Malcolm has not ever asked us for any specific financial help.  He's--I think Spike [Malcom D. Lee] went to Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.] and Spike helped him you know to, because he was already established in the filmmaking business so he helped Malcolm along.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. But you didn't see them as being, having any special talents when they were growing up as--?
Speaker 2: I wasn't with them, you know what I mean?  Spike was at Morehouse [College, Atlanta] and lived in Brooklyn [New York City, New York] and Malcolm also lived in Brooklyn, you know?  So no I, you know I didn't know what they were going to be cause I wasn't in touch with them that closely as they were growing up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to notice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55107
Speaker 1: Now you started another show in 1980 called "Arts Log"?
Speaker 2: "Arts Log" was a little--yeah, Bob asked me to do that.  And it was--they've discontinued that.  That's been discontinued.  But it was a little like five minute interview, everybody in the arts in Cleveland, I could interview anybody in the arts, you know to talk about what they were doing, what was coming up next, like an art show or whatever.  So I did that.  But now the regular announcers do that. They you know, they made that switch so the regular announcers are doing that.
Story_ID: 55108
Speaker 1: I know all week since we've been here people have talked about the theater district here in Cleveland [Ohio], the Cleveland Orchestra, Karamu House, different--is Cleveland a good arts town though, do you think?
Speaker 2: I think so, yes.  I think so.  But you know it's the same as all over the country, the older people are still supporting the arts.  The younger people are not coming along so much.  They're into hip hop and you know different things.  They're just not as supportive of classical music and things like that as the older people are.  It's a problem all over in theaters, concerts, blah, blah, blah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know.
Story_ID: 55109
Speaker 1: And if you noticed, if you notice on television for instance, for instance the Grammys [Grammy Awards], the people that they--are being awarded--and Billboard has a whole list of the top things and I don't know any of those people.  You know if you don't keep--I know Beyonce and you know Mary J. Blige and that kind of person.  But generally I don't know those young people.  It's a different culture now and the music that they like and they know all the words.  They can sing along with the performer but the music generally doesn't have a melody.  I don't know whether you've noticed but that--it, it's not very melodic.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's rhythmic but not melodic. [Laughter].
Speaker 2: So your favorite music is basically the spirituals and the classical music, is that true?
Speaker 1: What, say that again?
Speaker 2: No, I said your favorite music is basically spirituals and classical, right?
Speaker 1: I love jazz too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but depending on what kind of jazz.  I love the Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, you know that era of jazz I love.  But I would say basically, I would say the spiritual and classical would be--and then jazz.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now do you compose any yourself?
Speaker 1: Um-um.  [Shaking head no].
Speaker 2: No?  Okay.
Story_ID: 55110
Speaker 1: Now you're involved also in the William Appling Singers, right?
Speaker 2: I was singing with them.  Bill Appling used to be at Glenville High School [Cleveland, Ohio] as the choral director.  Then he went over to Case which was all men.  They blended Case Western Reserve [University, Cleveland, Ohio] now but Case was basically (unclear).  He went there and worked with all men, worked with that glee club.  Then he went down to Hudson [University, Hudson, Ohio], and had a group.  Then he started this professional group called the William Appling Singers and I was in that. Then he went to Bard College in New York and died just recently.  But it was quite an experience.  And I did some solo work with him but basically it was choral work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55111
Speaker 1: And you also are involved in the Fairmount Presbyterian Church?
Speaker 2: I was their soprano soloist for 20 years.  And that's a big white church here in Cleveland.  And I had to audition for that and everything and worked with the director for 20 years, doing the solos and singing in the choir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Now is that your church here in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: No, I belong to St. James AME [African Methodist Episcopal].  I'm still an AME so I still belong there.  Kept my membership there throughout my Fairmount Presbyterian even though I was at Fairmount every Sunday, September through June basically in the summer the choir didn't have to sing.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did--do you have a favorite I guess selection that you sing that--or a favorite composer?
Speaker 2: That I sing?  Oh, that's pretty hard to say.  I can't say that I do.  You know I, as I said I love the spiritual.  I love you know choral work that involves oratorios and cantatas and all of it involves solos.  I didn't sing much opera but I--some of the Arias that I sang I loved.  But it's hard to pinpoint.  I'm not a good one to tell you my favorite anything because I have a broad area of likes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you still sing?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know sopranos have to give it up after so long.  The lower voices can sing longer but you know for instance Beverly Sills, you know her, the coloratura, you get shakes and the higher you are you get shaky, you know, in those high notes.  So no, I'm passing it on to my students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55112
Speaker 1: And you teach at the Cleveland Musical Settlement?
Speaker 2: Music School Settlement [Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Music School Settlement, yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: And all my students for some years now have come from the Cleveland School of the Arts.  That means 9th through 12th grades.  And Dr. William Woods over there loves the fact that I give my students the spiritual.  I've had some white students too but basically they're all black, that they get the spiritual from me as well as the Italian art songs, English art songs like "Passing By".  And I use the Italian book of songs and arias with them as well and the English book Glenn and Spouse [Mabelle Glenn & Alfred Spouse] with English art songs.  But the Burleigh spiritual they get the--I keep those three going right along.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now have you had a chance to travel overseas as a performer--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or as a teacher?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay.
Story_ID: 55113
Speaker 1: Would you like, I mean did you want to at a certain point?
Speaker 2: Not especially.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was contented with what I was doing, what I was able to do.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now when you--do you have a, I guess a philosophy about music?
Speaker 2: Philosophy about music?  Well I think music, to me should be melodic and uplifting.  If it's a religious work it should make you know make clear that religious feeling such as the works of Brahms' German Requiem.  Many of the--or Handel's Messiah, you know what I mean?  But other than that, I love generally the art songs and the spiritual which has so much meaning, so much meaning.  And I can't say that I have a favorite spiritual but every time I hear one I just can't, I have to move with it, you know.  Like "I Want Jesus to Walk With Me" or "Every Time I Feel The Spirit", you know you feel, I just feel that.  It's just in me.  It's been ingrained in me.
Story_ID: 55114
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there anything major you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: What would I do differently?  You know what, I'm not a good interviewee on that score because I, I've been very pleased with my life.  The things that have, that I've done, I sort of wasn't even expecting them you know.  Like the opportunity to sing, to be a soprano soloist, to sing with my family group.  You know those things I just never expected and I wouldn't have done anything differently.  And with the library, same way, I--everything that I did added to my qualifications or my understanding you know of what I was able to give to the young people.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Sorry about that.  [Laughter].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now once again, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, today, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: What would be my legacy?  Well, I would hope it would be that I had instilled in young people an appreciation of their own culture such as the Negro spiritual and jazz, you know.  And I would like them to know something about their history and the people who came over here from Africa in chains and what they have given to this country.  I would like the fact that I've tried to give some kind of expression to that to the young and old people so that would be what I would hope my legacy would be.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55115
Speaker 1: And what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today in Cleveland [Ohio] and in the rest of the nation?
Speaker 2: I'm most concerned about the fact that we as a people do not seem to appreciate our culture.  That we go with the latest popular thing without understanding the greatness of the original or the derivative things that our people have given to this country in general.  For instance, I like gospel but I like it--Mahalia Jackson was great because she had that deep feeling but now I feel it's costumes and hair and stuff like that.  And we as a people, even in the churches have thrown away the spiritual.  And we in the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church have a hymnal that has included spirituals.  Do you think we sing them?  No.  Some people--and I've tried to get people in my church, AME Church to sing them.  They say, oh it's too sad.  Well the hymns are sad.  How many hymns do you know that are upbeat?  We have some upbeat spirituals but we need to know where we came from and that is my greatest sorrow to see that we just throw away our latest thing.  And even our jazz, the--basically whites are the ones supporting jazz and have sort of taken it over you know as their own whereas we began that and the blues and jazz.  And everything comes from the spiritual.  That is the mother lode.  And the fact that we don't understand that and we don't appreciate it is a thing that disturbs me most today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55116
Speaker 1: I know you have a radio show as a platform for expressing your ideas and feelings.  But now do you--have you ever considered writing a book like, about the trajectory of black music or a history of--?
Speaker 2: No, because I think there are other people who have done that.  Eileen Southern [Eileen Jackson Southern, an African American musicologist, researcher, author and teacher] is one and Mr. Levelle [phonetic] from--he wrote the black, he wrote "Black Song".  He was at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And I think that these people who have--scholars who have been in this area are better qualified than I am to do that kind of thing.  And as you get older you lose your desire to do you know special things like writing.  Writing takes some thrust of youth I think.  I've written a couple of articles.  One was published in Negro History Bulletin, one in a school library journal.  But a book, no I have not considered that.  And on my show, I don't try to get my philosophy over.  I try to talk about the artist and what they're doing and people get that.  And unfortunately, WCLV [FM] is a station of classical music that a lot of blacks don't listen to.  They're listening to the latest rap music or whatever on the radio.  So I have a lot of white audience coming up to me and saying how much they enjoy the show but I don't have that many blacks.  But I just have to do what I have to do.  I'm not on the air to proselytize, you know.  I'm not on there--I just want to present the artists and present the music.
Story_ID: 55117
Speaker 1: Well who would be some of your allies I guess in this area, I guess here in the Midwest or here in Ohio in terms of upholding you know the kind of music that you like and talk about on the show?
Speaker 2: Who are some of my allies?
Speaker 1: Right, amongst--in the African American community?  I mean I can think maybe I don't know if you knew Dr. Eva Jessye [the first black woman to receive international distinction as a professional choral conductor] in Michigan or--
Speaker 2: Which--
Speaker 1: --or George Shirley or I don't know.  I don't know who you would consider some of your allies?
Speaker 2: Well I mean there are quite a few jazz artists in Cleveland, you know.  But as term--in terms of withholding the spiritual I am not sure who that would be really.  [William] Bill Appling's gone.  Well he left Cleveland you know and--oh, Dr. William Woods would be one that I would hold in high esteem because he's at the School of the Arts.  And he's the one who sends me my students in--because one of the reasons being that I teach the spiritual.  And he directs the R. Nathaniel Dett Concert Choir.  He went to Tennessee State yet he named the choir for Dett, who started the music department at Hampton.  And it went to--of course he's an Oberlin graduate.  But Bill Woods, Dr. Bill Woods would be--Bill can do everything.  Kids sing Bach, they sing spirituals, they can do gospel, they can do jazz.  He has a jazz ensemble.  So he's certainly one of the ones that I would hold up as an answer to that question.  Other people have been dying out who have that same philosophy.
Story_ID: 55118
Speaker 1: Do we have any new people on the horizon, any of your students [at Cleveland Music School Settlement] you know, show promise in--?
Speaker 2: You know I don't even discuss that in my voice class.  We go, we do the music, okay?  And when I finish, when they graduate, I've tried--we've had what, for the past ten years at my church with a friend of mine, Sue Jones came to the Settlement and heard my--a couple of my students do their singing recital.  She said, Grace I would love to have them at St. James [African Methodist Episcopal Church].  I said you want them, you got them.  So for the past ten years we've had what we call excellence in the arts and these kids come back if they're studying at Kentucky State [University, Frankfort, Kentucky] or Central State [Ohio Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] or wherever and present a concert.  And the concert has classical music and the spiritual and maybe it could be excerpts from Porgy & Bess or whatever.  She says that she's no longer able to do this so we, we're looking at taking it to Dr. Woods' church, Antioch Baptist Church this year to see if they would take it over.  In the meantime, I have established a scholarship, a $10,000.00 scholarship, with the Cleveland Foundation which is for students who want to pursue their Master's Degree or their Doctorate, but they must also either sing or teach the spiritual.  We have had Kisma Jordan and another young man won, have won that scholarship.  But this year we didn't have anybody who applied.  That's just for Ohio students because I figured if I made it for Ohio, you know it had to be some restriction on it.  But that's what I have done and I would hope that that would help to maintain the spiritual, you know.  The way that Robeson, Roland Hayes, Marian Anderson, Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman and so, on have done.  That's what I'm--why I established that out of my own pocket, $10,000.00 scholarship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at first these students have to reside in Ohio and they do if they go to school in Ohio, you know.  And so that's what I've done.
Story_ID: 55119
Speaker 1: Now tell me about, now the Black Cultural Center or the African American Cultural Center [Howard A. Mims African American Cultural Center] in Cleveland State [University, Cleveland, Ohio] is named for your late husband.
Speaker 2: [Shaking head yes].
Speaker 1: Tell us something about his life and career.
Speaker 2: He of course, Howard went to Hampton [Institute, Hampton, Virginia] that's where we met.  His home is in Detroit [Michigan].  And he liked many of the same things I like because he loved singing, he was a tenor.  And of course he was interested in speech and he--especially what we call Black English, you know.  We have some of the carryover from Africa with some of our, some of the speech patterns.  And he had written some articles on that and he came, when he decided to head up, apply for the job of head of Cleveland State's Black Studies Department, he brought in some wonderful concert artists.  He brought in Florence Quivar and Moses Hogan and so on.  And the Cultural Center always had its director to, you know reported to Howard and Howard set the standard for the Cultural Center.  But it's now headed by Prester Pickett who admired Howard greatly and also has kept in touch with me.  In fact he calls me Mama Mims because I don't have any children.  But Prester has adopted me as his mother.  But he has many programs and he's tell me--he told me recently, he just called me recently to say that he will be doing a program with the star of Breath and Imagination, which the Cleveland Playhouse is now producing.  And it's based on the life of Roland Hayes, the great tenor.  So he's going to do that and he's going to talk about the spiritual in that presentation which I won't be able to go to because that's the day that I go downtown to put my radio show in.  But that's the kind of thing that the Cultural Center is doing and that carries on Howard's commitment to black culture.  And even though he wasn't a professional singer, he loved to sing and he loved the literature of black people like the poets, like Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen and so on.  And he was--his main thing was language, Black English, what black people had come up and had brought from Africa.  Some of the qualifications or characteristics I should say of the Black English that they had carried over. So he was very much into black culture.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm so grateful that they have given the Cultural Center his name and he also--they also established a scholarship for students that are interested in the field of speech pathology at Cleveland State for that department.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55120
Speaker 1: Now is there anything we haven't discussed that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think you've been pretty thorough.  [Laughter].  I can't think of anything.  I have told you mostly everything about my family, about my husband, about my sister and brother and what I think about my commitment to preserving the spiritual.  That's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well thank you and--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: The last question though is a, it's like legacy but it's a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Remembered?  Oh, you sort of covered me there when you asked about my legacy, didn't you?  [Laughter].  I, well I'd like to be remembered number one, as a warm person, that's the first thing.  I, I've always been a friendly person and I think that's what, why the people, the students at Hampton [Institute, Hampton, Virginia] voted me the homecoming queen because I wasn't snooty.  I've never been that way.  I've always been warm.  But I would like to be remembered as one who cared about people and cared about black people and cared about the culture of black people which is basically maintaining the spiritual.  That's how I'd like to be remembered.
Speaker 1: All right, well thank you so much.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 55121
Speaker 1: Now go ahead and tell us about this photograph please [Matthew Hickey The HistoryMakers videographer]?
Speaker 2: This is--oh start?
Speaker 1: Yes please.
Speaker 2: This is my mother, Mrs. Alberta G. Lee.  Her maiden name was Edwards.  Alberta Grace Edwards Lee and she was the most important influence in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay [Matthew Hickey].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Go ahead [Matthew Hickey].
Speaker 2: That's a ticket for our family group, The Descendants of Mike and Phoebe when we appeared at CAMI [Columbia Arts Management, Inc.] Hall in New York [City, New York].  And that was our ticket.  And we've used that symbol as the family has used the names, The Descendants of Mike and Phoebe for our family reunions and we've used that same photo.  This is the--
Speaker 1: Go ahead [Matthew Hickey].
Speaker 2: This is the brochure when I was honored by the National Coalition of 100 Black Women and I was their honoree for 2007, and that whole booklet is--has ads in it and the final ad is from--could you turn to the final page?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: The final--inside.  Put it all the way on.  And the final ad in the book is of my nephew, Spike Lee, and his family.  This is my husband, my late husband, Dr. Howard A. Mims.  And this was done at the dedication of the African American Cultural Center at Cleveland State University.  And that--it's now the Howard Alexander Mims African American Cultural Center.  This was when I was honored by the 100 Black Women as--I was their Woman of Vision.  And that article appeared in the Cleveland Calling Post with a beautiful picture.  This picture is when I was awarded an honorary doctorate at Cleveland State University and this nice article appeared in the Cleveland Music School Settlement where I teach voice.  They put the picture of me in that, in my robe and with my honorary degree in my hands with a nice article.  This is a flyer of our group, our family group, folk ensemble group, The Descendants of Mike and Phoebe in Concert.  And on the back of that, there we are.  It's Consuela [sister] on piano, Cliff [brother] is on trumpet, I sang and then Bill Lee [brother] was on string bass.  Bill and Consuela composed or arranged all the music that we performed.  Here in Cleveland and in Ohio, I performed with A. Grace Lee Mims and Friends.  I formed a group that we went from classical music, we--I hired some jazz men, we hired some dancers and it was a black music festival.  Like I said it's from spirituals to gospel, from rags to jazz.
Speaker 1: Go ahead [Matthew Hickey].
Speaker 2: This was our group at St. James AME [African Methodist Episcopal Church], our Excellence in the Arts.  These are my voice students.  On the, the first person is Sue Jones who is the chairman and (unclear).  And the first person up on the balcony is Mary Searsy [phonetic].  My students next to her, Leonardo Selvaggi who was from the Cleveland Institute of Music who performed.  You see that Carol Childress was the organist, the young man was from, he was a trumpet player, guest soloist.  I have flowers there that the group gave me and Arlicia Shorter [phonetic] is my voice students, Frederick Taylor is my voice student and Ms. Searsy is the mother of Mary.  Here you have my [maternal] grandfather, William James Edwards and my grandmother, Susie V. Edwards, it's a program from the celebration--my sister Consuela went back to re-open Snow Hill Institute [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute] [Snow Hill, Alabama] as Spring Tree, Snow Hill Institute for the Performing Arts.  And this was the centennial year for that, 1983 to 1993.  I did an album of spirituals with William Appling at the, on the piano and this is the cover.  It was an LP, so people who have LP players now can play it or transfer it over to a CD if they have that kind of machine.  This is my grandfather's autobiography, Twenty Five Years in the Black Belt.  And it is in the Cleveland Public Library and also in other libraries around the country.  This is the same book and that's my grandfather on the cover but it was done in paperback by my sister when she went back to re-open the school.  And if you notice on the bottom it says, with an introduction by Daniel J. Williams, he was from Tuskegee [Institute] [Tuskegee, Alabama], and an epilogue by Consuela Lee, my sister.  My cousin, Donald P. Stone, wrote a biography of my grandfather, Fallen Prince, William James Edwards.  And the subtitle was Black Education and the Quest for Afro-American Nationality.
Speaker 1: Do you want to get your cousin's picture on the back?
Speaker 2: That's a picture of Donald, the author of this book.  But Donald was also a member of SNCC, and went to jail for his opposition to the Vietnam War.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about him.  Okay [Matthew Hickey].
Speaker 2: This is my father, Arnold W. Lee, and he was a cornet player and bandmaster as well as an electric engineer.
Speaker 1: Okay [Matthew Hickey] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Can you see that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can see them.
Speaker 2: That there?
Speaker 1: Oh that one.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture there of me as a child.  I'm A. Grace Lee Mims, and my sister, Consuela Lee.  That's when we were children.  I'm glad I put the pages--you can take both of those and I'll tell you, that, that's--
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: Take him too.  This is a picture of my father's brother who died early on.  His name was Bertram Lee.  And this is a picture of my brother Clarence who was named for him, Clarence Bertram Lee, when he was in the army.  That was during the Korean conflict.  I'm glad I put those markers in there.
Speaker 2: [UNCLEAR CHATTER]
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my father holding his oldest son, Arnold and it's, he titled it, The Two Arnolds.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Arnold Wadsworth Lee, Sr. and Arnold Wadsworth Lee, Jr., as a baby.
Speaker 2: I think that's it.
Speaker 1: That's it.
