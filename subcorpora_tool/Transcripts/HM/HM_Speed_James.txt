Speaker 1: Who were the Hancocks?
Speaker 2: The Hancocks was a, a family in Oxford, a family in Oxford that, that owned the land, obviously, that they sharecropped on and that's about as much as I know about that family.
Speaker 1: Do you know if they were affiliated with a plantation?
Speaker 2: No they weren't.  From what I can, what I remember with my grandparents, they did not live on a plan--it wasn't affiliated with a plantation.  It was just land that they owned that they were allowed to sharecrop and they would, you know, harvest the fields and so forth and by the time that they, end of the crop time, by the time they paid off all the money, they didn't have anything leftover but that was, that's kind of what I can remember.  It was always a struggle for them.

Speaker 1: Long life.
Speaker 2: Long life.
Speaker 1: What was his name?

Speaker 1: Was he born a slave?
Speaker 2: He was born a slave.
Speaker 1: And then was able to purchase the land?
Speaker 2: Later able to purchase the land, of which all the land was sold once he died to settle all the, as traditional, to pay for all the taxes and so forth.  The land was sold and the remaining was distributed among the siblings because no one was in the position to, to buy the land individually so sold it and, and split the proceeds among many, many, many family members.  And I can remember this because this was about the time I was probably in third or fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Did you reap any palpable reward?

Speaker 2: Do not, do not know.
Story_ID: 239191
Speaker 1: You were born in Oxford [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I can, I can vividly remember the day that my mother [Elizabeth Allen Speed] received word that her mother [Shophia Allen] had passed and I can remember I was getting ready to go to school that morning.  I was in first grade.  I was getting ready to go to school and my mother's sister's husband came by our house to let us know that my grandmother  had died.  That's something I can still vividly remember today.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about it?  Give me the visual impression.
Speaker 2: It was, I can just remember how, how broken my mom was because she was very close to her mother and she was getting us ready to go to school and she would always brush our hair and so forth to get ready to go to school, and I can remember how she had to just sit on the bed and how she cried from that particular moment and knew it, it took a whole lot out of her, but she was a very strong woman.  And her mother was very, very, a very, very strong woman, very strong personality.  And I can also remember, and even after, if I go back past that time when we were little kids, all of the, all of my mother's siblings, normally on Sundays, all of us would go to my grandmother's house and, you know, we would always, talk about fried chicken, she always cooked some of the best fried chicken and we would all love going to our grandmother's house because, you know, this was, we lived in the town of Oxford and so we had a chance to go right to the country.  And, and they had the pigs out there and they had the horses and the cows and, you know, they raised tobacco and it was just this big old, this big, big farm and, you know, we all would just be there together and just, just play.  It was almost like a family reunion almost every weekend because we all congregated there, and that was even before we all started school.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite memory from the farm?  Your grandmother's farm?
Speaker 2: It was just playing with all of my cousins but I can also, if you fast forward a couple of years from there, I can remember when my, my, oh, I forgot one of my mother's siblings, Rosa [ph.], but I can remember my mother's sister and her husband, Rosa, took over the farm once my grandmother passed and her grandfather then moved to the City of Oxford and they took over the farm.  And I would go out, I can remember when I was twelve years old, I went out, eleven years old, I went out to spend the summer with my Aunt Rosa and her husband and he taught me how to work in tobacco.  So he taught me how to prime tobacco.  He taught me how to drive the slide and drive the tractor, and trying to, you know, at eleven years old, learning to drive a tractor was pretty, pretty interesting.  So I can still remember that but what I also learned from that experience was once he taught me how to prime tobacco that particular one year, at that particular time he had given me a skill at a very young age to be able to now, during summer months, once he stopped farming, for me to make money during my, during the summer months, and I did that when I was around thirteen, fourteen years old.  I would work in the back end of summer for other people but we got paid money to do that.  So that was one of the vivid things I was able to, to get out of that whole experience later on was, it was something that I hated doing at the time, but it gave me an avenue to be able to make money without having to go to anyone else and ask them for money.
Speaker 1: How much did you make?
Speaker 2: I can remember when I first started, when I was about thirteen years old, we were making eight dollars per day to prime tobacco and I remember when I, the next year, well two years later, three years later when I stopped doing that, during the summers, I was making sixteen dollars a day and that was to, that to us was, that was big money.  As a, I guess I was about fourteen then because when I was fifteen, I went on to New Jersey and worked during the summers, but that was about fourteen years old we were making sixteen dollars a day, and that was all day now.  You started early in the morning and you pretty much finished just before dawn.

Speaker 1: Going back to your early childhood, now you had a brother--
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: --or have a brother.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Chester [Speed].
Speaker 1: When was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born February 8th, 1956.
Speaker 1: And something happened during his birth?
Speaker 2: Nothing happened during his birth.  My mother [Elizabeth Allen Speed] became paralyzed after his birth.
Speaker 1: Okay, how, how long after--
Speaker 2: Well she had, well during the birth, right at the time of the birth, she had a stroke during the birth of my brother and became paralyzed on her left side of her body.
Speaker 1: What do you recall visually from that time?
Speaker 2: You mean from my mother's stand?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember, I don't remember, you know, her, obviously coming back from the hospital because at that time I probably was around three years old but we had an aunt of mine who was my, Betty [ph.], who was my dad's [James Speed, Sr.] sister, who at that point in time moved in with us and to help rear the kids because of the condition that my mom was in.  And so, but I also, but the image I always have of my mom, even to, it's the earliest image was, is that even though she was paralyzed on her left side, I mean she did every--I mean, she did housework, she could cook, she could do everything.  She was a fairly, she was a very functional person, even though she was paralyzed.  So that's the image that I have of her is being a functional person and someone who never made excuses and she didn't allow us to make excuses either, by the way.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite, early childhood memory with your mother?
Speaker 2: Always, someone who was always, she was always hugging us, she was always hugging us, she was always touching us, she was always feeling, you know, rubbing your head and she was someone who was always, who was real, a loving individual.
Speaker 1: Did you and your brother play games on the farm?
Speaker 2: Well, now, we didn't live on the farm.  We lived in the, in the City of Oxford [North Carolina].  We would only go to the farm when we visited our grandmother [Shophia Allen] and so forth, so we lived in the, in the City of Oxford because a lot of our cousins, who lived in the country, would always love to come to our house because we lived in the city, but the thing I remember about my brother and the neighborhood is that all the kids in the neighborhood, it was, it was, when you hear it takes a village to raise a child, it was, it was very symbolic of that because in the area that I grew up, you know, everyone knew everyone, your next door neighbors, if you did something wrong, they would right you of your ways and then they would send you home and your parents would take care of you also.
Speaker 1: Do you remember one such incident?
Speaker 2: I remember one such incident when we were at, we were next door at a lady's house by the name of Ms. Irene Harris [ph.], and we had done something, I can't remember what we had done, but something we shouldn't have been doing, and she whipped us.  You know, she spanked my brother, myself and her kids and then she came right across the street and she told my, my mother and my dad and then my dad also whipped us.
Speaker 1: What did they use to whip you?
Speaker 2: Oh, a switch, they'd always have you go outside and they would get you to get a switch.  You may know what a switch is, but you go up the tree and get a switch and you, and you better make sure you didn't get a small switch because if you got a small switch you had to go back and get another one and so we would get our whippings with switches, and I know people who will say today that that was such a horrible thing but I tell you what, it taught us that there was the consequences for everything we did.  And so when you look at it today, I think that's part of our problems today is we don't discipline the kids like that but, yeah, we got whipped with a switch and, and the thing you never wanted to hear my mom  say was, "Wait until your dad gets home" because if you ever said, if she said that, you knew you were in trouble and you better do whatever it was you needed to do before my dad got home.  My dad was a, he was a disciplinarian but he was a, he was a real, my dad was a real outgoing kind of, real friendly kind of person but when my dad spoke to you, or he looked at you, you knew that you better, you better correct your ways.
Story_ID: 239193
Speaker 1: Describe for me your neighborhood.  You said you lived in town [Oxford, North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Right, we lived in town [Oxford, North Carolina] and if you go back to that neighborhood today, you would definitely call it the inner-city but it was a mixed neighborhood.  You know, we had people who were, who were barely making it, but also in that, in those three or four blocks, you also had school teachers and we also had an individual who was one of my mentors, who was a North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] sales agent.
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: Marshall Cooper, and he lived in the next block from us but it was a very mixed neighborhood from the standpoint of education, socioeconomic but everyone got along together and, and everybody's kids played together.  It was a, but at the same end of the spectrum, I can remember when, about four houses up from us, was also a place that they, this is a strange name but they call it the Stronghold [ph.].  I never knew where that name came from but it was called the Stronghold and it had a little club in there, this was when we were small kids, it had a little club in there.  So four houses from our house, there was a place that had a club.  You know, one block up from that, or two blocks up from my house, there was a pool hall, had three or four pool halls, as you would almost enter Main Street there and then if I went two blocks down to the right of me, there was a church that we attended, First Baptist Church [Oxford, North Carolina].  So there was the church there.  So that was, it was a, I would say a, a basic stereo-African American neighborhood back then when there were a lot of different things going on in those community.  A lot of different educational levels and economic levels all in the same neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Who do you remember?
Speaker 2: And you knew, and you knew every, and you knew everybody in that neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the leaders in the community?
Speaker 2: One of the leaders, Marshall Cooper.  Mr. Marshall Cooper was a North Carolina Mutual sales agent that I can still remember one of the reasons I decided to go to college is because several of us in the community said that whatever it was Mr. Cooper did, is what we wanted to do because he wore a necktie every day.  And so here was, other than a teacher or preacher, this was one of the few guys in our neighborhood who also wore a necktie.  Now, if you extend beyond our neighborhood to some of the other areas, you had another individual by the name of Mr. John Peace [ph.].  Mr. John Peace was also a North Carolina Mutual sales agent, and then Mr. Alfonso Landis [ph.] was also a North Carolina Mutual sales agent.  So everyone in that neighborhood knew the North Carolina Mutual sales agents.
Story_ID: 239194
Speaker 1: What did you know about North Carolina Mutual at that time?
Speaker 2: I did--all I knew was Mr. Cooper would come by the house, he would collect the 25 or 50 cents for the insurance and his, his kids and his family, they lived a pretty good, what we considered a pretty good lifestyle.  You know, they got new--
Speaker 1: Describe their life?
Speaker 2: Their lifestyle.  You know, they would get new cars fairly often.  Had a very nice house.  You know, when we would get Christmas gifts and, and we can still remember, we would get football uniforms and our football uniforms might have been what you would have called getting your uniform, if you will, at Walmart.  Their uniform, may have, if they sold football uniform at that time, may have come from Dillard's or some higher end store than what we were able to get.  So they had some of the better things in life but his kids fit in with everyone else and it wasn't like they were at another level because he was a very giving guy.  He also was, he taught at our Sunday school, pillar in our church, but that's what I remember of North Carolina Mutual, and, and each one of those individuals that worked for North Carolina Mutual were leaders in that, in our community.  Other--
Speaker 1: Did they tell you the story of North Carolina Mutual?
Speaker 2: Well they didn't, they didn't, but then later on I learned a little bit more about North Carolina Mutual when my sister came to work for North Carolina Mutual later on after she had finished high school and had gone to Durham Business College [Durham College, Durham, North Carolina] here in town.
Speaker 1: What's your sister's name?
Speaker 2: Brenda [ph.].
Speaker 1: And what year was she born?
Speaker 2: Brenda was born November 27th, 1950.
Speaker 1: Was she the oldest?
Speaker 2: She was the oldest.
Speaker 1: Were there three children?
Speaker 2: Three children.
Speaker 1: And she went to work for North Carolina Mutual?
Speaker 2: She came to work for North Carolina Mutual.  She was, she was in, she was attending Durham Business College, here in town, it's no longer there now, and after about, after attending school for almost a year, she decided to get married and then when she got married, she decided she was going to leave school but she got a job here at North Carolina Mutual and she worked here probably eight or nine years here.
Speaker 1: And what was her job?
Speaker 2: She worked in the new business and she also worked in new business and the claims area at one time.  And I can remember when I was attending North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina], I can remember when I used to come up to North Carolina Mutual and, and she would lend me five dollars and so I would come up and I'd catch the elevator up to, I think the third or fourth floor where they were then, and she'd come out to the elevator and she'd give me five dollars.  It was supposed to be a loan but she'd never gotten paid back to this day.
Story_ID: 239195
Speaker 1: Tell me about your church.
Speaker 2: My church was First Baptist Church in Oxford, North Carolina.  First Baptist Church, we had a, I can remember we had a pastor by the name of Reverend Louis Wade and I can remember when this was in the early childhood, when Reverend Wade was, I remember when he ran for, I want to say it was either county or city commissioner, and the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and his, the parsonage was right next door to the church, and the Ku Klux Klan burned the cross in his yard because he was African American who was running for county commissioner of Oxford, but we also, I can still remember going to Sunday School every morning and we had people like Mister, Mr. Keratin [ph.].  Mr. Keratin also, when you talk about some influential people, Mr. Keratin ran a shoe shop and later on in life, I would, I would shine shoes there, but anyway, he taught the Sunday school there.  It was a, it was, as I look back today, it was kind of a stuffy church, somewhat, from the standpoint of you didn't see a lot of people there who would shout.  You didn't see a lot of people who would, it was pretty much, everybody that kind of wanted to be a little dignified--
Story_ID: 239196
Speaker 1: Tell me about First Baptist Church [Oxford, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Well, First Baptist Church is where I attended, during my childhood, up through, until I left to go to college [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], but it was a, it was a church where it was, in terms of today was, it was almost be kind of stuffy, if you will, during the service, if you will, because, you had a lot of your teachers who attended there, you had some of your more well-to-do people.  Now, we didn't fit that category, it was just that we only lived two blocks away from the church so all, it was a, it was a very diverse church, if you will, from the standpoint, again, education level, economics and so forth, but I can remember that the services weren't real rejoice-ish [ph.], you didn't find people who were really shouting, people saying, "Amen," you pretty much came there and you finished and you left.  But I do remember the Sunday schools because the Sunday schools, Mr. Keratin [ph.], who, who ran our, one of the prominent people in the neighborhood who owned a shoe shop, he was one of our Sunday school teachers.  And then I can also, in addition to the Sunday school, which we were required to attend, you know, every Sunday, and even as you became a teenager, you were going, it didn't, what time you got home that night, on Saturday night, you were going to church on Sunday morning.  But I also can remember when we were smaller kids and we attended vacation bible school and I can remember so vividly, we all would attend vacation bible school because every day, at the end of the bible school, they'd serve watermelon, and all the kids would come to be, at the end of the day, to get watermelon, but we had, and then we also had a church picnic and the church picnic was, we'd all get on a bus, and we would come, we would go to Raleigh, North Carolina to a place called [John] Chavis [Memorial] Park [Raleigh, North Carolina] and that was kind of a gathering place for a lot of African American churches around the State of North Carolina to come to Chavis Park because they had a swimming pool and if you can imagine in most of our towns, they didn't have swimming pools for African Americans to swim in so most of us would find a local pond or whatever and that's what we swam in.  So, that, that's a lot of the thing.  I can also remember being a part of the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts [of America].  Remember some of those Cub Scouts are den mothers.  I was back in my home town just a couple of weeks ago and there was a lady named Ms. Davis [ph.] who was one of my den mothers and I saw her and so it--
Speaker 1: What kinds, what kinds of things did you do with the Cub Scouts?
Speaker 2: Well with the Cub Scouts, we, I remember one of the, I remember one of the vivid trips that we had was, we caught a train and went to Richmond, Virginia to the Confederate museum [American Civil War Museum, White House and Museum of the Confederacy, Richmond, Virginia] and I can remember I was running a tad late and one of the parents was just getting ready to leave the church, so when I showed up, he had to take me over to Hender--you had to go to Henderson, North Carolina which was about fifteen miles away in order to catch the train.  And I can remember, but that was one of the big things we would do is every now and then we would have an opportunity to go on trips.  And then, also, as we got a little bit older, we would start going camping, just before we would move into the Boy Scouts and there was our scout master, was an individual by the name of Mr. Irving Parker [ph.].  And I can remember I used to really love to go camping because, you know, it gave you a chance to kind of get with the boys and we would have our tents and we would be cooking out and I can remember I said, "When I get to be an adult, I want to be a scout master like Mr. Irving Parker."  Now, I never did that because later on my schedule didn't allow but I can vividly remember us going camping and we used to always have the scout jamborees and we would come to Raleigh for the jamborees and, you know, we would have to compete and we would make the little derby cars that we would enter into the races and so forth.  And we had scooter races and it was a lot of crafts that we did as Cub Scouts.  And then you had to remember all the mottos and so forth, but it was a great experience because it, they taught us a lot about responsibility.  They taught us a lot about accountability.  They taught about integrity and those kind of things, that as you look back today, you know some of those things that, that assisted in making us who we are today, in addition to your parents giving you a firm foundation at home before you got to the Cub Scouts.
Speaker 1: Who was the pastor of your church?
Speaker 2: Okay, the pastor of the church at that time was Reverend Louis Wade.  Now, that--
Speaker 1: And you said he, there were some conflict with the KKK [Ku Klux Klan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when he ran for either city commissioner or county commissioner.  I can remember when they burned the cross in his yard because he ran and this was back in the '60s [1960s].  And then later on, a pastor by the name of Reverend Percy [L.] High, and Reverend Percy High, a few years later, was there just before, I think, I went off to college.  So I remember those two pastors that were there during my childhood and teenage years.  And then Percy High later moved to Durham [North Carolina], here, and pastored a church here in Durham and Reverend Wade left and went to New York and pastored a church in New York.

Speaker 1: What schools did you attend?
Speaker 2: I attended, the first school I attended was Orange Street Grade School [Orange Street School, Fayetteville, North Carolina] and I attended there from first through fourth, and it was only two blocks from my house so we could walk to that school.  And I can still remember having, just great experiences there.  I can remember all of my teachers that were there.  I remember my first grade teacher was, was Ms. Eason [ph.] and my second grade teacher was Ms. Reese [ph.] and my third grade teacher was Ms., Ms. Hawley [ph.], and then one of my favorites was my fourth grade teacher, a lady by the name of Ms. Louise Bibby, and she played a very important role that I think who I became later on because I can still remember her.  She always had positive thing to say about her kids and I can remember one day I had, I had gone to the board and, to do a math problem because back then they would call you to the board to do math problems, and I went up to do the math problem and I got it right.  And she says, "Oh, [HistoryMaker] James [Speed], you're a wonderful math student," and I can still remember she rubbed me on the head and she said, "you are a wonderful math student."  So, as I tell kids today, if there was a subject that I had to do in the fourth grade, guess what it was?  It was always math because she had told me I was a good math student.
Speaker 1: So that positive reinforcement really encouraged--
Speaker 2: That positive reinforcement was, was really important from that standpoint and she was just a person who was a very attractive lady.  I still, we all still remember Ms. Bibby being a very attractive lady but she was so positive and she was always encouraging about what we can do and what we can become that she really, I remember she was my favorite teacher and motivated me greatly.  So--
Speaker 1: Did you do well in math?
Speaker 2: I did well in math.  I'm a CPA [Certified Public Accountant] by profession, okay, so I did well in math.
Speaker 1: And what about the other subjects?
Speaker 2: And then the other subjects, I, they were okay, and I kind of liked them but she made me really want to do math and because, it is, she said you were good at it and you respected her and so you worked at it and you wanted to be good, so whenever there was a problem that, in math that she wanted somebody to go to the board, then I'd just be raising my hand and wanting to go up to, get to the board because all I wanted was that little bit of affirmation that James, you've done a good job, and--
Speaker 1: What year did you finish Orange Street Grade School?
Speaker 2: Orange Street Grade School would have been 19--summer of '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember what was going on racially in your county at this time?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Were you attending a school that was all-black?
Speaker 2: All-black.  It was all-black school and also, remember, in that, yeah, so it was an all-black school, don't remember a lot of racial thing going on because it was, it was, you know, it was, everything was segregated and we really didn't, wasn't concerned or didn't know what was going on at the white schools and none of that stuff because it was, at that age, it just, it just didn't concern us because all we knew at that time was, you know, these black schools.
Speaker 1: So, so the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision did not affect you?
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't, not to the point that at that time we, we knew much about it at that time.
Story_ID: 239198
Speaker 1: Where did the white families live?
Speaker 2: The white families lived, okay, the white families lived half a mile from where we lived, you know, and one of the streets where my church was on, Granville Street and Front Street [Oxford, North Carolina].  Well, if you would go down Front Street, two, two to three blocks, well you'd go two blocks, three blocks down Front Street, you cross one street, African American lived, the next street, the whites lived, and, and that would go on for several blocks.  So, there were pockets of, if you looked at the whole area, there were pockets where whites lived, there were pockets where African Americans lived.  And there was, there was almost a clearly, clear divide, if you will, clear divide.  You saw no, I lived on Granville Street, you saw no white families lived on Granville Street.  On, on Front Street, there were, there were whites who lived on Front Street because there was the pocket between Front and Raleigh Road, if you will, that, that white families lived.
Speaker 1: Did these families interact?
Speaker 2: No, other than where African Americans worked for those family as domestics, that was the interaction.
Speaker 1: Were the house sizes different?
Speaker 2: Yes, the house sizes were different.  You know, they--
Speaker 1: What did you see?  Describe.
Speaker 2: Well, they were the, very large Victorian-looking houses, some of these, particularly if you would ride down Oxford [North Carolina], on Main Street today, with the large columns.  They would be, sometimes, brick in structure but very nice houses.
Speaker 1: These are the white houses?
Speaker 2: The white peoples, so as you would pass by these houses, it was like, who in the world kind of live in these houses because, but you knew it was white people, and as we would walk from our neighborhood to the next African American, sometime you would walk through those white communities, like on Front Street, to get to the African American communities, but the houses was vastly different.  Now, if you would take some of the people like I was talking about, Mr. Marshall Cooper who was the North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] sales agent, you know, he didn't have a, a great big house, but the house he had was very nice, that was similar on the scale of some of the white people's houses, but--
Speaker 1: Was, was there any conflict that you recall between the races?
Speaker 2: Not until, not until later on, when I, when I became, when I got into [J.F. Webb] High School [Oxford, North Carolina]--
Story_ID: 239199
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, high school, but let me do my elementary--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I also attended Mary Potter High School [Oxford, North Carolina], well, at elemen--from the fifth grade until the tenth grade, through the tenth grade, I attended Mary Potter, it was Mary Potter High School but it was made up of elementary school and, and the high school.  So I started there in the fifth grade and then I can remember the sixth grade, they started to integrate schools.  And we had a few friends that then went to the white elementary school but, or the middle school at that time, and we stayed at Mary Potter.
Speaker 1: Which friends went to the white school?
Speaker 2: One of my close friends was an individual by the name of Frank Rogers [ph.] and Frank Rogers and another friend by the name of Paul McCoy [ph.], and they went to the, to the white schools, and we stayed at Mary Potter.  Now, I can, I can remember when we were probably at around the sixth grade or so, when we would, when we would walk home, again, we would leave this black neighborhood and then as we walked through downtown Oxford [North Carolina], occasionally, there would be other white kids who would be walking, you know, home also and every now and then there would be, there would be racial slurs that would, would flare up and, and at that particular time, during those, that was to the extent of, that was to the extent of any conflict, I would say, between the African American kids.  Now, we also were starting to realize that at that particular time, that there were a lot of other things that were going on in the neighborhoods from the standpoint, like the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] burning the cross and you would hear these things.  Now, other than that incident, I normally didn't see any of these incidents.  Now, however, I will tell you I left North Carolina, I left Mary Potter when I was in tenth grade and, again, that was another very nurturing period of time where even in the early high school years, you know, I had the opportunity to play basketball so we had a coach that was, you know, talked about being the best and just molded us into always being high achievers and then the, all of our instructors were making sure in English and those math courses that we were some of the best that they, so when we left there in, out of tenth grade and we went to J.F. Webb High School [Oxford, North Carolina]--
Speaker 1: Now tell me the name of your basketball coach.
Speaker 2: James Mosely [ph.].  James Mosely and an individual by the name of Marlin Tate [ph.].  Marlin [Tate] [ph.] was the assistant coach.  Marlin Tate had gone to Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama], had been a football player there but anyway, these were guys who just would work you to death and, but it made us, made us so much better people, if you will.  So now with that kind of training that we got from, from Coach Mosely and the training that we got from all those teachers who wanted to make sure we were the best, we left Mary Potter at the end of our sophomore year because for those kids who wanted to play athletics, they were only going to keep Mary Potter open one additional year and then that one additional year was for the transition year.  So, the last class was 1970 at Mary Potter, we left in 1969, but the main reason that a lot of my, my friends and I left was because of the fact that we wanted to play athletics and in order to play athletics, we had to move then to the predominantly white school.  But they also consolidated four other African, well, three other African American schools.  A school called [G.C.] Shaw High School [Oxford, North Carolina], Toler [sic. Stovall High School, Oxford, North Carolina], T-O-L-E-R [sic.], Shaw High School, Toler and Mary Potter, our high school [High School, Oxford, North Carolina], into J.F. Webb Senior High School.  So they took those schools and consolidated them all into, and that was in 1969, '70 [1970], my first junior year.  And what we found there is when we moved over to J.F. Webb, those kids, like myself and several other of my friends like Willie Darvin [ph.] who's an attorney today over in Oxford and a minister, and several other friends that have done extremely well, we all moved and went to Webb and was able, and I think, some of the kids were really surprised that we could compete with them, I mean, at the highest level and we all went onto college and have done very, very well--
Story_ID: 239200
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  So this was an integrated school [J.F. Webb High School, Oxford, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: This was an integrated school but when, it integrated because we brought three high schools together.  It was, it was about 50/50.  Now, to show you the impact there, our senior year, all the class officers, the vice president, I meant the president, vice president, treasurer, secretary, all were African Americans.  And so we're about a 50/50 and I understand once we left, that class finished, I think, they implemented a rule that says, every other year you had to have a black or white as president, you couldn't, because at that point in time, we had dominated and now I believe our president of also the student body was also an African American.  But also, there were, you know, Ben Chavis [HistoryMaker Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.], who was formerly of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], Ben Chavis graduated from Mary Potter High School [Oxford, North Carolina], but--
Speaker 1: Were there friendships across racial lines?
Speaker 2: There was, I think the class that we had, I think the class that we had did bear friendship across racial lines, yes.  I think, when we went to Webb High School, I think athletics played a big part in that.
Speaker 1: So you were on the basketball team?
Speaker 2: Yes, so we, we had a very good, we had a fairly good basketball team but when we first moved to, to Webb, we had a very young, we got a young white guy who became our coach.  He had maybe been out of college for about three years and Mr. Mosely [ph.], who had been coaching for years and year and years, he had to be the assistant.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name, the young white coach?
Speaker 2: Yes, Steve Holloman [ph.], and I still speak and talk to him today.
Speaker 1: Was he fair?
Speaker 2: He was very fair and the reason that I say he was very fair is when he selected the basketball team for that '69 [1969], '70 [1970] team, we had thirteen players, eleven African Americans.  Now, for the first few games we had, it was very few white people.  Now the students would come but very few white adults would come to support us until we became, we ran a record of about 7-0, and then the community started to get behind us but he was a very fair coach because he, he picked the most talented thirteen players that went out for that team and we had about seventy-five people to go out for that team that year.
Speaker 1: Did you want, at that time, were you dreaming of becoming a professional basketball player?
Speaker 2: I think every kid wanted to do that, yes, very much so--
Story_ID: 239201
Speaker 1: What was your academic favorite subject at this time?
Speaker 2: Still math.  I still liked math at that time but also a significant event took place during that, that junior year [at J.F. Webb High School, Oxford, North Carolina].  There was an African American that was shot in cold blood at a convenient store.
Speaker 1: Was this Henry Marrow, or [Henry] "Dickie" Marrow?
Speaker 2: "Dickie" Marrow and this was a book that has been written by a guy by the name of Dr. Tim Tyson, called 'Blood Done Sign My Name' [Timothy B. Tyson] and in that book he talked about "Dickie" Marrow.  Well "Dickie" Marrow had a brother named Ronnie Marrow [ph.].  Ronnie Marrow was on our basketball team, a very good friend, and known him since we were real small kids, this was his brother, and we can remember when, when the word started passing that, that "Dickie" Marrow had been shot by Robert Teel at the convenient store [Tidewater Seafood Market, Oxford, North Carolina] in a place called Grab-all, or Grab-all, that was the name of the community and, in which hence the book was written about 'Blood Done Sign My Name' and at that particular time, racial, there was an eruption of racial tension at that particular time two blocks up from Granville Street [Oxford, North Carolina] where I lived, I can remember the, the red flames of a, of a warehouse burning and it was a large warehouse facility.  It set on fire and just burned and there were, there was a lot of racial tension, there was curfews that was established and that took place during the summer of 1970 and so I didn't, I didn't experience that whole gamut of activities because I mentioned to you I primed tobacco until fourteen.  When I became, after I finished my, I take that back, this was, yeah, the summer of '69 [1969] was the first summer we started going to Wildwood, New Jersey to work because we could make a lot more money in a resort town and there were several guys who played basketball with us and the basket--who were older than we were who would go to New Jersey and they would work and was able to get paid a lot better than you could working at the, in the tobacco fields.  So, right after that incident got started, the warehouse burns down and this was my second year that we all left to go work in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: What kind of work?
Speaker 2: Well we worked as, we worked as bus boys, we cleaned up movie theaters, we worked in a laundry, in the washroom and also in the, where the pressroom where they would press the sheets and the, and the pillowcases and so forth.  We were dishwashers at restaurants.  We were short order cooks at restaurants.  Those were the kind of, just at a resort, and you've got these teenage kids who'd go to New Jersey and we could make, at that time minimum wage of about a dollar sixty cents an hour, which was a lot of money to these young black kids who had come from Oxford who were used to making sixteen dollars per day.
Speaker 1: So this, this case involving "Dickie" Marrow, was it Ku Klux Klan [KKK] related?
Speaker 2: Well I can't say it was Ku Klux Klan related but it was, it was racial prejudice at the center of it all.  You know, there were, there were rumors that Robert Teel was part of the Ku Klux Klan but also there was a group of African Americans who had just come back from [the] Vietnam [War] and they kind of spearheaded a lot of the activity around the African American community, forming that, putting together to basically fight back, if you will.  There was also an individual like Ben, Ben Chavis [HistoryMaker Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.] who, at the time, also was forming a group that was more or less organizing the African American community and so those were the kind of activities that were taking place during that time.
Speaker 1: Was Robert Teel ever arrested?
Speaker 2: Let's see now.  Robert Teel was later arrested but I do, but he was found guilty, I meant guilty, he was found innocent.
Speaker 1: And did that create some outrage in the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, by the time that happened, there was several years that had passed and so I think some of that anger and so forth had passed along because it was years after this finally took place.  So it was almost, no one ever served time for killing "Dickie," "Dickie" Marrow.
Story_ID: 239202
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate high school [J.F. Webb High School, Oxford, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1971.
Speaker 1: And where did you go next?
Speaker 2: I went to North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: How did you choose that school?
Speaker 2: Interesting.  There was a lady by the name of Ms. Rosetta Amos [ph.].  Ms. Rosetta Amos was a school teacher and she had a nephew by the name of Kevin, Kevin Holloway [ph.], and Kevin had gone to another school but he had gone to another African American school that was what they called at the time, the orphanage [The Central Orphanage of North Carolina] and this was what today is called the Central Children's Home [of North Carolina, Inc., Oxford, North Carolina] where all the black orphan kids would come to Oxford [North Carolina] and go to, they would be at the institution there and they had a school there.  Anyway, Kevin came to, to Mary Potter [High School, Oxford, North Carolina] when we were all in ninth grade and we became very close friends, a group of us, and when we were juniors, Ms. Rosetta, she was a North Carolina Central [North Carolina College, Durham, North Carolina] alum, and her and Kevin would always go to the football games.  Well, we had never been to a college football game, a couple buddies of mine.  So she invited us one Saturday to come to North Carolina Central with Kevin to watch the football game and I remember it was 1969, North Carolina Central was playing Morgan State [College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and it was such an exciting game and North Carolina Central ended up winning because both had great teams.  And at the end, the band was playing, I'd love to go to NCC, it was called North Carolina College at the time, and it was just this whole excitement around us.  I mean, it was like no other place you had been and we all, at that particular time, said it was, three other guys who were, who went along with us, and we all said, we have to go to North Carolina Central.  Well in the process, we went back home and convinced four more of our friends that they also needed to come to North Carolina Central.  So in 19--now, this was our junior year.  So, we worked on these guys all during our senior year and all of us, there were eight of us who decided we were going to North Carolina Central University--
Story_ID: 239203
Speaker 1: How did you afford your education?
Speaker 2: I worked.  Didn't, and I was also, I was so naive at the time, that I didn't even realize that I could have, that I could, that I qualified for loans.  I didn't even have a clue.  All I knew was, I was going to college and whatever it took, I was going to do that.  So, during the summers, when we would go to Wildwood [New Jersey], I would work, save enough money, save enough money to, now this is my first, save enough money that when I came back I was able to pay my tuition.  So that, I remember that and then I had a few, I don't think I had, I think I had one work study for a very short period of time but pretty much worked during those summers, saved the money and paid for my tuition in my freshman year.  And then my sophomore year, I did the same thing and then in my junior year, after my sophomore year, one of the things I had gotten pretty good at was playing cards and there was a game called Tonk and when I was growing up, I had, I had never played cards.  Well, I would always play with my dad [James Speed, Sr.], that's kind of how we learned how to count really, playing cards with my dad, and he would teach us all these games.  So, a couple of friends of mine, we started playing when we were about seniors in high school, none of us had ever really gambled before but what we started doing was playing cards and got pretty good at this so we'd then go to college and while at college we got pretty, we even got better at doing this.  So, on some of the weekends, I would go back home and a lot of my friends who didn't go to college would go by a place called the card house and the card house was a place where, you know, everybody would congregate and they would pretty much just gamble.  Now, most of my friends knew that I wasn't a person who normally would gamble.  So, but they didn't know I had gotten pretty good while I was at North Carolina Central.  And so I came back one weekend and I won several hundred dollars.  And so it wasn't later on and I had gotten to be pretty decent at this so a couple of weeks before tuition was due, I'd go back to Oxford, I'd play cards and I won enough money to pay tuition.
Speaker 1: What was tuition at that time?
Speaker 2: Tuition was a couple thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: Who was the president of North Carolina Central when you were there?
Speaker 2: [Dr.] Albert [N.] Whiting.
Speaker 1: What do you remember of him?
Speaker 2: I don't remember a lot of, I remember what he looked like, I'll also tell you when I was an undergrad, I had a great time in undergrad.
Speaker 1: What did you do?
Speaker 2: Went to a lot of parties.
Speaker 1: What kind of parties?  Fraternity parties?  Sorority parties?
Speaker 2: Well all kind of parties.  I remember when we first went to orientation our freshman year, and the eight guys that went, us from Oxford, we had gone to orientation and the thing they told us in orientation is, there's a place called the college plaza that we recommend that everyone stay away from.  So, as soon as we got out of orientation, the first place that we decided to go to was the college plaza and the college plaza was probably about three or four blocks away from North Carolina Central and there was apartments there, it was a lot of students who lived there and you got to imagine, most of these students had come to North Carolina Central, had come from these rural areas, also had an opportunity to now to be on their own, have their own apartments and we just had a wonderful time, have a great time.  So, when I also look at it from my first couple of years at North Carolina Central, I wouldn't say I had exhibited all of my academic skills at that time even though I had been a very good student in high school, all of a sudden, you know, I just figured my goals at that time was to, to do two things.  One was, when I got out of college, I wanted to get a job making ten thousand dollars, I wanted to have a lot of fun and I wanted to, just get by.  So those were kinda the goals.
Story_ID: 239204
Speaker 1: I'm going to bring you back, quickly, to Oxford [North Carolina] and you were telling me about one of the recreational activities involving scooter-like games?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the things, as I talked about this, this neighborhood that we had, one of the things that I also can remember is that you, you see, hear of skateboarding today.  Well what we were able to do is we made something called a scooter and you would take a roller skate that wasn't in the best condition anymore, you take it apart, you took the back part of the, of the skate and you nailed it on the end of a piece of plank and then on the front you put the front part on and then you nailed the piece of wood like perpendicular here and you put a handle on it and that's what you was, like a scooter, like you see today, and we made our own scooters.  And it was the most fun because we'd have scooter races but everybody would make a scooter and I can remember I had a scooter in the Cub Scouts one time and won a scooter race because we built the scooters and then we had a chance to paint the, you would paint the planks and so forth, but then roller skating was a big thing.  Everyone at Christmas would always get roller skates and by the time next Christmas came around, you had worn those roller skates out because, again, we lived in the city and it was nothing to see a bunch of kids on the street, on the sidewalks, roller skating.
Speaker 1: Nice.
Speaker 2: Wonderful time.
Story_ID: 239205
Speaker 1: So, carrying this theme to college at North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina], were you involved in sports or other recreational activities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played, I played, at that time, we had freshman basketball so I played fresh--the walk-on played played freshman basketball, was fortunate enough to earn a starting position there and, and then after, I saw that this was a little bit different than playing in high school.  Well, first of all, you see a lot of the guys who were pretty good but then I also saw the time that required to play basketball and at that time I was having a pretty good time.  So after that, after that freshman year I decided, "Ah, I think I'm done with basketball."  I wanted to be a professional whatever, you kind of given up that and that's when we started to, you know, to doing the parties and, on the weekends I was going back home, you know, playing cards to get tuition money and those kind of things and, and those eight guys that came from Oxford, we were still all on the same hall in [Howard J.] Chidley Hall at North Carolina Central, we all, eight of us, we split up into four pieces and we were roommates with each other and just, we just had a great time and we, all eight of us are still just wonderful friends today.  All of our families are still friends.  Some of us go on vacations together and so forth.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the political climate on campus?  Was there ever any talk about the Vietnam War or any sort of reverberations from the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can, I can remember the, our freshman year.  At this time they were, they were moving away from the draft into the lottery system.  And so all of us was congregated together in Chidley Hall to figure out, you know, because, what number we got in the lottery.  And we were all so relieved because of the fact that most of us, other than one guy, had gotten, one of our friends who, well, he happened to, I don't know why he was there, he was with us, but he went to East Carolina [University, Greenville, North Carolina] at the time but he had a real low draft number and later on went to the [U.S. military] service but all of us had, I had, my number was like 300 something so I wasn't worried.  So that was the big deal during that year was the draft had stopped, none of us wanted to go to the service and, and so having those high numbers in the draft was great for us.  I do remember at that time, there still was somewhat of a mood of, don't remember many protests or whatever when I was at Central as it related to the Vietnam War, but it was a strong move towards equality, a strong move towards equality because, again, this was the '70s [1970s], it was, you know, the popular song, "It's your thing, do what you want to do" ['It's Your Thing'], kind of thing, it was, it was that kind of attitude, kind of rebellious, real laid back and not a lot of structure among us.
Speaker 1: Now you hear about some of the freedom on a majority white campuses, you know, free love and that kind of thing and, you know, drugs, and that kind of thing, maybe in some of the pop--anti-war population.  Did any of that trickle into--
Speaker 2: Those things were also prevalent at, at North Carolina Central, during that period of time.
Speaker 1: What do you remember?
Speaker 2: I can, as we talk about, as we talk about the parties.  Now, I think at North Carolina Central, at a lot of the parties, you didn't see the, you didn't see the real hard drugs at that time.  There was a lot of marijuana.  There also was a lot of drinking and everyone making their spiked punch and so forth, but not real, real radical from the standpoint of the drug scene, but, but people were pretty free-spirited back then.
Speaker 1: And free love, the free love movement.  Did that make its way to campus?
Speaker 2: That made its way to campus.  We'll leave that there.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  Were you involved in any other clubs on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was involved in a social fraternity, Alpha Phi, Alpha Phi Omega, which was a social fraternity, also involved in the National Association of Black Accountants [NABA].  I was an accounting major, in the NABA.  Also involved in a group called [Future Business Leaders of America-]Phi Beta Lambda [FBLA-PBL] which was a business society but that was the extent at that time of my, my organization because of the fact that up until I got to be about a junior, and like I said, my goals were to have fun and to, and to just get by, and I was achieving both of those, up until about my junior year--
Story_ID: 239206
Speaker 1: What was your best subject?
Speaker 2: Again, I liked those math courses and the, and the accounting courses, but just, just didn't put forth the, like in my accounting courses, I didn't put my greatest effort towards those courses, the way I look back and I should have at the time.  Now one thing happened though is in my junior year, I started saying, well, you know, you do have to get you a job when you get out of here so you, and then I had a professor by the name of Mr. Ray Thompson.  Ray Thompson was our accounting advisor and I can always remember Mr. Ray Thompson telling me, he said, [HistoryMaker] James [Speed], you know what he says, you have a lot of potential, but he said, you know what potential is?  I said, no sir, what is it?  He said, potential means you're not doing what you should be doing and I remember that from Mr. Thompson and so I started to get a little bit more involved.  I said, okay, I've got to get me a job, maybe, so then I start, you start at that point in time, started to see the, the James Speed that should have been, in his freshman, sophomore year, start come out, started getting better grades.  And then when I became a senior, and I started doing interviews, and people would ask me what my GPA was, now it wasn't bad but it wasn't where I could be.  My GPA at the time, I think it was something like about a 2.8 out of a possible four.  Now that wasn't bad, but when the people would ask me what my GPA is, I would almost say it kind of sheepishly, or be embarrassed to say it because of the fact that I knew I had not done my best.  So during that senior year, I made the dean's list, both semesters.  I mean, it's almost like, well, Speed get on the dean's list.  I mean, because, then you started to saying, I really got to go to work but the thing I also remember too is that I think I had, I must have had in my senior year, I know I had twenty some interviews and some of my friends used to always say, "Man, why do you keep going to that career center on those interviews because you're not going to get a job and, why do you keep doing it?"  And I always told them, I said, "Hey, I only need one job."  "I don't need twenty, I need one job."  So the result of that, I went through several of those interviews, got several rejections but it did something for me.  It also taught me, again, what we can learn back at athletics, persistency.  Persistency in that the only way you lose, is you just give up or you just quit and that had always been instilled from my dad [James Speed, Sr.] and my mother [Elizabeth Allen Speed] and those people in that community is, if you just don't quit, you always win.  So, taking that philosophy, I kept, and in fact I got a job at PPG Industries [Greensboro, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: And what is that?
Speaker 2: PPG was currently known as Pittsburgh Plate Glass [Company] at the time but they, the name was shortened to PPG Industries.  They did chemicals, glass manufacturing, and I went to work for them and now I got that job and I had one other job that was--
Speaker 1: What year, what year did you get that job?
Speaker 2: That was, that was 1975, and so I had gotten that job but I had also had one other offer from, from, I think it was, Cargill Corporation up in Minneapolis, Minnesota and after the first visit up there in the snow, I knew if I got an offer, that would not be the place I'd be going, but then Pittsburgh was my second choice 'cause that was the only other offer I got.  So, but by then I had, I had started to say, okay, I really got to get a little bit better at what I'm doing and had started to then change, academically, at that particular time.
Speaker 1: And you graduated from North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] in 1975?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-five [1975].
Story_ID: 239207
Speaker 1: --And what was your job description at PPG [Industries, Greensboro, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I was a staff auditor.  I was a staff auditor and a staff internal auditor.  And my job was to go around to the various PPG facilities, their chemical facilities, their, their, they had a glass facility, the various facilities, and perform internal audits, internal audits that was just making sure that they had good internal controls and also checking what commonly are, laymen terms, checking the books to make sure that those numbers that they had at those facilities were accurate, or fairly accurate, and that was my job.
Speaker 1: Was the upper management, at the time, white and how were you received?
Speaker 2: Well, I gotta tell you how I first came to work because I can still remember the first day I showed up, had a big afro, I had on a, I had on a brown jacket with some beige pants, with beige shoes to match, with the heels, platform heels, and, but that's what we saw at North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina].  Now, the placement director had also told us how we needed to dress but at that particular time, you know, after paying your way through college and not knowing you can get loans, if you will, that's what I, that's what I had because that's what I wore all the time, but anyway, I was the only African American in the department, so that tells you everyone else in there were white.  I can remember there were two other females.  There were two females, and this department probably had 20, maybe 20 people in it, 20, 25 people, one African American and two, two females that I can remember, and they're, all the other were white males.  And I can remember, because I had not done what I should have done in college, I can so vividly remember the first evaluation that I had, it was terrible, and I was wondering, man, I may get fired.  But I also knew that I didn't have a lot of options.  I wasn't going back home.  I wasn't going back home so the next thing was, you need to tighten, you need to tighten up.  So basically what I would do at nights when I would get off work, I'd go back home, pull out my old accounting books, and I start going back through doing things that Mr. [Ray] Thompson, and others say I should have done, when I was in the undergrad, but you know, you've got to live through some of this, and then, the next evaluation got better, the next evaluation got better, the next evaluation got better and then I got promoted, this must have been about almost a year and a half later, had gotten promoted to the next level and had started to do better.  And then one of the, I'd say one of the life changing events that happened to me, on one of those audits, I was headed to Puerto Rico and on the way to Puerto Rico I picked up, Black Enterprise magazine and in the Black Enterprise magazine, they talked about students graduated from Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], making $25,000 a year and I said to myself, what would they do with all that money 'cause this was now in 1977.  Also during, when I got to PPG, I met another African American individual by the name of Andre Woodie [ph.], and Andre Woodie was an African American who had gone to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Andre was in the treasury department but later on, out of treasury had transferred into the, into audit groups so we worked closely together but he was also, we had become roommates at this time.  And so I get off the plane one day and I come back and I said, Andre, man, I got this article that you can go to graduate school at Atlanta University and in two years, we could be making $25,000 a year.
Speaker 1: What were you making at this time?
Speaker 2: At this time I was making around, I think when I left PPG in 1970--the fall of '77 [1977], I think I was making sixteen, eight [$16,800].  Yeah, I know it, sixteen, eight [$16,800].  And I said, but 25,000, that's a 30 percent, that's almost a 50 percent increase.  So, so what I did at that time is, I convinced Woodie, Andre Woodie, that the two of us should go back to Atlanta University grad school.  And, long story short, after reading that article, and about three months later, we had packed up the truck, driven to Atlanta [Georgia], and we were enrolled in Atlanta University.  Had taken the GMAT, we were enrolled in Atlanta University, in the M.B.A. program--
Story_ID: 239208
Speaker 1: What was your first impression of Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: My first impression?  It wasn't as much about my first impression of Atlanta University as it was when I walked in there, I said, you know what?  It's going to be a whole different day here than it was at North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] because when I come out of here, I want to be one of the best of the best.  And that's the image I had was, this is, I didn't come here to have, I didn't come here to have fun necessarily, even though I would, I came here this time to seriously never be put in the position that I was put in when I got that bad evaluation.  So that was one of the changes that I had in life.
Speaker 1: What was the climate like at Atlanta University at this time?
Speaker 2: It was wonderful.  It was absolutely wonderful because, at that time, I believe Atlanta University was the only accredited graduate school of business in the United States, at that particular time.  This was 19--
Speaker 1: Black school?
Speaker 2: Black school, 1977, and I saw kids come from, again, all walks of life but also saw students come from the major universities, a lot of the HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] but it was a melting pot of all of these very, very talented and some very smart people, what you're going to expect.
Speaker 1: What's one of your favorite memories from Atlanta University?
Speaker 2: One of my favorite memories of Atlanta University is that one of my strong mentors at Atlanta University was a lady by the name of Dr. Johnnie [L.] Clark.  She made such an impact on my life.  Dr. Johnnie Clark, the first impression, the thing I can remember most vividly was, we had an intermediate accounting class and we had a class full of kids and the first test we had, I got a C and I was devastated, but now kidding my, I was the only one who got a C.  No one else got a C.  I was devastated.  I said, it's no way I can be the best making a C and that even made me work a lot harder but I also understood, and people had already told me, you probably need to find someone else's class to get in other than Dr. [Clark] because she is so hard.  Well, I was already there so you had to make the best of it.  A long story short, I did get out of there with the best grade.  I was able to pull that up to a B, which was the last B I ever got in accounting, well, at Atlanta University, but, but I can remember when I got the C, it was off, it was again a reflection that says, you have got to nail it down some more but the faculty was very quality faculty.  They talked about, they prepared us really professionally, I think, for leaving Atlanta University going out.  They had a lot of those students who had graduated to come back that would talk to us and I read a lot about my profession because I said, if I'm going to be an accountant, now by this time, I also had realized when I was at PPG [Industries, Greensboro, North Carolina], that everyone they brought in had come from a major accounting firm.  So when I went back to Atlanta University, I knew that I had to get with a major accounting firm and at that time it was, there were eight major accounting firms.  Today there is four, but it was eight at that time and I also knew that in order to get in one of those firms, you had to be in the top ten percent of your class in order to, otherwise they didn't recruit, and particularly from the African American, you probably had to be even at a higher level than that because they figured, I think some people figured that the ten percent at Atlanta University wasn't as good as the ten percent, other places.  So you had, I knew I had to be real high up there.  So that whole process was very, it was a great process to be in and it was so many people that were there that were just really high achievers.  I mean these--
Speaker 1: Who do you remember?
Speaker 2: Who do I remember?  Well, students or--
Speaker 1: Students or faculty.
Speaker 2: Oh, students, Dr. Johnnie Clark.  I mean, she, I had a lot of other professors but it was Dr. Johnnie Clark because, first of all, she challenged me so much that I remember my, it was my, the last semester, my first year, I found out that Dr. Clark was not going to be coming back for our second year and I understand that there had been no one who had gotten an A in Dr. Clark's class, I don't know how many years it had been, that was the rumor going around anyway, and I said to myself, I have got to get an A out of her class before she leaves out of here and if I don't do it this next semester, I will never get to do it again, and--
Speaker 1: Did you, were you conscious being in Atlanta [Georgia] in the '70s [1970s]?  Were you conscious of black leaders at the time?  Maynard Jackson and [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young and--
Speaker 2: We were, we were aware of, of the Maynard Jacksons of the world, yes.  We, 'cause I initially heard of Maynard even when we were in undergrad 'cause he had been part of the law school, had gone to law school there [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], but, yes, we were well aware of that.  On the Atlanta University campus, there wasn't a lot of political movements there.  It was, it was at a time when African Americans was having an entree to corporate America so people in that class of '77 [1977], well really the '79 [1979] class, everybody was focused on achieving and it was more of the me generation too because everybody was like, what's, what's in it for me?  Everything was like, what's in it for me?  Wasn't what's for the team and so forth.  It was, what's in it for me?  But the move wasn't as political as it was fitting into corporate America and making an impact on corporate America--
Story_ID: 239209
Speaker 1: So what did you do next?  You graduated in 1979 from Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: What was your dream?  To work for a big--
Speaker 2: Accounting firm.  In the next, next, I'd say next move, major point there for me was, I was, again, I was reading in a magazine, the Journal of Accountancy, it was Fortune magazine or Journal of Accountancy that after spending ten years with a major accounting firm, a partner could expect to make about $100,000 and that's when I said, you know what, I've got to be one of those partners.  And so at that point in time, my focus was on public accounting.  Dr. Johnnie [L.] Clark again recommended me to Coopers & Lybrand [PricewaterhouseCoopers] my, after my first year, Coopers & Lybrand, she recommended me to go to work for them and they hired me off of her recommendation, as a summer intern.  Well, in 1979, I was fortunate enough to have now, undergrad, no offers.  I was fortunate enough to have eighteen job offers when I came out of Atlanta University, all eight accounting firms.  So I chose Deloitte & Touche [Deloitte LLP].  One of the reasons I chose Deloitte & Touche [Deloitte LLP, Raleigh, North Carolina] is because there was a partner in charge by the name of Charlie Chuney [ph.] and Charlie Chuney [ph.], when I interviewed with him, was such a caring man but I never thought I was going to interview there and then he, during the interview, before I was getting ready to leave because I had already decided I was going to work for, at the time, Peat Marwick [KPMG], that was another firm in Raleigh [North Carolina], it was just, I was going to Deloitte as the last person in town to interview with and he asked an individual by the name of Willie Closs [Willie T. Closs Jr.], now, to come over, who was another African American, and talk to me about why it would be good to work at Deloitte & Touche.  And he mentioned that we had a client by the name of McKennis [ph.] in [Mechanics &] Farmers Bank.  Now I knew of McKennis [ph.] in Farmers Bank because it was here in Durham [North Carolina].  And Willie Closs who is now today the executive vice president of marketing at North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] here.  So Willie and I had worked together years ago and Willie convinced me that Deloitte & Touche was a great place to work.  So between Charlie Chuney and Willie Closs convincing me that that was a great place to work, I ended up at Deloitte & Touche and I stayed there and had a very successful career there until 1991.
Speaker 1: What are some of the highlights from your career at Deloitte & Touche?
Speaker 2: One of the highlights at Deloitte & Touche was I had an opportunity to work on, what we considered in our office, some very important clients.  One of those very important clients, first of all, during my early years there, we were able to secure North Carolina Mutual as one of our clients.  At that time, it was the largest black-owned business in the United States and we, I was having an opportunity to work on that, the engagement, and to really to come over to North Carolina Mutual and to be around those, if you will, legends that I had heard about, to walk in a room and there would be Mr. Bill Kennedy [William J. Kennedy III] who, at the time, was the president who was well-known on the boards at Mobil Oil [Corporation] and Pfizer [Inc.] and these major companies back in 1980, early '80s [1980s], and to be around people like a Bert Collins who is our chairman today and to be around guys like, Mr. Cicero Green [ph.] who was the treasurer and you had all of these people that were just people that you had heard about and was just at the top of their game and I had a chance to work with them on the audit staff.  Another one was Hardee's Food Systems.  Hardee's Food Systems, at the time, was the large, was the second largest client we had in our office and a lot of times you could tell where your career was going by the clients that you got assigned to.  So when I was a client of North Carolina Mutual and also, and I realized that they wanted to assign me to North Carolina Mutual because that was an African American owned company but to get assigned and to eventually stay and to manage the Hardee's account was a big achievement because that indicated to me what Deloitte & Touche thought about my talents.
Speaker 1: What were your various titles?
Speaker 2: My various titles was staff accountant, staff accountant in senior accounting, in manager, and then senior manager and I was in the process of being admitted to the partnership in 1991, have an opportunity to be admitted to the partnership when Hardee's Food Systems offered me the job as vice president, controller.
Story_ID: 239210
Speaker 1: While you were at Deloitte & Touche [Deloitte LLP], did you encounter any race issues or was it all positive?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you.  It was, it was mostly positive.  I do remember, I do remember, and this is a credit to the individual I talked about, Charlie Chuney [ph.], I, we had some clients that had mentioned to Charlie who was our partner in charge of our office, that they would not allow African Americans or females to do audits on their audit.  So what, what Charlie did was, he just didn't put us in those situations.  So, he would not assign us to some of those clients down in eastern North Carolina that didn't want women and female, I mean, women and African Americans.  So he didn't put us in that position.  Now from the standpoint of my working colleagues, I can tell you that I never, not one time, had a racial problem with anybody in the Raleigh [North Carolina] office at Deloitte & Touche during my whole entire tenure.
Speaker 1: And was it true that upon graduating from Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] graduates made a six figure salary?
Speaker 2: Well, not the six figure but the 25,000 all salaries.  Yes, so they were making it.  Now, it's interesting you say that because at the time, public accounting, it was thought in public accounting that, that we're doing you a great favor by allowing you to work for us.  So, they didn't pay the amounts of monies that you could get by going to work for a, a Chase Manhattan [Bank; JP Morgan Chase Bank] or, or a Manufacturers Hanover [Corporation] or whomever it might have been at the time.  The accounting firm wasn't paying that so when I went to work for Deloitte & Touche, I started off not much more than I, at seventeen, five, but I made a conscious decision that I would be able to do that because I knew over the next ten years, if I did well, I would have the chance to make a six figure income or if I didn't stay in public accounting, would have a tremendous opportunity with clients because that was the pattern.  You worked in public accounting, you left, you got a very important job with a client.  So I knew if I paid my dues in public accounting, that I would reap the harvest at a later period of time, and it did happen.  Later on in my career, the things that I learned at Deloitte & Touche it really, it put you in a position to really succeed on the financial side because the clients are so diverse, their issues of self-complex that you are always, you always felt like you were over your head.  You never got to the point where you had gotten to this plateau where it was a comfort level that you could just kind of rest on because you knew everything now.  It was never that case.  There was always new challenges for our clients.  Always new solutions we had to come up with so it was such a learning environment that even though we had to start out lower, the amount of training they gave us far exceeded.  So, you know, later on in your career, you eventually passed most of 'em who came out making $25,000 and, and exceeded those.
Speaker 1: How many blacks were accountants at Deloitte & Touche at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, when I, as I indicated, Willie Closs [Willie T. Closs Jr.] was the only African American in Raleigh at the time when I started in 1979 and Willie left around 1983 to come to, to North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] and up until about 19--for about the next three years or so, I was the only other African American that was there.  Then we hired an individual by the name of Arne Morris who is the, the director of wealth management for McGladrey [&] Pullen [LLP; RSUM US, LLP] today.  He came on as a new person from a HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities].  And then, and then my last year before I left, we had a new partner in charge of our office and Richard Burnett [ph.] walked in my office and one day and he said, [HistoryMaker] James [Speed], why don't we have any more minorities than you?  I said, well Richard, you're the partner in charge, I need, should be asking you that now.  He said, well, we need to get some more African Americans.  So I was allowed, then, to start recruiting.  So I went to North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] and in that year I recruited three additional, no, two additional African Americans and then we got another African American from UNC Chapel Hill [The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], so we brought in three additional African Americans the year I was allowed to go out and recruit.
Story_ID: 239211
Speaker 1: So tell me, from graduate school through your first couple of corporate jobs, how did you balance high achievement with a social life?
Speaker 2: Well, now talking about work, I don't think I really did a real good job at that.  The reason I say that now, that was a little bit different than when I was in graduate school, but during the work career, I, I was so, I'm going to tell you, when I went to Deloitte & Touche [Deloitte LLP], I was so focused.  I was so focused and the reason I was focused was because of the fact that some of those friends of mine that was at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] knew how difficult it was to make it in public accounting because the thing about public accounting, every year, we used to have, we had a term called "spring cleaning."  Every year the bottom of the pack, you would always get eliminated, you would always, you will be outplaced, and I knew what my goal was and so I worked very hard because, again, being the only African American, I felt like that I had to work very hard and long hours to prove that I belonged.  That's the way I felt.
Speaker 1: How many hours a day did you work?
Speaker 2: Back then, in the old days before computers and everything, you know during the busy season, from January through April, it's not uncommon to work, you know, 13, 14 hours a day, and you also worked on Saturdays and you also worked on Sundays.  I can remember one year, you know, you'd go at the, at the, you would go to work on, after New Year's and, you know, you could pretty much work almost the whole month without a day off but we were into it because we had a lot of work the clients would, the clients work needed to get done.  We were also getting paid overtime to do this and we could take that time and comp time in the summer.  So, I didn't, at that early stage, I didn't have a lot of time to do a lot of socializing 'cause, again, I was very, very focused.  Now, as I moved through that career and so my role changed to the point that now you had to get involved in more, you had to get more involved in outreach, you had to get more into developing business development and client relations, at that particular time.  Then, as you reached the management stage, you're more in a supervisory role, you didn't have to do all the day-to-day necessary work but more of a review capacity, but then you were required then to go out and, you know, join various boards because now you needed to network and make contacts to be able to bring new business in, now--
Speaker 1: Okay, when you were at Atlanta University, how did you balance?
Speaker 2: When I was at Atlanta University, I had learned that I still wanted to have fun, like I had done at North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] but I know that my main objective at this point was to be one of the best of the best to come out of Atlanta University.  So what I would tend to do is, almost every Saturday, I would check into the library down in Georgia State [University, Atlanta, Georgia], which was near Atlanta University, and I would spend most of my Saturdays, all day, and study up until maybe about six o'clock and then after that I would, you know, go home and then I'd go out with everyone else and everyone would say, "Well, how do you get all these good grades now and you go to everything we go to?"  But then they didn't know when I left there, the next Sunday morning, or Sunday afternoon, I'm back in the library of Georgia State and I'm there till late in the afternoon.  So that was kind of my, that was kind of the schedule that I had almost every weekend and particularly during the last, the last semester of school because I was also, at that time, in the process of studying for the CPA [Certified Public Accountant] exam and so in addition to studying for the CPA exam, I was also, you know, trying to continue to have some of the top grades in the business school and so I kept that schedule.  So that was a schedule I had just gotten, had gotten into a routine, if you will, and it worked extremely well.  So during the, it prepared me for the week ahead so I was, you know, up on all of my information in classes and so forth and--
Speaker 1: Did you graduate at the top of your class?
Speaker 2: I graduated number one accounting student that year and also was named the Most Outstanding Student in the school of business in '79 [1979] and Who's Who and a bunch of other accolades that came along with it, yeah.
Story_ID: 239212
Speaker 1: When did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: I met my wife in 1972 when I was at North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: When did you get married?
Speaker 2: Nineteen, in September of 1979, two months after I left Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: What's your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Thedora [Speed].
Speaker 1: Spell it.
Speaker 2: T-H-E-D-O-R-A.
Speaker 1: And how did you meet?
Speaker 2: We met, I mentioned that I was part of a social fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, and the sisters also to, was a social organization called Gamma Sigma Sigma [National Service Sorority] but they were down at Durham Business College [Durham College, Durham, North Carolina], not at North Carolina Central, and we, during the week that we had finished pledging, we all went to this party and so I met her at this party where the two organizations were having a party together, and that was in November of 1972.
Speaker 1: Was it love at first sight?
Speaker 2: Not quite.  She played hard to get for a long time but, but I was one who wouldn't be denied.
Speaker 1: Determination.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 239213
Speaker 1: In Raleigh [North Carolina], during your time at Deloitte & Touche [Deloitte LLP], what was the political climate or the racial climate of the city?
Speaker 2: In Raleigh?  Now let me, let me see if, I want to say in the early '80s [1980s], late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s], Raleigh had a black mayor by the name of Clarence Lightner and so coming out of Atlanta [Georgia], that was something that was, you know, it would, kind of gotten used to with all the power in the hands of a lot of African Americans down in Atlanta.  That surprised me that that took place in Raleigh, North Carolina but I would also, I would also tell you that going into Raleigh, North Carolina, working with a major accounting firm, you knew a lot about what was going on in Raleigh, but Raleigh is a, Raleigh is a closed-knit town from the standpoint of, you have the old, you have the old established communities and so forth there and those communities are a little tough to invade for newcomers who are outsiders.  Also, again, if you think about that time, early '80s [1980s], was the time when a lot of African Americans, young African Americans was really about parity in corporate America.  So when we came out it, when we were at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], it was more about achieving and success in these corporations, also then back to the marching in the streets and so forth.  That was just the, that was just the times in the 1980s that I still remember.  Now, I think there'd be another side of the, almost like the '[A] Tale of Two Cities' [Charles Dickens] but another side of the world, let's say, well, where has this guy been because all of these things were going on.  Well, at that time, our focus was achieving in corporate America.  So, we weren't involved in a lot of the Civil Rights Movements as I moved to, when I moved to Raleigh.  There were things that concerned you but at that particular time, most of the friends that I had and so forth, we were thinking about achieving because we were first generation college graduates, a lot of the times, and these were the first corporate jobs we had.  You know, everybody was into buying their new BMW's and all these things and getting money and making money and that was the focus.
Speaker 1: Were you part of that?  Trying, getting nice cars and a nice home and--
Speaker 2: Well, I've kind of always, I've kind of always been, even when I go back to a child, I've always been a person who kind of did okay with my money.  And when I say that was because my dad [James Speed, Sr.], on the other hand when we were growing up, my dad was a person who just was terrible with money.  I mean, and so as a result of that, it was one of those things that you're saying, I'm just going to be the opposite of him.  So, I'd always been a person who, first of all, had always saved money.  So even though I wanted those things, I'm more, was kind of trading on building long-term wealth than I was, now, yeah, I wanted the BMW and the nice houses and those things, but I also knew that I was going to save some of my money out of every paycheck that I got and those kind of things and I knew that building a strong financial foundation, to me, was more important than me getting a BMW right now.
Speaker 1: Were you investing money?
Speaker 2: Yes, and, and I can, I still remember, it was just like yesterday, this was around 1982 and, and I was doing the audit here at North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina], down on the fourth floor, and I was doing an audit with an individual by the name of Robert Shaw [ph.].  Now Robert Shaw was a young white kid who had just come from college and he was looking through the papers, The Wall Street Journal one day, and he was talking about he had just gotten a 40 percent return on his mutual funds.  Now keep in mind, I was a CPA [Certified Public Accountant], I was a senior accountant at one of the major accounting firms, had an M.B.A. degree, and I looked at Robert and I says, "What is a mutual fund?" because think about it.  You're never taught that, either in college or in high school, and if you didn't get it taught at home, you didn't know it.  Now Robert's father, a young white kid, his father was a CPA so he had taught Robert these skills.  So, Robert showed me that day how mutual funds worked and I bought my first mutual fund from Twentieth Century [Mutual Funds; American Century Investments] at the time for twenty-five dollars and that's when I started doing investments, 1982.

Speaker 1: And so what year did you leave Deloitte & Touche [Deloitte LLP]?
Speaker 2: I left Deloitte & Touche in July of 1991.
Speaker 1: And what did you do next?
Speaker 2: And I accepted a position as the vice president, controller for Hardee's Food Systems.
Speaker 1: Now that was a pretty big deal?
Speaker 2: That was a huge deal.  That was a huge deal because the offer that I had received with all the different perks, was a very, very, very good offer at that time and I can remember I was in the throes of making the decision, do I reach this dream that I've had of becoming a partner or do I take this job offer at Deloitte & Touche, I meant to take the job offer at Hardee's?  And so I went to some of the guys at Deloitte & Touche that I highly respected because I'm having an opportunity to consider being a partner and I asked some of the partners, you know, they knew the offer I got, what would you do?  And pretty much unanimously, other than the partner in charge, who was Richard [ph.] who wanted me to stay to become a partner and he'd have a minority partner, they said, [HistoryMaker] James [Speed], you would be crazy not to do this.  You would be absolutely crazy not to do this.  And so I accepted that position.  At the time I was the only African American officer out of twenty-two.
Speaker 1: Wow, how old where you at the time?
Speaker 2: I was thirty-seven.
Speaker 1: So you were young?
Speaker 2: Fairly young at the time, thirty-seven, and this was a, keep in mind, this was a company that was, had its roots in eastern North Carolina, wasn't by any means one of your most liberal cities to, to work in.  I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to work on that audit for ten years but I will tell you that, that there were, and people knew the caliber of work that I could do and I will tell you, some of those individuals who I had worked with over a long period of time, there were some people at Hardee, still, who thought that the reason I got this job was because I'm an African American.  Now, let's don't be naive to think that they did need to start diversifying and they had the HR [Human Resource] director, vice president, lady by the name of Edna Morris, who later became the president at Red Lobster [Darden Restaurants], but Edna was a individual who wanted to add more diversity.  She was a, obviously a female, wanted to make this happen but also what had happened is Hardee's had a new chief financial officer, an individual by the name of Rick Hall [Richard L. Hall].  Rick Hall had been the golden boy for our, our parent company out of Canada, he had been moved to Washington, D.C. to help make some corrections at an organization called Shoppers [Drug Mart], not Shoppers Drugs [sic.] but, it was a drugstore chain in, I can't remember the name of, but it was a drugstore chain in Washington, D.C., and he helped get that squared away and then the next job was to square away Hardee's.  Today, Rick Hall works at North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] as our CFO but because of Rick Hall, and Edna Morris, they made having an African American vice president, controller possible.
Story_ID: 239215
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was there backlash, I mean, the whole affirmative action thing, the assumption?
Speaker 1: No, we had, so there was, there was an assumption, there was an assumption that, that this guy, even though some of the people who knew me well knew that this was a very well-qualified person and they had done a national search, this wasn't in the vacuum, this was a national search that had been done, and, so I ended up with the position.  When I first went, when I first took that job [vice president and controller for Hardee's Food Systems] on, I can still remember that there were occasions when people within our department would give me information that they wanted me to review or I should say, sign off on, and I would look at it and because of the audit background, you would know instantly that this wasn't right.  And so I would just call 'em in and say, kindly, that maybe I'm missing something here but based on my calculations of what I know, this, this number is not right.  And then they would look at it and they said, oh, [HistoryMaker] James [Speed], you're right, it is, it's not right.  And this happened more than one time so after a while I remembered one of the partners that I had worked with at Deloitte [& Touche; Deloitte LLP] who used to always, he called me one day because another individual that had worked with us at Deloitte, at another company, had been involved in an embezzlement where he had signed off on documents that were not legitimate and he said, James, don't ever, this, don't ever sign anything that you don't review and that had always stuck with me.  So, after a while, things got better because people started saying, well, obviously James knows what he's doing and we can't get these things by him.  So, you start establishing credibility.  Well, six months later, we had a review done by Arthur Andersen [and Co.; Arthur Andersen LLP, Chicago, Illinois] and we had a reduction in force.  We let go about 25 percent of all of the accounting staff and here I am, six months in, 25 percent of the work force, one day you had, the next day they're gone, and we had the task of trying to figure out how we're going to get the same amount of work done with the, with 25 percent less staff.  And at that point in time, I have to tell you, I really didn't know which way to turn.  So, going back to my, I guess, days of athletics and so forth and knowing that a team gets things done a lot more so than an individual can, we put together a team of people and said, okay, how are we going to work this thing out and over several months, we were able to get that same work done with those people but we had to, basically, blow up the old process, and we instituted a completely new process that over a long period of time, allowed us to not only be able to get done with 75, with 25 percent less, but we improved the process to the point that now as they had other layoffs, we still got the same amount of work done, even with fewer people.  So by the time, and this was after three years, we had changed that whole financial process and after three years as vice president, controller, Rick [ph.] recognized that, you know, we had done some pretty phenomenal things and we got a lot of people involved.  We also, at that same time, had, we had had a kind of an autocratic kind of management team and, you know, they were watching people's, people's, they were watching you watch to figure out what time people came to work.  We, you know, they were, they had a, one lady came in one day and told me, James, I need to let you know something.  The, we got some clerical people down in the break room eating with some of the supervisors and I said, oh, that's a wonderful thing.  They said, we don't do that here.  And so, anyway, we were able to change all that culture.  Got people involved and put together what I call a, we had a solution team because we had done a, we had done a, an employee survey and they were just terrible and I worked with HR [Human Resource] to say, how do we solve all these problems 'cause I had promised all the employees that we will fix every one of these things and we'd get back with you, but they didn't know they were going to be part of the solution.  So the solution team was a cross-functional team but we all worked through and made suggestions on how we made the workplace better.  A long story short, in about three years we had improved the processes, the morale was very, very good at that point in time and on January the 1st in 1995, that was recognized and I became senior vice president and controller but in addition to that, I also was given the treasury department, not treasury department sorry, was given the tax department, given our fleet group because we had several hundred cars in our fleet group, so I got fleet, got the tax department and the treasury group.
Story_ID: 239216
Speaker 1: --Was Hardee's [Food Systems] in the stage of transition at this time, not only in terms of, internally, but also in terms of product and marketing?
Speaker 2: Well it was, it had in the late '80s [1980s], late '80s [1980s], Hardee's had just passed Wendy's as the number three hamburger chain but then after several change in management and so forth, we were really struggling at that point in time to define who we were.  We'd also gone out and had acquired a chain called Roy Rogers [Franchise Company LLC], the Roy Rogers fried chicken and roast beef and we went through some transition there and because of some of the failures we had with that chain, there had to be cost-cutting moves to be able to take out administrative cost.  So we had this, at that time, a $20 million initiative to take out cost and it was all across the board.  So everybody took these kinds of hits but we were able to rebound and really made the process better.  I can remember when we first started this process, it used to take us eighteen days, if you will, to be able to close our books at the end of the month.  By the time we finished that whole process, we were closing our books in four days, we were doing it with about 50 percent of the, well I'm going to say, about 60 percent of the workforce that we previously had and we were getting more done with fewer people and it was all process change.  But, so, about every year or so, somebody was coming back and say, hey, we've got to take more costs out of the system so they were still just laying off people.  And we sold our people on the idea that for us to not to have to worry about being downsized, is that as people would leave our department, we need to find ways to absorb those, those positions so that when HR [Human Resources] comes to us and they look at our numbers, they can see that we've had attrition alarm but we haven't been able to replace anybody and that philosophy worked and the employees bought into it to the point that by figuring out better ways to do things, you were, we were all saving our jobs and they bought into it and it worked and like I said, after that three years, I was promoted to senior vice president with now more responsibility and we were able to incorporate those same kind of philosophies with these other departments.
Story_ID: 239217
Speaker 1: Now you were reading some books along the way, Napoleon Hill, [Andrew] Carnegie.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell me about those books.
Speaker 2: Well, I had, right after graduate school [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], I had started to read these, these books and listened to tapes like the 'Think And Grow Rich' book by Napoleon Hill, just a, just a classic and another book by Dr. Denis Waitley which was a book called the 'Seeds of Greatness' which is that quote that I told you, that I've kind of lived by for a long time, "Out of every adversity, there is a seed of equal or greater benefit" and, and all these positives start to, all these positive, if you will, start to become part of you and I realized at that time that one of the most important things in life is, not what happens to you, is how you handle those situations and it's attitude, that, is attitude and expectation.  So, these things start to influence.  Now, also, I can remember another incident when we were growing up.  I had, one of my dad's [James Speed, Sr.] sisters who moved in with us, my Aunt Betty [ph.], and she was a, almost a living example of what faith was because whenever something would happen, she would always say, you know, "We're going to work this out" and almost, I hardly ever saw a situation that she couldn't work out, I don't care how bad it was, work out.  So, you, even back then, we started having an attitude is, whatever it is, we can work it out.  And so, this just kind of added on to that early childhood where you were instilling, regardless of what the situation is, you can figure out a way to work it out.  So, these books, if you will, just reinforced that and my attitude.  If most people see me today and they say, "How you doing today, [HistoryMaker] James [Speed]?"  I'm always going to say, "Wonderful."  I always say wonderful.  Now, some days I know I don't feel wonderful, but it just comes out and I, and a lot of that was those books and those tapes and just, I believe that we all are either programmed positive or we're programmed negative and it's just what goes in, comes out, and that's what those, that's what those books did.  And then, keep in mind, when I was working at Hardee's [Food Systems], I had, I never moved to, I never moved to Rocky Mount [North Carolina], I still lived in Raleigh [North Carolina].  So I had a one hour commute each way.  So this was another way, pop in a tape, listen to something and I did that for nine years.
Speaker 1: So you're always listening to some philosophy, incorporating positive thinking?
Speaker 2: Positive thinking, yup, and even try, and try our best now, every day is not the greatest day, but I think that makes a difference in a person's life because I think the same things happen to all of us.  It's just how we react to them.
Story_ID: 239218
Speaker 1: What about religion?  Did it continue to play a role in your life?
Speaker 2: Yes it has and I think, you know, we talk about faith but when you, when you see those things like my Aunt Betty [ph.] would do, and to give you a, perfectly, I can remember that we used to, and I told you my dad [James Speed, Sr.] wasn't good with money, and I can vividly remember almost every year, when the school would start and we would, we would need money to pay for your books.  Back then you had to pay, you had to pay for your books.  I don't think we did that later on but anyway, so you had to have book money.  Now my dad would get paid like on a Friday and he knew that we had to have book money on like a Monday, and all of a sudden, he would, Monday would come and he didn't have the money to give us.  So my Aunt Betty would say, "Don't worry."  Now, we would, you normally had a grace period like two or three days.  Before Wednesday come, we'll have that money and Mr. Marshall Cooper, who was the North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] sales agent, you know the day before we needed the money, he might, would drop by and drop his shirts off of which my aunt would starch and she'd have enough money to pay these, and those kinds of things happened all the time.  So when you talk about faith and you see these things continue to happen like this, you know that there's more than human intervention that's involved in those processes.  And I sometimes say that when, when things happen in your life that you can't explain, it's just God being anonymous.  So, and those are the kinds of things that I learned from those books but also I learned a lot from seeing it work at home.
Speaker 1: What church did you attend in Raleigh [North Carolina]?  Or have you attended?
Speaker 2: Well, we attend Peace Missionary Baptist Church in Durham [North Carolina].  Now, we never, we, when my daughter [Kiera Speed] was younger, we started to look for a church so she could be involved in as a youth in Raleigh but we had to start, we started, my wife [Thedora Speed] had started attending Peace Missionary Baptist Church again where she was introduced from a lady by the name of Ms. Barbara Jones [ph.] who worked at North Carolina Mutual.  You see, all these things keep tying back to North Carolina Mutual, introduced her to this new church that had started in Durham and my wife started attending.  So when I moved back to Raleigh, before we got married, we started attending Peace Missionary Baptist, then we've been doing that ever since 1979.  So, the church we attend, the church we attend here in Raleigh.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite memory of Peace Missionary Baptist Church?
Speaker 2: I remember, and this is again on faith, is when we had, we had talked about building a new church and for years we were in a church that was less than desirable, even some of the women didn't even really like going to the restroom there.  And Reverend, Dr. [William E.] Daye, was a man with tremendous vision.  He had built, I think, about three churches at the time and he talked about us building a new church and he would kind of talk about the vision of this new church and there were people in the church, when we found out how much money that we needed to build the church, and how much money we had to build that church, there were so many things that, that from a physical standpoint said, it is no way this can happen.  But reverend, they kept building the dream and he talked about it and talked about and talked about it and then after all of this, and I even have one of the, one of the lady who called me because of my background, she says, "[HistoryMaker] James [Speed], why don't you talk to Reverend Day and let him know that financially we can't do this church."  And I'm saying to myself, I'm not, I'm not picking that fight.  But anyway, the first day we walked in that church, this is down on Highway 55 in Apex [North Carolina], and you said now, if this is not faith in action, there is nothing else.  So, when we walked in that church and said, against all the odds, when all the facts said it couldn't happen and all of a sudden, now the church is grown tremendously, with about six hundred members and so forth, so, to go in that church for the first day when it was so many people said it couldn't happen.
Speaker 1: Are there other prominent members of that church?
Speaker 2: Well, when you say, prominent members, yes, there are a lot of, there are a lot of influential people because I don't, I don't even consider myself one of the prominent members of that church, if you will, from that standpoint because I feel like when I go to that church, I'm just like everyone else and if you've ever heard [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] talk and some of his speeches, I can't remember which one it was but he talked about, you know, everybody goes around talking about, we've got "X" number of doctors and lawyers and all these people in the church and he says, when you come in God's house, it really doesn't matter who you are, we're all God's children and as a result of that, it doesn't matter how many doctors I got, he says, I'm looking for people who are willing to serve.
Story_ID: 239328
Speaker 1: Tell me the duration of your management career at Hardee's [Food Systems], from what year to what year?
Speaker 2: From July of 1991 to December of '94 [1994], I served as vice president, controller.  From January of '95 [1995] until July of '97 [1997], I served as senior vice president, controller and from July of '97 [1997] through March 31st of 2002, I served as senior vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer.
Speaker 1: Can you share with me a story or highlight from your experience there?  Favorite memory.
Speaker 2: I've had so, I've had so many, I had a lot of memories from Hardee's because I learned so many things when I was at Hardee's.  I learned how to deal with very difficult situations where the odds were really against you, but--
Speaker 1: Tell me about one of those experiences.
Speaker 2: The experience I indicated earlier, when we had the downsizing of the, the 25 percent and I had to sit across the table and I had to tell people that they no longer had a job and that impacted me so greatly it was what motivated me to make those changes of the processes and to streamline everything so that I knew if I could find new ways to do things, then it, it meant I have to face people one-on-one less times and tell 'em they didn't have a job because this wasn't something that was going to stop.  So--
Speaker 1: Were these black employees and white employees?
Speaker 2: Mostly white employees but I would also say, one of the, when you talk about one of the proudest moments, it was, I can remember when I had been there for a while now and one of the things that I noticed is that whenever we were in the process of hiring an African American, the person who was going to do that always came to my office and says, "[HistoryMaker] James [Speed], we have a wonderful candidate that we're looking at hiring."  And the first time I said, oh, great, and then when I would meet 'em, it had been African Americans.  So a lot of times, now I never told anybody in that department we had to hire African Americans but what I believed took place because of my presence and kind of had broken through the clutter to the point that, that African American can achieve and we're smart people and so forth, I think the people in the department, now whether they believed that or they were trying to satisfy me, I'm not sure but then later on when I looked at, when I, as I moved out of that role of the controller and I look back, when I became CFO, the lady who had become controller was a female that had been in the department, who had worked at Deloitte & Touche [Deloitte LLP] with me, this lady had worked with me fourteen years but she was a female, she was a white female.  I also had as a system controller, another guy had worked with me at Deloitte & Touche who was a Japanese American--
Speaker 1: Do you remember these names?
Speaker 2: [Mary] Beth Atkinson, Beth Atkinson, was the vice president, white female.  Bill McShea [ph.], both of these people are dear friends of mine today, was a Japanese American.  His mother was Japanese, his father was white, but he grew up in Fairview, North Carolina in a trailer park but he's a great friend and he was the assistant controller.  Then we had another individual by the name of, an African American, a [The] Wharton [School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] graduate by the name of Jamara McMillan [ph.] that I had hired who was the head of our acquisition and divestiture team and then he had a wife, Paula McMillan [ph.] who was an undergrad at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], had her master's [degree] from Southern Cal [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], a CPA [Certified Public Accountant], that was our director of external report, of external reporting.  So when I started looking at the management team, it was the, of the diverse management team but also we had brought on key African Americans in some key roles.  Also, I think because of showing them that we could succeed, another dear friend of mine, [W.] Maurice Bridges, later on in 1996, I believe it was, he was named as vice president of public affairs.  He had been there for a while so now he was the second African American to break into that management team.  So I think just the presence of doing a good job, working hard, brought also, I think, speak to the philosophy that let's hire, we can have very qualified people and we can have diverse people who bring different things to the table, and also, because of that presence, we allow other African Americans to later get jobs at Hardee's that in the past we didn't have.
Story_ID: 239329
Speaker 1: Now you had mentioned earlier the established families in Raleigh [North Carolina], the Raleigh-Durham [North Carolina] area, who were some of those families?
Speaker 2: Well I wouldn't say the Durham areas as much as I would say the Raleigh area.  When I think of the Raleigh, when I think of some of those families in the Raleigh area, one would have been the, block--
Speaker 1: Was this was the white family or black family?
Speaker 2: No, black family, and I know him so well, that guy that I indicated who was the mayor [Clarence Lightner], one of those senior moments, Lightners.  I would say the Lightners would have been one of those families.  Now, the Lightners was one of the, I think the prominent families there who later as I indicated, became mayor, they owned the funeral service there but it wasn't that they wouldn't allow because, one thing I said about that family, in particular the siblings of Clarence Lightner, which is Bruce [E.] Lightner today, has really done a wonderful job of, of reconnecting the African American communities with the mainstream and he's the one who, who promotes the Martin Luther King [Jr.] [Memorial] Breakfast [Greensboro, North Carolina] for the whole [Research] Triangle area now, and has done that in collaboration with the people at, at Fox 50.  So Bruce has had that outreach but those were one of the families that when you moved to Raleigh you knew were one of the major players.  Also, the Lewis family.  There was a guy by the name of J.D. Lewis and J.D. Lewis used to host a show called 'Teenage Frolic[s].'  It was like the African American, 'American Bandstand' and he held it at Chavis Park [John Chavis Memorial Park, Raleigh, North Carolina], the place that I talked about where we used to go with a picnic.  So you knew that the Lewis family was also one of those prominent families around Raleigh.
Story_ID: 239330
Speaker 1: At some point, you had children?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the kids.
Speaker 2: I have, I have one daughter, Kiera [Speed], and--
Speaker 1: Spell her name please.
Speaker 2: K-I-E-R-A and--
Speaker 1: What year was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in December of 1983.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: Raleigh [North Carolina], Rex Hospital, Raleigh [North Carolina].  The day I had gone through Lamaze, she was making sure that, I always remember the Tuesday morning that she was born, December 6th, I was on an audit down in, in Wilmington, North Carolina and got a call early one morning that indicated that my wife [Thedora Speed] was on the way to the hospital and this was probably 5:30 a.m. in the morning and I got in my car, about six that morning, and I drove back to Raleigh and on the way I think I was thinking about, you know, I've done all this Lamaze and if I miss this, I'm going to be highly upset.  But then when it all set in, the only thing you said well, you said, will it be a boy or girl and then all it, at the last minute you said, I just want it, whatever it is, just to be healthy.  And, and I remember that day at 3:21 [P.M.], she was born.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: That, and p.m.
Speaker 1: What is she doing today?
Speaker 2: She has just graduated from, she had just graduated from UNC Chapel Hill [The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  She has a journalism degree with a, with a concentration of PR [Public Relations] and a minor in, in business and she is currently searching for a job right now.
Speaker 1: Very good, and you have other kids?
Speaker 2: Only one daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my daughter really was a, my daughter was a real, real motivation to me because one of the things that, that I kind of, I knew that had taken place when you talked about balance, was when she was growing up, one of the things I made was a priority was always attending anything she was involved in.  So if she was, she also danced, you know, she swam, she, she played soccer, she played basketball so she was on a lot of activities and I always tried to get to a lot of those functions but as you can imagine, sometimes I'd be out of town and those kind of places.  And, and so one of the things I had set as a goal is, I have to be able to leave work before my daughter graduates from high school because I want to be able to, those last couple of years, to be able to spend time with her because I know if I don't do that I'll never get that time back.  And I was fortunate to be able to leave work on March 31st of 2000 and she was in her second semester of her sophomore year in high school and I really didn't work from that time until she graduated from high school, so, you know, we had the opportunity, you know, to spend time in Europe, we had to go off in, and I also had time to be one year the basket--the team dad for the basketball team, you know.
Speaker 1: Did she play basketball?
Speaker 2: She played basketball at, yes.
Speaker 1: What high school?
Speaker 2: Leesville Road, Leesville Road High School [Raleigh, North Carolina].  So, and then one summer when the coach needed some help for the camp, you know, I could go over and help out and occasionally they would need somebody to help on a fieldtrip so, you know, we called it, Kiki [ph.], Kiki's dad didn't have a job so he'd kind of go along with them so it was a wonderful time and as I look back to all the accomplishments I've ever had, that is one of the greatest accomplishments because that's something I can't, if you didn't do it then, you, you can't attain it now.  So when I look back, and you said one of the greatest thing you've ever done, that would have been able to put yourself in a position where, that I can spend time with my daughter.  And I still can remember one night, we were at a basketball game, and put it all in perspective.  We were at a basketball game and there was a young girl named Katie [ph.] and Katie had had a great game and Katie was crying and so I said, "Katie, what's wrong?"  And she says, I said, "You just had one of the best games you've ever had," and she said, "my dad wasn't there," he was in Ireland, and I said, thank goodness that whatever my daughter did in those important moments, I was there.  So, that really made me know that it was worth whatever I had to do to put myself in a position to be it.  So her last two years I never missed one second of a game.
Speaker 1: Wow, and you were semi-retired?
Speaker 2: I was kind of semi-retired.  And another incident happened is that the, about the first month I had retired, they were having a flag football game for the girls so my brother [Chester Speed] and I was at the game and my daughter, first, second play of the game, one of the girls threw a pass, my daughter, who was playing like a back, intercepted the pass and she ran for a touchdown with about 60 yards.  And I said to myself, now, I could have, I could have been in a board room, I could have been at a very important meeting and I would never have seen that and that's when I know, you did the right thing.

Speaker 1: What did you do next?  How long did you stay in retirement?  And did you start your own firm for a while (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Well I did and I was an investor, I was an investor for a while there and so I started a group called Speed Financial Group [Inc.].  Speed Financial Group was there to, to do pretty much investing kinds of things and so, and one of the endeavors that we took on when I first left Hardee's [Food Systems], it was a group of five of us who was the former president of Hardee's, our former chief operations officer, myself and two other individuals had put a company together and what we were going to do was buy, we were going to buy Hardee's Restaurants in, out of the Charlotte [North Carolina] market.  We were going to buy the entire Hardee's Charlotte market and a long story short, the chairman of the company kind of derailed that and after working on this project for about six, seven months, but it was just, at my own leisure of helping find the financing and doing a couple of other things to make that deal work, we're about ready to go to closing and all of a sudden the deal kind of blows up.  But I learned a lot in that process from the standpoint of just putting all this infrastructure and so forth together to basically form a company.  Well, I was doing this kind of in my spare time but I still had Speed Financial Group.  Now Speed Financial Group later on, unbeknownst to me at the time, ended up being the organization that I provided consultant services to through North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina].  I had lunch with Willie Closs [Willie T. Closs Jr.] and Bert Collins one day, well, let me back up.  I can remember my wife [Thedora Speed] had given me a surprise retirement party, April 14th of 2000, two weeks after I had retired and all my high school friends had come and a lot of the people who said that it would never be possible to retire in your forties, they all came and out in the audience was Mr. Bert Collins and Willie Closs.  My wife had invited Willie and, 'cause we had worked together at Deloitte [& Touche; Deloitte LLP] for many years and Bert and Carolyn [ph.], his wife came along and I had just given my speech about how great it was to not to be working anymore, to get up and kinda do what you want to do and at the end Mr. Collins comes up and says, [HistoryMaker] James [Speed], we'd love to have you come work at North Carolina Mutual and I said, Mr. Collins, I'm never working again.  But, anyway, long story short--
Speaker 1: Now they were on the board?
Speaker 2: Mr.  Collins was the president of North Carolina Mutual and he was on the board but I had known them through my relationship, I had known Willie from working together, I had known Mr. Collins through the relationship as being his outside auditor in over the years.  And so, you know, we went to, we had lunch a couple of times and, long story short, they asked me one day, Mr. Collins asked me if I would come to work, come to work for Mutual.  Well, after I gave him my rate, he says, how about coming one day a week?  So, I started one day a week and when I came here that one, started that one day a week, because I realized that initially that I thought I really didn't want to work anymore and what I later found out is all I wanted to do was have a choice.  I just wanted to have a choice to say what I basically did and then I got to North Carolina Mutual and we started working on a, well I had worked on some of the issues that we had around our auditing and so forth was helping North Carolina Mutual fix some of those issues.  I think about six months after that, Mr. Collins put a team of people together, made of the management team at North Carolina Mutual to put together a strategic plan and this strategic plan would take place for about four to five months about where North Carolina Mutual would go to the future.  And he asked me if I would, would be willing to come in and help serve on that strategic planning team and so I did.  And as I sat there I saw the huge opportunities we had but more importantly than that, the thing I realized was, I was absolutely loving being here.  I would just enjoy myself and I kept saying, my inner self kept saying, you're not supposed to be enjoying work, you're not supposed to be enjoying this but every day I came here, I was thoroughly having a ball.
Story_ID: 239332
Speaker 1: --Tell me about the sights and sounds.
Speaker 2: Well it was, it was finding the issue that you could fix and going to another issue that you could help fix.
Speaker 1: Give me an example.
Speaker 2: We had our, for instance, our investment and mortgage department.  We had had some individuals who had departed that area, had gotten a little bit behind, we were able to get that caught up to the point that we had balanced everything, got everything back to where it needed to be and started to make some changes to put some processes in where that wouldn't have to be something that was done by me but could be done by the subordinates in the department.  So those were who those were, first thing.  We also at that same time, we found out that we had some issues with a, one of our major, one of our lines of business that was going to cause us some major issues and Willie had gone down to Florida, Willie Closs [Willie T. Closs Jr.], Willie had gone down and he looked at this thing and he called me up and he said, [HistoryMaker] James [Speed], I need your help, because both of us had audit backgrounds, we need to audit this situation because we think we have a problem.  So, Willie and I and a couple other people go down and sure enough we had a major, major problem that if we had not found it at that time, we would be in, we would be in real bad shape now, but we were able to go in, we were able to identify what the problem was, to be able to take care of it, get out of that line of business and move on in about a six month period of time.  Those were kind of the rewarding things that you could do where you come in and you can make a difference.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the, the environment here at North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina].  Tell me about some of the people and maybe some of the interactions.
Speaker 2: I tell you what.  North Carolina Mutual is like no other place I've ever been.  Now, from the outside looking in, as an auditor, I could have never envisioned that I would have come to work for North Carolina Mutual.  It's nothing about North Carolina Mutual, it's just that, you know, I was going to have, I was going to have this very successful career in public accounting and then later on when I went to Hardee's [Food Systems] I'm thinking, I'm going to be at Hardee's until I retire and then, well, retire early, I always had the intentions from listening to those tapes that you didn't have to work till you're sixty-five and never thought about working at North Carolina Mutual.  But then when I got on the inside, this thing is contagious because it's, it is now, we, it's not a, it's not a utopia by any means, but it's this family atmosphere when someone's, when someone dies, say, everybody comes together and, you know, supports that person, when, it's a very supporting environment, okay.
Speaker 1: Can you think of an example that would display that family atmosphere?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Every other month at North Carolina Mutual, we have something called a anniversary luncheon and we recognize all the employees.  Let's say if we have it in February, all the employees who started on January, February, and we'd have that anniversary for those two months, but not only that, we will invite, we will invite the, the retirees back and to see the number of retirees that come back for this anniversary luncheon and when you get downstairs and you talk about, you have everybody do the icebreaker when they introduce themselves, and they talk about how long they have been, how long they've spent with North Carolina Mutual and you will hear ladies who will say, well I spent forty years with North Carolina Mutual and they will, they will have retired, let's say twenty years ago, and they still look great.  And the camaraderie and the love that they have for this company is absolutely incredible and I've never seen it anywhere else.  So, when you talk, so when you get downstairs and, you know, we open the lunchroom with a prayer and then after that people talk about how long they've been and you see the passion that they have and the camaraderie that these people have with each other and not, even though now they're not employees anymore, and these people work together, they are still tightly connected, they still spend time with each other and this is after being with the company for forty years and then leaving and it's, it's amazing.  We have founders day.  These retirees will come back.  It's just a connection and once you experience it, you can't shake it.
Story_ID: 239333
Speaker 1: Is the history alive and well here?  The history of the contributions of the founders, the [John] Merricks, the [Aaron] Moores, the [C.C.] Spauldings, etc.?
Speaker 2: I think the history is alive and well among people who were probably my age or older.  I don't think the history is alive and well anymore for the younger generation because, see, we all grew up around North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] in a time when North Carolina Mutual was such a prominent company in the United States but also you had those people like the Marsha Coopers [ph.] and you had the people like the John Peaces [ph.] who were going in the communities, in and out of homes, so everybody knew North Carolina Mutual wasn't necessarily the building in Durham, North Carolina.  Mutual were those individuals but today, you don't see those individuals going door to door 'cause we don't do business that way anymore in those homes, collecting, so as a result, the young people, they don't know about it because what they see on TV, is they see the guy on TV who talks about you in good hands with Allstate [The Allstate Corporation] or you're in the rock with Prudential [Financial, Inc.], that's what they see on TV, they don't see the North Carolina Mutual.  So as a result of that, some of that history fade.  That's why it's imperative that we continue to keep that history alive from the standpoint of we, from time to time, will have young people, particularly I've had several people from, kids from Oxford [North Carolina], who will, they'll have some of their teachers there who will say, "[HistoryMaker] James [Speed], can we bring some of the kids in North Carolina Mutual, I want our young kids to know about North Carolina Mutual" and we take them through the Heritage Room.  Now, the amazing thing is, it's not the kids who are so overwhelmed because some of them don't even know what we're talking about, it's those teachers who are now 35 and 37 and 38 who are saying, "Oh my goodness, this is incredible."  So to be able to bring some of that history back to life.  Another thing we're doing, and this is part of that strategic plan, is I still believe we can recreate the North Carolina Mutual of old in some sense.  When we look at the market that we served at one time, we served a tremendous geography, if you will, and you could go in the towns around North Carolina and Durham [North Carolina] and Greensboro [North Carolina] and High Point [North Carolina] or you could go to Virginia in, in the Tidewater area of Norfolk [Virginia] and Hampton [Virginia] and all those places and the Richmond, Virginia and in South Carolina, at Charleston [South Carolina], and you would find, North Carolina Mutual presence and over the years we're not there anymore and what we've been able to do after we put the strategic plan and we're seeing growth, we're seeing a North Carolina Mutual re--be revived in those markets.  To give you a perfect example, in September of '96 [1996], September of '06 [2006], we went back to Memphis, Tennessee and we had a grand opening of the office there and, talk about this family, there were retired employees from North Carolina Mutual who came to the opening and they had such pride to see that we were back in town and they had the pastors and the mayors and the different people who came and everybody was so glad to see North Carolina Mutual because the first thing they said, "Well we thought you were out of business only because we hadn't seen you in and out of the houses anymore" and now we opened up, just a couple of months ago, we go back into the town, we're going to open up a new facility in Norfolk because when you look at the concentration of African Americans as we go back into the Norfolk and the Hamptons and the Virginia Beaches [Virginia Beach, Virginia] and places and all of a sudden we go back in and we have instant success, first of all, said there's still a tremendous need in those African American communities where we can provide them some financial stability if there's an unexpected loss in their family.  Our policy is not to, we have policies that are 100,000 and 500,000, but most of the policies we sell, are around $25,000.  But when you have an African American net worth that's right now only somewhere between $7500 to $10,000, a $25,000 policy more, is more than three to, more than three times the amount of wealth that the average African American family has.  So a $25,000 policy, to the average African American family, means you have created three times more wealth than the average family in America does.  There is still a need there and we cannot forget that history, because that history did play an important part in the foundation financially of a lot of African American families--
Story_ID: 239334
Speaker 1: When did you become CEO [of North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: In January of 2004.  I was named acting, I was named president-elect in May of 2003 and took on the role because Bert Collins was transitioning out into retirement at that time, so I took over on January 1st of 2004.
Speaker 1: And your mission has been growth?
Speaker 2: The mission, our mission has been growth but the main mission still has been to provide financial stability to American families and it just so happens that our business in our market places skewed towards the African American family.  So that is our primary mission.  Now, when you have that kind of mission and you see such a need out there, and you see so many underserved people because everyone wants to move to those upscale markets, then you realize that there are also growth opportunities.  So there was in our strategic plan that we wanted to grow, that we wanted to be one of the top 150 life insurance companies in America and that would require us to grow but also require us to reconnect with those communities that we were no longer in.
Speaker 1: Now, as president and CEO, do you actually have an opportunity to go out into the community to meet these people?
Speaker 2: Well, I have, I have an opportunity to not necessarily to meet our individual policyholders, but to basically serve in capacities where I think I can have an impact on those communities.  Give you an example.  Like I'm a member of the board of the Triangle Urban League and as we talk about economic development in those areas, we're talking about economic development in those areas that if you will specifically impact, impact our, our, the people that we serve.  I also have an opportunity to serve on a board, the North Carolina State Board of Communities in Schools.  When we look at the number of kids that are at risk of dropout, a large percent of those are African Americans so you effect those.  I've had opportunities to go, and this is what I really like doing, going into some of those high schools and those elementary schools and being guest speakers and telling young kids that, you know, you can be anything you want to be, that, and not say that and really don't mean it but really say it and know that it can happen and to be somewhat of a beacon of hope and light and I do this a lot in my hometown, Oxford [North Carolina].  When I go back and talk to kids, and a lot of those teachers are saying, I grew up with this guy and he grew up on Granville Street [Oxford, North Carolina] and when they ride down Granville Street, and they can't believe it, it is a hope.  So, so that way you are going back into those communities 'cause you get an opportunity on a lot of instances where I can talk to a lot of kids.  We have kids come to North Carolina Mutual from, throughout the State of North Carolina to, to visit our Heritage Room and talk about that heritage.  So, yes, we have an opportunity to do that.  Now we have a program now called, Wealth Building and the Wealth Building Program is where we have reconnected with the African American communities and we've reconnected those African American communities with organizations like the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], with the National Baptist Association [sic. National Baptist Convention], the North Carolina General Baptist State Convention [sic. General Baptist State Convention Of North Carolina] and those organizations we've been able to reconnect and get at the root of the African American community.  Today, in Washington, D.C., we have a team of people that are back in those communities, we've invited those, those hair stylists because that is a key area in African American community from the standpoint of, regardless of how much money you have, how much education you have, you all in back there.  So we meet with them--
Speaker 1: Finish your sentence.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: But, but--
Speaker 2: --so we meet with them to talk about how they and other community people, along with North Carolina Mutual can form collaborations that help create wealth in those neighborhoods.
Story_ID: 239226
Speaker 1: Tell me that story.
Speaker 2: It, we talked about Jack and Jill [of America, Inc.] and some of the other things.  It's like when, sometimes when I go to church and there may be somebody new who will come up to me and say, well, [HistoryMaker] James [Speed], what do you do?  And I said, well, I work for North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] and they will say, and they will leave it at that.  And then they may go talk to someone else and someone else, they'll tell them they just met me and they'll say, well, do you know who that guy is?  They'll say, well he's the president of North Carolina Mutual and then they'll say, well he didn't' tell me that.  And they'll come back and say, well, you didn't tell me you were the president.  Well, first of all, they didn't ask me if I was the president but, as I always say, sometimes, the president is, is what I do, it's not really who I am.  And I can remember when I first became president, name is president-elect of North Carolina Mutual, I had the opportunity to go back to my hometown [Oxford, North Carolina], and to do a speech to the, it's called the human relations commissions [Human Relations Commission, Granville County, North Carolina] and it tries to get the, it tries to get camaraderie in diverse, all the diverse audience to work together in my hometown.  And I was getting ready to do the speech, so I was up on the stage and this was during the dinnertime and a lot of my very close friends, as they walked by, you know, they'd like look at me and kind of wave, kind of sheepishly, and I'm sitting there, these are my home boys.  And all of a sudden, I would go out and I'd get up and I'd go out there and I said, man, you, you didn't come up and, he said, well, man, you know, you're the North, you the president of North Carolina Mutual.  I didn't know how you were going to act to me, now.  And it's like, they had this, they had this impression that maybe James has really changed since he left us and I don't want to be thought of that way 'cause that's, you know, when I go  back, it's, you've changed, but also believe me, I don't see myself above any of those people that I grew up with.
Story_ID: 239227
Speaker 1: You mentioned your return to Oxford, North Carolina.  Describe for me the evolution of that town from your boyhood to now.
Speaker 2: You see a, you see a totally, a different town today and, but I will say it's probably no different than most of our other towns.  We're at a point in Oxford where I see too many kids underachieving.  I see too many parents not being parents.  I see, I see a more diverse, from a standpoint of Hispanics and so forth, that I'm not sure that everybody in Oxford even to this day, understand that we're in 2007.  I saw on the TV just two nights ago, where there was a white male who was chasing a black male and female in their car and they even showed a Ku Klux Klan [KKK] hood on.  Now I don't think that is prevalent in Oxford, but, but we don't have enough, I think, of the adults that's giving back to our kids the way they did when I was a young person and I would really like to see more of that.  But then on the other hand, there are some kids who are doing well and just like a lot of our communities, there's not enough emphasis on those kids who do well.  It's even to the point where some of those kids who do well, they don't want people to talk about them because it's almost like you're not cool if you do well.  And as I go into some of these high schools, I'm seeing right, I mean some of these schools, I'm seeing at a very early age, now, when you're talking third and fourth grades, that our kids are getting way behind from the standpoint of intergrade test and I'm thinking at that point in time, if we let this persist on until, until they are 11 and 12 and 13, it's going to be too late to reach them.  One of the programs I've gotten involved with, there was an individual who came to visit me that had heard me speak in Oxford and he came to visit me because he had started a program on how to help at risk kids in some of these schools.  And so when he came to me he said, is there a way we can help?  And I said, well, I'll do whatever I can do.  He said, well can you come back on some mornings and just speak to some of these kids at Mary Potter [Middle School; Mary Potter High School, Oxford, North Carolina], which is the elemen--which is the elementary school now, to just third and fourth graders because we're losing a lot of 'em.  So I go back and speak.  Most of them don't really comprehend a lot that you're talking about but when I saw what he was doing, I also reflected on the other organization I'm part of that I mentioned, [North Carolina State Board of] Communities in Schools, and I also knew that Communities in Schools could go into this, into Oxford and help those at risk kids with, with structured kind of programs.  So, I put this individual who was leading the charge, along with the state president, and we found out that if they could get $25,000 raised, then Communities in Schools would contribute another $25,000 and this $50,000 could start a program where we could start tutoring those kids in the afternoon.  We'd also bring some of the churches together to be able to make that happen.  Two weeks later, I got a call that says, we got the $25,000.  I called the people at Communities in Schools, they put 'em together and then it wasn't several months later that one of my dear friends, Willie [S.] Darby, who was an attorney, one of those eight guys we went to college [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] with, he's an attorney in medicine now, his wife just retired as a school teacher, and she called 'em and says, you know, can you help us do so and so.  She is now coordinating this program with the churches to be able to tutor these kids in the afternoon and I know deep down inside, that will make a difference.
Speaker 1: When you walk down certain streets today in Oxford, do you still see that division?  Whites on one side of the street, blacks on the other?
Speaker 2: No, not necessarily because I don't know, I don't see that division, if you will.  You still see the situation where, you know, most of the economic development and wealth still resides with the white communities but that's all over the United States.  The thing that I walk, when I walk down those streets, I see, I don't see the community that I saw.  I don't see where, I don't see the camaraderie of people the way they were back then.  It obviously seemed a lot smaller now than it was when I was a kid but you, it looks like it's, hasn't had much attention to some of those streets from the standpoint the maintenance of houses and yards and those kind of things, and it doesn't look like the same neighborhood that I grew up in, but sometimes I, it causes you to reflect because you think, what would have happened if I hadn't gotten out?
Speaker 1: What do you think?
Speaker 2: And when you, when you see those kind of things, they bother you because you have to say, what can I do more of to change some of this.  But then I realize how important education was because, and that's why I commit so much time now to going back to those schools because I know if those kids get an education, they have a chance.
Story_ID: 239228
Speaker 1: What's your greatest accomplishment at North Carolina Mutual [Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] so far?
Speaker 2: I think the team of people we put together.  I think we have put, when you look at our team today, I think we have a team of people that are second to none because, I think, we have been able to sell them a vision of where we're going to be, not necessarily there right now.  So everything is not in place the way I would like it to be but I see progress that we're making and when you look at those resumes and the execution of the people that we have today, we've got some, we've got a class A team of people and I'll be willing to put our people up against anybody else's people that you can find because they're, if you look at our senior management team for instance, everyone in our senior management team has at least an M.B.A. or better.  They are, I look on our finance staff, and we have about eight CPAs [Certified Public Accountants].  Now, I don't think a lot of organizations, let alone African American organization, principally African American because we always say we're rooted in the African American community because we do have white policyholders and we do sell to a majority of companies, group life insurance, but it's that team of people that we put together.
Speaker 1: Is that part of the long-term plan as well is to extend beyond majority black clientele?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Or you still focus, will you continue to focus with the black community?
Speaker 2: Our principal, our principal target market today is an African American female, between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five, and the reason that some people say, well why females?  Because the thing we know, for sure, and particularly in black families, and I would say any family, females make a large, on a whole, female make most of the financial decisions in families.  You're nodding your head like you agree, right, most, but they, they make most of the financial decisions.  So, that is our concentration.  That's why we talk about going in those communities, building relationships with those, with those churches because, look in churches.  A large part of that membership are females.  We look in those hair salons, not looking in necessarily the barbershop, but they, those places are where we're finding, we're finding our policyholders.  Another interesting thing that had happened over the last several years is that one time, most of our policyholders were older age people, you know, fifties and so forth.  Our average policyholder today is thirty years old, that we are writing in our new business, is thirty years old.  So, we're very proud of that but we know that the females make that.  Now, on the group side, we also realized that we have a distinct competitive advantage because being the oldest and the largest African American owned insurance company, there is a move in America to make sure that they are doing business with diverse population because of the browning of America.  As the population becomes more diverse, we think that that advantage of ours is increased because of the fact that we will have been in this game, we've been doing group life with the major corporations for about thirty years now but a lot of the new clients that we're getting, we're getting because of the history and who we are but also a company that can deliver those results.  So even though we have an African American background and so forth, we still have to deliver.  As someone who's been on the other side, as a CFO, when I go meet with these corporations, one of the things I always tell them is that we're going to deliver you a great product, at a great price, with great service, and it just so happened, we're African American rooted company, in that order because I think it takes the pressure off because we're not looking for corporate welfare.  We're not coming to you and saying, do this because we're minorities.  We're saying, all we ask is give us a level playing field and if you give me a level playing field, then we can perform with others.
Story_ID: 239229
Speaker 1: It's the year 2007 now.  As you look back upon your life from this moment, what are your greatest accomplishments and what would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I think one of the greatest accomplishments was having a daughter [Kiera Speed] and to have to spend those last years of her high school, to spend, have that opportunity to spend time with her, I think that's one of the greatest accomplishments.  It wasn't something I did at work because I think this is something that will last far beyond work because I don't think one day can someone come back and say, if you're on your death bed say, what are some of your greatest, say, you're going to say, well, I went to work.  It's going to be those saying more like family and other things that will be some of your greatest accomplishment.  I also had an opportunity to do a lot of things with, for my dad [James Speed, Sr.] and my mom [Elizabeth Allen Speed], if you will, that will allow them to have somewhat of a better life before they die, to be able to give something back to them.  But I think if I can say, what would I like my legacy to be at North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina], it would, it would be to be able to help as many families have the natural stability in their life as possible and it's not about me, it's about North Carolina Mutual and I believe that North Carolina Mutual can be the vehicle that allows us to do that.
