Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight warm-up questions we always ask and they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Meatloaf (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue is my favorite color.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: I think fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I think I'd like to see the Grand Tetons [Teton Range] again.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's one I'd like to copyright.  It became my mantra at school teaching kids.  It's, "Do it! Do it right!! And do it right now!!!"  And there's a series of exclamation points after each one.  There's one after each, as the first one, two after do it right, and then there's three after do it right now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think that's one of the best ones we've had (laughter).
Story_ID: 244497
Speaker 1: Now I want to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [William Hayes, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eurma, E-U-R-M-A, Eurma [Jones Hayes].
Speaker 1: E-U-R-M-A.  All right now that's an unusual spelling of Eurma.  Did--was there any story behind that?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, she never told us but we did realize early on that that was an unusual spelling.  Cordella is her middle name, C-O-R-D-E-L-L-A.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And her maiden name is Jones.  Did you know that?
Speaker 1: Okay and we're on Jones Street here in Ypsilanti [Michigan].  What is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Mother was born May 1st, 1918 in I think it was Uniontown, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about your mother's branch of the family?  I mean how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I can take her parents, both her parents and her siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay, but nothing any further back than that?  No stories about any ancestors, or--
Speaker 2: Nothing beyond her grandparents, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think--I know I was never privy to any of that information.  It was not it was a secret, but my--both her parents died when I was still young in the '50s [1950s], so.
Speaker 1: Is there a story at all about how they got to Illinois, or were they originally from Illinois or did they come from the South?
Speaker 2: The earliest I knew about was my grandfather being a minister, preaching in southern Illinois, and particularly in Alton [Illinois].  It was A.C. Jones, and he became quite a well-recognized name in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church in the State of Illinois, anyhow.
Story_ID: 244498
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about him [Hayes' maternal grandfather, A.C. Jones] that are passed down?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the stories, but I do know that he was a very stern, both he and his wife [Nettie Jones] were very stern and, and devout people.  We were not allowed to play on Sunday, for instance, you know, when he was preaching in our town or when he and she lived in our house as they were getting older.  I think he, he saw--from what I hear, his sermons were always quite fiery and, and almost belligerent, you know in, in accepting the gospel, et cetera, et cetera.  I don't know how he was as a father, but I know the five children and, and they did well in, in their lives in terms of family values and, and moral issues and so on I think, so--
Speaker 1: Alton, Illinois was the scene of a lot of abolitionist activity--
Speaker 2: There was that, yeah.
Speaker 1: --back in the 19th century when he was--he probably came along in the latter part of the 19th century.
Speaker 2: Yes he did.  Because as I say, he died in early '50s [1950s].  I was still just like in second grade [at Attucks Elementary School, Carbondale, Illinois] or so.  I remember his casket was in my bedroom.  Took things out of there, you know, and he had--was at rest there one afternoon.  I think also my grandmother was laid out in my room also at that time.  But no, I don't know history beyond that for them.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: She was a matron of the church [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Carbondale, Illinois].  She wore the white dress and the little white hat and sat in the stewardess' pew, and that sort of thing.  I think she was a hard woman to get along with.  I know she spent quite a bit of, quite a few years in my house when I was a kid, and I don't remember her ever being joyous or anything, you know.  And she and my mother [Eurma Jones Hayes] were often, not so much at odds, but tension between them because Mother wanted to raise her family the way she wanted it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Was there any, any, any hint of any knowledge of them having a hard life before they became so stern, or is that--
Speaker 2: I think that's part of it.  I, I re--I remember some--there's some memory there about the way they had to live.  And I, I've read such stories about people fresh out of slavery, et cetera, who overcame tremendous odds.  But I remember, I mean in the '50s [1950s] when I was coming up and, and early '60s [1960s], attitudes in the black community was such that--I mean I wasn't allowed to do music, you know or music was a, a naughty, awesome thing.  And, and she I know helped put that in, into the family, you know.  Keep it clean.  There's no place for that kind of stuff, praise the Lord with music and that sort of thing.  I don't remember her being musical or anything like that.  But she did have those--she was very firm in her beliefs.  And she could, you know, cause others to behave in a certain way.
Story_ID: 244499
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Eurma Jones Hayes] tell you about growing up herself in, in this kind of environment?  I guess she was raised in this kind of stern--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I guess I'm old enough and since my parents are both deceased, several of my brothers and sisters know about this interview and, and a few years ago I called myself going to visit some of my mother's friends, childhood friends through her adult life to find out what kind of person she was in their eyes.  And two of her very good friends told me--it's nothing that anybody need be ashamed of, but at the same time, she was in fact her own person.  She made some mistakes, but at that time I think the towns helped protect people.  I don't know what else.  The friends told me that she was the ringleader, that she could be the one to get things going.  But they all came through and as I recall they're all, they were all staunch believers and, and good people in the community and so on.  And just as any other teeners [ph.] would do, they were in little cliques, you see.  And there had to been some kind of tension because mother was living with a very stern set of parents [A.C. Jones and Nettie Jones], and of course I think she was, she's the third of five.  So--but they managed to all get through somehow or the other without--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother--did she have a chance to go to college or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Mother went through high school, but she did not attend college.  I would say that she was, she always presented herself as very intelligent.  She was aware of what she knew she needed to talk about and she did not rattle on about things that she didn't know.  She was very--she, she spoke well, she could write well.  She read extensively, especially the scriptures, but books also, other books.  And it was always she that they came to for the condolence at funerals and so on, and she could do it at the drop of a hat because somebody just died and we need to take care of this.
Story_ID: 244500
Speaker 1: Mother [Eurma Jones Hayes] was an activist in that she for a long time was PTA [Parent Teacher Association] president and otherwise served on the board.  Sought a position on the school board when I was in high school [Carbondale Community High School, Carbondale, Illinois] I think, and did not win.  But she was concerned enough about our community and its education that she fought hard, you know, for, for the schools and for the teachers, the students and the teachers.  She had always been a cook.  Moved up to where she was considered chef at a local resort park, it's an Illinois state park.
Speaker 2: Now which park was it?
Speaker 1: Giant City State Park [Makanda, Illinois].  She cooked for quite a few of the sorority and fraternity houses on campus [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] and a few businesses in town.  She finally gave up the cooking and she was, you know, phenomenal at it.  She taught all of her daughters to cook.  Most of them didn't remember how, but two of them are still good at it anyhow.  At least that's what the story goes.  But mother was still so concerned during the [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] years.  Dad [William Hayes, Sr.] went to the March on Washington, but mother was called to Washington [D.C.] by [President Richard Milhous] Nixon when Model Cities [Program] was the big thing.  And she had been so vocal on deterioration of the northeast side of town, and had created some noise in the town, enough that they did select her to go.  And Nixon was calling representatives to the White House [Washington, D.C.].  And she was there for a meeting with him.  I don't know what all happened, but I do know that when she died, a building was erected in her honor in Carbondale [Illinois], my hometown, with her name across the front of it as the Eurma [C.] Hayes Center [Carbondale, Illinois].  And that was--they were called community centers then, okay.  And it housed all sorts of services for then neighborhood and people outside the neighborhood.  It was for a while had some state funding and then it had city funding.  One of my sisters is still very heavily involved in it, creating a new funding source for it and so on.  But she had that sort of respect in her community.  She could pray at the drop of a hat in church or wherever else was necessary.  She wasn't beyond the normal swear words that you find all the time in the black (laughter)--but she, she and Dad both were quite involved and concerned about our coming up.  And I think it was Mother that did most of, I'm sure it was, the disciplining. And she was fervent.  It didn't matter if it was a switch or an ironing cord or a belt, what have you, you know, you learned the lesson and you didn't do that sort of thing again.  But her arm must have gotten tired with the ten of us, you know, through the course of our lives (laughter).  There were a lot of beatings going on.  And you know I'm not re--I don't regret the ones that I got because they helped to make, you know, me what I am, you know.  There was something being taught here.  You better learn what this is quick.
Story_ID: 244501
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?  Well it's the same as yours (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes that's same as mine.  William R. Hayes, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay and what, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 20--May 21st, 1912.  And he was born in Carbondale [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay now what do you know about his side of the family, about the family tree on that side?
Speaker 2: His mother [Lillian Parrot Hayes] moved, I think it was from Tennessee to a little town in--she moved with her family, her parents to a little town, now I can't say it.  It's right near Anna, Illinois, near Giant City State Park [Makanda, Illinois].  I'm going to say it before long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the interesting thing about that was as I said they moved in from Tennessee.  I've never known anybody except white people that lived in that town, and it was only about a hundred people.  And it was like a, a Tennessee mountain community 'cause it was where the glacier stopped in Southern Illinois and made all these rock formations and so on.  The valleys and, and somewhat twisty roads.  But that's where--Makanda, M-A-K-A-N-D-A, Makanda, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay so his mother was from Makanda.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They moved to Carbondale from Makanda.  I never knew that my grandmother worked anywhere.  She was a, she was a senior citizen when I first remembered her.  But she too lived some time at the end of her life in our house.  I remember she had her own house and we would go there and visit her and I would--my brother, it was his turn and it was my turn to go and chop wood and take care of her yard and that sort of thing.  Sisters would go and clean house.  As she got older, she moved into an apartment in the, in the back of our house where she had a room and a kitchen and a bathroom.  And that's where I knew her.  She didn't tell me stories.  She didn't even say much about her husband [Ova Hayes], whom, who had died before I was old enough to know.  I knew about her brother who had been living in her house, who was an invalid and bedridden.  He was Uncle Henry [ph.].  But I don't know anything about him.  I do know that her husband worked on the tie plant, that's railroad ties, in Carbondale.  And as a result of an accident, he lost his eyesight and of course in those days like everybody else, you didn't get any compensation for it.  So I remember my dad telling me stories about him selling, about my dad selling his father's brooms that he made in Carbondale.  But I don't know anything about--I guess because of the accident, he didn't do anything else that I knew about.  Only time I saw him was when he was bedridden.  So the story about his blindness came to me from stories, you know.
Story_ID: 244502
Speaker 1: What did your father [William Hayes, Sr.] say about growing up in, in Carbondale [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Only in the last couple years of his life did he get into talking about those things with me.  And I discovered not only he--I guess in a way I can say it today.  He was a hustler and he, he didn't hustle unclean stuff.  He just wanted to make a living for himself, his family.  So he was always at work doing something.  And he mentioned some things that he had done that I didn't know about.  Nothing, as again, he was doing odd jobs.  And there were certain black men in town who had some, either property or other sort of recognition in the community, who made positions available for a young man to go to work, et cetera.  So he seemed to have had a good time.  He stayed in contact with the class of '36 [1936] until the last I knew there three of them left before he died.  But most of them also stayed in Carbondale and, and made that their home.  Dad, since he was head of household during World War II [WWII], he was not called up to service, but he did serve in the CCC [Civilian Conservation Corps] in Southern Illinois.  And they--I don't know what all the projects were that he worked on, but--and I don't, I wouldn't remember his being away because I was still too--I was born in '44 [1944].  So I wouldn't know any of that firsthand.  But I do, I have seen pictures of him at camps.  I don't know--it was just a men standing in rows and so--Dad was very well respected.  He attended a Baptist church, his mother [Lillian Parrot Hayes] attended a different Baptist church.  But Dad was an officer in the church, he was an upstanding citizen.  His physical size and his character, a gentle bear you might say, allowed him free access to the community and, and so on.
Story_ID: 244503
Speaker 1: He [Hayes' father, William Hayes, Sr.] always enjoyed children.  There was a lot, a vacant lot behind, beside our house.  And it was always full of children on good play days, even through the nights, not through the night, but through darkness when we were playing hide and seek in our yard.  Half of the town [Carbondale, Illinois] would be there.  And he, he fostered children coming to play in the yard.  It was a place for them to come and, and do and oft times he was there to make sure there's no--kids did not mess around.  They respected Mr. Hayes' property.  And when Mrs. Hayes [Hayes' mother, Eurma Jones Hayes] put the laundry out, there was no ball playing, you know, 'cause the dust would settle on the clothes.  And we all knew that, but the town would come and that structure I told you where my [paternal] grandmother [Lillian Parrot Hayes] had lived for a while, he had built for college students.  I think he had room for eight male students on the two sides of the thing.
Speaker 2: The students at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At SIU, right.
Speaker 2: --Southern Illinois University, right.
Speaker 1: But he turned it into a two-sided rec [recreation] center in our back yard.  One side was a pool--a ping pong table.  And boys just came and stood in line to play.  And, and on the other side was a jukebox.  I don't think we sold any--yeah, there was things to, to eat like dogs and stuff, you know, pop.  But it was open all the time.  And, and he and mother both invited, just by their being alive, children to come there.  And they were all respectful.  There were some bad boys in town, but they did not misbehave when they were on the Hayes' property.  Dad went on to--he was--he worked for the Republicans for most elections that I remember, as a driver to the polls.  And as you probably already know, the drivers to the polls had boxes of booze in the back of the car (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, now, now tell us about this.  I don't, I don't, I don't know about that.
Speaker 1: I don't know whether he had a position or not, but I know he worked for the, the committee precinct person or someone.  And every election time they would bring a trunk load of booze, bottles of whiskey.  Which he would have in his car for a couple, three days, you know and, and stop off and give brother such-and-so a drink and remind him to come vote, and that sort of thing.  I didn't know there was any--there was nothing wrong with that when I was growing up 'cause that's what it was, you know.  And as I look back, I see my dad doing what was in his power to do, you know.  He wanted the election, and, and that was one way.  He was--both he and my parents, he and, he and my mother were both personal first name basis with the line of mayors that I knew through the town, police chiefs and, and all of those.  And I, I know the reason for, I think the reason for that is there were a certain few recognized black families in the neighborhood whom the white community would think would represent that neighborhood.  And Mother and Dad for whatever were amongst those who could be called upon to, to say things.
Story_ID: 244504
Speaker 1: Did he [Hayes' father, William Hayes, Sr.] have a chance to go to school, to finish college?
Speaker 2: He went through the first year of college.
Speaker 1: Did he go to SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], or did he--
Speaker 2: I am not sure.  The possibility is that he did.  Interestingly enough, there were ten of us, one of us [Leland Hayes] is deceased.  He is one of the three that did not yet have college degrees.  One is in progress still, but otherwise there are several master's degrees, there's no doctorate degrees in the family.  And SIU Alumni magazine once last year featured the Hayes family. All of us except two got degrees from SIU.  And they put a big spread about the family and, and its history in Carbondale [Illinois].  There are some--there are two doc--two books that have been written about Carbondale and they appear in those as well.
Story_ID: 244505
Speaker 1: Did your father [William Hayes, Sr.]--now what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He worked on the Illinois Central Railroad I understand for forty years.  Interestingly enough, he would bring his--he would bring stories home.  It was--we had dinner around the table and he would sit at the head with his spoon.  He had a favorite spoon which went with him to lunch in his lunchbox and came back home and was watched and got ready for dinner.  So--but he would lean on the table and tell us all about Heisler.  Mr. Heisler was the, the Jewish boss, the German, the German boss of, of the yard where he worked.  But Heisler kept Dad in a job for all the years that I knew.  There were layoffs when the, when the diesel engines came in.  And quite a few of the black men lost their jobs.  Some of them with families as large as Dad's.  But he managed to work for forty continuous years.  He fell off an engine once and hurt his hip, but--
Speaker 1: Your, your dad?
Speaker 2: My dad.  He was compensated I assume well enough, you know.  But he retired finally and, and collected his pension from the railroad.  And I think, you know that's a biggie, to do forty years and, and manage to do that.  And I think that's also something about what I'm trying--what I'm glad that I was able to go through my career without, you know, having it marred or anything.
Story_ID: 244506
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind how your parents [William Hayes, Sr. and Eurma Jones Hayes] met?
Speaker 2: I don't think I know that.  And I've still been--I was left out of the loop of some pertinent information for a long time and didn't know it even existed (laughter).  But I have discovered that my oldest sister [Georgetta Slaughter] was born before my parents were married.  And so that, that means to me that they had had some sort of relationship and I think I can truthfully say that my oldest sister's father was not my father.  Which gave me a lot of pause for a lot of years trying to figure this out.  This is the old man whom I had nothing but respect for forever.  This is the woman who is my mother for whom I've always had respect and love and would do anything for her.  And then found out that there was another man.  And then I think that my dad married this woman with a child, and I know they expressed physically their love in our presence throughout their entire relationship.  The community could see they loved each other and so on.
Story_ID: 244507
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My first time in the barbershop.  It was my mother's [Eurma Jones Hayes] brother Uncle Levy [ph.] took me for my first haircut.  My mother had been braiding my hair and, and it was big and bushy and stuff, I recall.  She--for a long time she had an envelope of locks which was long curls.  I don't think my sisters are going to remember that, maybe Georgie [Georgetta Slaughter] will.  But he took me when I was four to the barbershop.  And I remember sitting up on the thing across the arms of the chair.  And that same summer he put an antenna for FM radio on the top of the house.  He was somewhat of an electrician.  More than that, I think he was an alcoholic.  But he knew how to do the electricity, and he did some things in the house when he was around for my mother.  Those I remember, and he put the antenna because Daddy [William Hayes, Sr.] bought Mother a, a console radio turntable, which could play both 78s and 45s.  And I don't know why he chose to put money into that, but it was a Christmas present.  And I remember that year after the antenna was there, Mother and I could get, Mother could get FM radio stations on that radio.  And that's where I first heard the classical music.  Didn't know it was classical, it was just what Mother played when I was in the house.  My other brothers and sisters older than I were already at school, so it was just me and her in the house all day for a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Now that's, that's something that people today may not know that FM in those days was used primarily, it was the end of the--it was where you could hear classical music.
Speaker 2: I don't remember which side of the dial it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there weren't many--well the FM band was where you heard classical music.  That's all that basically was on FM band.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true.
Speaker 1: For many years until I guess the early maybe mid-'60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: See I didn't know that because the only radio I listened to during the day or heard rather was the FM station.  I don't remember the radio playing rock and roll.  I do know that in the '50s [1950s] when rock and roll came around, the 45 became the 78 record, and then later on the 45s, Elvis Presley and from then on, you know, all the stereos, stereos, hi-fis I guess, record players, that's what they played.  And Sunday mornings there was the gospel music, Mahalia Jackson and the quartets [the Golden Gate Quartet] from down south on radio shows.
Speaker 1: Like Blind Boys.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't wanna say that.  I don't know how many Blind Boys there are (laughter), but there's always some.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Blind Boys of Alabama I think, but there were, there were several different groups of people that called, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Story_ID: 244508
Speaker 1: I remember my brother and my cousins, I was, as I said, Little Bill, and I was about a stick, little bitty thing, short and skinny.  They used to tackle me and, and tickle me and, and hold me down.  And the laughing was so hard, and it was so relentless that it was crying.  And I remember being hurt, you know, by all of that attention.  I spent a lot of time by myself.  I remember a tree, my brother and I both had favorite trees in the backyard, they were quite tall.  And we built a, a seat in ours.  And every year he would find someplace higher in his chair, tree (unclear) (laughter).  So I'd keep going up.  I remember having pet chameleons which I'd buy for a dime at the ten cent store.  I remember playing with my sister Nettie [Morgan] when she was, well she's three years older than I.  But we'd bury insects and things together.  Had funerals and that sort of thing.  There's lots of, of child--as I said, the yard was always filled with children, so there was, yeah I remember that from my childhood.  My friend Hardin Allen and I were both newspaper carriers.  I think I started in the fifth grade carrying for Chicago Daily News in the morning before school.  And then that spring of that same, the next year I started with The Southern Illinoisan.  And he got a route with Southern Illinoisan as well.  And the two of us were--he was fatty, I was skinny and like twins for a long time.  We got bicycles and as we got middle school [Attucks Elementary School, Carbondale, Illinois] and high school [Carbondale Community High School, Carbondale, Illinois], we started exploring our town on our bicycles.  And I remember some of the neighborhoods we were asked don't ride in here, get out of here, you know.  But we explored Carbondale [Illinois] together and we talked about a lot of things, you know, and I guess that's when I began to recognize who I am through the eyes of somebody else or playing off of somebody else.  And we became our own characters, you know.
Story_ID: 244509
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Carbondale [Illinois] had the, the railroad, the freight yard.  All the trains would come through the city.  Traffic would stop.  And especially in the days of the steam engines, they would bring this black, billowing smoke.  And I remember as a young kid, I didn't know it, but when I would be downtown and the smoke would come through, I would cough a lot.  I remember those smells, the sounds from the engines also all day long.  Illinois Central [Railroad] was a direct route from Chicago [Illinois] to New Orleans [Louisiana] and/or to Miami [Florida].  So all the trains came through there.  Sights, Crab Orchard Lake with the spillway where we went fishing and, and swimming.  It was a big manmade lake there in Southern Illinois.  Sights, I guess the university [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] campus.  Watching the town grow as I was coming up, you know.  I, I saw things that were there before I knew they were there, but discovering them.  I began to look at the buildings themselves in the town and, and see the architecture and the art and the facades and that sort of stuff.  There was, it was a segregated town.  And in 1956 Illinois celebrated its centennial [sic.].  I remember that I had a little t-shirt, we all had white t-shirts with the, that--whatever the logo was at that time.  I was through college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], having entered quite a few establishments that ordinarily I would not have been able to go to, but things were lightening up.  But once I was gone in the, in the late '60s [1960s] and all the little towns began to have racial strife.  And I remember some of my friends boycotting and, and going to stand in line against certain businesses and so on.  But that was, you know, later.  As a kid, Hardin [Allen] and I were both quite active in our church [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Carbondale, Illinois].  We would run errands at Eastertime to pick up the eggs from the, the sisters.  They would be boiled and we'd bring 'em to church and ladies there would color them and so on.  Do the same thing at Christmastime for the fruit.  We both would bring a pocketful of spare change for Sunday school every Sunday so our class could have the highest collection.  I spent most of my time I guess with Hardin Allen.  And it was good time, we were boys, you know.  We didn't get in any trouble or get in anybody--sights, sounds, smells.

Speaker 1: The [Ayer-Lord] tie plant had a smell of creosote, you could smell that almost all over the town [Carbondale, Illinois] quite a bit of the time.  Mosquito abatement (laughter) come through with the jeep with the tanks on the back.  And, and spray this gray mist all over (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now that's--this is just a subjective observation here that Southern Illinois is probably one of the most humid and hot mosquito filled places in the world.  I mean that's just a subjective assessment of it having only been down there a couple of times.  But is that true?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, it's, it's hot and, and often a lot of moisture.  And there's always mosquitoes.  I'm sure, now when I was home last couple of times I noticed my brother's street, which had been a paved street for a long time with curbs.  Kept noticing how all these black folks had these lawns all manicured and so on.  And so I asked him, he said well there's a law (laughter).  You know and, and that was new to me because how you kept your yard was totally up to you, but anymore.  Certain streets anyhow, you had to follow certain codes.
Speaker 2: Right there where the Mississippi and Ohio meet and all that, that's the land that Mark Twain writes about, ['Adventures of] Huckleberry Finn.'
Speaker 1: That's called Little Egypt.
Speaker 2: Little Egypt, right, right.  And that's--
Speaker 1: And of course you would remember Cairo [Illinois] in the '60s [1960s] with the racial stuff that was going on there.
Speaker 2: Was that [HistoryMaker] James [H.] Cone down there who was involved in that?
Speaker 1: I don't remember.
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: It's like a very southern, I mean people think of Illinois as being this northern state, but Southern Illinois is pretty southern.
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, my hometown is south of the Mason Dixon Line.  And, and I didn't know it was southern until I moved away and, and, and found out.  But it had a lot of southern tradition.  It was a town where both majority and minority races knew where to step.  And I don't think there were--I don't remember any racial incidents when I was coming up where somebody was arrested or accosted or beat up or whatever.  People were sent to prison for thievery--robbery or something or other.  You know but there was nothing that I remember.  Now right next door in, in Williamson County [Illinois], and this is again before my time, with the coal mining industry there all around Southern Illinois, there was some bloody battles in Williamson County and there have been books written about that.  And I have a relative on my father's [William Hayes, Sr.] side who when I knew him as an old man, had been justice of the peace and fire chief with one fire truck in the town and right across the street from his house.  But I didn't know history and I didn't--all I knew is these old people who were around.
Story_ID: 244511
Speaker 1: Did you go to integrated schools or were they segregated?
Speaker 2: In the northeast side [of Carbondale, Illinois], there was Attucks Elementary [School, Carbondale, Illinois], [Attucks] Junior High [School, Carbondale, Illinois] in one building.  When I knew it, and then while I was going to school, they built the Attucks High School [Carbondale, Illinois] right next door.  Those were both black institutions, black administrators and, and black teachers.  There were no white teachers.  And I, I think most of the, the black teachers were local citizens.  Some of the high school teachers had moved, had been brought in from someplace else.  And I remember when I was in fifth grade, a young woman from I don't know what town in Mississippi, but came there to teach.  And it was a comb--I guess it was sixth grade, in the fifth and sixth combination classroom we called it.  And it was just looking at Ms. Montgomery [ph.] all day long 'cause it'd been nobody in town as pretty as this woman.  It turns out that she married a relative, my sister's husband's brother.  School was, was good.  I remember being--making good grades.  I remember feeling without--no I can't say I remember feeling the tension of performing up to standard.  But there was that.  The Hayses were expected to, to progress and, and succeed.  So through eighth grade, I didn't make anything except A, just like I think those before me and probably--by the time I left high school, elementary--the, the junior high school there, they were at that time about to start integrating the district.  I went to the white high school across town for my freshman year.  And I think I was one of six that came from, from Attucks that went to [Carbondale] Community High School [Carbondale, Illinois].  There were three girls, one of whom I know went on to SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] and became a teacher in Carbondale [Illinois].  Don't know what happened to the other two girls.
Story_ID: 244512
Speaker 1: So did you stay there [Carbondale Community High School, Carbondale, Illinois] all four years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All four years, right.  Now this was the second year of integration in that building.  I don't know the other students except one of them who was there the year before.  But he was not one of the people that I had a--I knew him, but he and I were not in the same--but I went--once I started going there, he and I walked to school three years together, side-by-side, talking and carrying on.  I got to know a different mindset, a person older than I who knew more about the world and so on.  But interestingly enough, my freshman year I was in band class and I got an announcement to come to the office.  And they called me there and said I--they accused me of having danced with two white girls in the hallway.  Remember I went to high school four feet eight inches tall, ninety-nine pounds.  Was forced onto the football team during which season I grew quite a bit, you know.  But I was still too small to have manhandled those size women in the crowd.  It was just a crush, you know, at that time of day is impossible for anybody my size to just anything--slip through.  And the thing was they had the principal from Attucks High School [Carbondale, Illinois] sitting there in the principal's office.  "This is a serious, this is a serious offense.  This is a serious offense."
Speaker 1: Saying this to you?
Speaker 2: And he and Mother [Eurma Jones Hayes], you know, well Mother knew what he was.  I mean he was the leader, but he was not a perfect gentleman, you know.  And when she found out about his coming there and not defending me (laughter), rather than allow them to continue to accuse, you know.  She had some words for him.  I managed to get through.
Speaker 1: How did they frame that?  That you are dancing with two white girls.  Did they say, "This is wrong for a black boy to dance with two white girls,"--what did they--
Speaker 2: That was the, the message that came across, okay.  All they did was accuse--they didn't say it was right or wrong, but--
Speaker 1: They say were you, or did--
Speaker 2: They asked me, no they told me that I had.  The two girls had said it.  And one of them played oboe in the band, one played clarinet.  And they were like at least juniors, possibly seniors.  And, and like I say, both of them bigger people than I.  So I didn't know why, you know, I was even considered to be the scapegoat for this.  It was shortly after that, it was early in my freshman year, like within the first month of school because I had been placed in all these slow and remedial classes as a freshman 'cause this little black kid across town couldn't keep up of course, so.
Story_ID: 244513
Speaker 1: The assumption was you couldn't keep up.  They didn't test you or anything did they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no tests.  So I was moved finally to--they took me to geometry.  I never even spelled the word geometry.  And from then the other fast tracked classes for the top echelon of Carbondale [Community High School, Carbondale, Illinois] students.  It took me a year to get up from a C back up to a decent grade point.  But I, I--Mother [Eurma Jones Hayes] didn't forgive them, but I put myself through that and I lived through that.  And as a result of my going to high school, I got scholarship to go to college [Southern Illinois University (SIU), Carbondale, Illinois].  And now we're talking about the stuff that made me, you know, who I am.  I had learned how to behave and, and cooperate as a child and, and the route seemed to be do what you're told and I was always luckily guided with some very good information and some good counselors and so on.  But I did.  I took the courses.  I got a music scholarship and was guided through all the coursework.  And when I came up time to graduate, my counselors and teachers knew that I had degree potential in bass, tuba, composition and education.  So they came together and said, "Take the education degree, you can always teach and write and play," and so on.  So I did.  But that was those people leading me, my professors.  It was my parents and the church [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Carbondale, Illinois] at home recognizing that I was in school doing a good job, on stage playing, in a concert every other week or so for five years.  So that's--that same thing from going to school and making the grade, upholding the standard in someone.  I don't remember even ever feeling pushed to accomplish, I was just thirsty, I wanted to accomplish.  And as I, I think I left SIU having taken all of the music classes in the catalog except the opera.
Story_ID: 244514
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite kind of music as you were growing up?
Speaker 2: My sister, my older sister was in high school and she got involved with George Shearing and Dave Brubeck.  I remember those--Nina Simone I think.  She was listening to that sort of jazz on her own stereo.  I don't know how she got it, but--and then of course my brother came in and he shortly after that with rock and roll.  So I heard these and I heard the gospel.  My dad [William Hayes, Sr.] sang in the church choir.  My mother [Eurma Jones Hayes] sang in her church choir.  I had heard without knowing the [Ludwig van] Beethoven and so on.  So I didn't have any favorites.  And as a matter of fact, I was--I couldn't play an instrument; I didn't read music until I was a sophomore in high school [Carbondale Community High School, Carbondale, Illinois].  But I had sung in church as a young boy and sang boy soprano for a while.  Not trained, but that's because it, you know, I was next in line.  There was always some boy to sing 'Holy Night' at Christmastime, you know.  So I passed through that time.  While in high school, I was playing the band literature and discovered that I could improvise bass lines and the band teacher used to throw things at me for adding notes, you know, in the piece (laughter).  But a couple of friends of mine and I--
Speaker 1: So he didn't like you--he didn't want you--
Speaker 2: He, he saw.  Now I see where it come from.  He saw my potential.  He wanted to make sure that I used it in the right place, the right way.  "Learn how to do it, I'll help you learn how to do it.  But this is the wrong place for it," okay.  So three of us started a Dixieland group, we called ourselves the Jazzbo.  And we played pep rallies, we were at--we were the pep band for the basketball games and so on, tuba, trumpet, trombone, saxophone and drums.  And we were just--it was awesome to think that we could make that much music being young and ignorant, you know, about--
Speaker 1: It just dawned on me.  Now you're, you're right there at, at Carbondale [Illinois], right on the confluence of the Ohio and the Mississippi.  I think during--in the 19th century, that was like a, a riverboat era of music, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but you also know what was on the riverboat, the gambling and the prostitution and that sort of stuff.  And that was the stuff that I was supposed to stay away from.  I remember a black bass player who worked at the [Ayer-Lord] tie plant, his name was Diddle Chambers [ph.].  Diddle was his, I guess his stage name.  I never heard him play, but I would sometimes on Sunday mornings be on my paper route and I'd see his bass in the back of his car.  But I wasn't supposed to emulate him.  But I do remember in high school when we were with the jukebox in the backyard, we had dancing and I was always bashful and shy.  But the girls chose to make me dance anyhow.  I always sang the bass lines to the rock and roll songs in their ears.  I didn't know the words, but I knew the bass line (laughter).  So I mean that helped a great deal in my playing the tuba 'cause I knew the lines.  I just didn't know anything about how to--but the ear and the brain eventually came together and the fingers.  My high school band director asked me to join him and some high school buddies who were playing Saturday afternoons in a local bar for college students, football Saturday afternoon, to play bass with his group, tuba because their tuba player who also was a music teacher, was leaving the area.  And I went in and got an education playing Dixieland with some, some really good guys.
Story_ID: 244515
Speaker 1: Did you always suspect you were going to go to SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois]?  Or did you--or was it--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you think you were going someplace else to college or when you--
Speaker 2: No.  When I, I'd gotten sophomore, junior and senior years [at Carbondale Community High School, Carbondale, Illinois] won at, at state festival on my instrument.  So as a result of that, I was awarded a scholarship at SIU for one year.  But I also ranked high enough in my graduating class that when the second year's allotment came about, I was awarded a state scholarship for the next four years of school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were--you graduated from high school in '62 [1962], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And from college in '67 [1967].  But I had no, I had no idea about going away anywhere to college.  It was the next thing that happened, and it happened.  I didn't prepare for--I mean I didn't sign papers or go out seeking and so on.  It's your turn.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well I, I thought you were going to explain how it happened.
Speaker 2: How--
Speaker 1: You say well yeah, you, you didn't, you didn't--
Speaker 2: How I got to college?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well yeah you said you didn't start out--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't intend, I didn't have any--about to go to SIU, but I did know that I wanted to go to college.  As a matter of fact, I had told my dad [William Hayes, Sr.] before I got the music scholarship, that I was going to be, I wanted to be a foreign diplomat to do languages and, and, and government because I had some Spanish in high school and three years of Spanish, in my senior I had French.  And I thought that was a, a reasonable thing to think about.  Made my dad quite proud.  "My son's going to get a"--but that was in high school.  And then I started college, the musician, I don't think he spoke to me for, you know, a couple of years because I was going against that Carbondale [Illinois] mentality.  This kind of music is not healthy, you know.  And you can't make a living as a musician, other than going to those sorts of places.  And I never once thought I'm going to make a liar out of him.  I went to learn [Ludwig van] Beethoven and [Johann Sebastian] Bach and [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart and, and I learned that.  I learned to use it to do blues and jazz and the other stuff as well.
Story_ID: 244516
Speaker 1: Throughout high school [Carbondale Community High School, Carbondale, Illinois] and college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] and maybe even in grade school [Attucks Elementary School, Carbondale, Illinois], did you have any mentors or, or teachers that came along and recognized your talent and decided to--
Speaker 2: In, in early on, one of the teachers at the high school, Hardin Allen's mother as a matter of fact, since he and I spent a lot of time together, she saw to it that we had academic activity going.  She was a single parent and she had two boys.  So they almost always had more stuff than anybody else.  So she offered us all sorts of educational experiences at her home.  In high school it was my band director who kept saying for four years, "Some of you should go on to college as music students because you really"--and I knew he was never talking to me or about me.  But I was the one that won his scholarship for my senior year.  Then there were two men early on at college, they were both tuba teachers.  My first tuba teacher was a trombonist who was killed in an accident.  He and I were about to make a decent relationship when the other one started.  And he and I became more than just student and, and teacher.  He was somewhat of a mentor.  Two other people at the university made tremendous musical influences on my life.  My composition teacher and the choral director there who chose me to play bass in his oratorios and, and that sort of thing.  And so they showed me a lot of stuff that a lot of students may not have gotten.  And I won't forget them.  And then of course I had three years of bass studies with the principal in the St. Louis Symphony at the time, Henry Lowe.  And I would go every Saturday for three years with a buddy, friend of mine.  That man made me understand performance aspect of the music.  And he did a lot to further me on.
Story_ID: 244517
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about Henderson, Kentucky.  Is it time for that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: While I was in college, I, as I said I was majoring in tuba, but my tuba teacher thought I should also study bass to make me better all-around musician.  And studying then, there was a group of us, two kids from my class and one year younger and a year older, we formed, we called the, the Justin Singers, mid-'60s [1960s], Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk groups, all of that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're patterned after like the folk singing.
Speaker 2: Yes, these are--
Speaker 1: Now is this a mixed group or what?
Speaker 2: These are all white people.
Speaker 1: All white people.
Speaker 2: Two girls and two boys and me.  I didn't sing, I just played bass.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we got good enough that we were winning talent shows at the university and so on.  We were awarded a Monday night half hour TV show for a year, which we did live in the studio.
Speaker 1: Was that at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  There are no extant tapes of any of that.  And I have been trying to find university, find someplace in the university to get them, but nobody seems to have them.  So we had--this was my senior year, my first senior year.  And the last year the group was together because two of, three of them graduated and left.  But we had won the major event at SIU on campus and the talent scouts from Henderson, Kentucky were there.  They had been coming--I didn't know, but for years taking the top winners over to their show for competition.  So we were invited to go.
Story_ID: 244518
Speaker 1: And I remember it was almost tornado weather.  It was very scary driving across Southern Illinois with that ominous sky.  But we [the Justin Singers] drove to Henderson [Kentucky] and, and straight to a restaurant/bar where three of our schoolmates were singing, like The Kinsmen--the Kingston Trio or something or other.  And it was afternoon, so we walked in and, and saw their instruments and their stage and there was a, a bartender and a waitress.  And we sat for twenty minutes and neither one of them came.  They just kept talking.  Finally, one of us asked her, and long and short, they weren't going to serve us.  So we asked them to call the manager and they called the manager and the manager says, "No, do not serve them."  So we left.  We went and, and played the show and, and won first place.  And the first person backstage to congratulate us was the owner of that restaurant where we had been denied service.  And he still doesn't know that we were the ones that he had denied service.  "Want you guys to come down to my restaurant and have dinner, have anything, drinks, stay at my house tonight, swim in my pool in the morning."  And he doesn't--he didn't know that he had refuse (laughter)--so after we had declined.  We did go to the restaurant and have dinner and, and lots--we even played a couple of songs that night.  But we drove back.  And the little town of Carmi [Illinois], C-A-R-M-I.  We stopped burgers just like one o'clock or so in the morning, whatever.  And the--all of a sudden the place filled up.  I mean every seat.  You could hear the country western music and so on.  And just as we finished our burgers, the place emptied.  And we were the last people in the room.  And we walked outside and every headlight in Carmi turned on that building (laughter).  So we got in our car and we were going to go west.  And we were blocked from going out of the driveway by a line of cars that was going west.  And finally the line stopped and somebody let us in line.  The rest of the cars followed us out and led us (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: No other incident.  But you know that has to be a memorable experience for, for the five of us.
Story_ID: 244519
Speaker 1: What were you thinking?  I suppose you didn't know what to think, did you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was, that was really frightening.  And, and I was listening to this--our leader [of the Justin Singers] who was a year older and quite a bit larger than most, the rest of us, trying to be rational.  This is not the time.  These people want us to leave, let us go, you know, was my feeling about it.  And I didn't want to hear him argue or to get hurt or any of the rest of us get hurt.  Somehow or the other we were led out of that town [Carmi, Illinois] safely and--but that's, that was the first time that I had felt--I'm sorry, that's not the first time.  The first time I felt the stigma of my race with--when I was a news carrier, The Southern Illinoisan had sponsored every year a contest to send the winners to Miami Beach [Florida] for four to six days, whatever it was at the time.  And when I won for the first time, they didn't know what to do because no black had ever won, won enough points to go.  And then said he wanted to go.  Well Miami Beach where they were going to take this boy was not, you know, ready for me.  The trip was postponed twice until they finally found a hotel that would accommodate me.  We got there, we drove, rode on my dad's [William Hayes, Sr.] train, Illinois Central [Railroad] all the way to Miami Beach.  Jacksonville [Florida], somebody called me Sambo.  But hey, I'm in the South, I can deal with that.  We got to the hotel and I had a suite of rooms for me, two bedrooms, a sitting a room and a bathroom, and a view of the oceanfront.  The seven white boys who were with me had that same accommodation, all of them together.  After the second night when they realized I had all that room, they just automatically split up (laughter).
Speaker 1: So they put you in a room by your--segregated you in the room by yourself.
Speaker 2: And I was not allowed to go to the pool or to the beach.
Speaker 1: Even though you were in Miami Beach as a vacation, as a reward.
Speaker 2: I could not touch their water.  So they--I remember having a helicopter ride all over Miami Beach while the boys were swimming one day, you know there was--so those two, you know, while I was a youngster.
Story_ID: 244520
Speaker 1: How did you feel about that in light of I guess the stuff on the news.  The clips on the evening news about the Civil Rights Movement and other things.  Did you have any kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was before--
Speaker 1: That was before the--okay--
Speaker 2: --so it was before [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.], see.  And my mother [Eurma Jones Hayes] was hot headed enough--"I want my boy to go."  And so they did--I didn't realize all that was going on in the background, I'm just waiting for the trip, you know.  But she asked them if they could take me to Virginia Beach [Virginia].  Well that was too far out of the way, you know, for any one person to leave the rest of the boys and--I knew that there was confusion, but I knew that I felt safe with the person who was in charge of us.  He was our circulation manager [at The Southern Illinoisan] and I knew that he was going to take care of it.  I didn't feel, you know, put upon or in any danger or anything.  And sure enough, we got back and there was--I won the trip again the next year and they refused to go to Miami Beach [Florida] anymore.  We went to a dude ranch in Indiana (laughter).  But by then I was through--I think that was my sophomore year in high school [Carbondale Community High School, Carbondale, Illinois] or something other, freshman or sophomore year.  But those, you know they, they didn't hurt.  I didn't suffer.  I didn't have to be a martyr or anything.  When I got into teaching and was out in Nebraska my first teaching year, there was the ranch area in the center of the state, the Sandhills.  And the kids came from ranches in a twenty-five, thirty mile radius.  They were all white.  I don't remember any Indians [Native Americans] in that town even.  But it was the same year in the spring that Martin Luther King was killed.  And my first wife and I were living there, two black people in this town of 112 people, by the way (laughter).  All of a sudden there was a car at our door, somebody knocking at our door constantly, coming to give us their condolences over Dr. King's death.  People whom we didn't know, they didn't know us, they knew that we were there and they came from as far as Ballantyne [ph.], that's a hundred miles, you know.  And I thought that was an awesome experience.  Well we didn't stay there for any more than that one year.
Story_ID: 244521
Speaker 1: How did you feel about [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] at that time?  Were you, were you--
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'd gone through five years of college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois].  I'd watched some of my friends become [Black] Panthers or attempting to be Panthers.  I saw some of them go on the, the freedom rides and I heard the stories that they told.  Many of these were college students who were older than I, my brother knew and, and so on.  And but even when I got into college, they were still going south for voter registrations and so on.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I spent my time in the practice room learning to play those instruments, and learning the minds of the master composers.  The black friends whom I dealt with, called me Oreo because I was not out there in the forefront fighting.  I never made any political stance.  I don't know what stopped me, but I was surprised when my dad [William Hayes, Sr.] said he wanted to go to the March on Washington.  And I guess all of us were 'cause we had not been political.  I don't think my household recognized the eventful power of Martin Luther King and, and the movement that he led.  So there was nobody in the household was glommed onto his, his, his campaign.  We recognize it, but we, we didn't jump on the bandwagon.  Now that might say how I felt about him when I got out to Nebraska.  And I, I think this is kind of hard for me because I did not think of him as a savior.  I didn't disavow what he was doing.  I just did not--it seemed to me as if too many people whom I knew were finding, or thinking of this--finally we're going to get something.  Well if you don't pay anything, you're not going to get anything.  And I think that's the attitude I had.  Don't just come out here now to start demanding stuff when somebody says, "We can go sit in," you know.  So I didn't fall into that trap.  And, and I was surprised at the people's reaction.  I had not denounced Dr. King or my being a black person in that area, but it was not relevant to me at that point.  I think that's what I have to say about that.
Story_ID: 244522
Speaker 1: So how long did you teach in Nebraska, in Sandhill[s]?
Speaker 2: Just the one year.
Speaker 1: Just the one year, okay.  And then where did you, you go?
Speaker 2: We moved to Bermuda with the [U.S.] Department of Defense [DOD].  And that was an attempt--both of us being musicians, my first wife was studying opera.  And we were applying to go to Germany.  And we had no idea that--I guess we had applied for the DOD, Department of Defense.  And there was no place in Germany available at that time for either of us so they sent back a letter saying, "How would you like to go to Bermuda?"  Okay.  So I went and our child [Erika Jones] was born there.  We were there on the island for two years.
Speaker 1: How did you and your first wife meet?
Speaker 2: At the university [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], you know, we were music students together.  She was a year behind me.  I don't think I want to get into all of that (laughter).  It was--I was, as I said, quite shy and more than that I was very naive about a lot of things.  She was from East St. Louis, Illinois, a lot more worldly.  But she was an [Seventh-day] Adventist, and, and but when you're free on your own like that in college, a lot of things that your parents and your church teach you, you do otherwise anyhow, you know.  And I didn't know for a long (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is traditional, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't know for a long time that she was Adventist.  But I eventually got involved enough with her that I converted and we married.  So we were in Bermuda together as Adventists.
Story_ID: 244523
Speaker 1: How did you like Bermuda?  Now this is a, this is a island that's, that's mostly black I believe isn't it?  Or is it?
Speaker 2: This, this--they're Bermudians, and they don't consider black and white.  But there are a lot of brown skinned people there.
Speaker 1: People that you would recognize as black over here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But a lot of them were also black or as white as these walls, you know.  So you didn't really know who was white and who was just real light, or no pigment, you know.  That didn't seem to matter.  And that was the first place that I had seen where race didn't seem to be a stumbling block to anybody.  Socioeconomic, yeah, and it looks like race.  But they were all treated with respect as human beings rather than--and that's interesting because Bermuda was part of, you know wasn't necessarily in the trade, but a lot of what populated Bermuda was involved in that trade.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the slave, slave trade.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  The islands themselves were--
Speaker 1: Bermuda is like unusual, it's really not a Caribbean island, but it's out in the south Atlantic [Ocean].
Speaker 2: No, it's north.
Speaker 1: I guess north of Florida.
Speaker 2: North Carolina, straight out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: That was a good time.  I, I wanted to volunteer for the [U.S. military] service, for the draft.  I missed it when I was in college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] because of my eyes.  But I wanted to volunteer service.  And none of the branches would take me when I volunteered, all of them.  I wanted to do music rather than fight, but I wanted to go, you know serve my country, and I didn't get that opportunity.  I'm not unhappy or happy that I did, one way or the other.  But it was in Bermuda when I thought that that would be something worthwhile to do under the circumstances.  We came back from Bermuda because my mother [Eurma Jones Hayes] died, and, and we finished out the year there and came back stateside because while I was at home for the funeral, my professors suggested I take the job at Western Illinois [University, Macomb, Illinois], which would give me a master's degree and a teaching salary.  So we gave up the DOD [U.S. Department of Defense] and came back stateside for that.
Story_ID: 244524
Speaker 1: Now Western Illinois [University], that's in Macomb, Illinois, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So how was that experience?  You, you--so you earned a master's degree (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I earned a master's degree there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And after that degree in one year, I left.  I was a missionary to Pine Forge Academy [Pine Forge, Pennsylvania].  Pine Forge Academy, the Seventh-day Adventist in Pine Forge, Pennsylvania.  That's Pine Forge Academy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was--I think at the time it was the only black boarding school of the [Seventh-day] Adventists in the country.  There were several white schools, but I counted it somewhat a privilege to have a chance to work there.  There's quite a history of, of alumni, none of whom I'm going to mention because I would say the wrong thing.  But I wasn't there long enough.  But I do know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How old is that school, I'm sorry.  How old is that school?  I mean how far does that go back?  Do you have any idea?
Speaker 2: I bet it's early 1900s [1946].  I'm sure of that.  It may have even been--there were some new buildings, yet there were some that were old, like they had been converted from plantation stables, et cetera, et cetera.  And right around the corner, just as the crow flies, was a new white school (laughter).  And you know that was a point of contention all the time.  The black folk never get anything and, and I guess I wasn't good enough for Pine Forge because I remember toward the end of the year, more often than I want to remember, I was pulled at the sleeve and put on my knees in front of the kids' lockers while they trying to get on and passing classes, having prayer for my sinful soul.
Speaker 1: So they would--who would pull you to--
Speaker 2: Principal, teachers, it didn't matter.  They were making sure that [HistoryMaker] Mr. [William Richard] Hayes is going to do this right, or, or I don't know what.  And I don't know why I was the one picked on to do that.  I know that I had not been brought up in the Adventist church.  And I was there to start a band, the first instrumental program that school had ever had.  I thought I had done that, you know.  But all of a sudden they kept saying to me, "You need us more than we need you."
Story_ID: 244525
Speaker 1: Before you joined the SDI [sic. SDA, Seventh-day Adventist Church], did you consider yourself a real--I mean how--I mean were you really deep into Christianity and, or do--was it easy to become a--involved in the Seventh-day Adventist church?
Speaker 2: It was, it was easy in that I was familiar with church, scriptures and the stories and so on.  I had somewhat of a, a young faith of my own.  When I joined the Adventist church, I studied--I had Bible studies for at least a year with my mother-in-law, who was my soon to be mother-in-law.  I think I was--I began to see hypocrisy to the point that it bothered me.  I was--I had a good moral upbringing.  I did not do dirty, naughty things.  I, I always felt and I can say this now that I'm many years old (laughter), I, I kept myself out of harm's way on purpose.  Lots of things a lot of my friends did in coming up that I would never have done 'cause--and they did get beatings for them.  But I didn't get beatings for those 'cause I wouldn't do those.  So it was--I took it not so well when they picked me out to say that I'm not the one that should be here [Pine Forge Academy, Pine Forge, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: What do you suppose that you did that would upset the--
Speaker 2: I can't imagine.  Because I, I--it's a boarding academy.  And the girls and the boys live in dorms.  There's never going any off campus without some sort of chaperone, at least two people.  And I don't remember ever taking any students off campus.  I don't know what there could have been 'cause--but whatever it was, they said I wasn't good enough anymore.  So I found a job up in Bethlehem [Pennsylvania] teaching at a community college [Northampton County Area Community College (NCACC), Bethlehem, Pennsylvania].  I continued to go to the Adventist church through that first year.  My wife found employment in Redding, Pennsylvania while I was at Pine Forge.  She had to travel a little bit every day.  But we moved to Bethlehem and she found a job teaching in Bethlehem as well.  But we began to--that's when I think the marriage began to fall apart for whatever reason, I don't know what it was.  But we had the daughter [Erika Jones] in Bermuda and she's now like three, four years old.  We stopped going to the church, any Adventist church.  That was my own bias.  The hypocrisy I heard and saw blatant, don't tell me I'm not good enough (laughter) when I see you doing such and so.  Well I didn't need that part.  It's not up to me to judge somebody else, but I judged myself and, and I figured I'm going to get out of this.
Speaker 1: Now were there any other black teachers at Pine Forge?
Speaker 2: They were all black.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's all black, okay.
Speaker 2: The entire--
Speaker 1: The teaching staff was, okay.
Speaker 2: Teaching staff, everybody.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I understood the students were, but I wasn't sure about the--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They weren't black that you would know they were black.  They were black at a church school, and they were on total behavior all the time.  I don't know what the kids were like if and when they were at home.  But I think it maintained its, its traditions.  And if you didn't behave properly, you were sent home right away.
Story_ID: 244526
Speaker 1: These people wanted an instrumental music program at a two-year community college [Northampton County Area Community College (NCACC), Bethlehem, Pennsylvania].  They had a professor there who was doing vocal music and the theory history, et cetera.  He was a church organist.  He had himself--he was too big, you know, so they hired me and, and he and I got along quite well under the circumstances, but our job was to create a two-year music major transfer program from that school to the other state schools.  So we traveled together to all the state schools, asked them what kind of curriculum should we present to the students to have them ready for junior year in your place.  And we developed that curriculum and started teaching it.  It lasted two years.  My students in the theory classes transferred successfully, three of them that went on to college, to the two-year schools and got degrees.  I started a band there, which did not continue.  They ran out of money, and that's when I was--went back to SI--to Western Illinois [University (WIU), Macomb, Illinois].  While I was at NCACC, again I'm young and naive.  I'm doing a job that I'd been hired to do.  I'm accepted by my peers as a quality person and, and a teacher.  There were again instances where I was not black enough.  And, and a lot of the white teachers who were there tried to befriend me, couldn't see me behaving enough like the, the shine they wanted.  But I have a, a--I have two degrees, I'm not a shine, you know.  And, and it disturbed me a lot.  Now we're in the 1970s, early '70s [1970s], and I see this one person, a black man, as one of the administrators at the college.  And I had come across this person several times and found that he couldn't speak the English language, but he was a vice president of something or other at the college.  And it bothered me that the college could hire this person, whatever color he is, with that sort of capacity in the public to get--make a good presentation.  He had a job because America needed him.  A lot of the white institutions began to hire a black person just to have one at that time, and this person was one of those, I swear.  It bothered me enough to think, why would they send him off campus anywhere to find, you know, to embarrass.  But then at that time, most of the places where this person went, he found himself in company just like himself, people who also had positions, whether they could--and I was pissed because I could do what I was hired to do.  I had a history of having done what they wanted me to do.  And, and I didn't appreciate--a lot of my friends from Carbondale [Illinois] began to have active positions in politics and in, in offices and they're taking care of money and, and welfare rolls and things and, and I know these people are not trained for that.  You go back (unclear), what do you call that?  What was it?  I forget.
Speaker 2: Tokenism, I guess.
Speaker 1: Tokenism.  And I refused to accept that.  I was not a token, I was a qualified, capable black man with a degree, evidence and history showing that I can, you know I don't just want your job because you can pay me, or because I need to be paid.
Story_ID: 244527
Speaker 1: We're ready to talk about this incident in Frankfort, Michigan.  All right, what happened?
Speaker 2: I had left Western Illinois [University, Macomb, Illinois] at my wife's behest.  I was teaching there as assistant professor, and I was given five years to complete a, a doctorate degree in education.  But after two years of not having time to go to school and all of that, we decided it would be better to leave.  And I wanted to get to where I thought education was real again.  I didn't feel comfortable teaching college students that behaved in many instances like high schoolers.  So we left and moved back up to Northern Michigan, her hometown area.  And I didn't have a job.  It was the first time I didn't have a job, I had always gotten letters asking me to come and apply.  But I applied to teach in Traverse City, Michigan, and they didn't have anything available.  So I spent that first year I was there substitute teaching in Benzie County [Michigan], basically.  The first--I happened to do some subbing at Frankfort during that first half of that first year.  The second half of that year they asked me at Frankfort if I would come over and take over the music teacher's position.  Something to the effect that she was losing control and the students were not behaving well, et cetera.  And if you can straighten this class out, or these classes, then we'll give you a contract for full time next year.  So I did that.  That was like in February when I started or so.  And they awarded me a contract for the next year on probation.  And February 14th, I now made all these families and, and kids like pied piper.  They all knew [HistoryMaker] Mr. [William Richard] Hayes was in town.  They didn't know me from Adam, but I did have a face because my wife's family was well known in that area.  And this is a all-white area.  I think there was one family, quite extended, in Benzie County, of black people--
Story_ID: 244528
Speaker 1: But anyhow, I had gotten all of these kids singing songs and learning music and the eighth grade I had two English classes [in Frankfort, Michigan].  One was grammar and one was American literature.  It was world literature 'cause we studied Greeks and, and all sorts of stuff in the eighth grade.  February 14th the principal comes into my class while I'm teaching and said, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [William Richard] Hayes," and he took me out in the hallway and told me had gotten some letters and showed them to me, from parents saying that I had locked a student in the closet and pushed the piano up against so the child couldn't get out.  I had taken my belt off in the classroom in front of the students and I had whipped a boy with my belt.  I had more than once dropped trow.  And I was in total disbelief, you know.  My in-laws who have--that's their home.  They, they were settlers, their family came there, you know.  So they got everything on the line with this new son-in-law.  And, and so they didn't know quite how to deal with it.  The church with which I had been--I'd even joined the church by that time, Congregational church, didn't seem to offer any support.  And the teachers wouldn't offer support.  Finally with my attorney, I contacted the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union], both of whom by phone said, "What the hell are you doing up there in the first place?"  So (laughter) they didn't offer any assistance.  And we finally went through the summer, it was the day of school board elections when the school board was meeting on my case.  And after all the people who witnessed and testified and so on, one of the board members, in fact he was voted off the board that night, "Mr. Hayes, we don't care what the truth is.  We don't care about the truth.  All we know is that we don't want a black man teaching our children."  Okay.  Now I figured we can--but I didn't want to mess up Northern Michigan for my in-laws.  I didn't want to go up there and create confusion, so I didn't fight.  We accepted a deal where they signed up all--sealed up all the papers for seven years, all those letters and, and the comments from other parents that had come in since then.  And if anybody ever called to seek information about my employment, only the superintendent would have a stock statement he would read.
Story_ID: 244529
Speaker 1: Traverse City [Michigan] hired me.  They had heard about this mess, and, "It's going to be all right.  We're not going to let anything like that happen to you."  And I taught there for seventeen years, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what was the name of the, the high school?
Speaker 1: In Traverse City?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was the Traverse City Area Public Schools [TCAPS].  I did mostly elementary and junior high.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And that was from 19--
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979] until '83 [1983]--'93 [1993].
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, right.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: It was an awesome experience.  I worked in twelve out of the eighteen elementary schools, there were that many by the time I'd left.  They built three I think since I was there.  So I knew a wide variety of people and they recognized me through their kids.  It was hard to go to the grocery or the movie--"Hi, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [William Richard] Hayes"--everybody, parents and children.  I was playing bass with my partner, a pianist, and all the, the big parties, the named, you know, people.  The main clubs in town.  As a matter of fact, the guys who built the Grand Traverse Resort [& Spa, Acme, Michigan] had been to hear my partner and me play for several years and they told us we would be the first group to play on their stage on the eighteenth floor of that building, and we did.  For four years we were there as the headline group.  So I developed a tremendous amount of public recognition.  We were both serving to the extent of having red coats as directors of the cherry festival, National Cherry Festival [Traverse City, Michigan].  And I guess what happened was I got to be too popular, important, for some people in town.  And I don't know who spearheaded it, but the high school band director and the high school orchestra director and the middle school band director, the three of them charged me with all sorts of grievances against the district and against the, the music department.  Nothing against kids, just I was not supportive of the program, of the curriculum.  And it's interesting to me how through the three superintendents I knew there, I was personal friends.  I didn't go to dinner, but I could pop into their office at any time and just have a chat.  Unlike here [Ypsilanti, Michigan], the superintendent would in fact go to the buildings and visit (laughter) and I would see him there.  All the other administrators would show up and it was not unusual for me to be skipping down the hall with my ukulele arm-in-arm with administrators, singing songs in my building, disturbing all the classes.  But everybody knew who it was, so it was never a disturbance.
Story_ID: 244530
Speaker 1: These people reacted by saying, "Well, we can go to arbitration if you want," but they didn't say, "Bill Hayes [HistoryMaker William Richard Hayes] could not have done this.  Bill Hayes is not this person."  They let it go through, and I think I was hurt physically, mentally by that.  Not mentally--psychologically.
Speaker 2: Were you the only black instructor there [Traverse City Area Public Schools (TCAPS), Traverse City, Michigan]?
Speaker 1: I am still I think.  The only black person ever to work in public schools in Traverse City [Michigan] at any level, you know.  And I'm quite proud of that.  While we were there, Wayne County, Michigan had a, a deal with Grand Traverse County [Michigan] to send some of their errant girls away from their community in Detroit [Michigan], particularly, to go--some were pregnant, some were juvenile delinquents, et cetera, and they put them all in there with these white kids from Traverse City (laughter).  There were about four or five years of that.  And at one time, this was like two years before we left, a calendar was found in three of the girls' lockers.  "On this date you will be,"--such and such, so and so.  And I got wind of it and found out that there were in fact some, some physical issues.  My son [Matthew Hayes] at that time was driving a car to school and he was parking behind the music building where he had most, he had access, you know.  My car was damaged with some sort of an, an iron tool, just all sorts of dents and so on.  As a result of that, my wife and I started what we called the--with some friends, some influential friends, the multicultural education committee, which was set up to help the school district recognize, identify and, and set policy for racial incidents.  We had--there must have been a dozen of us, and these were attorneys, an architect, doctors, townspeople at large, you know.  The superintendent was instructed to be at our meetings and he was there every time.  He occasionally brought one or more of his administrators.  And we went through a two year period seeking information from other communities somewhat like Traverse City.  And we developed some, some policies.  I don't know whether they're still in effect or not.  It was--we left there two years after we had started that thing.  But it made a difference.  It made people more aware--
Story_ID: 244531
Speaker 1: That [establishing the multicultural education committee] was a positive thing for me.  The fact that after that happened, I was run out of town, you know.  But I had made I thought what was a good showing in Traverse City [Michigan].  The kids--I was wearing an afro when I first went there and a big beard.  Not big beard, but a lot more than now.  And I couldn't keep the white kids from pulling at and touching my hair 'cause they hadn't had any contact.  And I taught them songs of America, their America.  I occasionally had some sort of gospel or rock or black beat with some of the things, which was cute, you know, to those people.  But I didn't set out to show them a black man.  I went there with the attitude I am, I have two degrees, I'm not egotistical.  I'm just plain Bill Hayes [HistoryMaker William Richard Hayes] regular.  Asked me to teach this music to these kids, I can do that and I did that without any--I didn't bring anything to myself beyond what would ordinarily come in recognition of what I was doing.
Speaker 2: Now in Traverse City, you were conductor of a community orchestra there (unclear)?
Speaker 1: While I was living in Traverse City, I was conductor of the Cadillac Area Symphony Orchestra [Cadillac Symphony Orchestra].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that was a fifty, sixty mile trip from my home each night to--each Tuesday night for years.  Area Symphony Orchestra, Cadillac Area.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was not the first conductor, but I, I was with them for seventeen years.  It was an all-white group.  I don't--yes there was a, a black woman that played flute.  Other than my son [Matthew Hayes] who played drums occasionally as he got old enough, and my daughter who finally graduated enough to play bass, there were no black people in the, in the orchestra.  After I think fifteen years, the mayor presented me with a, a document--proclamation naming the day of that particular concert as William R. Hayes, Jr. Day in Cadillac [Michigan].  Recognizing the work that I had done in continuing the symphony and, and building an audience for it.  That was, that was a good thing for me.  I didn't try to impose on them.  I wanted to let them do what they wanted to do and it was not a very good performance orchestra.  But I wasn't there to make the Chicago Symphony [Orchestra].  And I remember my history with them, the words from--there was one president all of that time.  That was their--she kept making herself remain president.  But it was to my advantage because I would get what I needed and wanted.  But she would always say it's not so much what he did, but how he did it.  And, and, without hurting anybody's feelings and, and with tact and all that kind of stuff.  I never had any incidents with the orchestra.
Story_ID: 244532
Speaker 1: What did you enjoy the most about teaching, teaching music?
Speaker 2: Watching learning happen.  My job as an educator and a, a wonderful educator friend of mine has made me know this.  Education means to bring it out, to educe, come out of or drag out of.  'Cause somebody else to speak out enough to--there's argument here, if argument there is learning.  And, and so I enjoyed watching a child actually reckon with information.  And once the, the reckoning had taken place and the child understood a concept, and, and that concept led to another bit of learning and so on.  Is that what you asked?  What did I enjoy most?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, more than performances.  Watching that I was seeing that I was able to lead a child to advance in his understanding of the subject.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a particular philosophy of teaching in terms of music?
Speaker 2: I don't think I know where you are.  What does, what does that mean to you?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well do you have a particular--do you have your own particular style of teaching music that's different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 1: --and, and, and what, what, you know, what do you personally--how do you approach it that's different from the way other people do it?
Speaker 2: Okay, let's go back to Traverse City [Michigan] when I was with the elementary and middle school [of Traverse City Area Public Schools (TCAPS)].  I had--my department chairman after a few years referred to my method as the soul method.  We had a, a white teacher who had the Ozark method.  She was from somewhere in the Ozarks.  And, and the two of us were maverick in our approach.  We didn't necessarily go page-by-page by the curriculum.  But we taught the same things in a, in a different way.  I wanted the kids to feel making music, feel having made music.  And as much of an understanding about why they had to go faster or slower or get louder or softer.  And, and I think that's what I want, I want children to experience--you can't say pleasure.  You can't experience it until you are experiencing it.  And you can't experience until you've learned enough to know what it is you're doing.  And I don't mean college level, I'm talking about children.  I sang, I played harmonica before I knew about notes and children have that capacity.  And they don't know what's hard (laughter) 'til you show them, especially when they're children, you know.  So I had kids doing things in the elementary.
Story_ID: 244533
Speaker 1: I taught beginning band in my building the last several years.  They finally let me do that.  But I would not, I was not allowed to teach strings and I'm a bass player.  I had, you know, some really fine string lessons with a really fine bass teacher.
Speaker 2: Why weren't you allowed to teach strings?  I mean why--that's something I wonder about because--
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, I have a little plaque locked away somewhere in one of the boxes, cut out from L. M. Boyd.  The question:  what can you tell me about the double bass?  Answer:  that is the largest member of the violin family, nothing more.  And, and the stuff that they--I could play better recitals on my bass, and I hadn't practiced, than the string teachers who were there.  They played sixth grade violin.  They didn't have time to, to practice and, and play.  They didn't like it that I was playing bass.  I'm playing bass, you know, four nights a week.  But I'm not a string person.  And I didn't let that bother me.  I did want some sort of a, an ensemble.  I wanted one of the junior high bands.  One year they said, "We're going to split this freshmen band up and, and take out those who are having difficulty," and, and--so I got a remedial band.  For three years I worked that remedial band with those who came in.  They wanted in seventh, eighth and ninth grade, for those kids to stay there and get out of the way.  But I kept making them good enough that they would, you know--so they discontinued that band.  They didn't need that anymore.  I, I'm still saying, I feel like I've always been able to do what I was asked to do.  I don't think I ever felt put upon to do something.  If it was something that I was not as familiar with or comfortable with, I would either make it so or, or get out of it.  I want the kids to know what it feels like to make music.
Story_ID: 244534
Speaker 1: I mentioned Anita [Johnson] here.  Just last month she sang with my children's orchestra [Ypsilanti Youth Orchestra].
Speaker 2: That's Anita Johnson, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Those kids will never forget that.  Here's a professional person, and they heard her talent, they heard her sing.  They saw her stage presence.  They heard her talking to them as a person.  And they saw what it took for them to support that.  I even had a, a twenty voice choir, you know, meshed in all this and the kids didn't know it was all going to happen until it did happen the day before the concert.  But I want them to see what that feels like and, and you can see when they walk off the stage, something happened here today.  They won't be able to talk about it for a while.  But if they get a chance again to experience something like that, then those experiences will move, move them farther along and, and what they know, they can.  If they want to or find themselves in the right place, accomplish.  Not just playing an instrument, but sports, math, whatever, you know.  I think if you can, can get them, and I know Verna [Rollins Hayes] has done this over the years.  I feel badly these days because behavior in schools is so, so awful that the quality teacher can't teach, you know, as much as he or she needs and would like.  My teachers when I was in school and so with Verna's for instance, would never have allowed, our families would not have allowed, yet we've had to live this long in this profession and had to accommodate these changes that American society has brought upon us, you know.  But I always felt competent to do enough to go beyond what the job asked me for.  And that's the part that, that bothers me enough because knowing you're not going to get paid what you're worth, at least you should not be hassled about it.  And, and Wendy [Gwenyth Hayes] brought me a new word today; sheeple.  Sheeple, and she knows what it means.  I mean people being led like sheep who don't know that there's another way.  Don't have any interior, you know--there's nothing to move them along, just through somebody else.  And I can't do that.  I've always--that's one of the reasons I had to stop because I felt like I was being asked to do too many things that would get in the way of my own creativity and creating my own product out of these students.

Speaker 1: In terms of your students, have there been any--I mean are there, are there some highlights in terms of teaching students, or some students that have gone on--
Speaker 2: One of the students in my first year out in Pennsyl--in [Sandhills] Nebraska.  I kept in touch with their family for a few years and found out that the child in fifth grade at the time whom I taught to play, started playing clarinet, had gone with a master's degree in, in composition.  Had written one of two operas and, and had been on stage as a performer, singer and pianist.  Beyond that, I don't know.  I, I--most of the students I've had here, there were some in Traverse City [Michigan] who went on for--one boy got a degree in tuba, one of my students.  Two girls went on--I think two of them came to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] in the chorale department.  What they did, I don't remember.  I didn't set out to create megastars.  And I told every, every parent, every student, these children--I will take them as long, as far as they want to go.  But I'm not here to--and when I discover a certain talent that needs to be pushed, and that's where I am right now still with my Ypsilanti Youth Orchestra.  Those students--
Speaker 1: Yeah, now you've been a conductor of that--
Speaker 2: Since we started, yeah six years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my, my push is to get them to recognize what they can do, and if they commit to doing it to a level where I think they're sincere about it, then I'll bend over backward, you know, for them on it.
Story_ID: 244536
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?  And, and do you have--I wanted to ask you this.  Did you ever regret not working I guess in, in the black community more?  'Cause you seem to, to always be in the, in communities where you're the only black person.
Speaker 2: Well you picked up on that very well.  And, and I think I said somewhere earlier I didn't do that to present a black man, I presented me.  And I was in fact in a position where sometimes the community could have said, or an individual could have said, "That one's okay."  I did ask the Adventist church once about teaching as a missionary in Africa, West Africa.  I had French and I knew the music and so on.  "No, stay here."  So they sent me to Pine Forge [Academy, Pine Forge, Pennsylvania].  They didn't give me a chance to work with black folk.  They gave me a chance to work with Christian, white people, youngsters for the most part, who hadn't made a commitment yet and were just going to school because their parents either could afford it or insisted that they go there.  When I came to Ypsilanti [Michigan] from Traverse City [Michigan], it was a tremendous awakening for me.  The first day I appeared in the high school [Ypsilanti High School, Ypsilanti, Michigan], there was a fight with fists, you know, going.  And blood, you know and people holding other people down and so on.  I had a lot to learn quickly.  And having been so many years away from the black population, my, my long-time marriage, which was just over a couple of years, a year ago next month, an interracial marriage where we enter--we adopted two interracial children.  Lived in a white town for years.  I even dislodged myself from my family for a long time.  I was isolated.  I wasn't doing it on purpose, but there were circumstances that would not allow me to get to visit with them and I had some issues in my own head about what they were doing.  I knew two or three people were doing something, you know, wow.  But I didn't see phenomenal growth and development of the butterfly as that--you know I thought it could have.  So I had some misgivings about going home.  And I discovered lately that going home is just going home.  It's not about who does what, but who is concerned about whom, you know.  And they didn't have to teach me that in words.  But in the re--of accepting me the way I thought I want, you know, to be back with them, it just happened.  And, and then I became more aware of the black community.
Speaker 1: So you were not, you were not only just the--you were, you were the only black person in, or one, one of the few black people in town and in these situations, period.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess, so you were really--
Speaker 2: There was a time when a Ford [Motor Company] dealer, one of the former Detroit Lions who owns a dealership, Davison [Michigan], just around Flint [Michigan], bought a dealership in Traverse City and had these ads with him and his wife.  I resented every time I saw the ad because they, they made themselves look like rich, well-to-do black people, but they could not speak.  And I thought that was part of their selling thing, you know.  I don't know whether they can speak or not.  But that was the attitude I had in Traverse City watching them.  And they didn't last long in that area.
Story_ID: 244537
Speaker 1: During the break we were talking about composition, and you were talking.  Now you do, you have some compositions you've written.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have some original things, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a major piece was performed you said--
Speaker 2: It was an arrangement of three tunes--pardon me--for orchestra with piano, bass, drums, jazz.  It--the history of the piece was when I was in Pennsylvania [at Pine Forge Academy, Pine Forge, Pennsylvania], the program was being discontinued and I was going home, back to Illinois.  And I was a jazzer enough to want to have the band play some jazz.  It was a small affair then with the college band which I started.  But the concept stayed in my mind and, and I once rewrote the piece for orchestra.  Had it performed at music, summer music camp at Western Illinois [University, Macomb, Illinois] when I was teaching there.  Still didn't like it, so I wrote it again for Cadillac [Michigan] and my partner in Traverse City [Michigan] played the piano, my son [Matthew Hayes] played drums.  But the orchestra wasn't good enough.  So finally the fourth writing I had it performed in Chicago [Illinois] two years ago by Chicago Chamber Orchestra.  And the same conductor conducted it a year and a half ago, April 1st, at Southern Illinois [University, Carbondale, Illinois].  And that was the first time I had been back home to make music since I left there.  My family hadn't seen me play, hadn't heard me writing.  It was an awesome experience.  I want to do--I have a whole library of stuff I want to write about, my experience and about the black experience at large.  But I'm not anxious, I'm not in a hurry.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that piece, though?  Could you give us the name?
Speaker 2: 'Exodus, Suite Exodus.'  S-U-I-T-E.  And it's a three part form.  It was--in fact when the conductor announced in Chicago at the audience, "We're now going to hear a fairly un--fairly unique piece for chamber orchestra, jazz piano, bass and drums."  And although he had heard--he heard it when I went there because my--I forget why I went home.  I think, I know my sister was ill, one of my sisters and was in the hospital.  And I had written this thing, it was in my computer, I could play it back.  So I took a chance and I took it to the campus and let the orchestra teacher, whom I did not know, hear it.  And he sat and listened and looked at the score and he said, "We're going to perform this piece."  So that's how, you know, that happened.  And I have--as much as I would like to go out and sell more performances of it, I'm--the busyness of what I'm doing right here doesn't allow.  I don't think I'm too anxious about getting started 'cause one of these days things are going to calm down.  I may not know what to do with myself (laughter).
Story_ID: 244538
Speaker 1: Now tell me--now you mentioned going back to Carbondale [Illinois] again after being away a long time.  What--were you--did you feel--I mean was it the interracial marriage that alienated you from your family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A great deal of it, yeah.  It so happened also that my wife at that time has, was going through progressive migraine headaches over a twenty year period where less and less capable of living more than twenty-four hours without, you know--so I wasn't traveling much.  It is true that my family didn't think much of my wife at the time.  The sisterhood gathering when they first started and they invited her.  Well the first year for it, she was going with her two sisters and her father who had invited them to go to Italy--to Ireland to see the home country.  So she missed the first one.  Two years later she had an excuse for not--so she missed three in a row.  And over that amount of time, I had no explanation for my sisters.  But they told me what they thought.  And, and finally when I realized the marriage was over, we spent two years almost apart.  I was here [Ypsilanti, Michigan] still teaching while she was up north in the first year taking care of her father who was in assisted living.  And then the second year she simply stayed there in Benzonia [Michigan] where we had lived before, in her father's house.  And I guess it all just fell apart.  Things that I didn't know she was thinking about, she finally had nerve to say or not say and just sent papers; do something about this.  But I suffered such a tremendous blow to my ego.  How could I be this talented and, and, and people wanting me to do things and, and not be accepted by my own wife?  She was not supportive at the end.  And I don't know what it was, but it was a long, a long time.  From the time we moved here, from Traverse City [Michigan], no more headaches, a new life for ten years or eight years of go to work every day and have, you know--but that didn't include me.  I was going to work every day, too, but it was--so I was so upset during that year waiting--through the divorce, from the papers, that I took a lot of counseling and, and rediscovered the importance of my family and began to say that to them via email and telephone.  And it wasn't spanking my wrist for having gone away.  It was just like the prodigal son.  "He's come back, let's put a robe on this sucker," you know.  And, and--but it wasn't a robe, it was just, Little Bill is back home.  And I discovered that I reclaimed the concept of Little Bill.  Little Bill had been taught by his parents [Eurma Jones Hayes and William Hayes, Sr.], his church [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Carbondale, Illinois], his teachers, his community and then led and guided by some very important people who saw capacity, potential and so on.  I wish I could go back and say thank you to all of them, you know.
Story_ID: 244539
Speaker 1: The Ypsilanti Youth Orchestra [YYO], which we started six years ago, two friends, both Jewish in Ann Arbor [Michigan], saw enough in me to ask me to, to do this 'cause they had been helping in my classroom.  I'd invited them as music masters to come in--one-on-one with the kids.  So after a couple of years of that, they suggested it.  And then the one woman left, moved to Boulder [Colorado] and I never felt comfortable saying to her because last week it occurred to me what I should say to Ruth [ph.] and why I was never able to send her an update as to what we were doing.  I never felt as if we had done enough yet, you know, that she would be satisfied with the job she left for me.  And that was the attitude I had about all those things.  When I'm given it to do, don't ask me to evaluate until it's over, you know.  And if it's not over, I can't evaluate.  All I know is I have to do some more tomorrow.  And, and I don't look for--I don't--I'm not anxious about what I have to do tomorrow.  I may be excited or tense 'cause it's such short notice.  But I will do what I've been asked to do.  And, and more often than not, I think those who ask of me are satisfied with the product.  So that's how I approach those things.  And, and I didn't approach any of my teaching, my conducting or writing for me.  This is my method of, of teaching these lessons, musical lessons, societal lessons, cooperation lessons, what have you.  But in the term--in the eyes of a working musician, you cannot create that CD with these people doing the hip hop unless everybody's cooperating, everybody knows his part, you know.  The sincerity of.  Now, right now there are--the YYO offers scholarships to students who need private lessons, who don't have money for it.  And it's up to me to determine who gets this money.  It was easy for the first couple of years, we only had two or three scholarships available and the top students, the ones who had the most.  But now I'm not teaching anymore, so I don't have access to any of my own students.  And I determined by those who come to the organization, who's going to commit to enough time to make it worth our while to pay for lessons for this person to do two or three years with us.  Having done so, look at what you've gained as an individual.  You can go out and do better and more and so on.  But in the meantime you have serviced this organization.  And, and I have a boy right now, it's a very strange case.  It's not unusual because it's a single parent, the father is there.  He's African and there must be some money in Africa, but there's no money here and the boy lives in almost poverty.  I gave, I gave him cello then bass lessons.  He doesn't focus and remain focused for a while.  In an attempt to lure him, I got a bass from the church.  The church gave me a bass to loan to this kid who's in the orchestra 'cause they want the base to be used.  I just finished a book that my friend Bernie [Bernard Galler], the guy that helped me start this orchestra, gave me.  It was about a young, black kid in inner city Washington, D.C. schools, fast track, upper echelon academically, keeping himself quiet.  Doesn't want anybody to know he's smart.  Goes off to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for a summer, and then ends up in one of the Ivy League colleges, failing because he wasn't prepared.  And, and I cry over the students who don't know that they're ill-prepared.  And they don't know because they didn't pay attention in class.  Bernie and I can both tell you tremendous stories about potential that's lost because kids make mistakes or get into confusion or trouble.  We're losing our own ourselves by not making a better community.
Story_ID: 244540
Speaker 1: Now you're someone who's come from, I mean you had these stern [maternal] grandparents [A.C. Jones and Nettie Jones] and you had like a strong, nuclear family.  Everybody supported each other.  But what--in light of that and your, your experiences of being out here as a pioneer sort of out in, out in unfamiliar cultural territory in some ways.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I see a lot of us--well let me take my daughter [Erika Jones] first.  My married daughter in, in Virginia.  She's a university professor, Ph.D., at University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] in organizational psychology.  She and her husband who is--he's a big shot with oil, Exxon [Exxon Mobil Corporation].  And an engineer.  And the two of them are making money hand over fist in today's society.  They're living in a gated community, twenty-four hour a day guardhouse, professionally kept golf course, you know.  All of those amenities.  Expansive lots, secluded, you know all of this.  They pay for that.  They can afford to pay for that, they're making that kind of money.  But when I saw my daughter this past summer, I don't like having to live in places like this.  I want to be a people, but my job, my career demands that I have this sort of--that's one echelon.  And there are lots of Erikas and Jimmys, okay.  I wonder about their passion for what we're talking about, those whom we have left behind.  Those for whom we have stepped, okay.  Because Erikas and, and even me, are a step beyond the average, normal working class black person.  That's not ego, it's a reality.  There's something about the ethic that allows you to, to take steps that others won't take.  There's something about those that have that dream who seek it and go through it, you know, step by step.  As opposed to I got mine, what you going to do, you know.  So that's one echelon.  Then there's the middle of us sheeple.  We make the core of, of the sit-in group.  Not the sit-in group, 'cause they're the activists, but those who are outside, you know, in the big mob.  We don't have that mentality anymore.  Individuals in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] just me and so on.  And now the '90s [1990s].  All these rules have been set, all these laws have been passed.  We're supposed to behave properly, but it cost too much.  Most of us can't afford to live according to the new laws that we have.  Security for this house for instance, in this community wouldn't take much to secure it.  And what would it cost my daughter in her gated community?  You understand?  I don't make nearly as much money, I used to not make as--as Erika.  But it doesn't cost her anymore to buy a screwdriver at ATCO [ph.] than it does me, you know.  So I, I see the minority America farther and farther away from the equitable, you know.  We've been talking about the education gap.
Speaker 1: A bigger gap you're saying between those who have and those who have not.
Speaker 2: There is that, yeah.  And, and I don't see currently much hope of, of stopping this fast lane of America.  I see families pull up at the school in an [Cadillac] Escalade whose kid is on free lunch.  That's the total different--that's the wrong--that's, I'm sorry, it's a different attitude, you know.  I cannot see putting my money into that at the expense of--because with that Escalade is the FUBU and, and the Nike, you know, all of that stuff.  And maybe we've seen how evasive it all is and have given up trying to.  'Cause there's enough of us in the classrooms these days that don't have that ethic, I'm going to pull up and, and go.  I don't know what's going to happen to it.  But America is making it harder and harder for us to compete, you know.  And I don't think we're enough, there's enough of us to push enough of us to try to compete.
Story_ID: 244541
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything that you've done so far, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I think--I'm glad that I didn't, but I, I should have become more active, more verbal, longer ago.  But I was in places where that was not necessary, or even you know, considered.  Here in Ypsilanti [Michigan], I wish I had been here.  Had I been here, I told my daughter [Gwenyth Hayes] today in the car when I was bringing her home from school, without all these things I just told you, I would not be sitting in this chair.  And I don't where I would have been.  But this is what I set out to do and this--I'm happy and, and satisfied with, with what I've done.  Yet I'm just sixty years old and I'm gonna live to be a hundred, so I got a whole 'nother career, you know, amount of time.  And, and I hope I'm given time to exercise some of this experience that I've had and, and I don't want to be a big name leader.  But I want to be one who can see and, and, and help situations as they arise.
Story_ID: 244542
Speaker 1: What would you consider at this point, and you still have another forty years to go, to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy is wider than me in terms of my teaching.  I've taught myself, my students and peers have taught me.  And I'm at the top of my game in terms of what I know how to do.  My legacy is, is left in the minds of those with whom I've worked.  "Bill Hayes [HistoryMaker William Richard Hayes] did such and so."  "My kid was involved, Bill Hayes did such and so for me."  It's not a, a national recognition.  It's an individual one-on-one.  Maybe it's some small groups.  But I taught people to recognize a human being.  And in many instances, a black human being, a black male, without trying.  Now I can say that because I've been back to Traverse [City, Michigan] and I've talked to several friends, and they quoted to me what I had done to them, for them, for the town.  I'm a little bit bashful about Ypsilanti [Michigan] because I made--the people who know me, know me.  But I have not stepped out to get to know the others who are also doing something.  As a matter of fact, I had (unclear) just two or three days ago.  I don't have any black male friends.  And she reminded me from what she's know, that I've never have had, you know, since grown up.  And that, that saddens me that, you know, I have not had, I have not found out how the brother thinks, you know.  What makes him move.  I have been in situations where like the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] last year awarded me one of their recognitions for--what was that?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Outstanding educator.
Speaker 2: Outstanding educator, and, and there were other categories as well.  But I don't know those people.  I don't know what they--and I don't know--they don't know me.  We know of.  I think I'm, I'm, I'm--I think I have something to offer to the community if I could get connected and one, I have not chosen yet to get connected because I have been selfishly taking care of the stuff that I do for those for whom I've been working.  I have not reached out beyond my sphere.  And I think that time has come.
Story_ID: 244543
Speaker 1: So you see yourself in the future really getting more involved in black community (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.  I'm currently on the, the teachers negotiation team for our contract this year.  And this is my second year.  But I hadn't had any interest in teachers union up to that point.  But I, I, I began to recognize sheeple, you know and sheeple need to be helped.  And, and I thought I had a, a base of recognition wide enough in the school community that if and when I do or say something, I would be heard and, and listened to.  And these people have accepted me that way.  They--I'm on their team, although I'm now retired.  Just my presence walking in there, they and those in the district know Bill Hayes [HistoryMaker William Richard Hayes] is sincere about what he's doing.  And I may not be speaking, but my presence there says a lot.
Story_ID: 244544
Speaker 1: Now in terms of your family, once again to revisit them.  You come from a family, most of the--your ten, ten brothers and sisters, right? All together nine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nine, seven sisters and, and two brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With me making the tenth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you all have--you said except for two, everyone's finished college and is pretty high achieving family.  Did your--what did your--did your--now your mother [Eurma Jones Hayes] died when you were in college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: No, she was, I was in Bermuda teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: My second year teaching.
Speaker 1: That's right.  What did your parents think about your, your pursuit of music as a career?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  My dad [William Hayes, Sr.], as I said, did not come to any of my recitals until the last year.  He came to the last one I played.  My mother had been to a few.  They didn't flock to see me when I was playing in the orchestra or the band or the brass quintet or whatever.  But they did come to see my recitals, my solo recitals.  Mother bought a piano, a cheap old piano the year I started college.  Dad came home from work and--what is that?  And she said, "I bought a piano because our son's going to go to college as a music student."  And he didn't lay his hat on it.  Anything in his house was--he could put his hat on it, it's his.  But he didn't touch that.  He walked around it for three or four years.  I left school, left college, graduated, and Dad was about to turn fifty years old.  In '68 [1968], right, and I saw him before I left college, getting everything ready.  The car is paid for, the house is paid for.  He's still got that piano to contend with and his son is out there making a fool of himself as a music student.  He didn't die at fifty like he thought he was going to, like his father [Ova Hayes] and his brother did.  Changed man, all of a sudden.  So I come back home now with my master's degree, "This is my master's degree son," he's telling his friends, you know.  "This is my tuba playing son," blah, blah, blah.  "This is my"--you know, so he changed his mind tremendously about that.  Mother didn't get to see it.  Yes she did, because I talked to her occasionally.  Not in words, but I know where I came from and she had a tremendous part in doing that.  So I had to say something to them every now and then, you know.
Story_ID: 244545
Speaker 1: Your children, you, you've mentioned them a few times, that they're--they both have--play music and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well my daughter [Erika Jones] in Washington [D.C.] is, is--in Virginia, rather, is not a musician.
Speaker 1: She's a psychologist.
Speaker 2: Yes, and she does, she did have lessons.  So she's not ignorant about music.  Matthew [Hayes] and Wendy [Gwenyth Hayes] lived in my house with their mother and they grew up there from age one all the way through high school and into college.  So they saw me every Friday, Saturday night, Sunday and sometimes Monday night, going out with my bass to play.  They were often brought to the gigs.  "We'd have dinner at a restaurant while Dad was playing," and so on.  Wendy is an awesome bass player.  She plays in country blues band here in the area.  She has a lot more potential.  But her focus now is going to school and she only plays now to pay whatever she needs to keep her going.  But she has a full scholarship to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] that pays her tuition and fees and she has her apartment and so on.  My son Matthew lives in Lansing [Michigan].  He has three children with his wife, almost wife.  But he's a musician and he works a series of, of day jobs.  He wants to be a, a full-time musician, but the opportunities aren't there yet for him.  And he's managing to keep himself sane while he's waiting for the--not waiting, preparing for the time that he can do more with his music.
Story_ID: 244546
Speaker 1: Is there something we haven't asked that you need to address?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I want--I, I really want to think that this is a worthwhile thing.  Rather than just have pages and/or video clips, something that I always--seem to be left out of interviews and, and things like this is what it was like for the person, what the person felt like.  What he had to go through, what he had to overcome to get, you know--we simply list.  In 1949 he accomplished such and so.  In 1952 such and so, so and so.  I think maybe we can see why I was in each lace that I mentioned where I worked and, and the impact that it had.  And, and the reason for my either going to or leaving that place.  And I think history--Wendy [Gwenyth Hayes] hates history.  She's getting more and more aware of the need to understand it.  I don't want the history to just be dry.  Not mine, all of this that you're doing.  A running list of who accomplished what is really meaningless, you know.  What did it feel like?  What did you have to do?  Did it hurt, you know or whatever, you know when you had to, to go through this, so.
Story_ID: 244547
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [William Richard] Hayes, Mr. Hayes was an educator.  Was a, a gentleman.  At his level of attainment, a scholar.  Respected, a sense of right, duty, morality.  A sense of faith, a fine parent and, and partner, you know.  I want people to know that I was passionate and compassionate, supportive, able to listen, able to see and hear and understand and, and share woe, or you know.  A person who has been accessible.  Who would be very willing--who has been very willing to give of himself for the furtherance of somebody else and/or somebody else's cause.
