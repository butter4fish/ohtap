Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, sir do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Winter because I leave Chicago [Illinois] and go to the sun.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?  That falls right into it.
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I like to move around on vacations, get new experiences.  But usually it's someplace that has sun and sand or sun and mountains or something like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Gotta have that sun.
Speaker 2: Well sun's important.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  Now I don't, I don't recall anything that I just say over and over again, yeah.
Story_ID: 72754
Speaker 1: Okay, um.  Let--let's talk about your parents and your background.  Can you give us the names of your parents and spell those for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Robert Howard Bakeman.  That will be R-O-B-E-R-T, H-O-W-A-R-D, B-A-K-E-M-A-N.  My mother's name was Vivian Summers prior to marrying my father.  V-I-V-I-A-N, S-U-M-M-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, where was your father born?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Winnipeg, Canada.
Speaker 1: And what year?
Speaker 2: Now that's a tough one.  Let's see.  He'd be about--if he had lived, today he'd probably be about maybe 92, 95, somewhere in that range.  So I can't give you the exact date, but it would have been I guess in the 19--before 1920.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ten [1910]--
Speaker 2: Somewhere in that area, that range, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother, the same age, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in a little town called Waverly, Tennessee, yeah.
Story_ID: 72755
Speaker 1: Okay, so your, your father's [Robert Howard Bakeman] from Winnipeg, Canada.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about, you know his childhood and upbringing and who his ancestors were and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well to some extent.  My father was quite a hockey player they tell me in Canada.  He had all kinds of trophies that we I saw as a kid, that he, he, he had won as a young man.  And my grandfather [George Bakeman] I'm told, I never met him because he died early, was part African American, part Roanoke Indian.  My grandmother was also of--I understand she was a Polish decent as well as African American.  I knew her, but never get, never knew my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, now Winnipeg is--where is it in relationship to the states?
Speaker 2: Well if you go straight up past Minneapolis [Minnesota] up into Canada, you'll be--you'll hit Winnipeg.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the Manitoba Province.
Speaker 1: Did your father have a story about how the family got to, to Winnipeg or, or--
Speaker 2: Well it's, it's a little spotty.  We tried to do a study.  We got as far as upstate New York, and then it jumped over to Minneapolis, and then up to Winnipeg.  How that happened, I don't know, but they got to Winnipeg for some reason or another, yeah.
Story_ID: 72756
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now your mother [Vivian Summers Bakeman]--you have an interesting kind, kind of a mix here.  You have somebody from down South and somebody from way up north.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Well they met here in Chicago [Illinois] because my grandfather [Charles Summers] on my mother's side moved his family from Tennessee to Chicago.  And my grandfather [George Bakeman] was a Canadian Pacific Railroad worker, so he had free passes.  And so the boys used to get the free passes and come, and go to Minneapolis [Minnesota] and then come on down to Chicago.  So my mother met my father [Robert Howard Bakeman] at the old Savoy Ballroom in Chicago.  They were dancing together and the magic happened.  And so he got married and they went back to [Winnipeg] Canada.  You know would go back and visit family, but he wound up staying here.
Speaker 1: Was she visiting Chicago or--
Speaker 2: No, no.  My grandfather moved the whole family here.  He was working on the--at that--when he moved here, he got a job working on the Burnham Harbor Program, yeah.
Story_ID: 72757
Speaker 1: Okay now when did her [Vivian Summers Bakeman] family move up from Waverly, Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Long before I was born.  They came up probably ten years before I was born [1923], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, around the turn of the century.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's about that, yeah somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: Did they have stories about their ancestors in Tennessee, what they were doing?
Speaker 2: Well my grandmother [Ora Summers] was alive, so--on my mother's side, so I have--spent a lot of time with her.  She was born in slavery, as well as my grandfather [George Summers].  They were both born in slavery.  And when they were freed, my grandfather was given quite a bit of land by the former slave master in Tennessee.  However, he had to leave and give that land up because the [Ku Klux] Klan ran him out of Tennessee because there was some problem with women and the sons, the, the white women and the, and the teenage boys and the Klan told him he had to leave, so he did.
Speaker 1: Now, now explain what this problem is.  A white woman and some teenage--
Speaker 2: Well the white girls liked this very handsome young black, black male.  And--
Speaker 1: That was your grandfather, right?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's son, my uncle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they, they, they knew my grandfather very well, they liked him.  His name was Charlie Summers and everybody liked Charlie.  And so some guys came to him and told him "Charlie, you gone have to get that boy out of town, otherwise he won't last."  And this is the story as it's been told to me, and so Charlie decided that he had to take his family out of Waverly, Tennessee.  He went to Nashville [Tennessee] for a while where my family--my, my mother [Vivian Summers Bakeman] went to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] for a while and used to be a Jubilee Singer.  And then he moved on up to Chicago [Illinois] because the employment opportunities were better.  And so that's how they settled in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Did your mother continue her, her education?
Speaker 2: Off and on.  She never got a degree, but she did take some courses.  She used to sing in the church choirs and things like that.
Speaker 1: Now did she--she was at Fisk, well she was there after [W.E.B.] DuBois, it had to be after DuBois.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, right, okay.  But she sang with the Fisk Jubilee Singers?
Speaker 2: For about a year, I think a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Did she get, get a chance to travel around the country?
Speaker 2: With the Jubilee Singers.
Speaker 1: Did she--
Speaker 2: I have no voice, though.  I didn't inherit that part.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about any experiences traveling with Fisk Jub--Jubilee Singers?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  You know I--as a kid, I didn't know what Jubilee Singers were, so I didn't have any questions to ask, you know.  It just okay, she sang.  Well Mother would sing at the--we had, we had--she played the piano and she'd sing at birthday parties and things like that, you know, so I knew Mother could sing.  But I didn't know what a jubilee singer was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 72758
Speaker 1: Now, now what did your father [Robert Howard Bakeman] do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father was a craftsman, as well as a, a, an independent businessman.  He--at one point he had one of these big oil tankers, and he had a home route where he delivered fuel oil to you know, homes all over the, all over the city before companies like Standard Oil decided they were gonna do it themselves.  And so he did that for years.
Speaker 1: So he had his own oil truck?
Speaker 2: Right, right, his own truck and everything.  Now on Saturday I used to go with him, you know and, and help him.  And I'd get paid for that.  Then after that, business was no longer viable because the larger oil companies decided they were gonna take that over.  He went to the railroad, the Burlington Railroad and became the first, first African American Car Inspector for the railroad.  And was there for probably fifteen years.  And then retired from the railroad and became a policeman in Momence, Illinois cause he bought some property out there.  And this next thing I knew he was on the police force out there.  And my father was an astute politician.  So he became Police Sergeant I believe, or at least a police, some type of officer.  And the, and the, and the Township Health Officer at the same time that he was also a member of the Momence Police Department.
Speaker 1: While, while you all lived here in Chicago [Illinois], he was--
Speaker 2: Well we--the family, you know we did both.  You know we lived in Chicago and also had property out there and the kids would go out there and play on the property and that type of thing.  They had a little house on it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So yeah he was versatile.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Versatile and astute.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Story_ID: 72759
Speaker 1: Now can you kind of describe for us I guess some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well the other thing I need to tell you is my grandfather on my mother's side, [Charles] Charlie Summers, became a very successful businessman here in Chicago.  He was in the--he went into the grocery business.  And I, I grew up working for him as well in the grocery business.  And he at one point had five stores.  And I remember helping him turn his stores into self-service stores before A&P [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company] did theirs.  He was that kind of visionary, that he recognized that self-service was the way to go.  I grew up with him and worked helping him in his business as a kid.  And learned how to be a butcher, so I can cut, I can cut meat.  I can dissect your joints and do a good job.
Speaker 1: Well, I hope we don't get to that part.
Speaker 2: But when I eat a steak, I even clean the bone with the knife, I don't have to pick it up.
Speaker 1: Tell me though, you said he was the first--he owned one, one of the first self-service stores.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I don't think that many people listening to this tape in the future will even understand what kind--other kind of store there, there could be, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah well this was--initially the stores were where you walked in, you walked to the counter and somebody would put a paper bag on the counter and then you'd give your order and they'd write down what, what you were ordering.  And then you go--and then that person would go around into the shelves and pick out what you wanted, what you were ordering, and then bring it to the counter, add it up and put it in the bag for you.  Then you, then you'd go on out.  So all the service was done by the employee of the store, not, not by the, the customer.  And so that's what I grew up in until he decided he was gone make it self service, which is what we have today almost everywhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah, always get a cart and you--
Speaker 2: Yeah right, right.  Well he had baskets that people could carry around and pick out what they wanted off the shelves and so forth and then come by the counter.  And they'd have to walk by the meat counter in order to get to the cashier.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Smart, smart placement of--what, what do they call it now?  There's a name, name for that.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Merchandising.
Speaker 1: Merchant, right--well see I kind of--I got--I, I grew up being promoted.  I started at the--stacking pop bottles when I was a little kid.  And I'd get paid for that cause see only--pop bottles then you got--you turned them in and you get some money for turning them in, like two cent or a nickel, it was a big bottle.  So those bottles had to be stacked because somebody would come and get them, the company would come and get them.  So I progressed from there to the candy counter and the ice cream counter where I, you know, would sell the candy and ice cream to the kids as they came in.  Then I, I graduated from that to the meat counter.  And that's where I learned how to, to, to cut meat and my father [Robert Howard Bakeman] and my grandfather [Charles Summers] used to buy whole cows and we would--he taught me how to skin them and cut them up and cut all the, you know, the steaks and all that stuff with them.  So I'd be--I used to be a weekend butcher in his, in his stores.  And then as I got a little bit older, I even ran one of the stores on the weekends.
Speaker 2: Did he have--was there, was there a name for his stores?
Speaker 1: Summers Grocery Stores.
Speaker 2: Summers Grocery Stores.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And how do you spell that again?
Speaker 1: S-U-M-M-E-R-S.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And where was--give, give me a couple of the more prominent locations I guess.
Speaker 1: Well his, his--the store that I initially started in was at 50th and State Street [Chicago, Illinois], right on the corner.  And then he had his biggest store was at 51st and State Street right near, near the corner.  But then he had a store at 55th right off of State Street.  And then he had a store at 47th near Indiana, right on Indiana.  So he had them all within the, the African American community.
Speaker 2: So these like in the late '40's [1940s] or so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, late '40's [1940s], yeah, yeah late '40's [1940s], early '50's [1950s].
Story_ID: 72760
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay.  Now any, any, anything else you wanna tell us about your grandparents or your, your parents [Robert Howard Bakeman and Vivian Summers Bakeman] in terms of the background of the family or anything?
Speaker 2: It was a close family, a very close family.  We had huge family picnics that were the highlights for the kids because you got plenty to eat.  You know, good old--good cooking and a whole lot of good food and everybody played softball.  So I mean I don't care if you were eighty years old, you, you played you know.  So it was a fun time for kids.
Speaker 1: Now I got a couple questions, probably should have asked this earlier, but how, how many brothers and sisters do you have and--
Speaker 2: I don't have any brothers or sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: However, my home was the home for every child in the family when there were problems in the--with that child's family.  As a matter of fact, I have two cousins that lived with me for about seven years.  So I never had the chance to be selfish cause I always had to share stuff with them, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Were these primarily your mother's relatives from, from Waverly, Tennessee?
Speaker 2: It didn't matter, either side of the family.  She was--Mother [Vivian Summers Bakeman] was kind of like the, the mother of the family.  And all the children just gravitated to her.  She was such a loving person.  And they, they'd come over to the house to stay just because they really liked her, you know, and she know they would--she would feed them very good, cook their favorite dishes, all that kind of stuff.  So I, I always had a lot of kids in the house.
Speaker 1: Was there a sizable group of relatives from Winnipeg [Canada] living in Chicago?
Speaker 2: There were, they, they--but unfortunately, many of them went back because--except my--I have--there were, there were two of my father's sisters remained, and my father's mother in her late years stayed here.  But the rest of them went back to Winnipeg because the racism was just too much for them here.  They just weren't dealing with that because they were--they had mixed marriages and whatnot.  You know in Canada they just do all kind of stuff up there and think nothing of it.  And so they came here with, you know with mixed marriages and it just didn't work out at all here, yeah.
Story_ID: 72761
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about your childhood, you know, what kind of a little boy were you and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of--
Speaker 2: I was a wonderful little boy.  No, I--as a little boy I grew up, first of all in the community where the Farren Elementary School was.  That's the first elementary school I went to.  And my grandfather's [Charles Summers] store was right across the street from that--
Speaker 1: Now, now let me just qualify something here before you get started.  Those who watch this in the future, they may not even have my perspective.  But I think of Farren, I think of the projects across the street.
Speaker 2: They weren't there.
Speaker 1: And they weren't there.
Speaker 2: There were no projects.  We had a lot of single family homes and small apartment buildings.  They were--they weren't middle class, but the people were, you know, were there in those, in those homes.
Speaker 1: Those are being torn down now.  I mean the, the projects.
Speaker 2: The projects are being torn down now, but they weren't even--there was, there was no such thing.  And this was the old Farren School, not the current one that's there, that's there now, the old building.  And so that's where I first started school.  And there was a very important event in my life that happened while I was there.  I was in my--at one point we were living in the back of my father's store, my grandfather's store.  And I knocked a teakettle of boiling hot water off the stove and it fell on my ankles.  And my ankles turned to mush, okay.  The, the boiling water just took the flesh right off.  And so I couldn't walk for quite some time and couldn't go to school.  Teachers used to come across the street and bring me my lessons for me.  And, and, and talk to me and grade my lessons while I was at home cause it was just right across the street.  And so I didn't miss you know really school, per se, because the teachers--a couple of the teachers made sure that I had my lessons and I was doing them.  I stuttered as a kid.  And I had a, a teacher who decided she was gonna take care of that.  And she got an agreement from my family that I could miss recess and stay there and, and bring my lunch, and she would work with me on the stuttering issue during that period of time.  And so that's what she did and I guess maybe a year or two later, I got past it.  And--but I remember as a kid have--you know, really stuttering and having a great deal of difficulty speaking and for, for quite some time after that to speak in public, my throat would lock up, you know and I couldn't talk, you know.  And--but you know certainly helped me to get past that stuttering.  It was just a--it was really quite a, quite a handicap at that point cause kids would laugh at you and make fun of you, you know, and that type of thing.  But the teachers just were so good.  I mean they were so sincere and so committed, you know, to the success of kids that I got, you know all of that good, good treatment from them which really turned my life around as a kid, you know.  Cause you can imagine what it would be like as a grown person still having to go through that, you know.
Story_ID: 72762
Speaker 1: Now as a kid did, did you like to read or did, did you like sports?  I mean what were you into?
Speaker 2: I, I, I liked sports.  I, I read when I had to, you know.  I, I was never a super scholar, okay.  I wasn't--I, I was--I did like sports and I was a little overweight.  So therefore, I had to work hard to become an athlete as a kid because at, at--in the beginning I wasn't very good at anything.  But my father [Robert Howard Bakeman] essentially told me that you know if I worked hard at it, I could, I could do anything that I wanted to do in that regard.  And of course I believed him, you know.  And he would get out with me and work with me on my sports skills and, and we'd run and exercise and you know after a while I got--you know the weight got in better shape and I began to, to be, you know, be more of an athlete.  And so by the time I was--I guess maybe in the, you know, 10, 11, 12, I was a pretty good athlete by then.  And I played all the sports.  My father put me on ice skates when I was about three years old.  So I used to be quite an ice skater as a kid.  As a matter of fact, I won the City Playground Championship probably when I was about 13, 12 or 13.  Cause that--at that point the playgrounds in Chicago [Illinois] used to have sports programs, and they'd have playground leaders that would organize activities and so forth.
Speaker 1: You, you were ice skating.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I skate--I skated in all of the--a lot of the major meets all in the Midwest.  As a matter of fact, we had a club called the Midway Ice Skating Club.  Cause we used to skate on the Midway out there in front of the University of Chicago [Illinois].  And we had gray suits with red lettering, you know, the tights and everything.  And we would go to the meets in Wisconsin and Minnesota and so forth and skate.  And some of us, some of us would win medals, you know.  And of course we were quite a phenomenon to see these black kids come up to these--and skate.  And of course the thing about it, we were always welcomed, you know, we were always welcomed to do that.  And as a matter of fact, we were encouraged by the, by the sponsors of the events and so forth because you know, we were a phenomenon. You know you'd bring 12, 15 black kids up to a meet and some of them actually either win or place, you know, get medals.  And that was something they liked to see happen in Wisconsin and Minnesota.  I don't know about anyplace else, but they--so we were quite welcomed, you know, to do that.  And I had a, had a great time as an ice skater, as a kid.
Story_ID: 72763
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of your teachers and, and why?  I mean there's some teachers that really took a big interest in you?  I guess, you know, the ones that you described after you got hurt.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm embarrassed that I can't remember those elementary school teachers' names.  I, I do remember an eighth grade teacher whose name was McNeil (ph.).  Who, who was tough.  Man was she tough.  But she was right all the time, you know.  And she kept us, she really kept us in line.  I do remember fifth grade teacher name of--I think her name was Mrs. White, who told me I'd never finish high school.  I do remember that very clearly.
Speaker 1: What prompted that?  Did you have some kind of a--
Speaker 2: I wasn't the best kid, you know.  I was, I was mischievous and I wasn't bad, but I was mischievous and, and I think I missed school for, you know, maybe thirty days or something playing in the park, you know and whatnot.  Which I shouldn't have been and of course I, I was well taken care of by my father [Robert Howard Bakeman], you know for--once he found out.  But to tell a kid, you know, you will never finish high school, could have a very devastating effect on that kid.  Fortunately, I, I, I just saw her as being just a nut and I--there's no way I was gonna allow her to influence my future, you know.  But they was--really you know as they say, it had made me angry that she would say that to me, you know.  Probably made me dig in my heels and, and be sure I got out of her class.
Speaker 1: What, what was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I really enjoyed the, the social studies, like the geography was probably one of my favorite subjects because I was always interested in what was going on in the world outside the United States.  I guess maybe because I--well first of all I wanted to know as much about Canada as I could, cause that's part of my ancestry.  But my interests went way beyond that.  I really wanted to know what was going on in the world, and so geography became a really interesting subject for me.  And I really enjoyed geography, and I guess I still do.
Story_ID: 72764
Speaker 1: Tell me about high school, you know, what was high school like?
Speaker 2: Well I went to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And the time I went to Englewood High School, it was probably only about ten percent African American.  There was one African American teacher there who was art teacher by the name of Johnson, I remember that because it was easy to remember, the only one teacher that was there.  When I first got there, they put me in wood shop and some other kind of shop although I left grade school with scores that were above average.  I think I left elementary school with scores running in the 11 and 12, 12th grade range.  But they put me in the--into the shop programs as opposed to college prep.  And of course my, my mother went nuts, went ballistic.  And the second semester they pulled me out of there and put me in general education, never in college prep, but general education.  Yeah and so you know I did all right.  The first, first year there was--I didn't--it took a while to adjust.  I didn't do quite as well as I should have the first year.
Speaker 1: Did you have to travel all the way from State Street to--
Speaker 2: I was living in, in West Woodlawn.  And we had to travel from West Woodlawn.  Although at that point I'd graduated from McCosh Elementary School.  And we had to travel from West Woodlawn, which I lived at 6631 South Rose Avenue.  And go over to Englewood which was over on Stewart [Avenue].  And so we had to take the 63rd Street, at that time, streetcar, to school.  So we walked from 60--my house, from--to 63rd Street and then hopped on the streetcar and rode it over to Stewart.
Speaker 1: That wasn't bad, it's a couple of blocks.
Speaker 2: Wasn't bad, it, it wasn't bad at all, yeah.  No it wasn't bad.  And that's what we all did in that West Woodlawn area, all of us, all the kids went to Englewood.  East Woodlawn, they went to Hyde Park [High School], across the, across Cottage Grove, yeah.  I went to high school as a pretty good size kid.  I was probably about maybe five foot ten and probably a good 200 pounds.  So the football coach saw me registering and said "You're on my team."  Okay.  Now you know I'd been playing--we'd been playing touch and tackle football as, you know as, as kids.  But I had no idea what kind of position I would play cause I played just about everywhere on the, on the pickup teams that we would have and the neighborhood teams, including quarterback.  Cause I threw from the left side, so I couldn't throw that long, but I was accurate.  But I wound up in high school playing football for a coach by the name of Toomey (ph.), that was his name.  And of course he put me on the line at 200 pounds, you know.  So I played offensive and defensive tackle for most of my time at Englewood High School.  Didn't have a very good team cause he wasn't a very good coach, you know, but we actually had to coach ourselves, you know in many ways.  But we had, you know, we, we had fun playing and, and made some excellent relationships then.  My mother [Vivian Summers Bakeman] used to, used to allow me to bring the whole team over to my house on Friday night for snacks and she--I mean when I say snacks, she would cook.  And we'd eat and talk about the Saturday game and whatnot.  And this included all the players, which were more whites than black, they'd all come to my house in West Woodlawn.  And that happened for two years, my junior and senior year.  And like I said we weren't a very good team because we didn't have very good coaching, but a lot of good players.  And a lot of those players on the senior team actually got football scholarships because they were good individual players.  I got scholarship down to Kentucky State [University in Frankfort, Kentucky].  I was offered one to University of Illinois [in Urbana-Champaign], but I didn't wanna go down there and be a number.  The Kentucky State coach came up and spent time with my family, promise he'd take good care of me, you know, and so the family told me "well this is where you going."  I said okay, it's all right, I didn't know, know any different.  So that's, that's how I wound up at Kentucky State.

Speaker 1: However when I was in high school [Englewood High School in Chicago, Illinois], the other thing that I think as important in my development was that we did have some pretty good teachers over there.  And one of the guys who was a--I guess the--like assistant principal, disciplinarian or something like that, kind of took me under his wing and made me his audio-visual guy and audio-visual coordinator.  And so I learned how to operate all the machines and everything and I became in charge of all the, the high school audio-visual crew.  And I had--made out the schedule, who would take the machines where and what--did a lot of repair work.  We learned how to repair them and splice films and all that stuff.  He taught me all that stuff.  Real nice guy, and he made sure that my grades where what they, what they should be.  So he was a very important guy and his name I think was Duban [ph.] if I recall.  And Mr. Duban was a pretty good guy for me when I was in high school.  So I was very fortunate to have that, that kind of support, you know, even though I never did get into the college prep program, you know.
Speaker 2: What were your favorite courses in high school, even though you couldn't get into college prep?  I mean did you have a favorite--
Speaker 1: It, it stuck around the same thing, geography and world history, you know, that area were, were really--areas that I was really interested in.  Yeah, I--never interested in geometry and algebra and all that kind of stuff.  I did what I needed to do to get through it, but my best interest was in the world history and the geography.
Speaker 2: Now in addition to playing football and being part of the AV [audio-visual] room--what other things did you do in high school?
Speaker 1: I was on the track team.  I did, I did field sports.  I did the, the, the shot put and the--primarily the shot put and the--
Speaker 2: Were you a discus--
Speaker 1: The discus, I do that, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now how, how was your social life in high school?  Were you popular or--
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.  As a matter of fact, in my senior year, I was--you know we had this separation of the black and white.  And even including the prom.  And so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is something we don't wanna roll past too fast.  But in those days they actually had a prom for the black students?
Speaker 1: Well we had our own prom.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We had our own prom.  We had a group called the Englewood Circle Saronies, now don't ask me what it means.  But it was around for years.  And every year the seniors would work with a guy who owned a [unclear] City Skating Rink, he was our sponsor.  And he would work with us to develop this prom.  We elected Class President, I wound up being the Class President who was in charge working with this guy and oversee the committees and so forth, to see the--our prom took, took place.  So I guess I, I became popular as the years--among the students as the years moved on.  I never held an elective office except that one in which they chose me to provide the leadership for the senior year and the prom.  And so we did and we had it at the old, the old Metropolitan Ballroom and so forth.
Speaker 2: Over on King Drive?
Speaker 1: Yeah, on King Drive, uh huh, yeah.
Story_ID: 72766
Speaker 1: So when you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Englewood High School in Chicago, Illinois], I mean did you, did you have any idea of what you wanted to do with your, yourself in terms of a career?  Had they prepared you for shop?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I, I didn't have a clue.  I, I thought I might wanna do something in business.  So I went to--when I went to college [Kentucky State University in Frankfort, Kentucky], I decided I was gone be a business administration major.  And after my first semester there, I decided that--one of the requirements was that you had to become a typist and type seventy-five words a minute in the business administration program.  Well, being an athlete and having to go to practice after school, and having to travel on the road with the team, there was no way I was ever gonna get to that seventy-five words a minute.  So I changed my major to health and physical education, and kept the minor in business, okay.
Speaker 1: Now tell us a little bit about Ken--Kentucky State.  You know it's a--basically it's a state black college.
Speaker 2: Right, historical black college [HBCU] at state, yeah.  Well it was, it was a culture shock for me, okay because again going to Englewood High School where you're ten percent of the population and, and the only black instructor you got is the art instructor, Mr. Johnson.  And I go off to Kentucky State where the President of the college is black and every officer is black and, and, and ninety percent of the faculty is black.  And you know you've got 1,000 black students.  And it's like--you know--and, and everybody's talking about black history, which I really didn't know much about, okay, other than what my parents [Robert Howard Bakeman and Vivian Summers Bakeman] had taught me.
Speaker 1: So that was a, a pretty hot topic then.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes it was a big topic on campus.  And--
Speaker 1: Where did they come--was there, was there an instructor that was really into that, or--
Speaker 2: It was just part of the culture, just part of the culture--that African American history was just part of the culture.  And the instructions would--you know, you study history, you're gonna study about African American the same as you study everything else.  And so it was an integrated, you know within the curriculum and so forth.  And you know I didn't know anything.  I mean I had to, I had to literally learn all, you know.  Like they--we were on a football trip and we were playing Bethune-Cookman College [now Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida], and all the guys were saying they were gone see [Dr.] Mary McCloud Bethune.  I didn't know who the hell she was, okay, didn't have a clue until they sat me down and told me who she was, okay.  So yes then I went to go see her, you know, cause this was a highly significant person.  But I didn't have a clue who she was because the schools I went to did not address any of that in the curriculum, you see.  So I was really deprived of all of that.  So I had to catch up while I was in college, and catch up I did.  Because I became extremely interested in all of that.  And so that was kind of like an avocation of mine, really to, to study my own history and, and you know, what transpired that I didn't know about.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers there that had a--any professors there that had a, an interest in black--a real keen interest in black history and culture?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, a fella by the name of Henry Chaney, just an outstanding professor.  He, he made it come alive for you and he was a, a--everybody really loved this guy because he was such a super teacher.  And he, he, he knew how to integrate.  And so you got, you know the whole picture when you, when you studied his history, yeah.
Speaker 1: Are there any other instructors at Kentucky State [University in Frankfort, Kentucky] that kind of stand out?
Speaker 2: Well of course my football coach who came to recruit me, was a--he kept his word.  He made sure that I was okay.  Didn't give me any breaks in terms of the field.  I had to earn my way there.  But he was, you know, he was a fair guy and very strong person.  And we learned how to win under him, (laughs) you know.
Story_ID: 72767
Speaker 1: So did, did the team do well?
Speaker 2: Team did well.  First year as a freshman we didn't do so well.  But as we matured and we began to become seasoned, you know, players.  Every year we got better and better and better, yeah and so last two years we were pretty darn good team, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what conference did you all play?
Speaker 2: At that time it was what they call the Southwest Conference I think, where you had teams like Kentucky State, Tennessee State [University in Nashville, Tennessee], Alcorn [State University in Alcorn, Mississippi], Grambling [State University in Grambling, Louisiana], you know top, some of the top African American schools, yeah.  So we had good, strong, you know, program.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you join any organizations on campus when you were--
Speaker 2: Yes, I joined the fraternity, Kappa Alpha Psi.  Yeah I'm proud to be a Kappa man.  As a matter of fact, I joined in my sophomore year and so the last two years I was the Dean of Pledges for the new pledgees.  They wouldn't let me be anything else other than that cause they said I would bring them in right, whatever that meant.  Yeah.  I was also a member of the--by the time I became a junior, I became a scholar in college.  And so I became a member of the, the Athletic Honor Society in school.  Cause at that point I was out of a four point average, I was carrying like a 3.5, something like that you know.  Cause I learned how to study and keep everything in balance at that point.  Probably the first time I've actually had a, a--been a real student in terms of academics, even through high school [Englewood High School in Chicago, Illinois].  You know because at that point, I started thinking about I'm gone have to get a job someplace, and somebody gone be looking at my transcript.  I might want to go on to graduate school, so I better make some grades, you know.  And so I got busy.  Started at the end of my sophomore year becoming a pretty good student, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it wasn't--it's no--it's nothing that really--you just suddenly realized that you needed to buckle down, or was there something happened that made you--
Speaker 2: No, I don't think there was anything that really happened as much as you know, you evaluate your life as you move along, you know.  And I was always--
Speaker 1: Some people...
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Well you know I had a lot of fun.  But at the same time, I was evaluating my life.  'Cause you know I come out of a business-oriented family, so they're goal-oriented you know, and so it's pretty hard for me not to be goal-oriented.  And at some point you start thinking about, well now what are my goals, you know, as a person.  And where am I gonna go with my life and, and how am I gonna get there, things like that.  Not a lot of pressure, but you know, you just think about that, and you reach some conclusions.  Well you know if, if I don't become a decent student, I'm not gonna go anywhere, you know, cause nobody's gonna want me.  But at the same time, I want to, I wanna retain my enjoyment, cause I was thoroughly enjoying college, cause I was traveling with the football team.  I was the manager of the basketball team, and I was on the track team.  So I traveled all, all year long, you know.  So I had a great, I had a great life in college.  And I--but I wanted to be sure that I'd have a good life afterwards, you know.  And so you begin to think seriously about that.  And so that's really how I began to you know, take a look at what does it take for me to get, get good grades?  Well what I found out is that if I got up at 4:00 in the morning as much as I hated it, I could, I could study in a quiet of the dormitory and spend about three hours a morning going through my, my lessons and doing my--you know, whatever I needed to do and so forth.  And then I could still have time to, to play on campus, go to practice if there was a practice.  And of course people got the impression I never studied because they never saw me.  And of course I didn't tell them any different you know.  They assumed I didn't have to study, you know.  They didn't know I was getting up at 4:00 in the morning.  Cause I didn't have a roommate see, cause I, I was fortunate enough that I got a room off to myself the last two years I was there.  So in a room, so I had no roommate watching me get up at 4:00 and, and study for three hours, you know.  So--
Speaker 1: So you perpetuated that myth.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.  They, they were under the impression he, he doesn't have to study, you know, he's just got it, you know.  Yeah, so that was fun, you know.  But yeah I worked hard, worked hard to, to get it, you know to get those grades.  But nobody knew how hard I worked on it.
Story_ID: 72768
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about graduation from Kentucky State [University in Frankfort, Kentucky], now.  What, what was that like?
Speaker 2: Well you know everybody was looking for the opportunity.  And I was no different.  I'd done my practice teaching at a place called Lincoln Institute, which was the high--one of the high schools in [Shelby County] Kentucky, which was residential where the kids from the rural areas couldn't go to the white high school.  The state sent there and paid for them to be there.  And so I did my you know, practice teaching there and actually took over the Spring practice for the football team.
Speaker 1: Was that a residential school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was residential.
Speaker 1: Like Piney Woods [Country Life School in Piney Woods Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Very similar, very similar, very similar.  And so we stayed there, we lived there on campus while we were doing our, our practice teaching.  When I, when I got out, when I graduated, I was offered a job, several jobs, but I took the one in a little town called Elizabethtown, Kentucky, which is about fourteen miles south of Fort Knox.  In Elizabethtown I was offered the job of being the basketball coach.  Now you say well you're a football player.  Yes, but I managed the basketball team for three years, okay.  And in managing them, I knew everything that I needed to know about basketball, cause I used to work closely with the coach in play design, in taking care of the athletes.  I actually used to actually run, run the practices and the scrimmages and so forth when the coach couldn't be there.  And you know so, so I had that experience of literally running teams, okay.  So I took this job as the basketball coach, you know in Elizabethtown, and the social studies teacher, okay.  So I wound up spending a couple of years there in, in Elizabethtown, Kentucky.  Had a, had a successful year as a basketball coach.  I took, took a team of kids who had been--who had lost 21 games and won one the previous year, and we wound up with a 17 and I believe it was 17 and five record.  And going into the state finals as a--I think we finished about fifth.  So--
Speaker 1: That is good.
Speaker 2: Had a great time with, with the kids.
Story_ID: 72769
Speaker 1: Can, can I backtrack a little bit to Kentucky State [University in Frankfort, Kentucky].  You made some lifelong friends at Kentucky State.  Can you talk about some of the people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a lot, a lot of good friends, still friends today.  One of the guys who's now--who's on our [Human Resources Development Institute, Inc.] Board of Directors, is the Board Treasurer, Dr. James [Y] Peoples.  Well Jim came down from Cleveland [Ohio] the same time I did and we both struggled to make the team, you know, and we did.  And somehow or another, Jim and I were kind of attracted to each other as kids.  And so he's still a lifelong friend, you know, we're still very close.  And he's part of the HRDI [Human Resources Development Institute, Inc.] family, you know as a--he's the, he's the Treasure of the Board of Directors.  Gives me no breaks, you know, which he shouldn't.  And at the same time he's a, he's a, he's a lifetime friend, you know.  And there's several you know like that all over the country.  I think one of the benefits of going to a historical black college is that you get a--you get to know so many African American people, and they come from so many different parts of the country that you wind up with connections that you would never have from the predominantly white universities, that stay with you.
Story_ID: 72770
Speaker 1: Okay, now after you coached the basketball team and--how, well how long did you stay in Elizabethtown [Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: Almost two years.  What happened was integration came and the, the white school absorbed the, the black high school.  And the coach over there just licked his chops to get my team because we used to beat his team in practice all the time.  Used to run them off the court.  So he was licking his chops to get my ball players.  But they wouldn't integrate me, you know, they were--I was, I was one of the casualties.  And so I had to go--I went to Louisville [Kentucky] and took a job as a Director of a settlement house in Louisville for year, and then came on back to Chicago [Illinois] and went into the Board of Education as a substitute teacher.  And eventually became a certified teacher and at, at some point became--well I became a school counselor.  And I was a counselor on the West Side at Hess Upper Grade Center.  I started out there though as a, as a phys ed teacher, physical education teacher because I could swim.  Cause Hess was one of the few elementary schools with a swimming pool.  And so I, I taught hundreds of kids how to swim.  Went to school, went back to school and got a Master's [degree] in counseling [from Chicago State University in Chicago, Illinois], became a counselor there.  Wound up--my counseling job really was not so much working with individual kids, but working with the different groups that were represented in school because this was an upper grade center and you had eleven feeder schools.  Which meant all of the different neighborhood groups, you know the street gangs, were represented in that school.  And my job was--
Speaker 1: Street gangs were strong then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, extremely strong.  And my job was to keep the peace and work with them.  You know everything and, and make sure that school was a safe area.  So we had safe zones and we'd--and it was amazing the kind of meetings we had.  We'd have, you know, summit meetings on something would happen over the weekend.  I'd have everybody down in my office and we'd talk about what happened and how we're gonna--you know how to respond, what the response is gonna be and how you know, we have to be sure that everybody gets home safe and that we don't have any stuff going on in the street around the school.  So all that kind of stuff, that was my job.  I was eventually pulled out of there by the Area Superintendent to become his Area Human Relations Coordinator, which meant--to do the same thing I was doing there, but doing it on a larger scale.
Speaker 1: And about what year was this--early '50's [1950s] I guess, or mid, mid '50's [1950s].
Speaker 2: I think we're now into late '50's [1950s], early '60's [1960s], okay.  Something like that.  And so that was my job on a larger scale.  Liked the guy who hired me, very nice man.  However, when there were problems at the school, in the schools, he'd stay home.  And he would call me, "Well how did things go, Vince?"  I handled it, you know because that's why I was there.  But--
Speaker 1: This was a black man?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  There were no such thing as black superintendents during my time.
Speaker 1: He was a superintendent.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was the Area Superintendent.  He had one third of the city [Chicago, Illinois] under his--schools under his control.  And I was in one third of the schools working with the principals, okay and the schools--I'm trying to, you know, help them understand what they need to do with the groups they had there.  And how to keep the peace in their school and whatnot.  So I was a known troubleshooter for the district, for the area.  I came to the conclusion that although this guy was a very nice guy and he had given me this opportunity, if, if something serious happened, he wouldn't be there to back me up, okay.
Story_ID: 72771
Speaker 1: And so I started looking for other opportunities outside the [Chicago, Illinois] Board of Education, and left, and left to become the Area Director for the West Cook County Office of Economic Opportunity, which was the War on Poverty Program.  I had West Cook County as my responsibility.  You know it was--at least there I had control over my, my area and office and the C.E.O. was a strong supporter.  And I knew that, you know, I'd have direct backup.  And so that was a, another experience for me, it was a good experience cause I had--I went from Palos Heights [Illinois] all the way up to Lyon Township [High School] and Maywood [Illinois] and all--just the whole west, West Cook County was my area of responsibility.  And we had the Head Start Programs, the Neighborhood Youth Programs, all those different programs.
Speaker 2: This was like a--after '68 [1968] I guess it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, something, something like that.  But I left the public schools and of course everybody thought I was crazy for leaving.  They said "You leaving that good job," you know.  "Yeah, I'm leaving it [unclear] I don't know where I, I'll wind up if something seriously happens and this guy is at home and you know I think I'm taking responsibility for everything."  So that was a great experience for me, that, that job with the Cook County Office of Economic Opportunity, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 72772
Speaker 1: Okay, now you're--you just had experience with Chicago Public Schools [Chicago, Illinois] and you quit, and what did you plan to do next?
Speaker 2: Well I read there was a job opportunity for--within the Cook County Office of Economic Opportunity.  And I knew the C.E.O., and I went, sat down and talked to him about--told him I was interested in leaving the Board of Education.  And he says, "Well I got the right spot for you," you know and that was the Director of West Cook County [Area Director for the West Cook County Office of Economic Opportunity].  And so I took that job as a Cook County director for West Cook County.  And that was quite an experience for me because during that time, the, the war on--the anti-poverty programs were really getting up and running.  And one of the areas that was extremely important was building community coalitions and you know, community support.  And of course I'd been doing that for some quite some time so that was right, you know, right down my alley cause I'd been doing that really for the Board of Education in my area.  You had to have the support of the communities around the school when you're dealing with that kind of stuff.  Then we had programs like Head Start, the Neighborhood Youth Corps, we had programs for the elderly.  We had what we called "summer action programs" in which during the summer we would have special programs for kids.  We did a lot of community forums in which we educated the community on all, all things we needed to be educated.  And so that's what I ran, you know for, for that organization.  I stayed there for I think it was two years.  And got an opportunity to go with the City Colleges [of Chicago, Illinois] as a, a faculty member.  I took a job with what they call the Human Services Institute at that time.  And what they wanted me to do was to develop the social service programs in the Institute.  There were three areas; youth, youth, work, community organization, and something like administrative support or something you know in that area.  My strength was community organization at that particular time, and of course youth work 'cause I'd worked at the Boy's Clubs and I worked with kids.  So those--so I really developed those two curriculums in the Institute.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by community organizations?
Speaker 2: Well organizing the community to take responsibility for its own problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What does that entail?
Speaker 1: Well it entails finding leadership in the community, getting people to see where they can be effective if they organize.  Helping them identify issues they need to pay attention to.  Helping them develop programs that make sense for them as it relates to those issues, and helping them develop strategies to address those programs.  And developing an organization that had some viability, that will last over time.
Story_ID: 72773
Speaker 1: Okay now, now how do you go about doing that [community organization]?  Do you actually--have to actually go out and--
Speaker 2: You spend time, yeah you spend time in the community, yeah.
Speaker 1: Knock on doors and things?
Speaker 2: Well you go to, go to the place where people gather, you know, barber shops, laundromats, beauty shops, you know, churches, you know where people gather.  And you talk to the--talk to the leadership in the community, and there's leadership in those places as well as the churches.  And, and help them begin to identify--you find out what do they think the problems are.  But everybody thinks there's some problems.  "Well what are you doing about it?"  Well we, well we--let's have, let's get together and talk about what we might do about this.  And you know initially becomes just a single focus.  You may need a stop light on this corner cause five kids have been hit by cars over the last two years.  And so you organize around getting that stop light.  But that's just the beginning because now you may wind up developing a whole neighborhood association.  Because now I want to say see the success about this stop light, you start looking at well, we got you know, some of these curbs need to be fixed in the street, and we got some, we got some other things--dangerous spots that need to be taken care of.  We got you know, our alleys aren't being cleaned properly, or--I mean they--it mushrooms, you know.  And so next thing you know, you got a neighborhood association that is, is taking responsibility for its neighborhood.
Speaker 1: So like when--you--would you have a staff then to do this for you--a staff of people to go out and--or would you have to do a lot of that yourself?
Speaker 2: It depends on what, what kind of support you get to do it.  There was a time when you could actually get financial support to help neighborhood organizations develop.  And the federal dollars that we got through anti-poverty pro--programs allowed us to do that, yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm dwelling on this cause it's--I know it's a kind of a--it's a subject that often is politically loaded sometimes when you organize a neighborhood.
Speaker 2: It's very politically loaded.
Speaker 1: Too good, then the mayor doesn't like it.
Speaker 2: It's very politically loaded.
Speaker 1: Or the, or the--whoever--
Speaker 2: The alderman or whoever it is, right.
Speaker 1: They get a little threatened.
Speaker 2: Yes they do, yes they do.  But that's, that's, that's just the way it is when you, you know the--it creates, it creates another equation in the community in terms of balance and you know the organizer is not necessarily the most popular guy with the political establishment.  But at the same time, you know you don't lead as an organizer, other people lead, take the responsibility and lead.  You provide the technical support, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think that's why the money kind of floats around.  Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not there.
Speaker 2: Well you know yeah, see on one hand, it's great to say "I'm gonna be--help these community organize and take responsibility for themselves."  That's a great statement.  But on the other hand if that happens, then they begin to call into question your motives as the political leader and what your intentions are, and begin to measure whether you're the leader they want to have.  You see so it's a double edged sword, you know.  And a lot--it's hard for a lot of politicians to walk that, that line, you know, once they understand what they got; it's tough.
Story_ID: 72774
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right what other kind of things?  I, I, I interrupted with that interjection there, but I thought that was important to talk about.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  I don't know what other kind of things you wanna hear about?
Speaker 1: Well, well just then to summarize, you're doing like social service stuff in the community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, and, and I'm at City Colleges [of Chicago, Illinois].  And I used to teach all those courses.  And teaching actually had an impact on developing HRDI [Human Resources Development Institute, Inc.].  There were really two things that happened pretty close to each other that really kind of forced me in that direction.  In my classes I always had a theme that ran through them, and that is that the African American community had to learn how to build institutions out beyond the church in order for it to be able to take responsibility for the issues that it has in the community.  And those organizations have to, you know, become viable so that they can address the issues in the community.  And so institutional building was, you know was extremely important.  And that was kind of a theme I, I you know interjected throughout, you know, in my teaching.  I can't remember exactly when, but you know a few years into teaching, I had a student one day you know, raise their hand and say, "Mr. Bakeman, I agree with you about we have to build institutions in our community, and that we need the skills to do it.  But I just wanna know what are you gonna do?  You got the skill."  And it's like, "oooh," threw the gauntlet down, you know.  And of course I had to think about that.  And at the same time I had, you know on a part time basis I had been working with a--another organization that I prefer it to remain nameless cause we had a falling out with.  And I tried to help them grow and greed by the Board Chairman got in the way of growth.  He decided he wanted to do what I was doing 'cause he wanted to get paid.  Well the Board Chairman of any not-for-profit organization is not supposed to get paid, okay.  But he wanted to be paid for his time.  And so he wanted--so he convinced his board to get rid of me, I was fired so that he could take that, take that responsibility over and get paid.  Well I would still remain the Chairman of the Board, okay.  So I was happy to get out of there.  So I was talking to a friend of mine who--and I'll tell you his name, his name is Samuel Patch.  Sam worked for Ralph Metcalfe, Jr., Ralph Metcalfe, Sr. for years as his Administrative Aide, real solid guy.  Was one of [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington's supporters, strong supporters and administrators.  But Sam was an old friend of mine from Kentucky State [University in Frankfort, Kentucky], we went down together, came back, came back together, graduated together.  He says "Vince, we're just gone have to get our own thing because they just not gonna do it right."  Well he was referring to a couple of things.  That experience plus the fact that in the late '60's [1960s], early '70's [1970s], most of the service programs in the African American community were being provided by organizations outside the community.  And what they were doing was using the data to get funded and open up a storefront, but all the resources would not come into the community, they stayed where, you know, with that organization.  Either on the North Side, suburbs, whatever.  And so when he says "We gonna have to get our own thing," in other words, "we're gonna have to change this equation."  And so we decided we would try to do something about it.  We had to have a meeting space, cause we were gone call together, some of our colleagues that were leaders in the community.  Went to [HM] Herman Roberts of Roberts Motel, and to this day Herman has no idea what kind of impact he had.  I told him what we wanted to do.  Herman gave us meeting space every Saturday with coffee and rolls and so forth in his motel there on 63rd Street, I guess 63rd and Prairie, Indiana, wherever--
Speaker 1: Five hundred--the one with the-0-
Speaker 2: Right, that big one.  He gave, he gave us meeting space in one of his large meeting rooms.  Plus coffee and rolls and so forth, you know, continental breakfast free, sponsored us.
Story_ID: 72775
Speaker 1: And out of that came an organization which ultimately became HRDI [Human Resources Development Institute, Inc.], okay.  We decided that we needed to incorporate, become a legitimate, legal organization, not-for-profit in the state.  And so that's what came out of there.  Our first contract came from the Governor's Advisory Council on Mental Retardation.  Our very first contract, 27,000 dollars.  That was in 1974 I believe it was, same year we, we were chartered.  And we would do a study of the, the developmentally disabled offender in the Illinois criminal justice system.  We went out and hired a couple of our colleagues who were professors at the School of Social Work [School of Social Service Administration] at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] to be our primary investigators.  And we hired a guy who had just retired as the warden of Joliet [Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois].  And so we--with that team, we put together a study of what was going on in prisons as it relates to that population.  It was pretty bad--pretty sad.  That study became nationally recognized almost immediately once we released it.  Quoted in the "President's Commission on Mental Retardation."  Even got invited over to London [England] to make presentations around that study and so forth.  It kind of launched us as an organization, fortunately.  So from there, we did one more study for the State, which dealt with the transportation needs of the same population because that was before you had all of the handicap accessible places and handicap laws, and before you had handicap parking and all that kind of stuff, you know.  Cause you know those haven't been around a long time, even though they seem like they have been.  And so our study had an impact on that because we just--we did a state-wide conference supported by the state government to, to present our findings.  In '76 [1976] we were asked if we were interested in doing direct service.  Well that was our intention all along.  And so we started with a small grant from the State Department of Mental Health, think it was about 95,000 dollars, to do a small day treatment program for the mentally ill black male who was in state hospitals, and to do a residential program.  So we had something--so we had to find the place for each of these programs.  And that's really how we got started in direct service.  Of course form there we grew and started to--because we were successful in, in the programs.  So that's really how we got started.
Story_ID: 72776
Speaker 1: So how have they grown since you--?
Speaker 2: Well we do drug treatment for adults, adolescents, outpatient, residential care, day care, day treatment.  We have the largest drug treatment program in any county jail in the country right here at Cook County [Illinois].  Five hundred beds of treatment.  We just won the contract to do the day, do their day reporting program, which is for a couple thousand people.  We have adolescent as well as adult programs in this area, same thing in mental health, adolescent and adult community mental health programs.  Both residential, outpatient, day, day treatment.  We have alternative schools we talked about earlier.  We do medical case management for about 6,000, about 6,000 people.  And mothers who are pregnant who need medical care to take care of their child that's gonna be born.  Then we stay with them the first year of their birth to make sure that the mother and child get proper medical care.  We do that also for DCFS [Department of Children and Family Services] kids.  Probably we have maybe 1,000 kids who are wards of the state.  We have AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome] prevention education, as well as testing programs.  We do suicide prevention in the day--in the summer camp that we run.  All kind of prevention, drugs, alcohol, mental health, suicide.  We are really pretty comprehensive as an organization.  Now we're operating in somewhere around twenty-five sites around Cook County, city.  And we've got a staff of about 400 now.  So we've grown quite a bit since those first days.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It sounds like an institution to me.
Speaker 2: We're close to becoming an institution.  Got one or two more steps to make.  That, that--when we do that, then I can honestly say we, we're an institutionalized organization.
Speaker 1: What, what are those?
Speaker 2: Well, we don't have an endowment program.  And I think in order to be an institution, in order to be an institution, you, you've gotta have a strong endowment to perpetuate your existence.
Story_ID: 72777
Speaker 1: You need that [a strong endowment program] in order to guarantee your existence.  Right now we operate on contracts, individual fees, and grants.  And it's hard to develop any type of endowment program off of, off of those kinds of revenues, you can't because those revenues have to go to the programs that you contracted to deliver.
Speaker 2: So you need a big influx of money just, just for that purpose?
Speaker 1: Well you know and, and we have a, we, we have a plan that we're working on to develop that endowment program.  That's part of institutionalization.  You know we're large enough now that--we've been around long enough that people can't question your stability and whether you're gonna be in existence.  We're accredited by every national accrediting body that you--that's out there.  So we've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval on us and you know our finances are solid.  So we're, you know we're, we're, we're a prime organization now for that next step.  And that's, that's where we're headed.
Story_ID: 72778
Speaker 1: Now is there a--you may have stated it before, but just for the record, what's the overall operating philosophy of all these, all these programs?
Speaker 2: Yeah our, our--fundamentally, we want to help people become as independent as possible, and to take as much responsibility for themselves as they can.  Empowerment.  And so we may get you in a debilitated condition, our objective is to make--is to help you become an independent citizen.  And when we say citizen, we're not just talking about overcoming your--whatever that has--you know that illness or whatever it is that has kept you from, you know performing as a solid citizen.  We're talking about become a citizen of the community where you participate in the life of the community fully.  Serve on, serve on neighborhood organizations, do Boy Scout work, do Little League.  I mean we want, you know we, we wanna prepare you to be a real citizen and make a, a positive contribution to the community.  And we do the same--we do the same thing with people that come out of the jails.  We expect--we're working with them to become good citizens; that they have a responsibility in their communities.  So that's really our overriding, you know, objective.
Story_ID: 72779
Speaker 1: Okay, now in the social service world of Chicago [Illinois], many other cities, the biggest--one of the biggest concerns are black males of the community.  I think stats now show that maybe--we're talking about maybe half of the males between--or maybe more, between 13 and 31 have been through the criminal justice system in one way or another.  It's a, it's a high rate of recidivism if they go once, they're gonna go again more than likely.  And when they come out, they're coming right back to the same neighborhood to do the same thing cause there's no more opportunities I mean the, the same conditions exist.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How, how are you all affecting that, that problem?
Speaker 2: Well no question it's a serious problem.  And the reve--the revenue support to address that problem is not there.  It just isn't there.  And the focus on the juveniles I think is extremely important, and the revenue certainly is not there for the juveniles.  We're very casualty oriented in, in this society.  We wait for people to get sick, we wait for things to happen, and we measure how much happens before we decide we're gonna put money behind the program.  Getting prevention money is very difficult, and yet that's probably where we would have our best success.  And so you know we're constantly pushing for more prevention resources to work with those kids that you're talking about.  Because they need a lot of help.  The men, the young men that we work with who have been in, who are in our treatment programs, our rate of, of return is much higher than other people's.  Not return, but rate of staying out of prison, returning back is much higher because they have a support network that we build in for them, which is something that, that all of them need.  They need a support network.  Unfortunately, there's no provision for that support network right now of any note.  Most guys are turn--they're released, they're given their clothes and, and, and maybe a little, little quick money and boom, they're out in the community with really no significant support, other than perhaps a parole officer whose overburdened and overworked with too many.
Speaker 1: Too many cases.
Speaker 2: Too many cases, so you would--
Speaker 1: Hundreds of cases.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's absurd, it's absurd.  So we're just not doing the job we need to be doing and I--there's nothing else I can say to you.  We do the best we can as an organization with the population that we have.  And I do think we're making, making a, a difference in the lives of a lot of men in this regard, but it's not enough.
Story_ID: 72780
Speaker 1: Now, now where are you concentrated, basically geographically in the city [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well I would say probably half of our program offerings are on the South Side.  Maybe you know somewhere between 50 to 60 percent are in the southern end of the city.  But we are up north, on the North Side.  We are in the West Side.  So we're, you know we're pretty much geographically around the city in terms of services.
Speaker 1: Where on the north side, Rogers Park, or--
Speaker 2: We have a medical case management operation about 4400 north in that, in that general area.
Speaker 1: It's like Edgewater I guess.
Speaker 2: Uptown.
Speaker 1: Uptown.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and on the South Side you're, you're in--are you in West Woodlawn?
Speaker 2: No, we're not in West Woodlawn, TWO [The Woodlawn Organization] is over there and you know we respect each other's territories and so forth.  But we are in Grand Boulevard all the way--and then all the way out into the Roseland/Riverdale communities and over west, over west.  We go as far as Western in terms of services.  And in the southwest area as well.  And of course we're going west, we're, we're in Pilsen, we've been in Pilsen probably for almost twenty years with the programs there--and we're near, Near West Side as well.
Story_ID: 72781
Speaker 1: Okay.  What would be your ideal I guess scenario for how, how you would like to address these problems?  What would you--is there anything you think the government ought to do right now to, or to help?  I mean I know that the emphasis is on self-reliance, but I mean some of these--what do you think would be the ideal scenario for how this all works out?
Speaker 2: I don't think we've taken some of our problems serious enough.  The drug problem.  It's hardly a family that's not affected by the drug problem.  Yet we don't have the resources that are allocated through either the federal government or the state government, to address this problem.  We're still scratching the surface in terms of the seriousness of the problem.  And so we're falling further and further behind when it comes to addressing that one particular problem.  And it, it appears to me that we're just not accepting the seriousness of the problem as a society.  Not just our elected officials.  You know I think as a society, we're not accepting the seriousness of the problem because if we accepted then it's a, it's an ugly cancer that we've really got to address once we accept it.  And we're just not doing it.  Therefore, we don't put the pressure on our elected officials to really address it.  You hear very little in the media about it, unless it's a drug bust, and then everybody shows all the drugs they busted from someplace which, you know, really doesn't solve any problems.  It looks good in the press and so forth, but it solves nothing.
Speaker 1: There seems to be an endless cycle of busting and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Revolving doors.
Speaker 2: Yeah but if we really--there's really been no impact in terms of the amount of drugs that come into the U.S. [United States] and are on the streets over the last twenty years, no significant impact.
Speaker 1: Do you think that's the number one problem in, in the community, the drug problem, or, or what--
Speaker 2: I think the drug problem is perhaps may be our number one social and economic problem in our community, and we're just not--we're not accepting that to be the case.  Because if you think about it, think of all the related illnesses that come as a result of--and I, when I say drugs, I'm just not talking about the drugs like heroin and cocaine.  I'm also talking about alcohol, okay.  You think about all the related health problems and the demands on the health care system that come as a result of those kinds of problems.  You know you've got respiratory issues, you've got stomach issues, you've got you know, just about every part of your system, endocrine system--all of that is affected by the use of these, these substances.  And as a result, the health care system you know just takes a hell of a beating because of the cost of taking care of people who have, who, who have that problem.
Story_ID: 72782
Speaker 1: Well I am, am a member of an organization called the International Council on Alcohol and Addictions, ICAA.  Been a member about twenty years.  I am currently the Deputy President of ICAA.  I'm the Deputy President for the Americas.  That includes Canada, United States, Mexico, Central America and South America.  We have two other Deputy Presidents, one is Australia who's responsible--I mean New Zealand rather, who's responsible for that part of the world, and one that's in, in Finland who's responsible for, for the European area.  One of my duties is to serve as the Program Chair of the Board of Directors as well as the Deputy President.  And we do conferences all over the world and those conferences are run through the program committee for approval and ideas and so forth in terms of what they--the content should be.  ICAA has been a UN [United Nations] affiliate organization.  It's been around since 1909.  We've had contracts with the UN to deliver training programs throughout Africa.  My time over the last probably eighteen years, I've spent a lot of time in west Africa, east Africa and southern Africa, primarily in the English speaking countries of Africa, which are about twenty-some odd.  And I've been in most of them.  I've been in a few of the French speaking countries.  And doing training in the whole area of drug policy and program development.  I've represented not just ICAA, but I've, I've been a representative of the International Labor Organization in these countries.  The UN Drug Control Program, which is the world policymaking body for, I mean for policy for the world.  And U.S. is one of those members of that body.  I've been doing, doing that probably for the last 17, 18 years.  I've helped countries develop national drug policy, helped them develop drug training programs, drug treatment programs, prevention programs, workplace programs throughout Africa.  It's been quite an experience.  I've, I've made in some cases as many as a dozen trips a year to the continent during the high period of, of that work.  I also served as the ICAA representation to the UN's Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which is the world drug policy arm of the UN, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs.  About eighty countries are in membership to the Commission.  And it's out of that Commission that world policy is developed.  And as the representative of ICAA, I sit right on the floor with every one of those countries and have an opportunity to speak before the, the body, as well as speak to every one of the delegates from those countries about policy issues.  And so we're able to recommend you know, policy directions to those countries that ultimately become part of the UN policy documents.
Story_ID: 72783
Speaker 1: How, how does drug policy differ in other countries from, from the U.S.?  [unclear] the countries of Africa and how the UN [United Nations] views the drug problem.  Is that different significantly from how, how we do it in the United States?
Speaker 2: Well in--on the continent of Africa, they were probably about ten years behind the U.S. in terms of having the problem.  And so you, you, you--we're, we're, we're structuring appropriate responses on the continent of Africa where in the U.S., those responses have already been structured.  Maybe not necessarily always appropriate, you see.  So we have a--we're able to take some insight in terms of what works with us when we go into Africa cause we've had trial and error here in this country, okay, to some extent.  I'm not being critical, but we've had trial and error because we've had the problem much longer and so we've had to learn, you know, you know what works.  On the other hand, you, you have to also be mindful of the culture where you are.  And so the culture has to be always considered in anything that you're doing there.  So you just can't transfer stuff and say "Oh that works."  They have to, they have to modify, adjust, you know incorporate new language and all that kind of stuff.  But African policy is not coming online.  It's taken us about ten years to really get most of the countries to a point where national policy has become a high priority and programs for, for care.  South Africa right now is having a serious problem with heroin.  They have no methadone programs.  As a matter of fact, methadone is illegal in South Africa.  So now they got a serious problem.  The, the alternative drug in which people can take and live a responsible life, go to work every day, go to school, take care of the family, buy the house and so forth, is illegal in South Africa.  Where here in the U.S., we learned that methadone is not necessarily a bad thing.  It's an opportunity for a person to get off of heroin and then begin to assess whether they want to get off of methadone.  But in the meantime, they can hold a job, you know, they can go to work every day, they can, they can have a reasonably you know, good life, okay while, while they're making those decisions.  Over there they, they don't have that, that capability.  And so the heroin population is growing and growing and growing and growing.  This is a new phenomenon.  For years the African countries were used as transit points where drugs moved through those countries to Europe and to the U.S. because there was no market.  But as the African economy grows and the, you know there is a large upper class in Africa, in all the African countries.  They began to use those drugs that are coming through their country in transit.  You can't be a transit country and not become a consuming country.  And so now the African continent is becoming a consuming continent.  And they've got to have the whole series of programs and policies that address those areas.  And so that's what we've been working on probably for the last ten years on the African continent.  And I've been a part of that, that effort.
Story_ID: 72784
Speaker 1: Now, now just the so-called "War on Drugs" has been going on ever since the [President Ronald] Reagan administration I guess.  What, what do you think about that?  It's been a lot of criticism of it, of--there, there was a movie last year I think called "Traffic" that criticized the, the war on drugs and probably futile, you know.  But what do you think about that?
Speaker 2: We don't have a war.  There's been no war on drugs, not from my perspective.  It was a name that was given to a series of government efforts, but--of which none of them were adequate to address the problem.  So we haven't had a war, we may have had a skirmish you know, where we, you know, fight a little bit to--I think, I think one of the things we've tried to do was containment.  But we haven't done a good job of containment because the problem in many cases has grown.  There have been years in which drug consumption has been reduced.  And those were years when the government decided to put additional resources in its budget and, and, and, and develop relationships with organizations like ours who know the community and know how to address the issues in the community.  But then there've been years where you know they cut back those resources down to the bare bones, and those are the years when you saw the drug program grow again.  One of the things that used to always disturb me when [First Lady] Nancy Reagan said "just say no", her, her President husband would wind cutting the drug budget because all you had to do was say no, which is absolutely absurd you know.  That's absolutely absurd.  That saying "no" is going to cure addicts.  You know and if you don't, if you don't address the addiction population, then the addiction population is gonna grow, okay.  And so we've not addressed addiction population, that addicted population the way we should, and so it's growing.  No war.
Speaker 1: Do you think that solution is the, is the legalization of drugs or what, what do you think about that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think, I don't think the legalization is the solution.  First of all, we haven't done our best job in providing adequate treatment, rehabilitation for the addicted population.  We haven't done an adequate job in developing the community- and school-based prevention programs that we should have.  I think skipping to legalization is a copout in terms of what we really should be doing in our country and in our communities.  We're not made--we're not adequately providing the resources to make those things happen the way they should happen.  We know--see it's not a case where we don't know what to do.  We do know what to do.  We have the state of the art capability in terms of what to do; that's not the issue.  The issue is resources, okay.  And, and legalization is in my mind, is just another copout.  It's says "Okay, we're not going to put any more resources in it, we're just gonna legalize it so some people can, can use it and we won't put them in jail."  Our prison system is, is probably 60 to 70 percent of the people in our prison system are there for some drug or drug related charge.  So we're spending billions of dollars in this country on prison populations that really should have been in treatment, and they wouldn't have been in prison.
Story_ID: 72785
Speaker 1: Yeah, now there's a controversy around that as well.  [HM] Reverend Jesse Jackson and others have pointed out that a lot of people who use crack, which is a--and some of the other drugs that you find in black community, get a lot more time for possession of those than someone who is, you know, snorting cocaine and some of the more expensive drugs, you know.  And it's, it's guaranteed that the--the policy is guaranteed to fill the prisons up with black males and--
Speaker 2: Because, because crack has been, has been one of those drugs of choice in our community where pure cocaine has been one of the drugs of choice in the other community.  And the laws that were made for crack came as a result of they claim all of the violence that was associated with crack.  Where you don't have a lot of violence associated with heroin, pure, I mean pure cocaine.  It's a quiet thing that people do who have money and they can do it in, you know, in a much more quiet way.  Whereas crack became an economic base for a lot of people, and, and it, it became an economic base for a lot of organizations.  And so it became a commodity that supported a lot of people and so territorialism became a, a, an issue with crack, and--
Speaker 1: The only way you can--I'm gonna guarantee that you pay me is to threaten you.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right.  Because you know people are--many people were using their last dollars to buy crack cause it was cheaper to begin with.  But they're using their last dollars.  Whereas folks who are buying cocaine are not using their last dollars.  So you have to threaten the people who--people who are buying crack have to believe that if they don't pay, something's gonna happen to them, yeah.
Speaker 1: And even that as far s them come up--come up with the money because after all, they're high.  They're not able to earn any money.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So they've gotta get it from somebody else.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  Now you just think about, you know, the number of crimes that are attributed to the use of crack in our communities.  Auto theft, home invasion, okay, right.  Not to mention you know, street crime, right that is attributed to crack in our communities.  In addition to the territorial wars that take place.
Speaker 1: So you think that if the government really put forth the effort, they could control the traffic?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Well not the traffic so much, but they can control the consumption.  The consumption could be substantially reduced with the right--cause we've proven that already.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With, with the, with the right--with, with resources, adequate--you know with both treatment and prevention, we've proven there's, there's data that shows that you can reduce consumption.
Story_ID: 72786
Speaker 1: Um.  Let me ask you about--what, what are your hopes and concerns about the black community?
Speaker 2: Well I, I think that we have to take more responsibility for our own future.  It's our future, it's not anybody else's, and I think that the responsibility is ours to create it.  To make it happen.  I think that we have to become more politically astute, more proactive in terms of politics so that we can make things happen.  I think we have to understand that political decisions are what runs this country, and that things happen because you make them happen.  You, you--we can't wait for it to happen, see.  I think the--I think our community is growing smarter, but we're not where we need to be yet.  Okay.  We need to create more institutions that are ours, that are in and of the community.  Now that doesn't mean you discriminate in terms of serving everybody else.  It means that you have an institution that is, that is part of the community, but has the capacity to serve whoever needs to have the service, or the, or, or to address their need.  But you are rooted in the community, okay.
Speaker 1: This implies maybe a cultural component or something [unclear] I guess.  I mean it--does it?  I mean do you all have, have, have specific cultural things you do in the black community that you wouldn't do otherwise?
Speaker 2: We, we pay attention to the culture of the people that are in our programs because we think that's extremely important.  In order for them to, to be successful, they've got to feel that you are sensitive to who they are, okay.  We do a conference, incidentally, we've been doing this for sixteen years called "Counseling and Treating People of Color, an International Perspective."  The focus is on culture and the significance of culture in the care process.  And you have all kinds of people there, you know, at the conference from different cultures.  And we call people of color, but everybody has a color, is of color.  So we talk about you know, world, world cultures.  And how, how you have to be not just sensitive, but you know have to develop some cultural competence in terms of working with the various people from, from different cultures.  So we--like I say this is our sixteenth year doing that.
Story_ID: 72787
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir, what would you see--and you're still fairly young, you have some time left.  But what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I've never thought about that.  I have never thought about that.  I would hope that people would, would see me as having been a positive force.  That had made some good things happen, both for individuals and communities that were in my space.  I would hope that I would have made a little dent in this world and made it a little better place for people to live in this world.  I know I can't change the whole world, I'd love to.  But I'd sure like to--you know I would sure hope that I will have made some help--make some changes somewhere that have been for the better.  Whether it be here or somewhere else in the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, did your parents have, have, have a chance to see you become a success?
Speaker 2: Mother [Vivian Summers Bakeman] did, yeah Mother did.  Father [Robert Howard Bakeman]didn't, he died, he died actually before all this started, unfortunately, yeah.
Story_ID: 72788
Speaker 1: And this is a slightly different question.  But how, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  How would I like to be remembered.  Well I think I'd just like to be remembered, you know.  Just remembered as, as somebody who did something worthwhile with his life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you sir.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Story_ID: 72789
Speaker 1: Just describe the photo and about when it was shot and who's in it and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Well I'm in it, but I sure don't remember when it was shot, cause I had hair then.  It might have been in the '80's [1980s], probably was in the '80's [1980s].
Speaker 1: That was probably about six or seven years ago when I--we were promoting the conference I was telling you about ["Counseling and Treating People of Color, an International Perspective."].  It was gone be in Hawaii.  This was in Kansas, this was in Phoenix [Arizona] and I always--the last day of the conference promote the next year.  So I put some kind of crazy outfit on and all that kind of stuff, you know.  So that, that was my Hawaiian operation there.  I had a Panama hat on and all that kind of stuff.  It was crazy, shorts are on.

Speaker 2: That was in Zimbabwe at the--one of the major art centers for Shona sculpture.  And those are the guys that I worked with in buying the pieces that I bought.  I've got--you see I have a piece in my hand, but I had them ship over to me some huge pieces.  I have some Shona sculpture in my house.
Speaker 1: Their ancestors built the Great Zimbabwe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Date for this?
Speaker 2: I would probably say the late, the late '80's [1980s] for that.
Speaker 1: That's in Zimbabwe where I was doing a training for the development of the workplace program at the Zim--I think that probably was the Zimbabwe Coca Cola 7-Up Company where I was training the, the managers and supervisors for the development of workplace programs for their employees.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  And a date for this one if you can recall.
Speaker 1: Around that same time.  This was in the 1980's [1980s].
Speaker 2: Okay.  That looks like we had a, a walk for--and I can't remember what all the details were.  Cause that was, I think that was a check that was presented to us by Coca Cola as one of the, one of the sponsors of that walk.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  And it says Walk A Bout about Saturday, May 28th, but it doesn't say the year.  Any guesses?

Speaker 1: Okay, in this photo right behind me are two HRDI's [Human Resources Development Institute, Inc.] employees, and the rest of--and there's another one.  This is a group of--a combination of HRDI employees as well as some, some of our African interns that we had.  We've had an, an intern program for people from Africa in HRDI probably for the last fifteen years.  So this is, this is part of the intern group with some of our, our HRDI managers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a picture that one of my former students who kept up with me, sent me.  Actually that picture was taken out of a Board, HRDI Board meeting.  Cause that student used to work for us at that time.  And it was the whole Board, and she took that Board meeting picture and had this one blown up.  That was probably in the late '70's [1970s].  You notice the leather jacket and the big afro and you know--yeah.  I was, I was truly a community guy there.
Speaker 1: That's, that's a picture at one of our "People of Color" conferences.  I think-
Speaker 2: [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 1: I think, I think that was in Barbados, I mean not Bar--Nassau, one of the conferences that we had in Nassau.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  And an approximate date?
Speaker 1: Probably early--let's see, probably '80's [1980s], probably early, early '80's [1980s].
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a picture with me with Tyrone Mbeki, who is the South African President.  That picture was taken at a meeting that we had with some members of the NC and him when we were--this was before he was--just before he became President.  We were talking about how we might be helpful to the South African government in developing their health and human service programs, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is a picture on Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa.  We had taken a group of health care professionals to South Africa, about twenty-five, on a tour of the health care systems in Johannesburg, Durbin and Cape Town.  And this picture was taken on top of Table Mountain in, in Cape Town.  Now I'm looking at the legend of, you know what we--what you were seeing because this is where both the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean meet.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Did you say the date?
Speaker 1: It was probably around 1995 or something like that, yeah.
