It was always a thing in the family whether it was a small D or a capital D. It started out with a capital and then it reverted to a small so heaven only knows.
Speaker 1: Well who decides?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I just th-, I'm not upset if somebody does a capital you know I'm not sure in the old records it was a capital and then my dad changed it to a small and I have no idea so I--it doesn't matter.

Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and painting, do you still?
Speaker 2: No, mainly sculpture, painting, no, I'm not--I like three dimensional things and I think that's because I'm a dancer and I work sculpturally as far as I'm concerned dancing is sculpture.

Speaker 2: (Laughter) I never thought of this. What's my favorite food?  I don't think I have one.  I think I, I'm curious about foods.  I'll try anything.  I love like blueberries, berries I like a lot and fish, believe it or not, certain fishes and, I'm not too hot on sweets.  That, that, that really stopped me in my tracks I might add (laughter).

Speaker 1: I have two more favorites--your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I rarely take vacations.
Speaker 1: Where do you want to go?
Speaker 2: You know where I really would like to go.  I was thinking of that last night.  Number one would be to see the Alhambra [Granada, Spain] and the other is to go down the Nile [Nile River], full moon in a falooka wearing a jallaba (laughter).  That's what I thought would be fun to do, eventually I'll get there.
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying--do you have one?
Speaker 2: Well you know how to catch a person off guard--I'd have to think on that one.
Speaker 1: Okay, but by the end of the interview--
Speaker 2: I hope to
Speaker 1: --or during the interview something will come up and you'll say that's it.
Speaker 2: Yeah I'll try to remem-, I'll try to think about that.
Story_ID: 351906
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your family.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We're going to start with your family's history and then we're going to work our way backwards and forwards and we'll do it as much in order as we can.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: We're going to start with your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --your mother's full name and date and place of birth.
Speaker 2: Well, it's very vague but it's, her name was Grace Grenot [Grace Grenot De Lavallade], G-R-E-N-O-T, but I think it's called Grenot, Grenot they're not sure of the pronunciation you know things change.  It's Louisiana--New Orleans [Louisiana], and I think she was like, her birthday was in November of--maybe--1904.  My sister-, our mother was taken from us when we were eight years old or something like that.  She was very ill and she was in a sanitarium, so we didn't know too much about her but her name was Grace Grenot.  I don't know if she had a middle name but her name was Grace.  Very beautiful lady, very soft, and lovely woman.
Speaker 1: What are your fondest memories of her?
Speaker 2: It's her coloring was kind of--she, when she was out in the sun her skin would get kind of red brown and her hair would get kind of reddish.  You know, and she's petite and very soft spoken and she's just beautiful.
Speaker 1: Did you, then did her mother raise you?  Her--
Speaker 2: We were raised by both families and unfortunately--and her mother's name was Louise and her maiden name was Dupart, D-U-P-A-R-T [Louise Dupart Grenot].
Speaker 1: Was she French?
Speaker 2: Louisiana.  No, it was all the--you know, all the names, all the names are French names.  The Grenot came from Canada.  Charles, Charles Grenot.  There's some record of a man named Charles Grenot, it's a very odd name so it has to be the same family because you don't find that name anyplace.  It came from Canada so he probably (unclear), that long trip there. So we haven't gone quite that far back yet but I find that quite interesting--so he--blue eyes, you know and he talked with kind of an accent like (unclear) (laughter) that I remember.  And had like, oh, like four uncles and Aunt May [May Grenot] so it was a big family.
Speaker 1: So you were raised (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that was a split, that was a split because of mother's illness, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because of the split, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 351907
Speaker 1: So your [maternal] grandmother [Louise Dupart Grenot], you were telling me about her, do you re-, what did she look like?
Speaker 2: She had long black hair, and of course she got very brown, she was probably a mixture I don't know.  And, and very thin and wiry and tough (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now (laughter) did your mother [Grace Grenot De Lavallade] have any siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes, Aunt May [May Grenot], Aunt May, Uncle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You said it was four of them?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, Leo [Leo Grenot], we called him Little Leo--
Speaker 1: Can you give me the order?  Give them to me in order?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  Then I would--it was Leo, and Herbie--Herbert [Herbert Grenot], and oh, it was-- you know, it was so long ago and--
Speaker 1: But it was two boys and two girls?
Speaker 2: No it was like four boys and two girls, it was a big family, and it was, you know because it was so early on with the split, you know, it was jus-, it was unfortunate.
Speaker 1: And by the split you mean-
Speaker 2: When mother became ill, and I think in that period of time people didn't know what was wrong with her, and I think it was one of those simple things like, I think a vitamin B deficiency kind of thing where the whole system go-, so they think there's something mentally wrong with you or something, so they know, so little in those days about any kind of illness that they became a big split in the family because she went to sanitarium, and then daddy [Leo Paul De Lavallade], poor guy, he must have of in his, oh they barely hit thirty or something like that and there he was with three girls.  You know, they took care of us for a while and dear Aunt May was divine, she was a lovely lady.
Speaker 1: What did she look like?
Speaker 2: Kind of brown, and round, and I remember she had these--she kept albums of Nelson Eddy and Jeannette MacDonald, it was all that time, you know, I remember that was her thing.  And she sang, I remember her singing all the time, she had a pretty voice she wanted to probably be an opera singer or something like that and she had this wonderful china doll on her bed all the time, I remember looking at it, and I remember.  My, my fondest memory of Aunt May is when I would have nightmares and she was always there to rub my back, I'll always remember that.  That was really very moving.
Speaker 1: That is really--that's touching, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah it was a crazy family, it was wild.  My mother was married before and she had a son, Eddie [Eddie Grandpre (ph.)].  And he was short, very tiny, miniscule hands and feet, he was really a small guy.  And his last name was Grandpre [ph.].  So, and I know very little about that, but it was a very--mainly men in the family.
Speaker 1: What did Aunt May do for a living?
Speaker 2: You know I really don't know, that's how far back it was, I must have been about seven or something like that.  And when you think--when families are wrenched like that, you know--I remember grandfather [Charles Grenot], he was--with his blue eyes, I remember he liked his beer.  And it was Acme beer, I remember that so clearly, you know, and I was very small and I loved beer and they wouldn't give me any.  When they would leave things on the table I would sneak it (laughter), and take the beer.  I love it.  And it was a funny--we lived in a Mexican neighborhood, totally Mexican.  Now, what I found out, they spoke Spanish, they all married Latino.  But what I found out, my sisters [Yvonne De Lavallade Davis and Elaine De Lavallade Johnson] and I found out when we were looking back in the history--family history well, sure enough, our great-great-grandmothers were named (Unclear), there's one name (Unclear), and (Unclear) Fernandez [ph.].  So, what their history is, we don't know.  So it se-, I said, oh now it makes sense that they--that they preferred that part of their, their, their heritage, you know.  So it wasn't like they were trying to pa-, well, we said, well, that's part of their heritage, that's where they--.  So in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] they all married Latino.
Story_ID: 351908
Speaker 1: And then Daddy [Leo Paul De Lavallade] went, we went, over to the black side.  So we're like, split (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So was that part of the split in the family?
Speaker 1: I'm sure that--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --I'm not sure, but I think it was more mother [Grace Grenot De Lavallade] than anything else.  But it was rather interesting--
Speaker 2: Now what's your--
Speaker 1: --and my sisters [Yvonne De Lavallade Davis and Elaine De Lavallade Johnson] and I were kind of sad about it because we liked that family.  We have fond memories of them, you know, and I loved living in the Mexican neighborhoods.  You know, I love all my Mexican friends, and they were--the people took care of us, you know--
Speaker 2: Well did they think you were Mexican?
Speaker 1: You know I really don't know (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Or Latino?
Speaker 1: Because in grammar school it was Vernon City Grammar School [Vernon City Elementary School, Vernon, California], and my dad never told us our background, it was very funny so somewhere in the records, you know, my sisters and I, we'd write whatever somebody else wrote (laughter) we didn't know what the word meant.  My dad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The word race.
Speaker 1: No. Daddy said, "I don't think it's necessary."
Story_ID: 351909
Speaker 1: What did your father--give me his name, his date of birth and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was great.  Leo Paul De Lavallade, he was in January 21st, they were--mom [Grace Grenot De Lavallade] and dad were about the same age, 1904.  And he was quite a guy, he was tall and handsome.  He--you know who's closest to him in figure and attitude? James Stewart.  And I look at James Stewart and I said, you look like my dad, and a cross between Henry Fonda, it's that lanky kind of, soft kind of, but very strong--he had to be, raised three girls.
Speaker 1: Now he was raised in Parksville?  Or he was born in Parksville (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Marksville [Louisiana]--Marksville, that's up--
Speaker 1: Marksville--now what's the difference between Marksville and New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: New Orleans is a port town, Marksville, see that's a whole, that's that plantation area.  That's up, that's a whole other story.  See I found actually that my mother's side is very well documented, you know.  Now on Daddy's side there was like--our great-grandmothers were, on both sides, Hisp-, they must have been two, let's see, were really what are called wards. I think somewhere after the Civil War when they hired people.  It's like being a--what were they--
Speaker 1: An--indentured servants.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah, I think that's probably was.  And the women, it was very hard for the women because they were at the mercy of anybody, so I know that my dad's mother, whose name was Emma Derivasse [Emma Derivasse De Lavallade], she has her siblings, some of the siblings had different fathers.
Speaker 1: Plantation owner fathers.
Speaker 2: Well of course, yes, you know.  And in fact (unclear) Mariah [ph.], she was on my--oh goodness, it's so complicated terribly, one of them Mariah--we found a paper that was written selling her to De Lavallade from this woman.  Evidently, Mariah was--might've been born in Geor-, I don't know where she was from, but anyway she was taken as a little girl and she grew up with this family, this woman--and I can get the material to you later if you want--and rather fascinating tale, and she stayed with this woman and De Lavallade bought her.  And there was a paper, it's all written in French, and there was, you know, the transaction and I look at the date and we were just going through it and trying to decipher what it was and it was my birth date, March 6.  I can't remember the year I just (unclear), and I thought, oh, that's too weird, just too weird.  So, you know, it's, so that's a different life that they had, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was the De Lavallade that had enough to buy another human being, to buy a person?
Speaker 2: I think it was Louise's [Louise Dupart Grenot] father--no, Benjamin Pierre [Benjamin Pierre De Lavallade], yes, Benjamin Pierre.  Benjamin Pierre, our name, there were other De Lavallades but I don't know--there was Emile [Pierre Emile De Lavallade], I think that was a nephew, they came from France.  Now when we look back he came from around--in the Cognac [France] area--in Charente [France] area, Chateauneuf-du-Pape [France], of all places.  And why these guys came, you know--they must've been brothers or cousins or something because one went up to San Francisco [California] another went to Chicago [Illinois], they're all these--they're related, but I think they're either brothers or cousins or whatever.
Story_ID: 351910
Speaker 1: But there was Benjamin Pierre [Benjamin Pierre De Lavallade] that--but they, but he gave all those kids his name, all those children his name.  So, you know, it depends. Some of those men had double families, you know.
Speaker 2: Of course, I mean some of the other, you know, people we saw, especially in the South, you know, there were two families.  He took care of both families and it was understood (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, certainly did.  Yeah, but he gave them, he gave them his name.  So that's pretty cool.
Speaker 2: His name. Yeah, which was unusual.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
Speaker 2: How did your father [Leo Paul De Lavallade] end up moving out west?  All the way from Marksville [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Because of grandmother, Emma [Emma Derivasse De Lavallade], Emma was quite a--Emma De Lavallade was quite a lady.  Emma, I think, Emma ruled the roost (laughter) and she decided they were g-, leaving--a lot of people in the '20s [1920s], you know, left because of the situation down there I think when, when, when--because the, let's say the mixed bloods, the coloreds, whatever, they had privileges that other folks didn't have, you know, when you look at it, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, the lighter skinned.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the lighter skinned had certain privileges, but it was very paranoid I must say because they were neither black, they weren't white they were kind of in the middle.  It's a mess, in other words, it was--'cause they created a whole other race of people and it was just a total emotional mess.  That's what I feel anyway (laughter) it did and it stayed that way.  But at the time, I think when the Yankees came in, you know, and it started to change and they put the same pressure on them that they did on the darker skinned people, that they got out of dodge a lot of people left.  Some went to Chicago [Illinois], you know that's when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, this is a dumb question, but--
Speaker 1: --big exit in the '20s [1920s]--
Speaker 2: In the '20s--
Speaker 1: --and that's how we got--
Speaker 2: --this is a dumb question, but I have to know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How did they get there?  Did they take a train, did they take--
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably train, yeah probably in that time they took a train.  I would imagine as train--
Speaker 2: The train because at that time people had stopped traveling by coach, or whatever.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but grandmamma went out and scouted, I don't know how she was quite a--and then they started going out the whole family left in the '20s [1920s].  Most of my cousins were born in Louisiana but they all moved out to Los Angeles [California].  And daddy said that Los Angeles, when he moved out there, was the most beautiful places he'd ever seen.  It was absolutely crystalline, the air, you could see the snow on the mountains, you know, and orange trees, and the--oh my gosh, he said it was just beauti-, poppy fields, and I remember poppy fields myself.  It was very beautiful.  Not any longer unfortunately.
Speaker 2: Do you know why they chose Los Angeles as opposed to any other place in the West (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I suppose the West, everybody wanted to go west, and you know the weather who knows the reason for that, and maybe the opportunity.  I tell you a lot of--they were construction people, brick layers, both families, you know.  And I don't know why or how the Grenots got there either, but I imagine it was because of the work.  Because, Los Angeles was being built up, they needed brick layers, they needed construction people.
Speaker 2: The Hollywood Hills.
Speaker 1: Hollywo-, daddy did a lot of the brick work--
Speaker 2: Mansions.
Speaker 1: --and the mansions and things.  He used to take us around and look at them.  I think he did the Adolphe Menjou's house--I think it was this beautiful chimney that had the bricks kind of went around in a circle like that, very beautiful.
Speaker 2: So you can go out there and still see your father's work.
Speaker 1: Probably, probably (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's gotta be amazing.
Speaker 1: Probably, a lot of those (unclear) use grated slate and palos verdes stone.  You know, those men, the brick layers from Louisiana were masters, oh, they were master brick layers--
Speaker 2: And who--
Speaker 1: --and construction people--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: --they really were very good.  That was their trade.
Speaker 2: That was their trade, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think for the coloreds that was what they did, you know, that was their trade.
Story_ID: 351911
Speaker 1: And so your father [Leo Paul De Lavallade] was a brick--
Speaker 2: Bricklayer (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) mas-, bricklayer.
Speaker 2: And then he became a postman.  So he was, you know, it was, you know, we, we got by, you know.  It's that whole thing, you never knew you were poor, you know if you (unclear)--
Speaker 1: But he wasn't--you weren't really poor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Really poor, no, no we weren't like down and out, no--
Speaker 1: Because becoming a postman--
Speaker 2: We were on the lower economic--
Speaker 1: -- was considered a middle class job then, federal job--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that time, yeah. He had this--I don't know why he went from brick laying to, to po-, he probably did both, you know, when he had time.  He had three girls to raise by himself.  Eventually his sisters, Aunt Adele [Adele De Lavallade] and his family helped care for us.
Speaker 1: Who, what was the daily life like in the home, then with just the dad and three girls?
Speaker 2: Well, you go, you take your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who cooked, who cleaned?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we all kind of learned to do that on our own and my aunts would come in and help show us how to do it.  I don't know we just managed I suppose.  Poor guy it must've been very difficult for him you know, in getting us off to school and all that kind of stuff.  But he had his own garden--we, he grew his own food.  We had rabbits and ducks and whatever.  Even on the Eastside [Los Angeles County, California], where we had a house, before all the big split came, we lived down the street from the Grenots so we could go back and forth.  And we had ducks, I remember we had ducks and chickens and all that kind of stuff, so.  And he had his garden of food, and what not, so he was very resourceful, oh, he was always like that.
Speaker 1: Was he, what type of a father was he?
Speaker 2: Oh he was terrific.  He's very stern, not stern, no--he was light-hearted, he laughed a lot, but he was strict.  He never laid a hand on--the worst thing he would do was to look at us, and he'd give you the eye and then you'd feel terrible.  And if we were naughty or something he'd just kept--tap you on the back of the head kind of, you know, why did you do that, (gesture), and he'd keep--pop.  And that was the worst thing; you didn't want that to happen.  He was--I think, when I think about it, for a young man to take care of three girls, they tried to break us up.  I remember going to this orphanage--a Catholic orphanage.  And I think now my sister, Yvonne [Yvonne De Lavallade Davis], I'm the browner of the three and I think they wanted to split us up but they wouldn't take darker ki-, you know I don't know what that was--
Speaker 1: Well, what do you think it was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and grandmother [Emma Derivasse De Lavallade] said, "No way."  Well, you know, yeah, because we were odd looking group and according to Yvonne she remembers something about they would take one or two but not the ot-, or one of those things, and grandmother said, "That's it," and marched us all out of there, you know.  It was shocking, but there--that's the times isn't it.  It doesn't matter who it is, church or otherwise, you still had those things going on.
Story_ID: 351912
Speaker 1: Was the family rel-, was it a religious family?  Did you grow up in a religious household?
Speaker 2: Sort of, not really.  Grandmamma [Emma Derivasse De Lavallade] was religious--
Speaker 1: Catholic, Baptist (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were all Catholic.  And in grammar school [Vernon City Elementary School] in Vernon City [Vernon, California]  there was this lovely little church, St. Martha's [St. Martha's Church, Vernon, California], beside the school and there was this wonderful Catholic priest that--Father Ramirez [Fernando Ramirez], and he didn't speak English.  But it was best and we'd go to that little church and the children had to sit in the front pews you know and when you're late (laughter) you'd come in and you would kind of sneak down--and Father Ramirez, he was so sweet.  He was saying Mass and then he'd stop and he'd turn around and look at you and you felt so bad.  And he'd wait until you sit down in the front, you know.  He was terrific.  He would let us dust the altars, the minor altars.  That was great fun, you'd climb and dust the statues, you know, and then he'd let us ring the bell, and you'd take, you know, and ring--or ride the bell.  Oh, it was great, it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: You said he didn't speak English though.
Speaker 2: No he didn't, he spoke Spanish.
Speaker 1: But did you understand the Mass?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well it was Latin Mass.
Speaker 1: Latin Mass okay.
Speaker 2: English Mass that's something, it was Latin, so it didn't, you know, we were all such little kids (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you knew the ritual.  When to stand, when to sit--
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, children.
Story_ID: 351913
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were the holidays like then?  Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving?
Speaker 2: Christmas, you know, Christmas at that time, you know, when you look at Christmas today, I--it's very disappointing (laughter).  But in those days you made something, or you got a little toy and some little candy.  And a few little toys you know, nothing expensive or anything like that, but you appreciated it, and an orange and you had dinner.  Whoever had big dinner, probably grandmother's [Emma Derivasse De Lavallade] house, and have dinner.  And it was much simpler. You'd go to mass and now it's like emotional blackmail.  You have to get something for everybody--it's not fun anymore.
Story_ID: 351914
Speaker 1: Well at that time what did you want to become?  What did you think, you and your sisters [Yvonne De Lavallade Davis and Elaine De Lavallade Johnson], what did you talk about becoming?  Teachers, nurses?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the usual.  But I think I--at an early age I was always dancing around the, I don't know at school--my cousin, Janet Collins, now this is my cousin, who became one of the--it's too bad Janet died about a couple years ago, and she was one of the great dancers, you know, of color and she was the first, well of color, ballerinas--or, prima ballerinas at the Met Opera [Metropolitan Opera] and Janet was at that time was dancing with Talley Beatty and [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham and all that so you know, I mean gee, Janet would blow into town like (unclear), gee whiz, what do you want better than that.  She was vivacious and lovely, and I want to be like Janet, I want to be like Janet.  So that was my, she was my light. So I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your beacon.  She was, yeah--
Speaker 2: Yes absolutely. She was just remarkable.
Speaker 1: What other stories can you tell me?  When did she come to town?
Speaker 2: Once a year or something like that, you know, and with her giggly self. I remember when she came to town, I think it was her last concert at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre [Los Angeles, California].  I remember her being very tired and sitting in a chair and I remember rubbing her feet for her.  I mean, she was just one of those mythical people to me, you know.  And when I went to New York [New York] she was partially responsible for my going because I know--oh, it's such a complicated story because I think in my travels I went there with the, with the Lester Horton company [Lester Horton Dancers] and I auditioned for 'House of Flowers' and went back to New York--to, to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and my mentor [Lester Horton] died.  And Janet was the one who got my job for me (laughter)--or who negotiated for me for 'House of Flowers' because she knew Saint Subber, the producer.
Speaker 1: Had you seen her perform?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  There was nothing like Janet in the world.  She was like, she was this creature, that was so fast and so light on her feet that, you know, you'd look at this side of the stage and she's there and then she's no longer there she's over there and you don't know how she got there.  She was like a will of the wisp, she was beautiful.
Story_ID: 351915
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did she look like?
Speaker 2: Like me, a smaller scale.  In fact, we look more like sisters than I look like my sisters [Yvonne De Lavallade Davis and Elaine De Lavallade Johnson].  It's very--and we were both born in March, not that far--she's ten years ol-, she was ten years older than I.  It's very, very peculiar, it's very strange (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did she get her start?  Because that was ten years-
Speaker 2: Yes, now that is a story.  Well, you see in that time--to find people who would teach you, number one--I'm not sure, I think Carmelita Maracci did help her.  I eventually studied with Carmelita Maracci, who was a wonderful ballet teacher.  But--she became very proficient, she and Talley Beatty.  Like, Talley Beatty used to go to the studios at six o'clock in the morning and would have to use the studios before anybody got there.  They would not allow you in class.  You're on your own, you had to do everything on your own.  In fact I remember going to, when Janet [Janet Collins] was rehearsing something, I went to this house or something, I guess they had a little studio there and I remember her rehearsing, but she was by herself as I remember.  Now she was so proficient she did pointe work also and Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo wanted to use her; she was so good.  And they said as long as she lightened her skin, and would lighten her skin, she was about seventeen, and she says, "No, thank you," and left.  And she remembers sitting on the steps and crying because she--see that's what she wanted to do and she refused it, I think it was a very courageous thing to do.  They wanted her, as long as your--you paint your skin.
Story_ID: 352165
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were just talking about--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Janet [Janet Collins] refusing to lighten her skin.
Speaker 1: That's right, and, but, she became--when, most of her work was soloist.  She didn't work with companies, what company was there to work with?  Except Katherine Dunham [Katherine Dunham Company], but she wanted to spread out, she wanted to be a ballet dancer, or more--and at that time you had the contemporary scene, which was very good.  And then she partnered up with Talley Beatty, I don't know when but I know that they changed their names to some Latin name [Ria and Rico de Guerra] and they did this duet, adagio team that was big thing at one time.  You have a adagio teams, where they took these--and I don't know what those names were, I'll try to find out for you--of Latin names so that way they could work any place as long as they had Latin names; interesting, yes? And Talley was gorgeous. (Unclear) Louisiana (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So they could pass for anything--they could be Latino.
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you put--that's the thing.  You change your name, you know, do that kind of thing and they could work.
Speaker 2: I have those names someplace; I'll have to find them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah you'll pro-, yes it's a wonderful story, you know, I mean--
Story_ID: 352166
Speaker 1: I, I'd asked if, if--did Janet [Janet Collins] ever consider going to France and you said no, but was it her sister (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her sister, her younger sister Alma [Alma Collins] went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], specialized French, went to the Sorbonne [University of Paris, Paris, France].  I think her dissertation was on--goodness I'm blanking out, this is terrible, I will remember I promise you--but she was Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society], ended up living in Canada.  She married Caucasian, but she never deliberately went out to pass or anything like that, she just didn't say anything.  So--
Speaker 1: Now did, just ironically did she end up in the same part of Canada that your [maternal] grandfather [Charles Grenot]--?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't think so, she was in Toronto [Canada] or something like that.  I'm not sure where that, where that part of the world was, but I don't think it's there--it might be, I don't know.  I really don't know.
Story_ID: 352167
Speaker 1: So let's talk about starting school, first grade.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your earliest memories of school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Vernon City Grammar School [Vernon City Elementary School, Vernon, California].  I loved that little school because it was like a hacienda, it was with a tile roof, and it had a little, it was in the shape of a C like that, and in the middle was a little grassy area.  And you had a--I remember that first room was the kindergarten and then there was a nice little auditorium and the other school--the other, you know, that other rooms were on the side.  And it was a very light area with pepper trees, big pepper trees, and eucalyptus trees around and maypoles and all that kind of stuff.  I liked that little school very much.  I remember pleasant memories of the school.  I also remember during that time when the war [World War II, WWII] came and all the Japanese kids were taken out of school.  And I remember it was when the Dionne quintuplets were (unclear) and they had these quintuplet dolls, they had to give away their dolls, they gave them to the school.  The children could not take their dolls.  And I remember saying, "Why, why?" to this day I don't know why--because they thought they were going to put messages in them--I, you know, it was just--I still can't, that was--I remember that so clearly I said, why they couldn't take their dolls to the camps.  So they were generous enough, these kids, to give their dolls to the school.  It was heartbreaking.  And that's--it's so funny I associate that school with that, that time period you know, and of course I learned my first dance there, too; it was a Mexican hat dance (laughter).  I learned to do the Mexican hat dance, and we had our little folk dancing.
Speaker 1: Was that your very first dance?
Speaker 2: Yep, I think that was my very first dance.
Speaker 1: Okay I'm going to have to make a note of that.
Speaker 2: We had the Chiapanecas and the (humming), you know.  Yeah that was funny.
Speaker 1: Who taught it to you?
Speaker 2: A teacher, one of the teachers.  I have no idea--
Speaker 1: You remember the teacher's name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I don't remember the teacher's name, but we used to--that was part of your, you know, aside from playing games you'd learn little folk dances and the boys would have to learn a little dance you know.  It was really sweet.  It was great.
Speaker 1: Did it have a big influence on you, you think?  Did you really connect with the Mexican hat dance or just dance at that moment?
Speaker 2: It was just dance.  I loved to dance.  And then we had painting classes.  I remember Mrs. Wilcox [ph.], I remember the lady's name, Wilcox.  Watercolor; and I was constantly painting hollyhocks, don't ask me why (laughter).  Just (demonstrates). But Ms. Wilcox, yeah I remember her.  But it was, it was a nice place.  And I remember there was one teacher that some lunchtimes he would bring out this big can of peanut butter and bread and give the students peanut butter at noontime.  And then you'd go to the nurse's office and get cod liver oil.
Speaker 1: Because there was no free lunch program then, right?
Speaker 2: No, you'd bring your lunch (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, you had to take your lunch.
Speaker 2: --and we were not a wealthy neighborhood, you know, so I guess these people were--I mean we'd get, your nourishment would be, would be cod liver oil, and they gave me cod liver oil, and I'd got to--I'd go and get my dose and be very proud of it.  But it was, it was--I, I loved that little school.
Story_ID: 352168
Speaker 1: Were there any other big influences at the school [Vernon City Elementary School, Vernon, California] besides Mrs. Wilcox [ph.] and the Mexican hat dance teacher?
Speaker 2: And my first little play, I di-, that's when I did my first acting and it was a Christmas play.  I don't remember what the play was about, all I remember that I had to get, bring in this potted poinsettia and somehow forgot it (laughter). And I remember improvising and saying, "Oh, excuse me, I have to go away for a minute," you know, or made some excuse.  Ran out, and got the plant, "I'm here," you know one of those kinds of things--the teacher complimented me on it I must say because it was my first big improv (laughter), it was, run out and get the poinsettia plant.  It was very good, good for me.  You know, but I really have lovely--you know, until they put over the earth, the put the asphalt, all I did was skin my knees you know.  So there went all the knees with the maypoles and the monkey bars, you know, kids falling off the--oh gosh--and I hated that because what I loved was the scent of warm earth.  Did you ever smell warm earth?  It's wonderful.  In California, you know, you had a lot of earth, clear earth, and in the summer--between that and maybe the eucalyptus trees there was this certain fragrance that was there.  And with the asphalt, which had an awful smell, but it was terrible when you wanted to play because when you fell down you really cut yourself up badly.
Story_ID: 352169
Speaker 1: The last question about this school [Vernon City Elementary School, Vernon, California] before we move on.  You talked about the Japanese students, were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was it mainly black and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was mixed, no, it was everything.
Speaker 1: It was everything.  It was everything.
Speaker 2: It was everything.  Mexican, and Japanese and, you know, and a few blacks.  I just remember, mainly--probably mainly Latino 'cause Vernon City [Vernon, California] was a Latino town.  More Latino than anything else.  Very few white people except maybe there was one white family in the neighborhood and they treated them very badly.  You know, Okies, they used to call them; that was the time when they had that influx of those poor people coming from that--oh, the drought and all that kind of stuff.  And they were treated, I remember them being treated not very nicely, you know, and--but they're mainly as I think about it, it was mainly Latino.
Story_ID: 352170
Speaker 1: Junior high school.
Speaker 2: Junior high school, oh boy, it was originally named McKinley [William McKinley Jr. High School] and then they changed it to George Washington Carver [Dr. George Washington Carver Junior High School; George Washington Carver Middle School, Los Angeles, California] that's when I went there, George Washington Carver.  And that's where I first met Alvin Ailey.  You know, going to junior high school is always traumatic I think; you know, I think grammar school is a lot happier because what do you know; you know, you're just busy discovering.  But when you hit that age and things start to change and the competition and all that kind of stuff.  And--I had an okay time in junior high school, it wasn't, it wasn't anything--I think I just was happy to get through it (laughter).  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't--you know, new friends (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But about this time you start to dance, seriously pur-, take dance classes?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's when I sort of started, well I--no, I was about--yeah I was about, let's see I started to take classes outside, but I didn't let anybody know that.  I got classes, but there was a lady named Melissa Blake, and her, her school was on Hollywood [Boulevard] and Highland [Avenue] that's where the Kodak Theatre [Dolby Theatre, Los Angeles, California] was, you know, it's around that area.  And my dad [Leo Paul De Lavallade] would drive me out there every day.  That's another thing daddy did, he would just dri-, he would drive me to my lessons that were way out in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] and pick me up and bring me back, he was amazing, he was just amazing.  There's another story I have to tell you about that.
Speaker 1: Tell me now before you forget.
Speaker 2: Okay, tell you now.  It's when we were younger, on Sundays when he--with the post office and he didn't have a babysitter.  So the movies were the babysitter, so he would put us in the, in the, in the truck--in the mail truck (laughter) and we would hunker down and he'd drop us off at the movie, and, place and the people would watch us and then he'd pick us up after.  So we'd get a couple of double features or whatever, I thought it was very funny.  And that's the kind of guy he was, he had to do what he had to do, bless his heart.
Speaker 1: Well how did you impress upon him that you really wanted to take these dance classes and that they were important enough for him to drive you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because I was jumping around all the time.  I think, like I said, during the summer months my aunts would divvy us up.  I would go to Auntie Annette's [Annette De Lavallade], that was my Auntie Alma's [Alma De Lavallade] sister.  And Yvonne [Yvonne De Lavallade Davis] and Elaine [Elaine De Lavallade Johnson], my sisters Yvonne and Elaine--Yvonne's the eldest, Elaine's the baby--and they would go to Auntie Angelique [ph.] (laughter) and grandmamma [Emma Derivasse De Lavallade].  So Auntie Annette was a pianist.  See a lot of my aunts, Auntie Adele [Adele De Lavallade] and Auntie Annette, wanted to be concert pianists.  Well, you know that arts, forget it, but they were very accomplished pianists and Auntie Annette would sit, and she's a cute little thing--and she'd sit and play her Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] or whatever it was and I'm out on the lawn making a spectacle of myself, flying all over the place I didn't care. I was dancing, I was, you know, I was being like Janet [Janet Collins], so to speak.
Story_ID: 352171
Speaker 1: So I guess they had enough of that so somewhere along the line my Aunt Adele [Adele De Lavallade], I think, found Melissa [Melissa Blake], who was willing to take me.  Now that was very courageous on her part being in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], you know, a Caucasian teacher and a girl of color to go--I think that was, that was really--
Speaker 2: Crossed the lines.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that was really very neat, you know.  I remember having the first recital with Melissa--
Speaker 2: Was Melissa your very first teacher (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Melissa Blake.  Yeah, yeah, formal teacher, yes.
Speaker 2: You remember your recital?
Speaker 1: Yep, and I remember doing a dervish dance, I remember the costume; it was a turn, turn, turn, turn.  And then there was another little, little, I don't know, something, I remember wearing a red, silk, kimono-like little costume; short, which I will tell you about later which is really very funny in high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California].  And, so, like I said, junior high [Dr. George Washington Carver Junior High School; George Washington Carver Middle School, Los Angeles, California] was not that, you know with all the crazy things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well let me ask you one question--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --about Melissa before we move on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 2: Did she encourage or discourage you?
Speaker 1: Encourage, encourage.  She was kind of gruff.
Speaker 2: Were you the only girl of color in the class?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And--
Speaker 2: And was the technique ballet or modern?
Speaker 1: You see, I think that a lot of people didn't know what I was, you know, and I'm kind of somewhere in the middle where they're not--
Speaker 2: It was hard to tell.
Speaker 1: It's hard to tell.  You certainly couldn't tell from daddy [Leo Paul De Lavallade], either.  But they, I don't know what, what flack she might of gotten or anything but she was very kind, she was very good.
Speaker 2: What technique did she teach you?
Speaker 1: It's modern--it was modern and ballet so I was doing kind of a bit of both.
Speaker 2: But is that where you learned the ballet terms for the first time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: What are they, what are some of them?
Speaker 1: Oh the plies, and the battements, and all-the seconde and all that kind of stuff, yeah, yeah.  No, she was very kind, little store front classroom.
Speaker 2: Now was she just a white woman, or was she Russian, or--?
Speaker 1: I think Russian-Jewish.  I think they were the ones that really accepted people, that would let you in.
Speaker 2: Okay, so from--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --so there you go once a week or on Saturdays?
Speaker 1: Yeah, about once a week or something like that.  Yeah, and, or I would go on the--what do call--streetcar, they call them the streetcar and it would take me a long time to get out there.
Speaker 2: Well how did it feel to put on the tights and the slippers and--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was fine, and, you know, I remember Janet [Janet Collins] taking me to get my shoes when she was there she told me where to go.  Capezio [Capezio Ballet Makers, Inc.], was still there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Capezio's (laughter).
Speaker 1: Capezio was still there, but the real Capezios were still there.  And so that was all very exciting, you know the first class.
Speaker 2: Were you; were they teaching you pointe at that time or no, it's too young?
Speaker 1: Well no, I didn't get to the pointe work until later.
Speaker 2: Okay, so Melissa taught you the basics.  First position, second position.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.  All that, and then the modern things, too.  Even in the--on the recital, some people who were able to do pointe work would do it, but we would do the little modern things, where you were at the time, you know.  I was about, what was I, about thirteen or fourteen at the time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you were fourteen at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about fourteen, or something--
Story_ID: 352172
Speaker 1: So then you move into high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now that's, Thomas Jefferson High School [Los Angeles, California].  Lot of people went to Thomas Jefferson High School, it's quite a history there.  I mean, you might be able to look it up because I think--wasn't Jesse Owens--some of those runners--very fine athletic, particularly track, they would win practically every year.  They would, oh my gosh, they were wonderful, every year.
Speaker 1: Did you have a boyfriend in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh you know that's when everybody's looking.  But I was busy trying to be a, you know, do my dancing.  Oh yeah, but there was this one guy, Lowell Brenson [ph.], I loved Lowell Brenson.  He was the handsomest guy in cla-, one of the handsome, there were other handsome young men--and the guy that I went out with was, oh my gosh, (laughter) show you how much he impressed me (laughter).  Anyway, the, the, and prom or something like that--I remember I was going out with somebody else--and my girlfriend, Effie Buggs [ph.], Effie was short and round and very dark.  And I loved Effie, my sisters and I loved Effie, and Effie didn't get a date.  And we said--my sister, Yvonne [Yvonne De Lavallade Davis], and I said, "We're not going to the prom unless Effie goes."  Well, those guys were jumping and carrying on running around trying to find someone for Effie.  And Lowell said, "I'll take her."  And (unclear) he was always, it was so sweet, he was just adorable, such a gentleman, you know.  The name's coming, but I thought that was really kind of fun.  But Alvin Ailey was in the school at that time.  He was in junior high school at--oh, my stomach's growling--at, was at, Carver Junior High School [Dr. George Washington Carver Junior High School; George Washington Carver Middle School, Los Angeles, California] also, that's where we first met, (unclear) Spanish major.  And we didn't get to really know--'cause he was always, you know, doing his thing or whatever--but when we went to high school he was in the gymnastics--gym, and I remember seeing him.  And they were doing the free exercise, you know the slow things, it was a little different than it is now but it was more like dancing then from what I remember.  But I thought he was just marvelous and I told him, "Oh Alvin, you ought to dance."  You know, and I finally kind of dragged him, by that time I had gotten a scholarship with Lester Horton around that time, toward the end of my--before graduation.
Speaker 1: Who introduced you to Lester?
Speaker 2: My Aunt Adele [Adele De Lavallade].  Who is very good at this.  And Lester Horton was at that time, I never knew who he was, but he was very popular in the modern, modern--contemporary dance.  And they were just starting a theater [Lester Horton Dance Theater] on Melrose [Avenue], 7566 Melrose they had a studio but they were moving to this theater.  So I went and auditioned, and got in and got my scholarship.
Speaker 1: What was your audition piece?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: It wasn't an audition--it was like they would audition you, to see if you could physically do everything.  But of course I was--had had my classes with Melissa [Melissa Blake] so I was a little ahead of the game on certain things.  You know, they didn't do the ballet they just did contemporary, and then I, so I got in but that meant I had to go all the way from East L.A. [East Los Angeles, California] back up to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].  On the busses this time (laughter).  And I'd take bus--Jefferson to--I took about three busses.
Story_ID: 352173
Speaker 1: Now at this time were you doing it [dance] for fun, or you thought I am going to be like Janet [Janet Collins] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I always--I was going to be--I must say I was, you know, really intent on that and I, and I--I guess it frustrated some of the guys 'cause I wouldn't go out.  You know I was busy doing my work, I was considered rather uppity, I wasn't, but I; but all that kind of stuff.  And, but, you know I would go to some of the games and all the things like that--O.C. Smith, was my classmate.  I loved O.C., oh my gosh, he was such a rascal.  You remember O.C. Smith, the singer?  And O.C. had that big voice of O.C.'s, and he was very naughty.  During the--some of the assemblies we'd have to say the flag, you know do the flag, and he'd say out loud then all of a sudden, "And liberty, and justice for some, Amen."  And we'd--and the teacher would you'd hear this voice just (making sound) and he had this giggle that was infectious and the teacher would come up looking to see who was, you know, doing this and he'd do it every time, he was just--he was a rascal, that--too sweet.
Story_ID: 352174
Speaker 1: But, this is the story about that red costume (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Red.
Speaker 1: All right, we had--toward the end, before graduation we had this, this assembly [at Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California].  There was this wonderful guy named Ronald Gaffney.  Ronald (laughter) was, well he wanted to be in the theater and dancing and he was rather iffy, the kids used to tease him all the time but I liked Ron, Rodney, and he decided that we were going to do a dance together.  And we've got the, some--what is that--'Scheherazade,' Rimsky-Korsakov [Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov], 'Scheherazade,' this one whole thing I don't know, it's a big, long piece.  And we decided to do this duet, this guy comes and I'm there and I kill him and he falls--you know all that and very dramatic thing (laughter) and I put that, that kimono costume on and my hair was out, my hair was down to my behind there, you know, very full--I never wore my hair out by the way, I wouldn't wear my hair out because I'd get razzed about it, so I never put my hair loose, very rarely, if ever.  And, but anyway I put my hair out, and we did this piece, and I put that red thing on and the kids just went crazy--they're still talking about it today--and Ronald and I are just going, and he (laughter), we took the curtains and draped them and made ourselves a little set with the--it was one levels, you know, and all that kind of stuff and I got up there and I stabbed him and he fell down.  And well, we had the best time and the kids went crazy they had never seen--I was just using whatever technique that I had to do this you know and--it was--it was great.
Speaker 2: They'd never seen sort of ballet, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Alvin [Alvin Ailey] talked about it all--no not anything like that--Alvin talked about it all the time.
Story_ID: 352175
Speaker 1: What was he doing during that time that you were at Lester's [Lester Horton Dance Theater]?  Once you got the scholarship, did he continue to dance with you?  Did you see him often (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he used to, in his b-, I think he used to come there and watch all the time until Lester [Lester Horton] said, "Are you gonna sit there, or you gonna come and work?"  You know he would come, but Alvin [Alvin Ailey] was a--he would disappear on us all the time, you know, he was an odd guy and he--I don't know why--he went up to San Francisco [California] we were expecting him to do one piece, one concert and he just disappeared; we used to work on the weekends, you know, Friday and Saturday night performances.  So when I got through with school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California], when I graduated, my Aunt Adele [Adele De Lavallade] insisted I take two years of college, you know, so I went to LACC [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California], and while I was there I was still working at Lester's, so I was up at six [o'clock] in the morning and go to Lester's and go to school and then go to Lester's, and I worked all the time, all the time.  I was there seven days a week, I just did it seven days a week.  I was totally obsessed with it, I mean it was just something I just took, you know that I--I didn't think about it.
Speaker 1: What was Lester's feedback?  What would he say to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was, he was a wonderful mentor and he really knew how to get the best out of people, he's very inventive is how he would get the best from you--that's the best way I can say it--is that his technique was very broad and big and very difficult to do and--but, but, airy and full and has a lot of vitality and was always exciting, the classes were always exciting.  And Bella Lewitzky, who was my--his lead dancer, I used watch the company all the time.  So, I would learn by watching their rehearsing, how they rehearsed, how they got to their characters because at that time mainly dancing was literal, story-based, where now a lot of--most of the dancing is rather abstract in form, you know, and I'm used to the story-based, during that time all ballets were stories.  And he would--he would trust you, he would guide you-- he was more like a director, and he was constantly changing the technique and constantly changing his ballets, even the classwork, if he were thinking or working on another piece, different piece, your classwork would change.  So it was never stagnant you know, he was a wonderful man and he had no prejudices whatsoever--he was, he was a curious person.  He taught you about music, he taught you about people in other countries, he taught you about painting.  We would have classes where you would do paper sculpture and wire sculpture and relate it to movement and-- I remember when I first went there and the 'Salome' [Lester Horton], Bella danced, well it was all, the music was percussive, percussion, the drums, and bells and all that.  And I remember I played a pot of screws (laughter).  I shook a pot of screws and a zither and a rattle on a zither, and I'm sitting there playing this--and eventually I danced the role of Salome when Bella left.  So that's--and what was so wonderful about that is when she left she taught me the role, but Lester changed some things because she was a very small woman, she was very much on the--like Janet [Janet Collins]--small, tiny, wiry kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was she Russian?
Speaker 2: No, but Lewitzky, I don't know where Bella--I think she was American, but Jewish background and probably Russian-Jewish, you know. But, Lester changed it because I was much taller, different shape, he said, you know, some things are not going to be right, you cannot do what Bella can do in some things and she cannot do what you can do.  So there are some things everybody is able to do and there are other things that are not just lengthwise so he would change it to suit me--
Speaker 1: Now did--
Speaker 2: --he did that with everybody.
Story_ID: 352176
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, did they split because she [Bella Lewitzky], did she give his name when they test-, when she testified before--
Speaker 2: I don't think so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the Un-American Committee [House Un-American Activities Committee]?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, I think she just wanted to--my understanding was--that she wanted more, they wanted to be more politically based, you know, all that--
Speaker 1: She did or he did?
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: She did.
Speaker 2: They felt that they wanted to do pieces that were more what's going on in the world and blah, blah, blah.  Lester [Lester Horton] just wanted to make dances (laughter), and I think that was a--you know he was not, he was not political in the sense that he would, you know, do things that would--that were politically or unp-, uncorrect, or whatever you want to call it.
Speaker 1: I know you were a teenager but were you aware of McCarthyism what was going on--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and that she would have to testify?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was really very ugly, well I think she had left by that time, it was very ugly time and we just went on--I don't know how he did it, I really don't because he didn't get involved in that.  But, his thing is that when she left [at Lester Horton Dance Theater], the whole company began changing.  There were--a Japanese girl came in, you know; I was in there and then James Truitte came in.  The people, I remember he had a coup-, two of the girls from Harlem--Harlem, I mean from Watts [Los Angeles, California] area--
Speaker 1: Watts.
Speaker 2: --yeah, way out there.  Esther [ph.], and I can't remember the other girl's name, they would come all the way there.  In fact there were times when we'd work late at nights he'd send them home in a cab, he was very generous that way, he had no problem.  This was really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you think she had a problem?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I really don't know.  But I know the look of the company changed it was all mixed up, we were totally mixed up there it was great, it was really--and that was due to him.
Story_ID: 352177
Speaker 1: The question I was asking, we were talking about Lester [Lester Horton], and we were talking about the technique [Lester Horton Technique] he was developing with Bella [Bella Lewitzky] and you said it was just--he was using her instrument--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and whatever was coming out.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you take it up from there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well when she left, then he continued evolving whatever he wanted to do physically.
Speaker 1: Using you.
Speaker 2: Using me and there was Joyce Trisler, there was James Truitte, but I had been there the longest because I was in with the ot-, the older company [Lester Horton Dance Theater], which by the way had, obviously, Rudy Gernreich, that was before he was the big--the big designer, adored him, very bright, very sweet.
Speaker 1: Was he a good dancer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very odd kind of dancer, but he was from Germany [sic.].  In fact, his family I think they had a not a very good time in Germany, I think there were some of his friends were in the concentration camp.  But his designs became just--in fact I had a couple of his things, and the early things, I don't know where they are, I have them pushed away someplace.  But he was magnificent and I remember hi-, choreographically he was very bright and he did one, I remember one piece that he did, it was- and here's where you can do political things without being political.  He had a platform, one, two, three platform.  One person sitting on the top, then there was a middle person, and then there was a person on the bottom chained down there, and somehow at the very end--and I remember there was an apple, somebody eating, but by the end it was the person on the chain that was on top and the top was on the bottom without standing, I can't even remember; I remember, you know, the idea and I thought God, it was the best thing; I can't remember how he got there or anything, I just remember it was just wonderful.  So it's that kind of creativity that was going on in that school.
Story_ID: 352178
Speaker 1: Where would you say that his, Lester's [Lester Horton], influences are still hanging on?  Where would you see his work still (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, Alvin [Alvin Ailey] and Joyce Trisler were the ones who were the most ex-, because they eventually had a company.  I never had a company.  So they had companies and Joyce Trisler, all her company [Joyce Trisler Danscompany] members were trained Horton because she was teaching.  Alvin had Joyce teach also the company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] he taught--and by the way, we had performances every Friday and Saturday night, every year there's a new performance, the school we never had mirrors, there were no mirrors, the classroom was the stage.  You see, it wasn't a (unclear)--it was a real little theater but no mirrors, we had to do without mirrors, which I, I liked to do, you know he wanted you to sense yourself and you were--you had to know when you were off, I mean, I don't know how he did it, you know, I liked it that way.  But--where were we--that kind of training, see Lester's kind of training was very, very valuable.  We learned really who we were, we weren't dependent on mirrors or anything, and we had those performances every weekend.
Speaker 1: And you kind of were storytelling with your body (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You can't beat that.  It was like being in a school and then going and, and having, you know, you finally get your audition, you get in the company, it's like starting all over.  We were constantly working, teaching and learning new things and performing them on the weekends, it was absolutely invaluable and then going to Carmelita, you know, being, Lester sent me my first ballet--my other ballet teacher--Carmelita Maracci a very great, great, great dancer.  They were friends together but they both taught like directors.  You know, they gave you a reason to do what you doing, it wasn't just counting, it was a reason to, like Carmelita would say, you'd do those ronds de jambes where you--leg, she said, "Well it comes from kicking a skirt, you kick the skirt and you get the idea," oh yeah, I kick a skirt th-, leg goes exactly where it's going, where it's supposed to go.  Or Lester when he would give you a movement and you're all kind of in a little whatever is (unclear), it's like being in a box or you pop out of the box or you feel this or (unclear), so you were just not counting things, see it became something more, you're almost like an actor that was moving more.
Speaker 1: So would you say Lester was more about storytelling or was he becoming abstract with dance?
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't say abstract.  Well at that time, like I said, it was storytelling.
Speaker 1: It was all storytelling.  Which is kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, but physically it was very broad and--I remember when I did 'Salome' [Lester Horton], I remember--I don't know how in the world I did it--it was three levels, it was one, another level, so yeah about this high, and another level here and then smaller and I would stand on the top and hinge all the way back until my body was over, from here and I had my arms down here and roll down and then up and down, it's like those slinkies. I remember terrified when I was learning that thing but I did it, and it was really chancy, chancy things and you just did them you just did--well, that's what we have to do--and materials, lots of materials, handling materials and props and all kinds of things, that's a great education.
Speaker 1: Which is probably one of the reasons 'Revelations' [Alvin Ailey] has lasted so long because it's good storytelling.
Speaker 2: It's story--and it's right out of the Lester Horton Technique, every bit of that, I can sit and look at it and know exactly where every step came from. And it's done brilliantly I think, you know, Alvin just turned it out--but the technique, if I broke it down I know where it all came from.
Story_ID: 352179
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you--was 'Salome' [Lester Horton] your first lead dance with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes, first lead, yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell me about the breakup and then tell me how he, how you replaced her.
Speaker 2: Well, when the breakup came as I said it was not a nice time, you know I sensed, I didn't get involved with it cause I was one of the students or whatever and they were looking for somebody and Lester [Lester Horton] wanted me to do the 'Salome' and evidently there was a young lady that was with the company [Lester Horton Dance Theater]--I don't want to mention her name--her mother went into a fury and I think as mu-, and I think she made a remark about, a slight racial remark, about that native going, you know, into that, 'cause she wanted her daughter who was in there to be in 'Salome' and Lester wanted me to be in 'Salome.'  And I didn't know those things I just went on about my business I was very happy to do the role and they didn't think I could do it, they just said, "Oh dear," and--
Speaker 1: Did he think you could do it?
Speaker 2: Obviously.  Is that--when Bella [Bella Lewitzky] taught it to me and then all of a sudden I just did what I had to do and everybody was knocked out; they couldn't believe that I did that. I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you make it your own?
Speaker 2: Instinct.  I mean I just found, you know I, I did what I thought I had t-, I don't know why and they just said, "Oh my goodness," I was very precocious or whatever, I sa-, I don't--I don't know, I was just, for some reason I took to it like duck to water you know that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Is it the "Dance of the Seven Bells" [sic. "Dance of the Seven Veils"] is that in that song?
Speaker 2: Well it is, but he had, it was the dance with the, that had, that held the head of John the Baptist.  So it had this, it was like twelve yards long.  Twelve yards that I had to swing around and it had--
Speaker 1: Twelve yards of fabric?
Speaker 2: Yep, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, there's the revelation in the water (laughter).
Speaker 2: All that kind of stuff and it had these red handprints on it like bloody hands you know, Bella did that, and I, that was part of the--so you had to learn all that and the levels, you were never on a flat floor, it was on levels, ramps, and the way that you learned it, as we learned from Bella, he would make you close your eyes and feel the, the ramps, the different levels, and then you open your eyes and you keep looking at what you're doing, but you, all your peripheral vision is catching all the things and it was just like walking on the floor.
Speaker 1: But I've heard dancers complain about those raked floors at City Center [New York City Center, New York, New York], like they really are hard on your body.
Speaker 2: Yes, they are, they are.
Speaker 1: Okay so you take over that role and you're successful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and so I, I in essence became you know the lead dancer and, you know, then the others were there with Jimmy.  Jimmy Truitte [James Truitte] and Joyce Trisler and, you know, we had a great group of--and then we had the young ones like with Lelia Goldoni and Vida Solomon, things like that, you know--
Story_ID: 352180
Speaker 1: Now when he sends you to study with her [Carmelita Maracci] is it because he thinks he's taught you everything he can?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He told me that, "She can give you what I can't."
Speaker 1: Which was?
Speaker 2: Ballet.  Evidently he saw a need for it, he saw--you know, and they were great friends and so it was kind of a, I guess it was--and one of her dancers came to--it was a like a little, you know, switch there.  And we became very good friends--we became very good friends.  And she was stern, but she was a great musician, too and I learned to appreciate, she, she in her classes there she would play, have Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] and Schubert [Franz Schubert] and  Schumann [Robert Schumann], and you know great composers and she was so, there times when she would hum it herself if the pianist didn't play it the way she would like it, she would hum it, "Don't play it, Nino [ph.], I'll hum."  But you learned discipline from both of them, Lester [Lester Horton] was a little freer, and she was a little more strict, but it was--those two things together were just magical.
Story_ID: 352181
Speaker 1: And okay so they can prepare you for the creative side and to work the instrument.  Who was preparing you for the business side to get a job when you're done?
Speaker 2: Never entered my mind, isn't that funny?  I don't think you--today it's a business and you can make a living out of it.  In those days nobody wanted you to go into the theater, there was no money--there was no money.  I mean if you--did you see the film 'Ballets Russes,' the 'Ballets Russes'?  Oh you have to see that.  That whole company, they, it was amazing.  They had trains, it was Sol Hurok.  See that was a whole, you know, impresario, which you don't have anymore.  They didn't--they didn't care whether they got paid or not, they just wanted to dance.  It was to a one, it was amazing, I kept thinking, you know, we never thought about it, we just wanted to do that.  And it was well, of course, for Lester [Lester Horton] when you have a company [Lester Horton Dance Theater] and stuff like that you'd better have some business sense, he did have somebody to help take care of it.  Oh goodness, sorry, my--
Speaker 1: It's okay.
Speaker 2: He got, had somebody to do it, but it, it was very difficult to keep a company everybody (laughter)--Lester unfortunately had most of the people on scholarship (laughter); he couldn't say no, trying to make money--you have to make money--but he would have a lot of people on scholarship.  He was such a generous soul, you know.  Great teacher, great human being.  I really, I got to get a copy of that for you to see what that was because it will explain a lot about him and what the world was like at that time, and you know at that time the McCarthy [Joseph McCarthy] period--there we were at 7566 Melrose Avenue [Los Angeles, California], with an interracial company in the 1950 whatever in Hollywood, California, amazing.  And there we were, and nobody really bothered us because I have a feeling they think, oh dancers, what use are we, you know, we're--dancers are always low man on the totem pole anyway, they don't take us seriously, they really don't, never have, and so I think they kind of dismissed us--unless you were maybe like Bella [Bella Lewitzky], who was much more--.  And I remember during the film--because a lot of people, that was when Hollywood was really musicals and all that--it was terrible, wonderful people were thrown out of work, it was just awful, it was a nightmare.  But we were a little company that's, everybody knew that company.
Speaker 1: So were there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Somehow, it's really rather interesting I used to think, I said, I don't know how we got through that.
Story_ID: 352182
Speaker 1: And I don't know what happened, he would ne-, Lester [Lester Horton] would never tell us if anything was wrong, he would never do that.  But he was, something was going on because I think after with that split from Bella [Bella Lewitzky], I think that's when his health began going way down the tubes and his heart--
Speaker 2: And what happened to him?  When did he--?
Speaker 1: He had a heart attack.
Speaker 2: He had a heart attack.  And who took over the company [Lester Horton Dance Theater]?  What became of the company (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, Frank Eng, who was the business manager, took over the company and well--I th-, because I think Frank was not an artistic person he was, he was a, wrote for one of the newspapers at one time and then gave that up and stayed to work with the company because he liked the company and he had his idea on how it should run and it didn't work out too well, I mean for me particularly.  I mean we--when Lester died we all held onto our responsibilities--it was a horrible time, it really was--and Alvin [Alvin Ailey] was brought in--we didn't know what we were doing, we really didn't--but I think with the training that we had we did in a way know what we were doing.  And I'm sure for any kind of thing, when the head leaves it's always an upheaval.  And at that time, I do believe my aunt [Adele De Lavallade], she never told me this, that Lester was thinking that it was time for me to leave anyway, he wanted to see me, he wanted to give me my wings, that is generosity.  Because he feels--felt, I suppose, that I should go to the next level you know.  And I think that is very generous-that is very generous.  And I was never told those things, I learned that later.
Story_ID: 352183
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the next level?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: If you left Lester [Lester Horton Dance Theater], what's next (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know, see I wouldn't even have known, I wouldn't know how that was going to take place.
Speaker 1: But where did you go?
Speaker 2: But, but, but, well what happened was fate took over, Lester [Lester Horton] passed away.  And when we--that last year of Lester's life when we had taken a cross country trip to Jacob's Pillow [Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival] in New York [sic. Becket, Massachusetts] for the first time and I did the audition--I did audition for 'House of Flowers,' but how did that happen?  Oh dear, or was it my sister, Yvonne [Yvonne De Lavallade Davis], that auditioned?  We might've both auditioned, I think, but Yvonne auditioned--but when we came back I made, I tell you what, 'Carmen Jones,' the movie 'Carmen Jones.'  Herbert Ross was the choreographer, he came in.
Speaker 1: How had you met Her-, how did you--you'd met him before though, right?
Speaker 2: That was the first time I met Herbert Ross--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --okay.
Speaker 1: He came in--
Speaker 2: He came in and I got the audition, you know did the audition and got the film.  And when he went back to New York [New York], there was a big change in 'House of Flowers.'  They, they, the director--oh, you should have the, who was it, Paul, Peter, Peter Hall [sic. Peter Brook], and Balanchine [George Balanchine] was choreographing--they were ousted, anyway, everybody was out and they wanted to get another director in and Herbie came and took over the directorship and he sent for Alvin [Alvin Ailey] and myself, that's how that happened.  God took care of it I didn't.  You know, and that's when Janet [Janet Collins] said "Go," and she called Saint [Saint Subber]--and we got the job, and there I went off to New York.
Story_ID: 352184
Speaker 1: And that was the first time you'd come to New York [New York] to live.
Speaker 2: To live, yes, and Janet [Janet Collins] helped me out with that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so, so let's go back and you talk to me about the filming of 'Carmen Jones'--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --being on set, working with the ac-, yeah--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, with Dorothy, Dorothy Dandridge and my cousins, the Collins, knew each other, so those girls all knew each other. When I auditioned (laughter) we were the concert group, it was Jimmy [James Truitte], myself and Alvin [Alvin Ailey], we went to do this call, open call and we were the concert people coming into audition and Herbie [Herbert Ross] told me later, he said, he says, he told me, he says, "You certainly are square," (laughter) and I said, "Yes, I know," (laughter). He was very sweet and I finally got the aud-, but the scary part was after the audition, it was on one of those big sound stages, and I was wal-, let's see how is that, I was walking ahead or maybe in the middle, Herbie was here maybe I was here, and Mr. Preminger [Otto Preminger] came and I heard this voice that said, "Mr. Ross," and he turned around, I remember turning around and Mr. Preminger says, "You are going to use Ms. Lavallade [HistoryMaker Carmen De Lavallade], aren't you?" And I thought, there goes my job because what had happened was I had done the reading for Carmen Jones, not that I could do it by any stretch of the imagination, all I did not, not--did an okay job.  And I had met him in that aspects but then I tried out for the dance thing but I just hear that voice booming across the sound stage and I thought my gosh that sounds terrible like I had a tryst with the man or something like that, you know (laughter).  But he gave me the job and I did a very good job, and which was rather sweet, and so that's how I got my job in 'House of Flowers' [sic.], and Alvin.  And it was just one of those quirky things.
Story_ID: 352185
Speaker 1: Did you find that you were being cast as, as any sort of ethnic type?  Or just a--what, how were you being used (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, you know I never really thought about th-, maybe it's because of my dad [Leo Paul De Lavallade] or something, so I never--.  I guess I tried not think of it, I just tried to keep my eye on what it was and never made a thing about it, you know.  You know who--James Edwards, the actor?  I did my reading with James Edwards, and I remember when we were doing, [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll came in, and she had her audition and Diahann couldn't remember her lines or anything, but she got the role of the other girl, and I remember when I was going through mine, we were--James and I were going through the--oh, he was wonderful, wonderful teacher, too--and we were going through the scene and Mr. Preminger [Otto Preminger] came in and he walked in, and somehow I just felt, just keep going, and he sat down and put his feet upon the table and crossed his legs and he just looked like that and we just kept going, kept going, kept going and we went through the whole scene and James was so pleased, he said, "We did it."  And I think that pleased Mr. Preminger to a point, I don't think, you know at that time I was an actress of any--but he had always been kind to me, Mr. Preminger.  Socially he was a wonderful man, but when you had to work with him ooh, he was a martinet, well he's a director, I mean he had to get the job done, you know.  And then Dorothy [Dorothy Dandridge] on the set was--I sort of stood in for Dorothy whenever he had to have somebody stand in for the lighting or something like that. But she was very kind and very sweet, and it was a very difficult position to be in you know because that, that was really--imagine, she was very beautiful and to be in that position, in that role, lead role, and she was very shy; she didn't speak very much.  And sometimes people think that she was ups-, uppity--I know those kinds of things--she wasn't uppity, she had her work to do and she was probably frightened, I would be.  You know and I understand that she and Preminger had a little fling or something like that, that's hard, that's very difficult.  But I thought she did, I look at that film ['Carmen Jones'], and I thought she did an excellent, excellent job, really excellent job.  She could've been a really fine actress if she had the chance.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: If tragedy hadn't struck.
Story_ID: 352186
Speaker 1: And then 'House of Flowers.'
Speaker 2: That was a mad time, yeah, that was something--of course I met [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder there--well, that was fascinating, I mean to walk into a place and you meet Harold Arlen and Truman Capote and Pearl Bailey, bless her heart and you know, I had never been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was Truman Capote doing there?
Speaker 2: He wrote the, it was based on one of his little short stories.
Speaker 1: Which--okay.
Speaker 2: "House of Flowers" [Truman Capote] I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I forget the name of the whole book ['Breakfast at Tiffany's,' Truman Capote].  But, oh he was--poor thing--they locked him in the hotel room and wouldn't let him out until he finished the script or something like that, it was very funny.  And Harold Arlen was, what a great guy, and Jerry Arlen, was his brother, was the conductor, wonderful family, what a--
Speaker 1: Pearl Bailey?
Speaker 2: Pearl Bailey--Pearl Bailey was, you know, not the easiest person to work with 'cause she's very strict, extremely strict and; but we got along fine, we got along just fine.  And we had, now all the dancers would lose--.  There were all the choreographers [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell was there, [HistoryMaker] Louis Johnson, Walter Nicks of course Alvin [Alvin Ailey] finally got there, it was [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle, I mean everybody, every choreographer that came years later was in that, was in that company. They all had companies out of that, you know, and eventually I just guested with all their companies; you know, if somebody had a concert you'd go and work with that person.  So there were times when I was with three people at one time (laughter).
Speaker 1: So there was no desire on your behalf to have your own company?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  I-- in fact, I'd never been in that kind of, I'd been from a concert world and I must say I was not very nicely accepted (laughter).  I was on the stage--I have to tell this story--I was on the stage and Alvin and I were standing there and--Jolie [ph.]--Jolie--I mean,  Herbert Ross introduced us to the company and they looked at us and turned their backs and walked off, and there we were I thought, well, there it is.  So I, you know, I just kept my mouth shut and Geoffrey was, you know, busy chasing after me anyway, but he was a good protector of Alvin and myself actually.  And, but you know you just have to--.  I could understand it because they had been working for a while you know, they had gone through the--.  And they had this big change and then Alvin and I come in and we get a special number.  Now I can understand that, so I just politely stepped out the way, did my work and tried to not have the feeling that I was uppity or something like that and worked hard, I remember I understudied and I remember there--when illness goes through a company I was doing three parts you know and I went in there and did it because I was from the Lester Horton Dance Theater, my dear, and we did everything, you know, including cleaning the place.
Speaker 1: And lights, and scenery, sound (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everything, the whole thing.  So it's nothing to me if you have to step in, you step in, and after a while they kind of loosened up on, on me.
Story_ID: 352187
Speaker 1: I mean at this time you're making money, you've become a professional dancer.  What did your father [Leo Paul De Lavallade] think about it?  What did--what was Aunt May [May Grenot] (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, daddy never--Aunt Adele [Adele De Lavallade].
Speaker 1: Aunt Adele?
Speaker 2: They had no problems, see they never had any problem with my being in theater at all, you know, because I guess Janet [Janet Collins] was in there, and they were very pleased.  They were very, very pleased.  And out of that, being in New York [New York], then you're with all the--this was the dance capital, you see, and I had done my debut with the Horton company [Lester Horton Dance Theater] that last year and I actually had danced 'Salome' [Lester Horton] and another ballet called 'Yerma' and got wonderful reviews and whatnot and it was the time--
Speaker 1: What was that ballet?
Speaker 2: 'Yerma,' Garcia Lorca's [Federico Garcia Lorca], 'Yerma.'  And, and unfortunately--poor Lester, he had the worst luck in that way because here he brings the company, everybody heard about this company and Lester Horton, and we get there and there was a newspaper strike, a newspaper strike, and so you didn't get the people as much as you wanted to.  That was the sad part, you know we drove all the way across the coun-, and a newspaper strike.
Speaker 1: So just to go back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think that was very unhappy for him, yeah.
Story_ID: 352188
Speaker 1: Just to go back because we're talking about Lester [Lester Horton].  So when Lester dies, Alvin Ailey actually takes over kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As choreographer, yes.
Speaker 1: As choreographer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Then how long does the company [Lester Horton Dance Theater] last before everybody--
Speaker 2: Alvin and I left?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Maybe a year or so--
Speaker 1: A year. So then, then--
Speaker 2: --because I remember we went back to Jacob's Pillow [Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Becket, Massachusetts], you know, took another trip across the country and I think that was the last time we did that.  And then the company continued going, Alvin and I left that was a big, Frank [Frank Eng] was very unhappy about that.  But it was, in a way it was good because I would be, you would be--and I don't think Lester wanted, if you studied, he wants you to take what you get and go out and, you know, and to experience and use it; not just to stay there and then all of a sudden you're teaching, sending other people, I mean it makes no sense.
Speaker 1: So of the three films, which would come first? 'Carmen Jones,' or 'Demetrius and the Gladiator' ['Demetrius and the Gladiators'], and then there's 'The Egyptian' and then there's one about Abbott and Costello [William "Budd" Abbott and Lou Costello] and--
Speaker 2: Oh, I think the 'Abbott and Costello' ['Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'].  Oh gosh, and I did my little kind of oriental--wasn't that funny, I just loved it. Oh I love those old--those old sounds, there's a smell that they have that's just unique.
Speaker 1: What is the smell?
Speaker 2: I don't know what it is, old coffee (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sawdust (laughter)?  Old coffee.
Speaker 2: You know, it's something, you know, and they're kind of damp and they're kind of--but there's something magical about those places.
Speaker 1: How did you get the job, that-
Speaker 2: Lester.  Lester choreographed Maria Montez and people, he would do choreographies for films and we did one with the golden eagle I think to, and all that.  So anything before Lester's death would be the first, you know, film-wise.  I think it was maybe 'Carmen Jones' was after Lester died.
Speaker 1: And then there was 'The Egyptian.'
Speaker 2: I think 'Carmen Jones' was before Lester died. I b-, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he got to see you in that.
Speaker 2: I think he did.  I'd have to look at the dates, I can't--because I think Lester died in '53 [1953] I think or '54 [1954] or something like that.  I'd have to check that--isn't that awful because my life goes so fast (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I have dates but you, never know if my dates are--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm sure you probably better.
Speaker 1: We're going to stop here and change tapes.
Speaker 2: You probably have better things than I have--I'm terrible because I don't think of the past, I just keep going.
Story_ID: 352189
Speaker 1: Okay let's clear up the timeline about Lester's [Lester Horton] death--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and your film career.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well when--
Speaker 1: The time, so he died in fifty--
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) three [1953].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that's when I--
Speaker 1: You'd done the one film with him that he'd gotten you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that he choreographed.
Speaker 2: Choreographed the, the, the golden eagle ['Pueblo Eagle Dance'] was there--what was it, the--oh dear--
Speaker 1: 'Costello Meets Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' ['Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Um-hm, um-hm.  And then I, he did one of those summer theaters with Martha Raye, 'Annie Get Your Gun' I think it was, you know that was very exciting, so I kind of assisted him on those kind of things so he began using me as an assistant.
Speaker 1: As an assistant choreographer?
Speaker 2: No, just to help him.
Speaker 1: To help him with, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So then he dies--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but he had already introduced you to the world of film--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so they continue to call you to audition?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I did the, I think it was the 'Carmen Jones' after that and then I did--what is the--oh, 'Lydia Bailey' with Jack Cole, that was an experience.  Now Jack Cole was a magnificent dancer and I loved Jack and everybody was afraid of him (laughter), but he--.  Alvin Ailey was supposed to have danced with me and Alvin got sick, and then Jack Cole decided he was going to take Alvin's place.  Now it took place in Haiti, with a bunch of black people (laughter), and he decided I'm going to make myself, and so he put the tar makeup on, he says, "I'll look Moorish anyway," he had this hawk nose and I thought okay, I don't wanna know what you're going to do with your blue eyes, but anyway.  And so it was very funny that the makeup that we used--cause I was fair-skinned, some were your color, some were my color and some were lighter than I was--so they had to put on this makeup and James Truitte told me, he did the film 'Mighty Joe Young,' and he told me about this makeup they used on him called Negro number two (laughter).  It wasn't one, it was two.  And, I thought he was telling a tale, "So, I'm a specialty, so I get my makeup done, you know, separately."  So I'm sitting there and I see these makeup things and the man went out of the room and I looked over and it said Negro number two, and I thought I would fall out of the chair.  And what happened was they would make you up your face and then you'd have to go to another, you'd have to walk out of this place and walk down the street, you know in the studio, go to another room or something for your body makeup, which--ice cold, and you'd walk down the street and see all these people with all this makeup on, it was just hysterical.  And, then you get on, well what happened was, with our skin it turned a kind of greenish tint (laughter), it wasn't very pretty.  But I look at Jack Cole, and he looked terrific.  Well it was made for Caucasian skin, you know, because we have the greens and the yellows and the purples and all that kind of stuff under your skin, so it changed the color, we looked so funny.  And we got on set we were laughing, and of course Michael Curtiz [sic.], I think he was the director, and he got very annoyed with us laughing all the time.  Jack looked fabulous.
Story_ID: 352190
Speaker 1: It was a wonderful piece, it was very good, and he was, to work with him, duet, oh my goodness, I would talk to Gwen Verdon because she danced with him a lot and it was a terror to work with him, but he was, he was very nice to me.
Speaker 2: Why was it a terror to work with him?
Speaker 1: Because he was like working with a tornado. He's was--he's intense and he means business, and I learned those steps so fast he said next to Gwen Verdon I was the quickest, I was scared to death of the man.  Not only that, he had one eye that kind of was out of focus, and he would look at you and with his hawk nose--.  He was magnificent, I mean a body like a cat and he developed his technique, the Jack Cole technique, was the most difficult technique I've ever danced, it's all in plie, it was all kind of--. I don't know it was a special kind of way of moving that's extremely difficult, and he didn't let you get away with anything, it was very precise.  And I got through the day with Jack Cole and the machetes and the chicken blood--it was tomato juice--and we were laughing all the time on the set [of 'Lydia Bailey'] and Mr. Curtiz [sic. Jean Negulesco] asked, when we looked at ourselves, we thought we looked funny, and Mr. Curtiz asked Mr. Cole, "Will you tell your people to be quiet, please," (laughter), you know.  But I loved Jack, I think he was, I learned a lot from him, discipline, discipline, discipline.  And every once in a while you need that you know; you get complacent, the body gets complacent, so he scared me enough that I really learned very quickly.  We had a drummer named Emanuel Vanderhans, better known as Gaucho.  He was my cousin Janet Collins' drummer when she would do certain concerts.  And Gaucho, Jack told me that Gaucho told him, he said, "Don't you yell at her; you just tell her what to do and she'll do it. If you don't, I'm going to dress your head up with my drum," (laughter).  And he told me that.  Gaucho was my guardian.
Speaker 2: Was Gaucho black?
Speaker 1: He was from Dutch Guiana.  Very brown but he was from the Guianas.  I loved him, but he was like my uncle, he was like my Uncle Gaucho, he would watch out, nobody's going to get near me and if anybody gives me the eye he's going to (gesture), you know.  Which was really great, I could relax.

Speaker 1: So you meet Geoffrey [HistoryMaker Geoffrey Holder]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, and you marry.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And do you co-, decide to collaborate right away, or--?
Speaker 2: No, I think, you see the wonderful thing about Geoffrey is--which very few men would do when they marry someone--he let me do whatever I wanted to do. And he always said, "You were [HistoryMaker] Carmen De Lavallade before you were Mrs. Holder," so he allowed me to do those things so that's why I would not only work with him, I worked with Alvin's [Alvin Ailey] company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater], I would work with [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle's company [Donald McKayle Dance Company], I would work with Sophie Maslow for the Hanukkah festivals, I would work with John Butler, I would work with Glen Tetley, I would work with Joe (Unclear), I would work with anybody.  I would work with Emet [ph.], see he allowed that and, I mean, I have no complaints.  You know, that--not that many people would be that generous.  He allowed me to go to Southeast Asia with a company with Alvin, you know, and that's really very generous.
Story_ID: 352192
Speaker 1: So you marry [HistoryMaker Geoffrey Holder] in '55 [1955], you have a son in '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: But you also go immediately back to work looks like you worked with Duke Ellington after that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, about two months.
Speaker 1: How did you meet Duke Ellington?
Speaker 2: Oh, I knew from Lester Horton of all things.  Well, I mean, of course everybody knew Duke, but when one of his pieces, we used some Ellington, 'Liberian Suite.'  Lester choreographed 'Liberian Suite,' and Duke came to the studio--which was really a great deal of fun--and somewhere I have a photograph, I'll try to get it for you.  And so when I got back here, somehow I got the job of Madame Zajj and that was two months after Leo [Leo Holder] was born and that's in the museum of, the city, what is it, the--for film--
Speaker 1: Television and Radio [Museum of Television and Radio; Paley Center for Media, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  You can see that.
Speaker 1: Right here in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  You can see that there, it was a wonderful film with Talley Beatty, he was the drum and I was Madame Zajj.  He was Carribee Joe, that's what he was, he was Carribee Joe.
Speaker 1: And that piece was 'A Drum Is a Woman'?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And it was done on television, live, 'U.S. Steel Hour' ['The United States Steel Hour'], one hour, live.  That was an exper-.  And I had to lip sync--lip sync Joya Sherrill and Margaret Tynes, the voices.  And I want to tell you, and the reason why I did that, years ago--and it's not on here--with Lester, there was a thing we did; '3-D Follies'--remember when 3-D was in--I had to learn a song, lip sync, and I was taught by the top men, I can't remember their names or anything but they knew--they taught me how to lip sync properly.  And there's a whole art into that, into lip syncing.  And from that experience--thank God I had that experience, otherwise I would not have known what to do.  Because I was expecting they would give me a coach and they would sit there, and they--what they do is do the playback, you do the breathing and you sing very softly and they would watch your mouth and your breath to see if it came out, if it--it was magnificent.  This man would just sit there and he would watch, it was wonderful, and he'd give you corrections.  And I was waiting for that person, I was waiting for the care and they just, nothing came and we kept--.  Days were getting shorter and I kept saying, where is this person, and nobody showed up.  And I said, "Please give me the recordings," and I sat down, and with those two songs all night long, I mean vocalizing, or doing--because of that experience and nobody could tell that I was not singing those songs, which was wonderful.  And as a tribute to those men, whoever they are, I love them dearly.  That taught me how to, the song and how to--especially that man who sat there and watched me, it's the brilliant technique and I don't think they do it anymore.  So thank goodne- that was an experience.
Story_ID: 352193
Speaker 1: How did Alvin Ailey come back to you and say, okay, we're going to go to Asia and we're gonna form this company--because then you're equal partners, when you--well you have both your names on the marquee.
Speaker 2: Well I--well, you see, I was known before Alvin because when I came here I had a gre-, Alvin was just beginning, so I had my career and, you know, whatever.  So evidently, when I don't know how it happened that the company was going, but they insisted it be De Lavallade [HistoryMaker Carmen De Lavallade]-Ailey.  And that's the way we took it.  And I think that's the way it got because it's that whole thing, which we talk about, somebody who's known will have the, you know da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  But it was a wonderful experience, but it was a long one; we started from Australia and went to Burma, which is now Myanmar, and went to the Indonesia and Korea and Japan and, you know, all the way up in Manila, Philippines (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who choreographed the pieces that you were doing?
Speaker 2: Most of them were, let's see, we did one piece from Lester [Lester Horton], 'The Beloved.'
Speaker 1: Which was?
Speaker 2: It was called 'The Beloved.'
Speaker 1: Oh, it was called 'The Beloved.'
Speaker 2: Called 'The Beloved,' a duet.  Alvin did 'Revelations,' we took 'Revelations' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even then he was doing 'Revelations'?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Yes, that was quite a while back.  And let's see, what else.  'Mountain Way Chant' was by Glen Tetley.  Oh dear, I can't remember all of it.
Speaker 1: Now would you say that they were more storytelling--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or that they were becoming abstract even at that point.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: They were all storytelling.
Speaker 2: It was still all storytelling--still all storytelling.
Speaker 1: So that was in 1958.  The year you finished after the tour and it lasts for how long?
Speaker 2: Well let's see, I don't know how many--it was a couple months.  You know, it took us all the way from Australia all the way up to Korea.  In fact, in Vietnam, we left, let's see, from Burma (laughter), we got to Saigon [Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam], and the government had closed in Burma.  We took the last plane out of Burma.  Everybody we had lunch with, U Nu was out and Ne Win was in and that was--.  It just closed off, you couldn't get back into Burma; they closed it off.  So that was an experience.  And then we get to Saigon and that was like, not that long after the palace [Independence Palace, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam] was bombed when (Unclear) was still in power, and people walking around with their machine guns, and I said, "What are we doing here, you know, why are we allowed to come here?"  And that was an experience.
Speaker 1: How was the work received over there?
Speaker 2: Very well--very well.  Burma was very interesting, I loved Burma, I don't know why.  I loved the people, I loved the country, the children are divine--pretty little things--and we learned something from them because they never applaud, rarely applauded.  And we said, "They don't like us."  And oh no, it's not that, it's when they're quiet is when they like you the best.  And that is true of any place.  If there is dead quiet, you know that you're doing a good job.  If you get people coughing or (unclear) restless, you know something's off, timing's off.  I learned a lot from that.  Oh they were wonderful, they were very gracious, they were lovely people.  The minister of culture was lovely and we went to Mandalay [Burma; Mandalay, Myanmar], too, and to the school there where the children learn their art because they're singers, dancers, and actors, they have to do everything, and make their costumes, do all the sewing.  And--wonderful, wonderful and there's just something about the atmosphere of the place I loved, I don't know why.  But, I felt comfortable there.
Story_ID: 352194
Speaker 1: I loved it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now when you were in Asia, was that when Geoffrey [HistoryMaker Geoffrey Holder] started his own company?  Did he have a company?
Speaker 1: Well, no, we, you know, you start companies and end companies, everybody had--.  Pickup--that was time of pickup.  You know, when there was a time to do a concert you just grab some people and do a concert.  We didn't have any (unclear).  No, that ended the party when NEA [National Endowment for the Arts] came into play.  That's another (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you ever work with--I'm sorry, that ended the party when?
Speaker 1: Ended the party when the NEA came in.  That's when everybody had to have a board of directors and dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.  That's the end of that, even people sharing people, that was the end of that.
Speaker 2: The party was over.
Speaker 1: Party over.
Speaker 2: Did you ever work with Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Johnson]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Louis, and just a whole lot of them, it was wonderful.  That was a nice thing, you know, because you shared people.
Speaker 2: It was a community.
Speaker 1: It was a community.  Shared the concerts, and like I said I was also working with Sophie Maslow, I did all the Hanukkah festivals, which was great, it was wonderful.  At Madison Square Garden [New York, New York], at the old Madison Square Garden.  It was fantastic, you sort of worked with everybody.
Speaker 2: And, then you come back from that trip and go right back to the film business.  Did you go back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to do 'Against the'--
Speaker 1: 'Odds Against Tomorrow.'
Speaker 2: 'Odds Against Tomorrow,' or did you do that in New York [New York]?
Speaker 1: Probably, no that was here--that was here.
Speaker 2: New York?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, that was here.
Speaker 2: And who was in that film?
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, Cicely Tyson was in that.  Robert, no--Shelley Winters and, oh, that wonderful man [Robert Ryan], who was the leading man? That's easy enough to find out.  I was going to say Robert Walker, but it wasn't Robert Walker.  Oh, he was magnificent.  But it was a great film.
Speaker 2: And your role?  You starred as?
Speaker 1: I was Harry's lady friend, love interest in it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kitty.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kitty.  That was--Robert Wise was the director. Yeah, he was a lovely man.  It was a good film, it was one of those films that was ahead of its time, you know with the bank robbery and the two men fought and they destroyed themselves in the process.
Story_ID: 352195
Speaker 1: And then you go back to television in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Yes. Well I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you were one of the few people--you know, you hear all the stories about oh, when there was a black person on TV, everybody was, oh, there's a black person on TV.
Speaker 2: I know, I know.  I did 'The Ed Sullivan Show.'  I did two 'Ed Sullivan' shows.  One I did 'Ladies in the Shade of the Banana Tree' ['Two Ladies In De Shade Of De Banana Tree'] with, with Pearl [Pearl Bailey], and then I did a duet with, with Claude Thompson.  But what happened was, is that I originally John Butler choreographed 'Willow Weep For Me.'
Speaker 1: It was a little weak?
Speaker 2: No, 'Willow Weep For Me'--
Speaker 1: 'Willow Weep,' oh.
Speaker 2: --it was a song, I'm sorry, I'm thinking too fast because I'm aware of the time.
Speaker 1: Oh, don't worry about the time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Willow Weep for Me,' you know, 'Willow Weep for Me,' and I was to dance it with Glen Tetley at that time I was with John and John did a lot of television work, and you know so that's how we got in.  I don't know--I think through John Butler.  And I was not allowed to dance with Glen because he was Caucasian.  And that was the time when you'd raise your hand and, I never have been or never will be a member of the Communist party, it was that whole time.  So, I had to, I got Claude, which was fine with me, you know, but they wouldn't let me dance with Glen.  And John Butler, was from Greenwood, Mississippi and his two leading ladies were myself and Mary Hinkson, ladies of color and he's from Greenwood, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: I'm from Greenville, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Oh well, there you are.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I know exactly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you imagine?  And this man, he was, I've never seen him get so angry and upset.
Speaker 1: Well who--
Speaker 2: And that was 'The Ed Sullivan Show' they just, you did not mix up people on the telly at that time.
Speaker 1: And who comes out with that decision?  Who comes down and says, "You guys can't do this?"
Speaker 2: It was Sullivan [Ed Sullivan].  That's just the way it was you did not--
Speaker 1: But you rehearsed it.
Speaker 2: I know, but when they found out that Glen was white, that, that, that, no, and we had to change it.  So that's the way it was at that time, I mean and--but the funny part about it is that on the Sunday mornings 'Look Up to Li-,' 'Look Up and Live,' and the 'Lamp Unto my Feet,' and all those early morning religious programs, who was dancing, Glen and myself and John's choreography, I mean it was all right for that but not 'The Ed Sullivan Show' because it's going all over the country, you see.  It's just like Lena [Lena Horne] doing 'When the Clouds Roll By' [sic. 'Till the Clouds Roll By'], they would always do her segment separately so that when it goes to the South they can cut it out.  She did her songs and they could cut it out, you didn't know that.  Oh that's what would happen you see, because it goes all around, and that was a national show I think, 'Ed Sullivan.'  And even when they started having people sing together, black or white, or the top people, they had to stand next to each other, you know, it was little by little, it took a long time.  These young people are lucky today.  They haven't a clue, but that's what happened.  I mean, I was grateful for Claude and myself and I do have a copy--my son [Leo Holder] digs up all the things that I've done--maybe I'll send you a copy, it's really charming piece that he did.  Different kind of thing choreography and television, really some nice things; I did two really sweet pieces you don't see that ever, now it's all, you know, whatever, but really quite beautiful.
Speaker 1: Did you think about what--did you think about what you were doing?  Did you think that we're breaking ground, that we're making changes, that we're--
Speaker 2: No, I just did it because I knew, you know, I mean yes, I suppose, back here, you know, but (laughter) it was just, it wasn't surprising to me.  It was surprising to John maybe but it wasn't surprising to me.  But Claude and I just had a wonderful time so, it's okay.
Story_ID: 352196
Speaker 1: So between, in the '60s [1960s], you were doing a lot of different dance performing--television, film, concerts.  Of the things you were doing, which stands out most for you?  Which did you enjoy the most?
Speaker 2: You mean between the film and the danc- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Film, dance, live theater, you know.
Speaker 2: Live, yeah. I don't know, each thing is unique you know, it's hard, it's like to pick which is your favorite child.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well did you have mentors at the time?  Or influences--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --when you were on your own?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Well Janet [Janet Collins], of course, was mainly.  But then I came in contact with, oh, all kinds of interesting people like Ted Shawn, up at the Pillow [Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Becket, Massachusetts] Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis.  And then I met--worked with Ballet Theatre [American Ballet Theatre] with--what's her name--Agnes de Mille, Antony Tudor was around, you know, all those people and I sort of, I never planned anything, it was really funny, it wasn't like I went out and looked for the th-, it just sort of came to me a lot of it.  You know, and I just like the experience of it.  With John Butler, when we performed 'Carmina Burana' for the first time, well Leopold Stokowski conducted, gee whiz.  You know, I mean everybody was scared to death of the man, I didn't mind him at all, I like all that kind of eccentricity.  And Sherrill Milnes, and Margaret Tynes and John Reardon were the singers, I mean my goodness.  You know, and when I was at the Met [Metropolitan Opera], it was--I made my dancing debut doing Janet's 'Aida' and 'Samson and Delilah' were the things that my cousin Janet Collins danced.
Speaker 1: And 'Samson and Delilah' has the best dance number of all operas, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, both 'Aida' and 'Samson.'  But I made my debut with Renata Tebaldi and I met Rise Stevens and Blanch Thebom, and George Otolsy [ph.] and Robert Merrill and all these extraordinary people, my goodness.  Aside from adding the Duke Ellingtons and all those kind of people, you know, I mean I've had an extremely lucky, rich life but it's--and I'm humbled by it really, because these absolutely legendary people; Martha Graham--not that, I didn't work with her company [Martha Graham Dance Company] because she knew I wasn't right for her company, I wasn't right for her company, I knew that and she knew it but we became friends--but I learned a lot from her (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you consider her--what did you learn from her?
Speaker 2: About theater and performance, she was extraordinary on the stage, I knew her--she was a much older person when I knew her--but my goodness, she was the kind of person that could have her back to the stage, everybody could be dancing, she might be older, but who are you looking at and why?  And, I kept saying why, why?
Speaker 1: And people see that, why, why?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, you, you--your eyes just, because her focus on what she's doing.  And she's taking in everything and she's like a magnet and those things you learn from people.  It's not just being on a stage and doing your steps, it has nothing to do--it's your internals.
Story_ID: 352197
Speaker 1: So in 1966 you won the, that Dance Magazine Award for your contributions to the art of dance (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yes, yes.  And next year, I'm going to get the Capezio Dance Award (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right on (laughter).  Did that surprise you in '66 [1966] when you won it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, yeah.  But it was nice to get.
Speaker 1: Is it surprising now that the Capezio one is going to be next?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just didn't fathom, well just give it up, you know.  But it's very nice to be recognized, it really is.  It's very nice to be recognized.  And I think Donald Saddler recommended me.  Donald Saddler was my, in Carmelita Maracci's class he was my first partner when I was on pointe, it was really funny, he's a terrific man.
Speaker 1: So it was Carmelita's class that you actually learned pointe?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Started to learn, but it wasn't for me, my ankles were too f-, because when I was small, I was the clumsiest person in the world, I was constantly spraining my ankles (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did Janet [Janet Collins] do pointe?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well?
Speaker 2: Very well.  That's why the Ballet Russe [Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo] wanted her.  But it wasn't right for me, it didn't like me, and so--but it was very valuable.  I wish I could because I told somebody I said, oh yeah, I wish I were a ballet dancer because I know what would do with 'Swan Lake' [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky] (laughter), or 'Giselle,' I know exactly how I would do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 352198
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was the late '60s [1960s] that you make somewhat of a transition that most people don't know about and that's into acting.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was--well, what happened was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm talking about oh, go ahead tell me what happened.
Speaker 2: John Butler's company you know broke--it's how company's do that, they begin falling apart and people do their different things.  And Alvin [Alvin Ailey] was doing his company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] and Geoffrey [HistoryMaker Geoffrey Holder] had his work to do, and I was with the Glen Tetley company [Glen Tetley Dance Company], we'd just come off a big tour of Europe and I'm nowhere fast, I was not doing anything.  But I knew a woman, Mildred Dunnock, you remember Mildred Dunnock, the actress?  I performed something with--John Butler had choreographed something with Millie and myself, she was speaking and it was a Francois Villon poem, and she was the elder lady and I was doing her as a young woman, I got to meet her.  I knew Alvin Epstein, actor, when he worked with Geoffrey and they did a Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], I think it was 'Twelfth Night,' or something like that.  I met Alvin and we became friends and I did 'Story of a Soldier' ['The Soldier's Tale'], 'L'Historie du soldat' [Igor Stravinsky] for a film for television and he was the soldier and I was the princess and Brock Peters was in it and Jerry Orbach and so you know how life just sort of, we all came together.
Story_ID: 352199
Speaker 1: And somehow when Glen's company [Glen Tetley Dance Company], I was coming back, was on tour with Glen [Glen Tetley], during the last leg of it, I had gone up to Yale [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut], the very beginning of the Yale when Robert Brustein was taking over, it was in the main stage, not the church, to see something that Millie [Mildred Dunnock] did with Alvin [Alvin Ailey], and I met Robert Brustein.  And I remember I was in Ohio or someplace like that, didn't know what I was going to do after this con-, and I got this telegram asking me to come to Yale to teach the dancers--to teach the actors movement, and then I eventually became part of the company.  And I was kind of thrown into this acting thing, and this whole scho-, and this is when it was--Yale was just starting to bloom with Robert Brustein, you know, who really knew his business, I must admit.
Speaker 2: Who were some of the actors you were teaching?
Speaker 1: Let's see, when I started, well the ones that people--Henry Winkler, I worked with Henry a lot, I'm trying to think.  Well, the young people that they would know would be Meryl Streep and Sigourney Weaver and Michael Gross (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's talk about Meryl Streep for a moment because she's such a great actress.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Did you recognize something about her talent at the time?
Speaker 1: Well of course, you just look at her and say, well there it is, I mean, we just say, oh well there it is, there it is.  You just knew.  And Sigourney, too, this elegant, wonderful girl.  Joe Grifasi, wonderful character actor.  Michael Gross, there's just a lot of people, there's a whole list of them, and what's so lovely is that they're doing well, and we're all like family in a funny kind of way.
Story_ID: 351951
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, but I'm going to start with that story--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --before I forget because it came to--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when I was interviewing Maurice Hines [HistoryMaker Maurice Hines, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --and he's like, "There is only one dance diva." (Laughter) And he said, "Carmen [HistoryMaker Carmen De Lavallade]," and he's like, "and you can tell her I said so," (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that's so lovely.  I had the best time at Ballet Tap USA--it's on there somewhere--and because that was an experience, it so much fun, and he's such a dear, he really is.  He's a fine artist that man.
Speaker 1: Did you tap at all?
Speaker 2: No I didn't tap, I just did my solos.  And you know, I went on with the company, and it was really fun, it really is a movie actually, this little tap company going all around and it made, you know, a concert dance (unclear) tap company, it's really hysterical and going to all those funny little places and playing in these high school auditoriums and things like that, and dressing in the band rooms, you know (laughter).  And we'd call them club dates 'cause it was just one light bulb.  It was great. And, you know, on the buses, and we were going to Altoona [Pennsylvania], and we never got there, it was like I always wanted to do a film called 'When Do We Get to Altoona,' because we started at nine o'clock in the morning and got there at twelve o'clock at night.  It was just hysterical, you know, it's just--but it was a wonderful experience and I love him dearly.
Speaker 1: How did you get to meet him?  Just in the dance world (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, who knows.  Just in the dance world, and--
Story_ID: 351952
Speaker 1: Did you ever live in Harlem [New York, New York]?  Did you ever perform in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --or did you ever have a connection to Harlem and, as far as dance and choreography?
Speaker 2: No, except going to--dancing up in the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] and going up to--what is that--Aaron Davison [ph.], things like that, all my work's been in the city.
Speaker 1: Would you consider yourself to have had a mainstream dance career?  I mean a crossover career.  A career that's bridged--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean you haven't been boxed into one specific category.
Speaker 2: Not really.  Not rea-, I'm not a ballet dancer, I'm not a pointe dancer, although I did guest with the Ballet Theatre [American Ballet Theatre].  But that's--Agnes de Mille's work was, it had nothing to do with pointe work so it was okay.  And that was a milestone, that ballet, 'The Four Marys.' [HistoryMaker] Judith Jamison was one of the girls.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah, [HistoryMaker] Glory Van Scott, and Cleo Quitman and myself.  And that was kind of, you know, it was based on, like, the plantation and the owner liked the girl and she, she had a baby and drowned the baby and she was executed for it.  It was really--came out of 'Henry VIII' [William Shakespeare and John Fletcher] and 'The Four Marys,' something that happened in one of the English, in their history, that she used that basis for American plantation life.

Speaker 1: So when you arrive at Yale [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut] and you, or when you get the telegram and you are asked to teach--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what are your first thoughts?
Speaker 2: Well like I said Geoffrey [HistoryMaker Geoffrey Holder] was generous enough to let me go back and forth.  And it's within a, you know, you can commute and whatnot.  And oh, well, the dancers--the actors I keep saying the dancers--but, the actors kind of, they didn't know, who is this person you know, but eventually they found out and we got to be really good friends.  And I did end up in the company [Yale Repertory Theatre] thanks to Larry Eric [ph.], the directors and Robert Lewis, and they took a lot of chance thanks to Robert Brustein, too.  I must admit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, ere there any other black--oh, go ahead.
Speaker 2: You know, I mean, I was not, I had theater experience but certainly not from the acting standpoint but to be around those actors--it's just like watching Bella [Bella Lewitzky]--I am like a sponge.  I went to all the rehearsals, I watched and I tried to, I knew I had a lot to learn and I would volunteer to do things and then I would you know work with the actors and I love teaching actors movement because they're a whole other animal you know and they're very imaginative.  Dancers, unfortunately--I was fortunate enough to have Lester [Lester Horton] and Carmelita [Carmelita Maracci]--but I find dancers are all into counting and technical work.  You know, and, but when you get around the actors, I just learn how they get into characters and they talk about things and maybe you might have a script, but what they're talking about is not in the script, but they have to make up so that they can get back to the script, you know, and I found that fascinating, absolutely fascinating.  So I would go to as many things as I could and I was in the theater all day and, you know, teaching the kids at nine [o'clock] in the morning or 9:30 or something, and I just involved myself as much as I could and Robert Brustein was wonderful about that and he forced me into doing movement and choreographing or staging some of the things and I said, "I don't know if I can--," and he says, "Yes, you can."  He was very, very generous to me, I'll never forget that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you the only black company member?
Speaker 2: In the beginning? I suppose and then it just started to--.  You know I guess when I go places I don't think about it, if I think about that, I clam up you know what I mean.  Although, you know, I'm sure that there are certain things they wouldn't put me in because that's in their head that that's, you know.  Although, at the same time I would do Lady MacBeth and Lady MacDuff, and, you know, so I had no problems.  I had no problems.  But let's face it, I look kind of, they don't know where I am, most people don't know where I am (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and on stage. And you're on stage, they put you on stage.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they don't know where I am so I can pretty much, let's say I'm fortunate in that respect.  Although there are some times, today, even though they know that I look a certain way, they still didn't know that I'm of color, and they won't use--you know, it's that kind of thing, it's just weird, it's all weird.  But like I said, if I stop to think of that, then you hinder yourself, do you know what I mean.  You have--not that it's not there and I know (unclear)--
Speaker 1: But there's no point to stop to think about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  If you do, you just clam up.  You know I just want to do the work, and if I'm right for the work, I'm right for the work, if I'm not, I still want to try it.  You know, but that's part of art, that's part of the theater, is the creativity, you do what you can.  And sometimes, you know, I just thought, the things that don't work out for you are sometimes the best experience because you learn something.

Speaker 1: How would you say dance is different from theater, having done both?
Speaker 2: Well, dance is all physical, physical thing, theater is, is--well, dance is more like poetry and music it's on a different plane.  It's a little rarified, it's in a different, like poetry and music it's in that vein.  Where acting, theater, is like grounded, it's earthly.  Where dance and poetry, it's kind of more, lighter air.
Speaker 1: What part of your instrument did you use in acting that you had not used or developed in dance?
Speaker 2: Voice.  That was hard, oh boy, and I had a wonderful--Marjorie Phillips, who taught voice to the actors [at the Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut], and we worked a lot, she liked the way that I handled the actors movement-wise, so she would give me classes, you know she would help me with my voice and then I would help her with movement and study-, understanding of the body.  And that worked out very, very nicely.
Story_ID: 351955
Speaker 1: What type of teacher would you say you were?
Speaker 2: Well I, with the actors [at the Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut], I--even with the dancers--I would try, I was not a generalized, I think that's why in teaching dance I'm not too good because I'll stay too long on one thing because I get too specific and, you know, I want--I try to get everybody.  I will talk about a movement or something and I would make sure that everybody understood what I was talking about.  The actors I always thought I don't want them to be dancers, I want them to be people but I want them to know how to handle their body so that whenever they have to move, they feel comfortable in their skin, and that way it worked out very nicely.  So, I didn't expect them to be dancers by any stretch of the imagination, but boy could they move, some of them.  Oh it was wonderful, and I like that roughness about it, that's what I--.  So that when they move on stage they look like people and not somebody putting something on them that's not--.  I had problems trying to keep myself from looking like a dancer, because I became too refined.  You know you can just spot them a mile away, oh it's terrible.  You know, and I had to work hard at getting rid of some of that.  But actually and I learned from the acting and the directors and people that--guest directors, like Terrence McNally and actors--guest actors like Robert Drivas and Christopher Lloyd--it's just the working--Nancy Wickwire, how they get their characters, so that when I went back to anything that was dancing, my, my vision of it was different, and my approach was different, totally different.
Story_ID: 351956
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some of the people you've worked with.  Terrence McNally.
Speaker 2: Yes, I, actually I understudied 'The Ritz' [Terrence McNally], well it became 'The Ritz'--
Speaker 1: It was 'The Tubs' (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but it was really 'The Tubs' and I understudied Googie Gomez, and there came a time when I had to do it and it was like the last minute because Stephanie [Stephanie Cotsirilos] had got sick and I jumped in and, well, I put the wig on and the whole thing--and I really looked like a street walker (laughter), isn't that terrible.  And I looked very Puerto Rican, too.  And even Terrence kind of got like this well I had to use the famous word, the famous four letter word.  Well I'm always darn and shoot and all that kind of stuff.  Well, when that came out of my mouth the guys fell out and every performance they'd stand at the wing, Kurt Kasznar, and all these--Ted Tally was one of the playwrights at that time, he was doing one of the roles and they would stand in the wings and wait for me to say the famous word, and they would double over, it was so funny.  So I, needless to say, I had a great time with dear old Googie and my accent was really quite good and--
Speaker 1: Can you do a little of it now?
Speaker 2: Can I talk like that right now?  Yes.  See, I can talk like that.  I can talk like that and I was around a lot of Latinos in my, in my, in my early life, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's good.  That's really good.
Speaker 2: --and I know that the women are very, you know, they talk real loud.  (Laughter) And so, I had a wonderful time, and they had no idea that I--that all of a sudden that other person came out of me, I had a magnificent time, I loved that role, it was really a great role.
Story_ID: 351957
Speaker 1: Christopher Lloyd.
Speaker 2: Oh, my Oberon.  Well, Quiet--I call him Quiet Rascal--but when we did 'Midsummer Night's Dream' ['A Midsummer Night's Dream,' William Shakespeare], Alvin Epstein was the director, we used Henry Purcell's music from 'The Fairy Queen.'  Alvin Epstein is a terrific--we work so well together, Alvin and myself, we worked in a number of the plays at Yale [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut], but somehow we always knew what each other was thinking you know, we could beat each other--I knew we just, it was a great combination.  And we used the whole chorus of singers and Christopher Lloyd was Oberon.  And Christopher's a very quiet fellow, he never said very much, but I remember him telling me he said, one day he said, "Carmen [HistoryMaker Carmen De Lavallade], get on my shoulder, sit on my," and I said, "Well I'm an awful big lady," he said "Get on the shoulder."  Well he's a big guy, so but somehow our bodies worked perfectly together, and he did his whole soliloquy, the last soliloquy was with me on his shoulder, he just held me this way and I straddled his--the side of his neck on the left hand side.  And he would rehearse with me, every time he rehearsed a soliloquy he said, "Get on my shoulder," and I said, "But you can't do that all the time," he said, "I have to because of my breath, to get the breath right."  I just think the world of that man, we had such a great time, oh he's naughty, too, he's really terrific.  And the set was magnificent; it was just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The costumes.
Speaker 2: Oh, well it was like we were nude.  He was all silver, I was all kind of bronze, like cobwebs, you know, it was a beautiful production and he was magnificent.  And there--the movements, he was kind of this awkward kind of thing and so I was more like a dancer, we're--Titania, and the balance of this awkwardness from Oberon and the certain daintiness of Titania worked beautifully and he was very good with lifts, very simple things that we did.  And the fairies were all men you know these looked--Alvin had them all look like bugs and this, like things that crawl out under leaves because that's a lot of the words are like that, it wasn't that dainty little fairytale thing, not at all. It was very dark and everybody was arguing, it was one big brawl from the beginning to end, which was terrific, it was a beautiful production and the music was magnificent, but he was, he was quite, quite extraordinary in that role.
Story_ID: 351958
Speaker 1: Adrienne Kennedy.
Speaker 2: Adrienne, well it was during that time with the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], and Adrienne is sweet and she had written this thing called 'Dead Essex' ['An Evening with Dead Essex,' Adrienne Kennedy], and from what I can remember it was about the young man who shot at people from a tower, and she, she was kind of political and she almost made him into a hero of some kind which, you know, I thought, oh dear, I don't want--and she wanted us to use our names.  I said, "I can't do that."  But she was very sweet, I love Adrienne.  I thought she was quite a playwright, but during that time it was a very troubled times at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] with all the Panthers and that great big march that they had, it was, ooh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Didn't Adrienne also write 'A Star Must Appear in Black and White' [sic. 'A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White,' Adrienne Kennedy]?  Is that her?  They did it at the Public [The Public Theater, New York, New York] a few years ago they did a retrospective of her, of her work.
Speaker 2: You know maybe, maybe, maybe.  I believe there might have been another play that Adrienne might have (unclear), or just did 'Dead Essex.'  I know I was in 'Dead Essex' and it was controversial but we did it.  You know it was an odd play and she knew it, that's what I love about her she knows, and if you're uncomfortable, she'll change things, she understood.
Speaker 1: So she's a good playwright.
Speaker 2: She's a good playwright.
Story_ID: 351959
Speaker 1: She's [Adrienne Kennedy] a sweet person (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You said in your introduction that you were adding playwright to your list of accomplishments.
Speaker 1: Yes I'm working on a--on a, I call it, it's a play, with music, but jazz, and it's not music that is like musical music, which I'm not that fond of--it's okay.  But I like jazz songs because they--they're almost like cabaret songs, being that they really are almost like when you hear good bluegrass songs, you know they're about something, it's really about the gut of--they get to the meat of a person's soul, like Billie Holiday singing, it's a different way of singing when you hear jazz songs.  And I thought it might be interesting to do a musical with jazz, use it in that context, so it's not musical.
Speaker 2: That sounds like fun (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because it says something different, it's different.
Speaker 2: Okay, it's sort of, kind of reminding me of--or it's sounding like 'Caroline, or Change' [Tony Kushner].
Speaker 1: Yes, in a way but jazz.
Speaker 2: But just how they use the music because it's different than a musical.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  That's correct, correct, when they--what are some of the songs--but, any of the things Fitzgerald [Ella Fitzgerald] sings or Billie [Billie Holiday] sings it just wasn't a musical, they were really people songs--people singing.
Speaker 2: It becomes a play with music, as opposed to musicals.
Speaker 1: Yes.  I like plays with music.
Speaker 2: I do as well.
Speaker 1: Because it comes out of the, it just comes out naturally, instead of just stops--well musicals are musicals, they're fine.
Speaker 2: And you know the girl [Anika Noni Rose] who played the daughter in 'Caroline, or Change' is now one of the Dream girls [Dreams] in this new movie ['Dreamgirls']--
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 2: --is that actress.
Speaker 1: It's amazing isn't it, it's amazing--
Story_ID: 351960
Speaker 1: So what happens?  How do you end your tenure at the Repertory [Yale Repertory Theater] at Yale [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: I--Well I was there for a while and I thought I had to get back to New York [New York], cause poor Geoffrey [HistoryMaker Geoffrey Holder], you know, was hanging on his own, and our son [Leo Holder] was in France going to school, finally got him back and he was in Connecticut with me, I put him up in school in Connecticut.  And just as it was time to--.  And I think at that time, too, unfortunately, Robert Brustein lost his wife, Norma [Norma Ofstrock Brustein].  That's a whole book, just my whole life there is a whole other thing, you know, because my life been so broad, you know, I never know where to start.  And I thought it was time to get back to New York.  And then my life changed again, getting back to New York and coming back and I thought maybe it would be nice to get into the acting it was very difficult because they know me as a dancer.  New Haven [Connecticut] knew me as an actor (laughter), and New York knew me as a dancer.
Speaker 1: But you were able to work some as an actor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.  At least I got to do 'Othello' [William Shakespeare] with Earle Hyman at the Roundabout [Roundabout Theatre Company], you know, that was hysterical, that was a very funny production (laughter).
Speaker 1: The Roundabout is awesome, though.
Speaker 2: It is, it is.
Speaker 1: They've come a long way.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was an early time, and it wasn't the greatest production of 'Othello,' you know, and Earle kept saying he was going to die (laughter), and I'd say, "No you're not," "I'm going to die," "No you're not, no you're not."  And you know he had to take his medication for his ailment.  And one day at a matinee Nick Kepros [Nicholas Kepros] was playing Iago and there he was, they were doing their scene and I remember he got to the word promulgate, and he just stopped and he just keeled over and we all watched him fall like a giant redwood, and we said, and I thought to myself, he's done it (laughter), he killed himself, he didn't want to be in this production. And somehow he, it was with his medication I guess, he was out for two hours, scared the living daylights out of us, we laugh about it all the time.  Oh dear, you know I mean even productions that are not good have their wonderful times you know but I did my Emilia and I got my St. Clair Bayfield Award for off-Broadway I loved doing Emilia, I think I did a good job with dear Emilia.
Speaker 1: Well you won the award.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a really exciting thing and it was good, I liked doing that kind of thing, you know, and I find Emilia, actually, she's the linchpin because if it weren't for her--she's the one that told Othello he was a fool and she's the one with the Iago and she let it all out of the, you know everything and what did she get was a nice husband killed her. So (laughter), so, but she was crucial.  Most people don't think of her but when you think about her role in it what she has to say is quite truthful and necessary to the action.  In fact, the director wanted to end it at the, when she was strangled or something like that and everybody said, "Are you mad?"  You know, the whole point, the last part of the play is very important, it was one of those weird things, but we did the whole play.
Story_ID: 351961
Speaker 1: But you did 'The Cosby Show.'
Speaker 2: Yes, that was fun.  He's quite, Bill [Bill Cosby] is quite something to work with, you really have to be on your toes because you never know what he's going to pull.  You know, but he's--and I was watching recently, the reruns, that was a wonderful show and I think it's one of the few programs that dealt with young people and the problems, and what they do and don't do and their direction about education, it's the only one.  And it's still the only one that deals with the problems in a really kind of marvelous, funny but really serious, wonderful way.
Story_ID: 351962
Speaker 1: And then, and this next subject I'm going to have you elaborate on because it's one of my favorites and I'm the interviewer so I can do that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: But you were at the Joyce [The Joyce Theater, New York, New York] with [HistoryMaker] Bill T. Jones and Arnie Zane--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in that performance.
Speaker 2: Gosh, what did I do?  Do you remember what I did?
Speaker 1: It was in the '90s [1990s] and--
Speaker 2: Do you remember what I was doing?
Speaker 1: --and it was.  You know, Bill does this--these pieces where, and it wasn't the one where he brings the preacher on stage, but you--it was kind of a speaking role and you--
Speaker 2: Yes, what did I do?  Oh isn't that funny, I do so many things, I lose track.  But, you know, all the people that I work with, it's just amazing, he's a wonderful guy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he has a great company [Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or he did back then, I don't know what he's doing now.
Speaker 2: Well, I think a little something, something.
Speaker 1: And I remember it was you, it was a really big fat white guy with a bald head.
Speaker 2: Really, yes.  My gosh, isn't that awful.  Oh dear, there's so much up here (laughter).
Speaker 1: And it was a dance piece but you guys broke the fourth wall and you talked directly to the audience.  Anyway, it was one of my favorite.
Speaker 2: Well, actually when I was at Yale [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut], Geoffrey [HistoryMaker Geoffrey Holder] choreographed 'The Creation' for me, James Weldon Johnson's thing, and that's been very successful for me, people don't--.  Where I speak it and do my whole movement to it and I performed it with the Boston Pops with a whole eighty-piece orchestra doing the host the planets, you know the Venus section of the planets.  And that was quite a--people didn't think I was, they thought it was a voice over or something like that, but no.  So I've been trying to do more of that kind of work (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's awesome, I love that kind of work.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and of course that was a while back and of course physically I couldn't do some of the things I did then.  But I'm doing it again but it comes out a little differently and it's fine, you know--
Speaker 1: And how does it feel inside?
Speaker 2: Richer.  And the more that I do, I know how to visually how to, rhythmically how to get something more out of it.  As you get older it's like when I saw Sir John Gielgud doing the 'Ages of Man,' he says, you know, it's so sad, let's see--you never know how to play Romeo until you're too old to play him.  It's that kind of thing.  It's like listening to Tony Bennett singing, he's not singing the notes, he just going all over the place.  Or Joe Williams, they're singing between the notes and making it richer and when they sang when they were younger it was all rather, each note, you know what I mean.  And as you get older, you throw all that out and get down to the real, the real meaning of things.  And that's the way I feel now about things, I'm beginning to understand it more.  It takes you that long, strangely enough, you keep changing.  (Unclear) Arthur Rubinstein, I remember him saying that he, there was a Schubert [Franz Schubert] that he always loved to play and he says every time he plays it it's different, it's been fifty years and he never plays it the same. And I said of course, you don't keep it the same, but you're a different person every day, so it's going to change every day.  But as you get older you get your--you get experience, you get richer, your words get richer.  As you get older, the older performances ge-, maybe their voices aren't that great anymore but my goodness.

Speaker 1: Now was 'Creations' ['The Creation'] first performed at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Carnegie Hall, yes, of all--.  I said, now my feeling, if you're going, if you're going to go down, if you're going to make a mistake and really be terrible, do it in the best places.  At the Metropolitan Opera [Metropolitan Opera House, New York, New York] when I choreographed 'Lucia di Lammermoor' [Gaetano Donizetti], it was one of those productions, it got terrible reviews, but whatever, it, it caused a lot of consternation, of course they sold out tickets, of course that's the way it always is, you know, they wanted to go and see really what it was about.  But I remember when we came out, the whole crew or whatever it is, the director, Francesca Zambello, whoever, we came out on stage and we took our hands to do our bow and you hear "Boo, boo," (laughter), and I thought it was funny because what it sounded like, we must've had a clack or something like that because it was like somebody said, "One, two, three, boo," you know, it was one of those things.  So--and somebody was there and said, "Carmen [HistoryMaker Carmen De Lavallade], you were laughing," I said, "I thought it was funny."  And besides which, what better place to have a boo.  It's in front of the gold curtain of the Met [Metropolitan Opera House], come on, you know and it was wonderful, exciting, and--
Story_ID: 351964
Speaker 1: How did you get the job with Benny Goodman?
Speaker 2: Have no i-, I think my manager, Helen Keane, who was the manager of Bill Evans, whom I danced with, too--add that onto it, I'd forgotten about that--worked with him as soloist and a duet with my friend, Wesley Fata and I think she got that film for me and it was a wonderful experience and I thought, Benny Goodman, oh my goodness.  And I became part of the orchestra.  You see I sat, and they're doing their thing and I'm doing my little thing movement-wise and then I get up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sitting in the chair, though.
Speaker 2: Sitting in the chair, you know like they are and then I get up and do my--.  Everybody gets there little solo, I got mine and sat down again (laughter).  It was wonderful--it was wonderful you know.  And he was a task master, that man, oh he's so brilliant on that clarinet.  You know it was fascinating to watch him work with a man because he would go very slowly when they'd have a difficult space, he's take it very slowly and then they'd pick up the tempo and they'd rip.  And when I did would do a movement and they liked the rhythm, and the one old guy says, "Hey, that was good, I like that," and I thought wow, you know, I got the okay, I felt very pleased about that.  But t-, when I think about that I say, "What were you doing?"  You know these were the top--Benny Goodman and the men that played with were just phenomenal.  It's like working with Duke [Duke Ellington].  Cat Anderson, Ray Nance, oh my good-, Johnny Hodges.  What a blessed, what a blessing, what a blessing to be around those people, oh my goodness they were just phenomenal--I know I've left somebody out--but they were just, those men were just wonderful, just to watch and listen to them.  You know just--working with Bill Evans and just doing a solo with him sitting at the piano was just wonderful.

Speaker 1: Now did Meryl Streep get you the job in 'The Hours,' the film (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I tried out for it, but it was, you know, it was one of those things where you're supposed to have a little scene but they cut it out, it was one of those--that's okay.  But, it's always nice to see Meryl and I wish we could've had--.  But I think it was, absolutely--what I tried out for was really superfluous, it wasn't really necessary but it was nice to, you know, do my little walk across street.  You know, but I'm really proud of her and Sigourney [Sigourney Weaver], I'm very proud of, all of them and Michael Gr- [Michael Gross].  It's just wonderful, it's like watching your children, you know, doing well and we've all become fast friends because you know what was unique about Yale [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut] is that I might've been the teacher, but we were all in the same show, which meant if come into to teach at nine [o'clock], 9:30 in the morning, you're there at nine, 9:30 in the morning and I don't want to hear about anybody sleeping late.  I was on the stage, too, and they knew that. So everybody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it was fun.
Speaker 2: But it was fun--
Speaker 1: It was a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: --oh, it was, it was, it was incredible.
Story_ID: 351966
Speaker 1: But you s-, but it started ten years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh goodness, yes.  You mean--
Speaker 1: Paradigm [Paradigm Dance Company] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Paradigm.  Yeah, Paradigm, you know, in the meantime I'm doing all these other things and I'm doing concerts and what not--it just takes too much, I'll have to send you a lot of stuff.  [HistoryMaker] Gus Solomons jr., and I guess he was you know deciding what to do next or something, and he had called me and asked me if I would like to work with him and Dudley Williams in a trio and I thought, oh, that's interesting, I mean we're not going to be doing things that we did twenty years ago, God help us.  So I thought it would be very interesting to do work for older people--I don't want to say, more mature audience, performance--and so we started working together and he choreographed this crazy thing called 'Thin Frost' ['A Thin Frost,' Gus Solomons jr.] which was just the wildest thing and it turned out to be really good.  And then we started having younger people come in and choreograph for us, and people started to like it, I mean it was really very, very interesting.  Now, starting a company that's an older company was something that I had an idea with Hope Clarke years ago but it was very difficult to start and we had people like, Miguel Godreau, and Louis Falco and myself, and Bertram Ross, and Erin Martin and Hope and myself, and we weren't chop liver at that time, you know, but there's no clout in this country.  You don't, you know--it's hard enough even with the NEA [National Endowment for the Arts] to get anything going where at the same time, the Nevins Dance Theater [ph.], they started a company of the same kind.  Well it was no problem because they have theater and they have the money so bloop, so there they go.  Or Baryshnikov [Mikhail Baryshnikov] comes and he starts a c-, well he's Baryshnikov, so it's very difficult.  Now we have our company and we've added Hope and a couple of other people--Keith Sabado and Michael Blake--so that we're not have to do all the pieces because it's very exhausting when you want to do (unclear) when you want to do a whole evening.  But I'm--it's, young people, the interesting thing is that the young people, when they work with us, they can't have us flying all over the place, they have to focus and their work becomes very interesting when they do that.  Dwight Rhoden did a piece for Gus and myself, called 'It All,' a Bjork piece, about the train.  And he did that, I swear he started working and we must've done that in an hour.  It was one of those things that just goes and he does-, and we don't even remember doing it, it went so fast.  That's when everybody's in sync you know and it's a beautiful piece, a beautiful duet and I think Gus and I are going to do it next month for, for, for a showing.  But it, you know, as, as you get older, I'm finding you know that the body will just go so lo--.  I can do a lot of things, but you have to be realistic about what the joints are going to do and I don't care how good you take care of yourself, you know, nature is nature.
Story_ID: 351967
Speaker 1: And, but the thing is to, is to invent around it, I think is what can be interesting.  I have, I'm doing a lot of solo monologues and I have one called 'Willie's Lady Sing the Blues' ['Willie's Lady Sings the Blues'] and that came out of my work from Yale [Yale Repertory Theater] when I did Lady Macbeth, Emilia and Portia from 'Julius Caesar' [William Shakespeare] and I do them in a southern accent, and you see because the southern accent is Elizabethan.
Speaker 2: I was wondering why you were slipping into a southern accent.  Oh my God, that is great (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I just can't help myself when I do that.  And I do this lady in a bar and she's in her cups, you know, and she's talking about how William Shakespeare knew all about the blues because all his lady's sang the blues.  And so I would relate how Lady Macbeth you know had the problem with her husband and then she decided she going to kill the king and all that, and then she (laughter) she loses her courage, and I do the speech, you know.
Speaker 2: Did you write it?
Speaker 1: I wrote the, the little vignettes and then I would do the actual speeches and Emilia, too, you know and Portia from 'Julius Caesar,' you see, and Brutus.  (Laughter) And, and, and the language you know say, you have ungentley, Brutus, stole from my bed, and, yesternight at supper you suddenly arose and walked about musing and signing with your arms across and when you asked me what the matter was, you stared upon me with ungentle looks.  And I have not changed anything from Shakespeare.  You know, she do that and she goes through this, and I even put some, some of 'Hamlet' [William Shakespeare] in there, to be or not to be that is the question.  (Laughter) You see because she's contemplating whether she wanted, with her drinking, whether she wants to live, to be or not to be, you see, so I'm working on things like that.
Story_ID: 351968
Speaker 1: And I have 'The Creation' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's brilliant.
Speaker 1: --add that with my 'Creation,' which you know, and I'm looking for things like that.  So that, that way I can still do my movement but it doesn't--I'm not dancing per se because I know the older--I was very lucky, never had terrible injuries or anything, but there's certain wear and tear that is just natural.  So I have to think, if I want to stay, if I want to keep doing what I'm doing with Gus [HistoryMaker Gus Solomons jr.], or whomever, myself, I have to take that into consideration.
Speaker 2: What are you doing with the piece ['Willie's Lady Sings the Blues'] you were just (unclear)?
Speaker 1: I've been, I might do it again this--in another, hopefully next month in our showing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How long is that piece?
Speaker 1: It's about ten minutes--it's about ten minutes.
Speaker 2: Is that something you're looking to develop into a full length (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well somebody told me that they wanted me to do the full length in an evening (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think you should because I saw Lynn Redgrave and her whole show, 'Shakespeare For My Father'--
Speaker 1: Oh really?
Speaker 2: --is her talking about stories from her father, you know he was an actor, and then she'd go into scenes from these plays.
Speaker 1: One of--right, right.
Speaker 2: And she'd play all the characters, and not really all the characters but like in 'King Lear' [William Shakespeare], she'd be one particular daughter--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --or, you know, and it was fascinating and just sitting watching this two minutes of you, I could watch an evening of it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, well, you know, I'm trying to get an evening of monologues and things like that together but it's, you know, and I--
Speaker 2: You have the little Puerto Rican lady and the southern lady.
Speaker 1: But that's 'Windows,' I just got through doing that, Sylvia Bofill, from Puerto Rico and she had Helena [ph.], it was the best written in, the play needs work, it's a workshop, but I tell you, sweated blood with that thing, too, and, you know, I was around all the Latinos and I didn't want to you know make an ass of myself.  And, and, but I worked on Helena and I liked her because she was very tough but very caring lady, and she loved her granddaughter and she loved her daughter, but they didn't get along because she married a gringo.  (Laughter) I like her first husband, Ernesto [ph.], I like Ernesto.   I didn't, Henry [ph.], no, no, no, no, no, I don't like Henry.
Story_ID: 351969
Speaker 1: Did you learn all this--where did, where do you say you've learned this skill from? Do you say this is from Yale [Yale Repertory Theater], or is it something you always had in you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yale, or probably something I might of always had, you know.  And I do you know learn from the past.  When I did Googie Gomez [in 'The Ritz,' Terrence McNally], I remember the costume, I had to fit myself in this costume and the shoes were too short, which was good because you know, ladies put their feet in shoes that don't fit.  But when, during the '50s [1950s] at the Palladium [Hollywood Palladium, Los Angeles, California], the great Palladium, I remember a woman dancing cha-cha-cha, black hair the most beautiful black hair, simple pink dress and very little jewelry and she was dancing away those high heels and she turned and she had a broach on her behind.  I thought it was the most elegant, fabulous thing and that's all.  I said, my God that's beautiful, I mean, it was very simple, I said, incredible, right on her beautiful hip and I used that in Googie Gomez, I remember that woman.  And I used that, things like that you know, you remember things and you put them--.  And I remember how the women, Latino women are very vivacious and they're not afraid of their hips.  They have these little, and--you know the hippier the better, and they never apologize for it and they look wonderful, it works, it really works.  You know, it's nice to see ladies now not afraid of having hips like you know Beyonce and Latifah [Queen Latifah], and all that it's a wonderful thing to see.
Story_ID: 351970
Speaker 1: So when you look at the world of dance now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what are your concerns?  Do you have any?
Speaker 2: Oh well, you cannot beat the physicality.  Dancers today are, I'm just in awe, the body is extraordinary what these young people are doing with their bodies.  I'd like to see--but most of it is abstraction in counts, you know.  Some, it's amazing, some you watch and they innately have the whatever it is.  Contemporary people more so than--because I think, their work is sometimes a little more about the soul and not about counts and physicality.  The balletic things are a little more cou-, and some of the modern things are a little stiff for me.  But I would like to see more story things coming back, I miss that--I miss that.  Now I'm recreating 'The Portrait of Billie' ['The Portrait of Billie Holiday'] based on Billie Holiday, it was a duet that I had commissioned John Butler to do for me and it will be the Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] people are--they did it years ago but now it's back in the rep and it's opening this Wednesday.  And I had to coach the kids on, you know on the acting part about it.
Speaker 1: Are the kids the same today as when you were dancing?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: What's different?
Speaker 2: --the bodies are different.  They're much more technical, they're much more technical.
Speaker 1: Is that good or bad?
Speaker 2: It's good.  It's good.  But now if we can just fit the, some soul in there, sometimes-; because I mean the demand is great on them, you know, they've got to have the, the things they're doing is tremendous, I mean we were not chop liver either I must say, and a lot of the Ailey people are Horton-based technique [Lester Horton Technique] so it's very broad and very demanding work.  But I have such admiration for the dancers today, but you know they're so lucky because they can make a living if they can do, they can make a living.  I mean there was no such thing, I am not making any more now than when I first started.  I mean I'm over fifty years, I haven't made anything out of my career as far as the dance goes.
Speaker 1: You mean money.
Speaker 2: Money. In comparison to them, no nothing, nothing.  You know, so they're very--and I let them know that too, I mean (laughter) I think they understand.  But they're very lucky, they're very fortunate, my gosh the Ailey kids are living in a palace for crying out loud right now.  I was on wood floors and getting splinters up the leg you know what the heck is--.  You know, but I wouldn't trade it for the world because we were tough, we were tough.
Speaker 1: When you look back what stands out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the people before me, Janet [Janet Collins] was tough.
Speaker 1: Tough.
Speaker 2: And Talley [Talley Beatty] was tough and the people before that, all those Ballets Russes [Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo], they were tough people.
Story_ID: 351971
Speaker 1: You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When you look back through the years, what stands out for you?
Speaker 1: Oh I'm just I awe of all the things that I was, I was offered and I--and opened up to me and you were talking about what I thought--the saying, I remember Lester [Lester Horton] telling me, like when he told me about, when I first started 'Salome' [Lester Horton], he said, "You can't have what Bella [Bella Lewitzky] has, and she can't have what you have."  So I was never in competition with anybody so he gave me the freedom to find who I am and that's what I'm trying to do to the dancers.  I have three couples doing the piece I said, "You're each different, you have to find that character.  I'm not telling you everything that I--.  You have to do the work, I'm not going to do all your work for you, you see."  I also choreographed a duet for the Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] people a couple years ago, three years ago, 'Sweet Bitter Love,' Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway songs, same thing I said, "No dancing allowed, no counting allowed, you have the technique already, let's get to what we're doing here, it's a love affair that's breaking up," okay and that's what we're getting at.  I had three couples again I said, "You're each different, you do not count--each story's going to be different, the steps are going to be the same but each one's telling the story a little differently."  That keeps them from trying to compete with one another and they must find their way of working, does that make sense?  So that they don't feel that they have to be like somebody, they're not like anybody but themselves.  Can't possibly, they're all different, shapes, sizes and forms, and even in the choreography it's got to adjust sometimes because our lengths are different.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's like everyone reading the same story but you have ask them what did you take away from it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To be or not to be.  You hear Hamlet, everybody's going to say it different, the words are there but it's going to be different.
Speaker 2: And it means something different to everyone.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 351972
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What is it you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Making people happy, I'm not, I'm not kidding, that when you perform it takes you to another place and I had that wish.  I was--I did 'The Creation' on television and I got a letter from a lady--gosh, it just kills me, and I can't, I put it away and I can't find it--that, who was in a wheelchair, and she said, for those moments, she was not in the chair.  She was not in the chair when she was watching on television and I said, "Work well done."  See that's what--.  So you can transport, take their, whatever day that they had and transport them someplace else, and that's my job in life.  You know, I mean, I'm a dancer, yes, I mean I'm certainly not like a statesman.  I mean if I can do 'The Creation' and change the world in, in Darfur [Sudan], and in South--and what's happening in Iraq, I would love to do that.  If that's what I could do, that's what I, you know what I'm talking about.  I'm not a statesman of anything but if there's one thing I can do, it's take one thing transport people into a place where they would see a different world and change them, that's what I'd like to do, if it's at all possible (laughter).
Story_ID: 351973
Speaker 1: So I have one more question for you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that came to us from someone who knew we were going to interview you, sent a couple of questions, but--.  You've worked with Lester Horton, you've worked with Alvin Ailey, you've been a prima donna [sic. prima ballerina], you've worked for Metropolitan Opera and you worked with great choreographers, you've worked in film and what we'd like to know is what is it about you that's allowed you to move so seamlessly from modern to ballet, ballet to modern, from stage to film, film to stage?
Speaker 2: Curiosity I suppose.  And, and I try to trust myself and it's not easy because I get terrible anxiety.  But it was very nice to know that the best of the actors like Sir Laurence [Laurence Olivier] and Cherry Jones, all those people got stage fright. I think, and somebody said because you're so intent on being perfect--it's impossible (laughter), it's impossible you can't be perfect and I think be-, it's the challenge--it's the challenge, it's to take the challenge is scary, when I tell you frightened to do these things but I just feel I have to do it, I just think it's, it's, it's nourishing.
Speaker 1: So when you and I are no longer on planet Earth--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what do you think will be written about your contributions to dance?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I hope it's good.  Well I just like to, you know, for the young people, I just want to be as, to find themselves so that they don't feel they have to fit into a--
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you this. So they feel they don't have to fit into--complete your thought.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Fit into a, they have to be like somebody else. Just to find themselves because that makes the art much richer than to try to copy somebody and be somebody who you're not.  It takes a lifetime--it takes a lifetime to find out who you are and even probably when you leave, you don't know who you are because you're a different person every day.  You know and that's hard- that's not easy but it is an adventure, that's for sure.
Speaker 1: Well I was going to ask you what it is you think learned that you're teaching them but you've already answered that question and it's in that statement that Lester [Lester Horton] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You always learn.
Speaker 1: --told you.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That I, you can't be like somebody and you can't be like Bella [Bella Lewitzky] and Bella can't be like you. And that life changes all the time and you're a different person and your experiences make who you are, so it's, and I can look at television or read and I try to learn from whatever I hear.  And I really mean--in one of my things you asked me what I like to do aside from going down the Nile [Nile River] (laughter) in full moon, is to do 'The Creation' at the Vatican [Vatican City].  And if I could do it, I'd put it right out in front of the Blue Mosque [Sultan Ahmed Mosque] in Jerusalem [sic. Istanbul, Turkey], I'm not kidding because it's--I think it says everything.  You created, you know, the force created man and--and they gotta shape up (laughter).
