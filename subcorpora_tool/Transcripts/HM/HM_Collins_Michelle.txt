Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers, our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Okay, it's Michelle Lynn Collins [HistoryMaker Michelle L. Collins]. Michelle, M-I-C-H-E-L-L-E, Lynn, L-Y-N-N, and Collins, C-O-L-L-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 27th, 1960, and here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: All right, and ma'am what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, currently I am a consultant to small and medium sized companies, and a private investor.
Speaker 1: Okay, would you consider yourself to be a--venture capitalist?
Speaker 2: That had been my profession in really private equity, because I was focused on buyouts, so venture capital focuses on really tiny companies that are startup oriented.  I focused on more established businesses, but generally private equity was where I was--what my occupation was, then I just switched my position in the last year or so, and I'm really focusing on equity investments, so venture capital would fit for what I'm doing currently--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just as an individual, not at a company (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is February 21st, 19--excuse me, 2008 (laughter).
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at The HistoryMakers head office [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 615021
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that management compels me to ask of every one--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Okay--you want me to answer you? French fries (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a toughie, but I will say Jamaica, since that was most recent.
Speaker 1: Okay. And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have one that sticks with me quite--I don't know that it's a favorite, but it is, you know, happiness is self-sufficient, and thus the end of action.
Story_ID: 615022
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and your father's [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side first, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's Elizabeth Ann Terry Collins [Elizabeth Terry Collins].  E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, Ann, A-N-N, and Terry, T-E-R-R-Y, and Collins, C-O-L-L-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 20th, 1938.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Pittsburgh, okay, now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly enough, there is one of our family members, who went back several generations, so we were--I don't know the actual dates, but was able to go back at least, you know, three or four generations beyond my mom, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were your ancestors doing, back in history?
Speaker 2: Well, they were--this part of the family, was primarily centered in the East Coast, in Virginia, and I believe that--I'm not sure exactly which level he was-- but, Warren Quincy Marr [sic. John Quincy Marr], I believe, was his name, married--not married, but had children with an Indian [Native American] woman [Eliza Nickens], and from there, that started the strain of our family, that we could trace, so it was through that relationship that we were able to get some information.  I believe that he might have been a grandfather to my grandmother [Margaret Marr Terry], and that was basically just how they were in that part of the geography, and the family basically somehow migrated from Virginia to Pittsburgh, but I don't really know the details.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are you related to Warren Marr [HistoryMaker Warren Marr, II] and [HistoryMaker] Carmel Marr in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Sure.  That Warren is my mom's uncle--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Carmel is her aunt by marriage.
Speaker 1: And Warren Marr has something to do with the founding of the Amistad Center [Amistad Research Center, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Correct, yes.
Speaker 1: Down in Tulane [Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana] and--okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was very much involved with that--f- in--as long as we can remember, he was family because he would come visit us and take all of our photos so, (laughter), but he was very passionate about that, and he was very passionate about building this Mystic Seaport ship [Mystic, Connecticut], you know, called the Amistad [Freedom Schooner Amistad], so he was very much behind, you know, creating that, and sort of envisioning that, and getting some funding for getting that done.
Speaker 1: So he's your uncle right?  Your, your great--
Speaker 2: My great uncle, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: A wonderful, wonderful, character, he's--I would visit him, he and Carmel, in Brooklyn [New York], where they lived, when I was in college [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and he wrote for The Crisis magazine, at one point, and you know, always fancied himself, both writing and he did a lot of artistic things, and you know, so he had great stories of, some of the musicians, and people like that in the neighborhood that would come and visit with them, and just sounded like a really very rich experience.
Speaker 1: Right, I think--and Carmel worked with Ralph Bunche in the development of the United Nations, I think so.
Speaker 2: I understand that that's true, I remember hearing from a very long time ago, that she was one of the tops in her class, if not the top, at Columbia Law School [New York, New York], I think potentially in 1949 [sic. 1948]--is that possible?  And she worked with Henry Cabot Lodge, I believe, so yeah, she was a pretty accomplished person, and they were great dancers by the way, (laughter), so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they, they're quite a couple, the Marrs (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm yeah, they are, um-hm.
Story_ID: 615023
Speaker 1: Any other stories about the Marrs you know, that predates them even?  So, you, you, you had a, an ancestor Warren Quincy Marr [sic. John Quincy Marr] who married an Indian [Native American] woman, you said--
Speaker 2: Yes, I believe her name--
Speaker 1: --and that's the line that you descended from.
Speaker 2: Yes, I believe her name was Eliza Nickens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we actually have found a couple of relatives through these strains, here in Chicago [Illinois], but unfortunately I don't know how they all sort of line up, but that Warren Marr [HistoryMaker Warren Marr, II] who's married to Carmel [HistoryMaker Carmel Marr], actually did all the research, he was the one who actually went back and he wrote a book that I haven't read, recently, but sort of made all these connections, because the family was fairly large and there were a lot of Marrs sort of running around Northeast.
Speaker 1: Is, is, the book published?
Speaker 2: It is in the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.], I understand, and we have a couple of copies, but I don't think that it's like for general--
Speaker 1: Widely published--
Speaker 2: --publication, yeah.  It's really, I think it's like a gift for us to get to know.
Speaker 1: Nickens, is an interesting name. There with some famous A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] ministers, David Nickens [David L. Nickens], in Chillicothe, Ohio was one (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. And I, I don't know them--yeah--
Speaker 1: Letters that were published and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know them, but I appreciate hearing that because there is a person named Enos Lesende [ph.], who's sister, I believe, wrote a book and her last name was Nickens, so we're just trying to find out if there's a connection and then Susan Campbell [ph.], just by accident, somebody that I grew up with, who lives here in Chicago, about my same age, her grand-great-grandmother, was the sister of my great-grandmother, so we found out that we were cousins by just talking and she happened to mention the name.  So there're fairly--are you know, just a large number of people running around, (laughter), that are related.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Now, so how did the family get to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?  Is there a story?
Speaker 2: I actually don't know that story, I don't know how my mom [Elizabeth Terry Collins]--how the Marrs got there.  I don't know what got them to that place. I do know that they were there for at least one to two generations, because of just some of the stories that I've heard.   I think my grandmother's father [Leesther Marr], may have been a butler or something, like that for the Mellon family, or some work for the Mellon family, so that was a tidbit, and then my grandfather [John Terry] who was born in had gone to Pittsburgh looking for work essentially, and somehow met my grandmother [Margaret Marr Terry].
Speaker 1: Okay, Mellon family, that's Andrew Mellon the great financier--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the banking family, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so this would be a great-grandfather or something that worked for--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Pittsburgh. Now is your family associated with the A.M.E. church in Pit- Pittsburgh at all?
Speaker 2: I'm not positive actually, although, it wouldn't surprise me if they were very much churchgoing people, but I don't know for sure.
Speaker 1: Does the family have a church affiliation in general or just different churches?
Speaker 2: I--you know, our, my family my--the nucleus of my family, we are actually Unitarian so, we have been to a lot of different churches, but actually haven't picked a particular denomination.  I mean I was brought up Presbyterian, I was baptized Presbyterian, but we were brought up in the Unitarian church so, I don't really know.
Story_ID: 615024
Speaker 1: So, I take it your mother [Elizabeth Terry Collins] grew up in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did she grow up in the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], or, or, in a particular neighborhood that you, know about?
Speaker 2: I know it was Joshua Street and I couldn't tell you about geography, but I will say that the August Wilson plays, she loved those because she recognized a lot of the, you know, the locations that he talked about and you know, funeral homes, and things like that, they were--she was very familiar with a lot of that geography, so it must have been around there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like the Hill District of Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's what he writes about, the Hill District of Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: Okay, uh-hm.
Speaker 1: So, so did your mother have any stories of growing up and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had lots of stories, because my--she was an only child, but my grandmother [Margaret Marr Terry] was one of six and so the six were fairly independent, and some were fairly artistic, and a couple of them I believe, moved to New York [New York], and really spent a lot of time--her--seemed to have a very interesting lifestyle, from her perspective as a young child going to visit them.  She also talked a little bit about traveling a lot which, you know, was sort of unusual because she was a young girl and they'd put her on a train, and she'd go visit a relative somewhere, in the general vicinity, of course, but sounded very exciting and lots of fun and you know, very rich.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you know what high school she went to in Pittsburgh?
Speaker 2: I do not, actually, no.  I'm sure she said it, but I don't recall the name of it.  I don't recall the name of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Should have looked this up before I came, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but she finished high school there right?
Speaker 2: Yes she did.
Speaker 1: Did she go on to college?
Speaker 2: She went to college at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She--you know, that was one of the stories that we heard a lot about.  I think she'd had a scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], I believe, and maybe some encouragement to go to the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], but she chose to go to Fisk at my grandmother's urging because she really wanted to be with other African Americans.
Story_ID: 615025
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father's side of the family (unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Okay, it's Rosecrain, that's one word, R-O-S-E-C-R-A-I-N, Collins, C-O-L-L-I-N-S, Jr. [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story behind the name Rosecrain?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, only that somebody else had it, that's pretty much it. We don't know where it came from or we're not--no place that we've ever heard, and in fact, the family calls him Junior, so nobody ever actually uses it, but--
Speaker 1: So, they call him Junior most of the time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all his family calls him Junior and his buddies call him sometimes from--by his last name, or, and I think they called him J.E., for some reason, when he was in college, in dental school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now what's your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It's February 14th, 1929, and I believe it was Southside, Tennessee. I don't know if that town is still named that or not, but it's right outside--I believe Clarksville [Tennessee]--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --which is right near Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: --all right, okay, so what do you know about his side, of the family?
Speaker 2: I don't know a lot, because no one has actually written anything down, but there, it was a large family, there were four Collinses, and then five Batsons.  His, his, father [Rosecrain Collins, Sr.] passed away at a really young--when he was very young, my dad, and his mother then went to the city, to get some work, so they were on a farm initially, and then his mother went to the city to get some work and that's how she landed in Nashville. She married Ewing Batson, who was my father's stepfather, and there are five Batsons, so that's pretty much, you know, what we know.  The--I think back in Southside, there were--oh it was a very dominated Collins group. All I know is that, that, everywhere you went there were a lot of Collins, you know, signs, and the cemetery was filled with all these Collinses and stuff, but we don't have any sort of tree, if you will, as is typical, sort a lot of oral history, and you can't pull it all together, which we probably should be doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father grew up in Nashville, I understand?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was on the farm for the early part of his year and then--of his life, and then, I'm not sure at what age, but it was when he was a teenager, or young teenager, that he actually moved to Nashville, just to partially get work, and help to support the family, while he was going through school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any real old stories about the family, about, about slavery or the Civil War, or any stories like that?
Speaker 2: No, we can't--we actually asked that question, and at least I have not heard any about it, and-- but we would certainly suspect that there must be some tie in there, but that's just conjecture.
Speaker 1: So your father moves to Nashville as a teenager, now did he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah, like twelve or thirteen, kind of teenager, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did he finish high school in Nashville?
Speaker 2: He did finish high school, I know he did take a year off, to work for the family, but he finished high school, there's a--called Pearl High School [Pearl - Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it's a lot of people from Nashville seemed to have gone there, and then he went to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], and then he went to the Meharry dental school [Meharry Medical College School of Dentistry, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, so now I think I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's coming up on his fiftieth reunion from Meharry, so, which is nice.
Story_ID: 615026
Speaker 1: I think I understand where your parents met now.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay. Yes, as it's not atypical, actually.
Speaker 1: So we got 'em, we got 'em both in Nashville [Tennessee] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly--
Speaker 1: You know, in their college years.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right--
Speaker 1: Okay. So is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know about the very first time that they met, but I do know that my mother [Elizabeth Terry Collins] was in college [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], and my father [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] was in graduate school [Meharry Medical College School of Dentistry, Nashville, Tennessee]. I do know that so that was a little bit of time difference, and I do remember that my mother who I think went there, and you know, had a lot of support, and, you know, had a really good time, as well as obviously worked hard, but my dad had to work, and go to school. His family was there and he's the oldest boy and you know, had to kind of look out for the rest of his siblings, so my mother would joke about the fact that when he would go out on a date, he would have about fifty cents, you know twenty-five cents for you know, gas and twenty-five cents for a fish sandwich somewhere, but that was about the extent of it but, you know, she didn't hold that against him and you know, they had lots of, you know, good times I think and, and obviously you know, decided to have a life together.
Story_ID: 615027
Speaker 1: Are you related to any of the Collinses in Chicago [Illinois], the, the entrepreneurial Collins?  I thought I'd ask that, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, unh-uh, no, we're not.
Speaker 1: But you know what family I'm talking about, right?
Speaker 2: The Harvey Collinses [Harvey D. Collins]?
Speaker 1: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, people ask me that a lot, but no, we aren't related to them, not to our knowledge, and there's another set of Collinses, who were actually in Nashville [Tennessee], at the same time, Roosevelt Collins, who was also a dentist, and graduated about the same time as my dad [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.], and his wife Jean [Jean Collins (ph.)], who knew, grew up with my dad, so they were, were, buddies you know, since high school [Pearl High School; Pearl - Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee]I think, and were actually very close those two families, but we're not related.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So people often mistake me as the daughter of Jean, as opposed to my mom Ann [Elizabeth Terry Collins], so.
Story_ID: 615028
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, and talents--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and dispositions--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: That's a great question because I--it has changed over time, and I think it as I find myself in the middle part of my life, you know, very much a mixture, not necessarily that they are a--fit together per se, I mean, they're just two sides, so what I mean by that is my dad [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] very focused, very specific to get to a certain point, very disciplined, you know, fairly serious, my mom is--and he's very, I should say, very aware of, and very focused on providing for the family.  My mother [Elizabeth Terry Collins] on the other hand, you know, sort of through her relationships, with other people, her relationships brought a sort of broad experience, a lot of diversity in her family, from just where people came and how they chose to live and the like, so, hers is much more outward, you know, focused, if you will, in you know, how she cared for other people, you know very empathetic-- empathic--excuse me.  You know she's a public school teacher for most of her career, and all those traits, I find that I've got both of those, they don't always--sometimes they rub up against one another, so you sort of feel like you're--okay, which way do I go on this particular issue--but anyway, definitely feel both, the both of them are within me (laughter).
Story_ID: 615029
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Sure I do, I have a couple, one was actually being in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], but I think was like maybe two or three, and I'd actually that particular time, I may have been there for Christmas, and had been pretty,  actually ill, that Christmas, and so--I just remember it being really cold and (laughter)--I'm just trying to, you know, get through essentially, but there's some pictures that probably have informed that memory a little bit, just because, I got my first piano and all these, and my [maternal] grandparents [Margaret Marr Terry and John Terry] were showering me with gifts so, but, it was a very good memory. I have some other memories of being in Pittsburgh, also early when my grandparents lived there, they moved to Chicago [Illinois], shortly, when I was probably four or five or something, but during those years that I was visiting, you know, the hills, and they had a dog named, you know, Mr. Chips [ph.], and on the top of the hill, rolling down, that really big hill that they lived on, you know, they had some other cousins that had a vineyard in the back, which I'd had never seen before, and you know, lots of family oriented types of situations, and just remembering how hilly Pittsburgh was.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did you visit Pittsburgh a lot when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I think we were there probably once or twice a year, as we were to Nashville [Tennessee] also.  So I have memories of Nashville that seem to be later, and I think it was mainly just because of the activity was a little bit different.  My father's [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] sister she and her husband had a restaurant called Debra's [ph.], I have a cousin named Debra, and Debra's was a fun place to be. It was kind of a diner, but it was the hangout place in Nashville, it was very popular for a fair amount of time, so I have a lot of good, fun, memories there, because it was big, all my cousins were there and working, and getting through school that way.
Story_ID: 615030
Speaker 1: Describe the neighborhood that you lived in, in Chicago [Illinois]. I mean that you grew up in, in Chicago (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, grew up on--my first recollection, I should say that I, I know we lived in an apartment building, when I was first born, but I don't remember that so much--we may come back to that part later--I grew up on 83rd [Street] and Prairie [Avenue], from you know, let's call it one or two or something, 'til I was six or seven, and it was sort of a typical, you know, sort of, nice box houses, you know, very clean block, lots of kids playing outside, very close to the family next door, the Langhart [ph.], family, you know one of my closest friends was the kid that lived next door that was my age, named Peter [ph.], and it was, you know, very--it was a just fun.  It was just very fun and life, if you will, and it felt very classic, if you will, classic American sort of upbringing, and then at seven, I move to Jackson Park Highlands [Jackson Park Highlands District, Chicago, Illinois] area, 67th [Street] and Euclid [Avenue], my parents [Elizabeth Terry Collins and Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] still live there, and that was a similarly positive, you know, place to live, but was much more diverse, you know, whereas, the first situation was all African American families, to my knowledge. I don't remember that it was diverse at all, but 67th and Euclid, we were, one of early African American families, into the neighborhood, so there was a lot of every other nationality around, in part, because a lot of the people from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] were living in that area at the time.
Speaker 1: Right, it's still--there're still some people in the ar- you know, well to do white people living in that area.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm. Yeah, absolutely, yeah, absolutely, so--
Speaker 1: Surrounded by total black neigh- neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Right. Yeah, absolutely, so yeah, I remember that, both places though were, were, you know, I remember a lot of being outdoors, and being able to be outdoors and visiting one of my today, closest friends, actually she lived in Jackson Park Highlands, but about four blocks away, so we'd meet halfway, whenever we went to each other's house, and so you know, it was very, you know, safe and comfortable, I guess, in that sense, you felt very free.
Story_ID: 615031
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: White shrimp--White's Shrimp [White's Original Shrimp/Fish, Chicago, Illinois] (laughter), I remember that, going there, and I think that was on like 71st [Street] or 73rd Street.
Speaker 1: Oh, on 71st Street [sic. 75th Street], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, so, you know, barbecue, lots of barbecue, always a barbecue going on, Orange Crush, lawn, you know lawns being mowed, you know, the Saturday activity for most of the families, those are, those are, you know, let's put this frugally, which is, I guess the part that stands out the most, but a lot of lawn, and being outdoors, so.
Speaker 1: What did you particularly like to do, what, what, were you--your interests for the most part?
Speaker 2: The, in the early stages?
Speaker 1: Yeah, growing up as a little girl.
Speaker 2: I just--you know I remember, you know again, played outside a lot, I, you know we had lots of kids on the block, and I remember having popsicles every day, bringing everybody in, and you know, playing--this friend Peter [ph.] was, would be playing cowboys and Indians [Native American], and driving my little Thunderbird car [Ford Thunderbird], or whatever, so we--it was lot of activity outdoors.  I do remember that, you know, I had a pretty feisty personality at the time and, you know, we would end up getting into some arguments now and then, because my parents [Elizabeth Terry Collins and Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] would actually tell me about, because, they would talk about how ridiculous some of the conversations was, but we had a sandbox in my backyard, and I remember getting up and not realizing that the sandbox was gonna tilt when I did, and it knocked my friend over and he started screaming at me, and you know, and I jus- and my father thought it was pretty funny because he just completely did not pay any attention, like, "I don't know what your problem is but, go sit down again," and what have you, so those kinds of things come back.  I think also some other memories, that relate to the fact that there was actually an older crowd, you know I was the oldest in my family. My father's younger brother actually lived with us for a little while, and he was friends with some other people, so there was this other activity that was completely disassociated from me personally, but I remember observing how teenagers and young adults behaved, or didn't behave, (laughter), growing up too, so that was actually another important part, you know, and I'm pretty close to that particular uncle.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have any brothers and sisters at all?
Speaker 2: Sure, yeah, one sister. Her name's Adrienne [Adrienne Collins King] and she's four years younger than I am.  She lives in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] also, and you know, we're very close. So absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so just the one?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 615032
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Ye- not in the sense of being there a lot, but it was always present in that we did go to Sunday school, we did, you know, have to--the institution was present, but not a particular denomination.  And I remember on the days that I lived on Prairie [Avenue], you know, that we would go to church, that was--I can't--it was Crerar Church [Crerar Memorial Presbyterian Church, Chicago, Illinois], that I was actually baptized in. It was Presbyterian church, and it seemed to be kind of a neighborhood place, if I'm not mistaken, and so it was present. My [maternal] grandparents [Margaret Marr Terry and John Terry] always went to church, you know, that was a very big part of their Sundays obviously, and but it was also a very present, because my parents chose to go to the Unitarian church, when we moved to 67th [Street] and Euclid [Avenue], I think my father [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] was brought up as Baptist, and not sure what my mom [Elizabeth Terry Collins] was, to your question earlier about the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, could have been, but she just kind of, you know, heavy emphasis on organized religion. They wanted to, you know, get a little bit away from that, and actually, you know, really just get into what the different religions are and have some religious background but not force a particular denomination on any of us.  And so--

Speaker 1: The Unitarian church is really where we kind of grew up, we--my mother [Elizabeth Terry Collins] taught Sunday school at the Unitarian church, in South Shore [Chicago, Illinois], and then, we currently are all members of the Unitarian church in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], and I would say fairly active as we've gotten older.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, all right, now was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 1: Not explicitly, you know, we, we, you know, I took piano lessons, classical piano lessons like many kids did, and that stuck with both me and my sister [Adrienne Collins King], so music today is actually a fairly meaningful thing for both of us, but through some of the, through that background essentially, but it really wasn't, we didn't have any one who was really like a musician, that we, you know, sort of followed or anything like that, we just listened to it, like other people did.
Story_ID: 615034
Speaker 1: Was you know, TV, radio, movies, other popular culture stuff, a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: No, you know, actually, I would say that if there was a dominant theme in my mind, it is the family stuff, you know, basically, because there were even in my early years, I remember lots of family members visiting, and always somebody coming and going, and we were always visiting there, and then later on when my grandparents, my mother's parents [Margaret Marr Terry and John Terry], moved to Chicago [Illinois], they were very present and, and then, even later as my dad [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] who, you know, he lived here in Chicago, his brother, lives here in Chicago, but everybody else pretty much stayed in Nashville [Tennessee], so as I got older, I was very cognizant that there was sort of the rest of this family that wasn't just somebody that we visited, every couple of years, but something that he was very actively keeping tabs on, and trying to help out, where things--when things were needed, or if there were issues or something like that, so it grew and it was nothing that they ever stated, but it was sort of observations that, you know, as I became older, I began to understand, a little bit that, you know, he had a lot of responsibilities, more than just the two of us, and my mom [Elizabeth Terry Collins].
Story_ID: 615035
Speaker 1: Your parents lived in a pretty well to do part of Chicago [Illinois] on the South Side, did, would, did were their friends, some of the movers and shakers, in the city, or I mean in the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, I think they knew a lot of people who, you know, who were very accomplished, a lot of those people actually stemmed from in the dental and medical community, initially, and continuing, but you know, through those relationships and I think just being here, and some of the parents, of friends of mine, you know, from school [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], and the like, you know they met a number of other people, but they didn't sort of define themselves, I guess by that, at all, by who they knew, or what have you, they just, you know, liked to have good friends, so--
Speaker 1: I know sometimes when, you know, people grow up in those situations, and they meet all kinds of people, they're not really fully aware of the significance of, until later on in life, (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --you know, are there people like that that came through your house?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, I--yes, I'm sure that, that's true, you know, although, I wouldn't recognize that really, probably the only ones that would really fit that category is--I remember my mom [Elizabeth Terry Collins], actually taught school with a woman who was married to Cirilo McSween early on, and so as a result of that and the activities that were going on, and the Civil Rights Movement, you know, we were very aware of activities of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, Cirilo McSween. Yeah, he, he was very active with Dr. King and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, correct, right--
Speaker 1: --he was known in Chicago as the owner, of quite a few importantly placed Mc-McDonald's restaurants.
Speaker 2: Exactly, right, absolutely, absolutely, so that would be an example of sort of knowing them, through actually going with my mom to her school, and seeing them, and their girls, Esperanza [Esperanza McSween Powell] and Veronica [Veronica McSween], and knowing who Cirilo was through the McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] part, but not really recognizing his active role at the time, until much later.  So that would be one example of it but, you know, I--a lot of the people that were friends, are people that remain friends, but were people that they knew when nobody had anything, and you know, they pretty steady eddy people, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, now where was your father's [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] practice?
Speaker 2: It was initially on 51st [Street] and I think, either Cottage Grove [Avenue], or King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], one of those places.  I actually could point it to you, if I could go look at it, and which was, you asked about childhood memories, I would have to go stay there after school on most days as a young person, in elementary school, and then some time I think--I'm not sure of the exact date but it might have been the early '70s [1970s], that he moved to the Hyde Park bank building [Hyde Park Kenwood National Bank Building, Chicago, Illinois], and then he ended his practice there.
Story_ID: 615036
Speaker 1: Where did you start school? Now, you started school at--did you, I, I know you went to the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], but did you start at the Lab School?
Speaker 2: No, I actually, I remember that I attended probably two, or three, or four, nursery schools, because I have a couple of memories of my dad [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] feeling that the school was not good enough for me, so he'd pick me up and take me up, and say to my mom [Elizabeth Terry Collins], "Okay, you gotta find a place for her to go to school tomorrow."  You know, my mother was working too, so it was not very convenient, but I definitely remember those situations, it was because he was sort of, was very particular, about where he wanted me to go.  I went to O'Keeffe [Isabelle C. O'Keeffe Elementary School; Isabelle O'Keeffe School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois], which was a kinder--it was a public school around 67th [Street] or 68th [Street], and it's east, a few blocks east, from where we lived--
Speaker 1: Merrill [Avenue], or past Merrill, something like that--
Speaker 2: Merrill, something like that, yeah, exactly, and went there for kindergarten, and then went to the Lab Schools for first grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So O'Keeffe was--you know, some of the neighborhood kids kind of, on my block, we went there, and you know, it was a little bit of an interesting experience, but as I've mentioned, my mom was a teacher, and so I was often after school with the principal, because I was always going after some kid for something, that would happen in the class, so I think that I was a little bit of a troublemaker actually, so--that's how I may have ended up at Lab.
Story_ID: 615037
Speaker 1: How did you like University of Chicago Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It was great, it is a place that I am, you know, very grateful for having the opportunity to have gone there, and remain very committed to it, even today, it was--it's gone through a little bit of it's changes over time and when I went there, it probably had a little bit more of this experimental kind of, you know, feel to it, but the most important part of it, is that the people were just incredibly motivated, and they were, you know, bright, but you didn't feel, you know, with some people I think when they go to schools like that, they feel like they're pushed. I didn't feel that at all.  You know the most important things for me aside from a great education, were, you know, some of my friends, who are still some of my closest friends today, I met in those early grades there, and just quite grateful for that opportunity.  And I know it was a bit of a work for my parents [Elizabeth Terry Collins and Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] to sort of come up with private school tuition, but they did.
Speaker 1: Well, who were some of the friends that you met there?
Speaker 2: Well, you know it was a wonderful group of people, you know, the first most important person was Janice Cook [Janice Cook Roberts]. She was someone I met in second grade, and we became fast friends, and it was actually through Janice that I met another friend, named Kevan Cooke [ph.], who lived in my neighborhood [Jackson Park Highlands District, Chicago, Illinois], and the two of them be--were my closest friends, pretty much, from that time through all the way 'til today.  You know, each of us have friends we've met from other places, and are probably pretty close with those other people, but Janice and Kevan sort of remain very much the bedrock, you know, they know me the best, and you know, just have the longest history with them.
Speaker 1: Now, are they related?
Speaker 2: They're not related--
Speaker 1: Just really two Cooks.
Speaker 2: Just really--one is with E, Kevan is Cooke with an E, and Janice is Cook without an E.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now I heard that you went to school with John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] too?
Speaker 2: I did go to school with John Rogers. He was I think two years older than I was, or ahead of me or however you might like to put it, but he became a friend, right about the eighth or ninth grade timeframe, I used to, I remember meeting him because he lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], and Janice lived in Hyde Park, and it's where I spent a lot of time, so I think I might have met him earlier, but then in high school, I think he came to Lab Schools in high school, if I'm not mistaken.  I'm not positive about that but--I think that's where I remember meeting him (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, Okay.
Story_ID: 615038
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in, in, in grade school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Math, math (laughter).
Speaker 1: Math?  Okay, all right, that, this probably may sound silly but did, did, you like to count money (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have money to--well actually, you know, I did, because I--my parents [Elizabeth Terry Collins and Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] bought me a cash register when I was in--lived on 83rd [Street] and Prairie [Avenue], and I used to actually play store, and have people come and bring things that they could buy from me. So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had your own cash register?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was pretty focused on having to make a living, (laughter), so it was pretty important.  But, you know, at Lab [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], it was, when I mentioned this sort of experimental thing. I'm sure I probably have a little of a natural inclination towards it but, it got enhanced in my third grade because of a teacher who I believe her experiment was, what would kids do without a teacher, which sounded a lot like kindergarten for third graders right?  And, but, I did math the entire year, so that was, you know, where, at least in my own mind, you know, it sort of took off from there, because that was where I spent most of my time.
Speaker 1: So you were in a situation where you were allowed to do math all year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: It was kind of interesting, 'cause it--well we had some other subject matters, you know, science and gym and you know, there might have been reading or something like that, but, but, still out of the day, a lot of your homeroom time, was pretty much--you could go through whatever subjects, and I chose to do math, pretty much during that time period, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's unusual. There aren't a lot of women that confess that they love math, you know (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, here's the odd part. I actually, probably don't add and subtract well, but I go to theorems and things like that so, (laughter), that was, you know, that just sort of came from that training I think.
Speaker 1: So do you think that, that perception is probably erroneous or just a part of cultural bias or what do you think it's--
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not actually sure. I know that I've definitely worked with people who are--met people, who absolutely believed that women in math kind of diverged, as they get older so that, you know, even when you don't remember things, or, you know, I remember somebody actually saying that to me, and it was like, you must be kidding me (laughter).  It was, you know, such a revelation, but you know, I don't think that that has to be true at all. I just think that that's what people sort of pithy, they're believed from old experiences, and they just kind of put it on, 'cause there are a number of women, I'm in the finance community, and there are tons of women in there, and there are a lot of data hogs and you know, you know, I feel very comfortable in that setting, you know, that--where, where math or finance or science might be, you know, prevalent.
Story_ID: 615039
Speaker 1: Now did you have any particular special teachers or mentors, you know, at Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: You know, I loved all of my teachers. I think I can remember almost every single name, the--out of there there weren't special ones, but there were a lot that I, you know really liked and cared about, you know, I remember the first African American teacher I had was named Mrs. Miguel [ph.], or Miss Miguel, and she was my second grade teacher--again, that year was the year I met Janice [Janice Cook Roberts]--and she, you know supposedly, she died, when we were in third grade, and there were some questions to whether she had committed suicide or not, and I remember Janice and I being very vocal about that fact that she would never do such a thing, you know, and really fighting with some of the teachers, about that, but it was significant because we hadn't actually seen other than, like my mom [Elizabeth Terry Collins], at the schools that she went to, other African American teachers, so that was significant in really why I thought that she was really cool, you know, fun to be around as well.  There was another teacher, Mrs. Williams [ph.], she was sixth grade. She was another African American teacher, both of--she was fun, but she was a disciplinarian, and, you know, we were right at that age where we were, you know, we were, Janice and I were pretty big pranksters and we were a little bit taller than everybody so we were sort of the bullies in that sense.  Not bullies, bullies, but, you know, we liked to play jokes on some people and Mrs. Williams, was one of the few who could reign us in, so she was significant.  Mrs. Camparos, [ph.], our fifth grade teacher, she, I think I was in her first--I think she was--I'm sorry, she was my fourth grade teacher, she was first, I was in her first class I guess, and I actually just saw her about a year and a half ago, where she had just retired, so she was standing with one of her students from her last class, but she was actually, you know, I think a lot of it was, she was Greek, I remember she took us to a Greek restaurant, and things like that, so she sort of stood out for that reason, the third grade teacher had this experiment--she looked just like Cher, her name was Mrs. Eilsdorf [ph.], you know, so everybody had a little something and going to Lab Schools, people hang around, so, you know Mrs. Camparos, Mrs. Goldschmidt [ph.], you know, Mr. Wilson [ph.], all these people, they all sort of stayed around and, you know, stayed in your life, if you will, as you were continuing to grow up.
Story_ID: 615040
Speaker 1: I think there were a couple of other people, interestingly, my piano teacher, Mrs. Brett [ph.], was very meaningful to me because she--in, in part, because she got to know their life a little bit, in a one on one setting and so, she had a husband, who actually had a disability, and so her--she was a great joy in her life, but she had this kind of existence where she had to kind of work with us, and she was very, you know, wonderful to be around, but, then she had to go home and it's a very, sort of a care giving role, once I remember being very sensitive, to that, and then my ballet teacher, Mr. Bachman [ph.], he had--he actually was paralyzed, he was apparently a well known and very talented ballet master and as he was growing up, and you know, but then somehow had multiple sclerosis I believe, and so, we actually learned ballet from him while he was in a wheelchair, which was--his wife would demonstrate, but he would--and he was very good, actually produced a number of people, not me, but others to go on who pursued ballet professionally, so--
Speaker 2: Well, it sound like a pretty active youth, I guess, you're dancing, piano lessons, math, and all that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and sports, you know, you know, my friends, you know, we played tennis, and you know, as we grew older, we played basketball, and you know, it was just a, yeah it was, very rich, and active. We purs- we wanted to do well and you know, have a group of friends and an environment, in which that was sort of expected, without sort of again, said not really pushing, we're just sort of, you know, we all sort of took it for granted that we were gonna, you know, get good grades and win at our tennis matches, and that sort of thing, it was, it was just sort of who we were.
Story_ID: 615041
Speaker 1: Now when you were in high school you, you--this is still the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what was high school like at the Lab School?
Speaker 2: You know it was very much, a continuation of the same, I mean, making the jump from eighth grade to ninth grade, you get a fairly sizable portion of people who've been there from the beginning, that go on to the Lab School, and then there's new people come in and, you know, that would definitely the case for me, so though there was this long continuity, didn't have as much of a distinction as it might have for others because you know, at the Lab Schools, they have experimented with having seventh and eighth grade together, or you know, sixth grade is at middle school, it's at elementary school, and so you didn't--some of those labels actually, you didn't pay as much attention to.  So it was very seamless, from my perspective, it wasn't a big you know, trauma to kind of go to high school all of a sudden, but it was very much the same, in sense, in the sense that, it can be a very rich learning environment, or a group of people that were fairly motivated, but a lot of fun and you would stress that, because I had a really good time in high school, and, and you know, throughout my childhood, you know it was not lacking for activity, extracurricular, social activity, so.
Story_ID: 615042
Speaker 1: So University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] had a pretty lively social--?
Speaker 2: Well we, you know, we--well the good thing was that actually a lot--especially the African American, African American kids, we had friends all over the place, because we'd grown up in different neighborhoods, and some were at Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois], some were at the Ray School [William H. Ray Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] when we were in elementary school, you know, we didn't limit ourselves to the few of us who may have been at the Lab Schools [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois].  You run across, because I wasn't a Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] member, but I knew everybody else that was a Jack and Jill member, you know, that's the wonderful thing about African American organizations like that, is you cut across, some of the--these institutional boundaries, so this sort of rich after school extracurricular activity came in part, because we knew each other outside of school alone, and you know, you would just meet other people and go and have friends from other schools. It wasn't just limited to the Lab School.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did you take part in activities in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] too, or maybe Kenwood or something?
Speaker 2: You know, not in any formal sense, but I just knew a number of people who went to those schools, and you know, we would show up at the same parties, or play with tennis tournaments in the park district, or Lake Meadows [Lake Meadows Apartments, Chicago, Illinois], or what have you, it was that kind of relationship, if you will, that, that really developed outside of the Lab School.
Story_ID: 615043
Speaker 1: Were you an honors student or did, did they have that kind of set up at the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: The- I, you know, I think at the time, and I'm not positive about this, I could be just remembering, you know, thoughtfully and favorably, which, that I don't think there was an honors track, but I do think that they started to introduce AP [advanced placement] testing.  So in certain subject matter, you could be put into a class that would actually, you know, that was somewhat honors like, if you were gonna take these AP tests, and I don't know how long that had been in existence, but, you know, for things like math and you know, I think it might have been foreign language, I think even, which would shock me, because I wasn't a big science person, but I think we might have even taken one for science, like biology or something like that, but that was as much of an honors track as I recall anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, were there like clubs and things in high school that--
Speaker 2: There were, you know, I don't recall actually being in clubs per se, you know there was obviously the social--sports activity, so tennis and basketball were my two primary sports that I did after school, with the Lab Schools, and then there are other activities like, they have a Rites of May festival, sort of participate in putting on that festival, but what I didn't do was, you know, run for government or you know run the French club, or anything like that, you know just went to class, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was about it.
Story_ID: 615044
Speaker 1: All right so, so did the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] have a proper prom and all that?
Speaker 2: It did have a prom actually, come to think of it, they--which is a little pitiful to be honest. It was, the just sort of organizing that, I just remembered that we would sort of stand aside while they would try to get it together at the last minute, you know, me and my friends we were sort of--well you need to do something better than what you've got laid out.  So I think I was in--I think I went to the senior prom, in my junior year, and I think I--I'm pretty sure it wasn't my only senior year, so you know, but it wasn't like, you know, the big, you know, some of the larger schools that have big homecomings, or something like that cause we didn't, we were pretty tiny in school, so.
Story_ID: 615045
Speaker 1: When you were a senior then, wha- what were your prospects for college, wha- what did you--what--had you chosen a college yet or had you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. You know, I hadn't, it, you know, we, we had a guidance counselor, like many students do, and I picked I believe three schools, a couple of them were Ivy League schools, and you know, another similar type school, and my guidance counselor said, that, "Oh, you should be fine with those, and that's great," and I do remember two things, one is that, in picking those three schools, there was a consultation with my friends, Janice [Janice Cook Roberts] and Kevan [Kevan Cooke (ph.)], who, we had been close friends for so long so we wanted, we knew, that there was time for us to grow up and separate, and so we kind of split the schools, and I don't recall exactly how we did that but somehow, you know, I got a set of schools and Kevan had a different one, and Janice had a different set, so we knew we weren't going to be together, so that was probably one important revelation.  The other was you know, it dawned on me that it wasn't, you know, cer- for certain, that I was gonna get into these three schools, so I actually, about two weeks before the deadline, went and borrowed other college applications, from anybody who had 'em and they weren't using, and then applying at up to twenty-two colleges, because I wanted to be sure that I was not going to still be at home where my parents [Elizabeth Terry Collins and Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] had said, it's time for you to be moving on.  So I applied to twenty-two colleges, and I remember my mother writing these checks thinking, are you sure that this is necessary, and, I'm sure that you're gonna get into one of these schools, you know, that sort of thing, but, you know, it ended up being fine, so, and I was able to move on (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now what--you ended up going to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] right?
Speaker 2: I did, yes.
Speaker 1: Was it--how, how, did it happen?  You just applied and they accepted you right away or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did happen because I applied. It didn't come without a little consternation there. We had interviews and someone actually from my neighborhood [Jackson Park Highlands District, Chicago, Illinois], and I believe a professor, at the medical school, interviewed me, and I thought it was a particularly tough, and maybe not quite so fair interview, and I don't know if that was by design or what have you, but he ended up making me believe, that I was, you know, that he was trying to make some kind of statement, essentially in this interview that my parents might be giving me too much freedom, because I was able to drive myself around and I could, you know, babysit to all hours, and go out, and all these sort of things, and yeah, so I came back feeling that, a) that I wasn't going to get in, and secondly, what was he after there.  I never really found out, except for that I suspect that it was a tough, you know, by design, to be a tough interview to see how you'd handle yourself, because I did get in and he ultimately came over and he congratulated me so, if anything it made Yale rise to the top where I didn't have a particular focus on going there in the beginning. It just sort of ended up that it was on the list and it rose to the top because of this strange interview I had.
Story_ID: 615046
Speaker 1: Before we get you out of Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], I was just--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: We were discussing during the break just the ambiance, of University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean, it's an interesting place to grow u- I mean, to grow up and go to school I would guess.
Speaker 2: Oh sure, it really was on a lot of levels, and I think first of all in the Jackson Park Highlands [Jackson Park Highlands District, Chicago, Illinois] at the time, you know, it, it, was to me, significant, although of course, in retrospect, but there were literally no two of anything--two black people, two white people, or two whatever, there were different nationalities, there were, you know, Native Americans, there were, you know, hemophiliacs, I mean we had some of everything, but, but, our block really gelled, I mean, the Olympics became our major activity, you know, on our particular block, and we would carry this German guy, Axel [ph.], who was a hemophiliac, and we would carry him around so he could actually participate, you know, without hurting himself.
Speaker 1: You had your own Olympics, in, in that Highland Park I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We would create a--yeah, so--
Speaker 1: --Jackson Park.
Speaker 2: --at least on our block, well it was on our block in Jackson Park Highlands, see yeah, because that was just who we had.  There was an Argentinean couple, with three kids and we had Axel, he and his sister, Susan Powell [ph.], she wrote a fabulous book called 'Grave Dancer' [ph.], you know, they're very activist oriented, in the Native American community, but there literally was no two of anything, and so it was, again, you sort of take these things for granted when you're a kid, you're not sort of you know, analyzing and understanding why, but it was very, very, special for that reason.  You know, and yet, I had this sort of other, sort of very rich group of friends, who were African American both from where I lived before, but also my new friends as I was growing up, and, and going to the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], so it felt very rich and diverse, and you know, always something to learn.
Story_ID: 615047
Speaker 1: Now you were in school when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Chicago [Illinois], and you'd have been about ten years old then, I guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Elizabeth Terry Collins and Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] take special note of that--was it discussed around the house?
Speaker 2: It was definitely discussed, so I did have, you know, a great sense of it, from listening to them, and overhearing when they would have friends over, or go to different people's houses. Ironically, I do remember marching, with, I believe it was Mrs. Camparos, [ph.], who took us to Midway [Midway Plaisance, Chicago, Illinois], and we were marching with you know, black power, it was--so there was, you couldn't be in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] and not, you know, pay attention to this.  And I think the other part that, you know, I maybe didn't talk about, was my mom taught in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], and you know, so gangs were very significant in terms of how they cut their territories, and what, who was for what, and who was tied to whom, and so there was a lot of discussion, from a lot of different places, and everybody was sort of aware, you know, obviously, I didn't understand what it all meant, but it was, you know, it was definitely just very prevalent, if you will, you know, during that time period, so just naturally.  Had to be, (laughter), I don't think you could be here in America and not, not somehow, you know, be aware of something changing, you know, maybe a little bit like today, I don't know.
Speaker 1: I know when Dr. King was killed, there were riots on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and did that affect you?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't--
Speaker 1: Now, I know there weren't any in South Shore [Chicago, Illinois] or Jackson Park [Jackson Park Highlands District, Chicago, Illinois], but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, in the areas--I don't remember, I, I, know that I don't remember, that specific part, but I do remember, the lot of the violence from I think, 71st Street, might have been a dividing line, and I remember that when my mom taught school, you know, we would hear gun shots, from different places and sort of hit the floor, kind of instruction, when we would hear it, even near our house in Jackson Park Highlands, you know, after school, we would do that, you know, so you, you know, you became aware of danger, you became aware of, well everybody.  In contrast to what I just described, which was very, you know, everybody plays together and works together, and whatever, in our Olympics on my block, you know, here was another side where--that you actually saw that was not the case.

Speaker 1: I think some of your neighbors--Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] at one time moved to the, the Highlands [Jackson Park Highlands District, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He lived in the area, and--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --we had [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis, yep, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Ramsey Lewis. Who else lived in the area?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know those were the two most notable, the--Ramsey Lewis in particular, because kids were at the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], and one of his kids Kevin [Kevin Lewis], was in my same grade and he had brothers older and younger that were at the Lab School, so and we used to practice singing at his house.  We were hoping that we would see Earth, Wind, and Fire, or something.  And Jesse Jackson because, and again, because of his relationship, that my mom had with Mrs. McSween [Arlene McSween], so there was some--more discussion, fairly serious discussion that, you know, there were safety issues, and you know, just things that I might pick up on overhearing on a telephone, so again, just it's an awareness, I wouldn't say, there was an understanding fully.  But there were certain instances, you know, my next door neighbors were Jewish as an example, and they were--we would play together, but we would go places outside and go to the skating rink, or something like that and you know, Debbie [ph.] would get in and there would be questions about, you know, well who's your friend and did they belong to like the South Shore Country Club [South Shore Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois] was one, where, you know, where we would always go by it, I knew it was not a place where I could go in, and I actually can't remember if Debbie did--tried, to go in or not, but you start becoming aware of some of those things as you get older.
Speaker 1: Now Debbie was Jewish right?
Speaker 2: She was Jewish.
Speaker 1: And South Shore (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cultural--
Speaker 1: Country Club in those days.
Speaker 2: Country Club at the time--
Speaker 1: And when I got in '77 [1977], I was told that black people could not go in there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: --and so you were growing up and this is this big, edifice on the lake, where they eventually shot 'The Blues Brothers'--all those scenes in 'The Blues Brothers'--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --was--
Speaker 2: Hands off.
Speaker 1: --I think it dated back to 1909, or something the building does.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's a country club, and--but it was hands off--black folk, people were not allowed.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: But the city finally took it over, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right and for--thankfully, it's a great area for some cultural, you know, attractions.
Speaker 1: Was that a subject of discussion in the neighborhood, when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Not, well it's nothing for example that my parents [Elizabeth Terry Collins and Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] would aspire to, so it didn't come up in that regard, but it would come up like for example, with Debbie, I remember we would take the bus to some, you know, I think it was a skating rink, I think, on 71st Street that we would actually go to, and you would always pass by it cause, it would--this bus would go along the lake [Lake Michigan], and I just remember that it was hands off for me, and I don't recall, it may have been hands off even to Debbie, but it, it, was certainly hands off to me, and so that, that, injected differences, you know, that we became aware of, in our relationship, and you know, so those, that's just another example of where, as you get older, you just become aware of certain things, not, not really understand why, but just that they are--exist, and so you have to kind of start to pay attention to what the circumstances are, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, now did--add one more name--did you ever run into Muhammad Ali?  He lived around, in, that neighborhood, and South Shore [Chicago, Illinois], at one time--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I did through some friends, actually, would work with him and the like and I knew he had this, his practice place in Michigan, which was I guess a lot of people went up to Union Pier [Michigan], and would, "Oh, Muhammad Ali has this place there," and so I didn't actually--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was in Berrien Springs [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Berrien Springs, yeah, exactly, and I think he's still, it's still in his estate potentially, and I'm not sure, I'm not positive, about that but I believe, so, and I remember that he lived in--on Woodlawn [Avenue], you know, in that really, one of those really pretty houses on that street, so, certainly was aware of him but you know, just 'cause of who he was, so it was nice.  I didn't know him though (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think that Elijah Muhammad actually had a pres- presence there too, didn't he?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just down the block, yeah, exactly, and some his kids were, you know, around the ages, and again, and you'd sort of see some of then when you go to parties and things like that, so yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 615049
Speaker 1: On the verge of graduating high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Did--does the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] have a regular graduation like most schools, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did actually, you know, we, I think were at the Rockefeller Center. Not the Rockefeller, not center, but Rockefeller Chapel [Rockefeller Memorial Chapel, Chicago, Illinois], and so we had a--had the graduation and it was, you know, it was really a typical ceremony, but it was nice to be able to walk down and get out pretty successfully, so it was good.
Speaker 1: Okay, and tell us about Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], now this was 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978], okay, so graduation, you go to Yale--
Speaker 2: And I went to Yale, you know, I, I, went initially--they had an orientation program for minority students, and I think that it was reasonably significant because, I met most of my African American friends that week, so that was September or whatever, and I think there were about sixty-five African Americans in a class of about twelve hundred, a far--you know, that's ten times the size of the class roughly, at Lab, and so the bigness was different, you know, the looks weren't so different. Being in a small city was very different, and New Haven [Connecticut] is pretty tiny, compared to Chicago [Illinois], but in many respects, it was not a hugely different experience than going to Lab. You just had to negotiate with a lot more people, but and I mean that, sort of academically, in the way the environment worked.  At Yale, was, you know--tried to really define liberal arts, if you will, by saying that you had to take as many course as possible in these four years, across all these disciplines, and at the end of the day, you either knew a little about a lot of things, or you were at least qualified to have a major in two or three subjects, just because of the amount of classes, and you know, and I think probably for that reason, it had a similar reputation for being, having, fairly nerdy people, like sometimes people like to say about the Lab School, but, you know, I didn't find that to be the case, we weren't more nerdy than other people.  What was interesting was there were quite a few Lab School people, there as well, which I had--didn't expect, I thought I was getting very far away by going to New Haven, but you know, it was similar experience, it was a great--you know, I enjoyed college quite a bit, I didn't have the same closeness, as I do with people from Lab, you know. I have a handful of friends that I stayed in, you know, reasonable contact with.  But that's probably the main difference if anything. It was just that whereas the Lab School is just incredibly dominant in my memory, Yale was, you know, less so, just because of those relationships just weren't as tight as the ones from, you know, from my younger days,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I enjoyed it, loved school, you know, and glad I went.
Story_ID: 615050
Speaker 1: Who were some of the personalities, now, now, now, did some of the personalities from Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], stay, I guess, meaningful acquaintances all the way through Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] or were there just some there or--
Speaker 2: You mean from, that I met, people that I knew at Lab, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, some of my friends that I mentioned from the Lab Schools, stayed friends even though we all went to different colleges, or, you know, weren't together, during those four years or so, and it continued to all the way to up 'til now.  There were some people that went to the Lab Schools that I didn't actually know so well, before I went to Yale, because just ran in the smaller, different, circles, or what have you, so there's a woman named Jackie Pardo [Jacqueline Pardo], who lives in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], she's a child psychologist, I believe, she literally was in the next room to me when I came on campus my first year, and Amy Schleys [ph.], and you know they were--so, I was like whoa, (laughter), I thought we--I thought I was moving away from the Lab Schools but they were literally right here.  Josh Lerner who's the, you know, hot professor, at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], currently, in entrepreneurship and private equity, he was at Lab. He was known to be super smart when we were at Lab, didn't probably hang with him, if you will, during that time period, because, he was in a different category of academic achievement, I would say, but when I got to Yale, he, you know, we saw each other a few times, didn't necessarily become particularly close, but I just knew him and turns out that a guy that I met, at Yale, and have since become a fairly good friend, had actually roomed with him. It's just a small world, you know, and I think that that happens for a lot of us, you know, but it's a pretty small world so, they, they, overlap, things overlap like that.
Story_ID: 615051
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], that--
Speaker 2: You know they actually--not really, I--there were incidents, you know, I listened a lot but, you know, it was, it definitely didn't have the same closeness, where, you know, the classes were small at Lab [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] and so you could touch those teachers and you'd see them every day, at Yale, you--there were certain professors, that may have made some impact on you in terms of listening to different lectures or what have you, but I didn't have any of that same--you know, I couldn't call the names, for example. In other words, I can remember every teacher from Lab School, and that, forever, before, I couldn't at Yale and I don't think that's a detriment. It's just, you know, the way it was because it was a bigger school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was you major at Yale?
Speaker 2: Well, it ended up being economics, but it went through lots of routes. Started out being math, then moved to architecture, then to urban planning, then to urban economics and then finally to economics.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, John Kenneth Galbraith, was he at Yale or Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  I think it's one or the other.
Speaker 2: I think he was actually, I don't--really--I might get this wrong--I don't actually know, but he might have been an economist at Yale [sic.].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought he was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he wasn't yet--it was interesting, at the time the economics department at Yale, for undergraduates, I think that they put a lot of emphasis on the graduate programs, and so, even though there were good courses and I learned a lot, and that sort of thing, it didn't stand out as kind of a, you know, huge emphasis in that area.  My sister [Adrienne Collins King] did go to Yale, after I did, and actually majored in economics as well, and I--my observation was the undergraduate courses actually became a bit more robust, in the department and how they were producing people, and I think it was just a sign of the times, if you will.
Speaker 1: The only other professor I know at Yale, that I can think of now, is in black studies, and that was--black history, and that was John Blassingame [John W. Blassingame], did you have courses from--
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, you know he--I think he lectured in some classes that I--but I didn't have him. Actually, Henry Louis Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.], was at Yale at the time, and I didn't have any particular relationship to him, but that would be an example of act- you know, listening to a professor, you know, getting a lot from it, and then he subsequently left to go to Harvard, but John Blassingame, was definitely was there, and he was somebody that I know I listened to several times, and I think there were a couple of sort of smaller sessions that we would have. I forgot what they call them, but they were seminars in the evenings. I think he may have taught in some of those, that went to or through the black student union [Black Student Alliance at Yale], that I you know, would, would see him, but that he was definitely a major person, you know, there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 615052
Speaker 1: You majored in economics, and--
Speaker 2: What else did I do while I was there (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's interesting because I didn't actually play kind of team sports, but I did play intermural sports, which was, I leave off men's squash--
Speaker 1: You played men's squash?
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't see it--I think that they must not have had a women's squash team, but the squash court, I was--loved tennis, from when I was in high school [at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], and I wasn't good enough to be on the tennis team, at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and I had actually, you know, been asked to come out and play basketball, but I didn't wanna go on the road for as much as they wanted to do it, and so I probably took that for granted--I probably shouldn't have, but all the residential colleges had squash courts in the basement, so I--one of my roommates, from my freshman year, someone I met--you were--we had these residential colleges so this woman--was my soph- one of my roomies my sophomore year, so we would actually play squash in the middle of the night, and she was, you know, a talented student and a talented athlete, freshman, who played pro golf for a while, before she went to law school, but anyway, that's how I ended up playing men's squash for a while.  So I did that--I think about a year and a half, or something like that, and it was fun, it was good do to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it messed up my tennis game (laughter).
Story_ID: 615053
Speaker 1: Were there any big crises on campus, when you were there at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] or--
Speaker 2: No--noth- you know, I think I was there during the first four years of Bart Giamatti's [A. Bartlett Giamatti] administration. He was the president, and he was commissioner of baseball (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he went on to become the head of Major League Baseball.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly and I think the significance, between the '78 [1978], and '82 [1982], period with him being there, he was just adored by the students on campus. It was just a--he really connected with them, in a great, great, way and for whatever reason, I don't know if it was, you know, just the economic environment, or whatever, but we didn't put--the school didn't put a lot of money into the infrastructure, during that period, and the significance of that was, things were actually sort of were falling apart, while we were there (laughter).  And so you did have this really weird sense about, you know, when you're in this great institution, but it's pretty rickety, and yet, there was a lot of emphasis on that subsequent, to my time being there, and--but he was a guy, he was just an amazing sort of personal--you'd meet him once and then, you know, three months later, or six months later, you go to another whole class event, and he'd actually remember your name.  It was just astonishing, and he was just, he was just, a really kind of terrific, very personable, leader and so that was just one sort of takeaway, so much so, that when my sister [Adrienne Collins King] graduated, I actually wanted to go back, because this was his last year and so, not only did I see her graduation, but really actually reminded him, just that I had been there before, so he was really just a neat person, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, his, his, son's an actor now, Academy Award [Oscar] winning actor now--Paul Giamatti.
Speaker 2: Oh really, I didn't actually make that connection. Oh, okay, but he was just--he was just amazing, he had this incredible connection, so--
Speaker 1: Bart Giamatti, I think he suspended Pete--Pete Rose, I think, or--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: He's the one that was involved in that--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, he really--'cause he died early, right, and he just--but he would really, you know sweat over these kind of really personal, human issues, and you know, students would say, you know, "Look, my ceiling's falling down, can you do something," and you know literally, he would get somebody over there, like the next day and he--if there were personal issues with different people, he'd, you know, find ways to get them help, and they probably wore on him actually, too much, that, you know, in terms of dealing with the rest of the university.
Story_ID: 615054
Speaker 1: You probably didn't have any contact with him, but I have to ask about [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards, he was there and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you know, I didn't have any contact with him, although the drama students were right across the street, the old drama school was right across the street, so, who, I know they would never remember but, David Alan Grier, and a guy who's name--I would recognize him in a second, I mean--he's actor--I think it's 'Roc' something--
Speaker 1: Charles Dutton [Charles S. Dutton], he played Roc [Roc Emerson]--
Speaker 2: Dutton, he--I think he was there, and then there was another guy, but we--my roommate and I--
Speaker 1: Rocky Carroll--is that Rocky Carroll?
Speaker 2: I think so. He was sort of tall and thin, and he was in, he was in--
Speaker 1: 'Piano Lesson' ['The Piano Lesson,' August Wilson] too along with Dutton?
Speaker 2: That, I don't recall--I don't know for sure--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, he--but they would, you know, they were, they were, like funny and really good, and so we used to steal eggs for them, out of our dorm, they'd get them food, (laughter).  Angie Bassett [Angela Bassett] was in a class ahead, I remember she--I would go to black church and she would just do wonderful orations and you know, you could just see some of these people, really--if you could just get a little glimpse of it, and see them today, it's just kind of interesting.
Speaker 1: Was her husband there too, Court- Courtney [Courtney B. Vance]?
Speaker 2: I don't remember him there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He might have been through the drama school earlier, but Angie actually was in--a year ahead of me actually in college, I think, before, I think she went to Yale drama school [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut], which I think was subsequent to, the time that I was there, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you see any of the plays, and of the productions, of Lloyd Richards (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, some of them, although they were--yes, definitely saw some Lloyd Richards, but the, it was interesting, acting, has a big place on campus [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and a lot of the arts do and so every residential college, or there were a lot of repertory theatre things, and I can't in my memory anyway, distinguish between some of those different venues, but I know that Lloyd Richards was obviously was just huge on campus, and so whenever we could to see some of his productions, so it was great, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well--
Speaker 2: So was the woman, you know, who was actually there, who which I remember up close was this--the woman who built the Vietnam Memorial [Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Washington, D.C.], Maya Lin--
Speaker 1: Oh, the Oriental [East Asian] woman--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was--I was working in the art and architectural library, in the library as a, you know, work study person, and I remember when she submitted her drawing or entry into the Viet- the memorial thing, and she obviously won, and she had also submitted it for her, her class, and her professor also submitted it, also submitted a drawing for this memorial, as well. He gave her a C, in the class, and lost the competition, (laughter), so, you have this very soft spoken person, but she's had a--she was--actually, she was so quiet, but everybody you know, sort of noticed her when she was, you know, in architecture school, so anyway that was-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just another famous person (laughter).
Story_ID: 615055
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] in '82 [1982] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: In '82 [1982], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982], all right, okay, so, so, what did you do in '82 [1982]? What did you--did you go right to work (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In 1982, in 1982, I--when I left Yale, I went to work at Chase Manhattan Bank [JPMorgan Chase and Co.], in a--initially in a credit training program they had and that was about a six month training program, and then I went into--you have a sort of avenues you can go to in the bank and I chose credit audit, and the significance of that was--were two things, one is that, it was a traveling job, you had to kind of go on assignment to different locations around the world, and also around the world, also, we were sort of selected based on how we did in the training program, to participate in this credit audit thing, and it was somewhat unusual at the time that Chase had a couple of credit issues, right before that, that caused them to take that action, so consequently, the people that I traveled with during that period, and, you know, that were in credit audit, also became fairly close people, because, you know, you're traveling in teams of twelve, or something for basically a year and a half, to two years.  So, that was a--I really enjoyed that, you know, exposure, you know, first working at Chase, and making money, center bank, and I'm very loyal. I'm still a Chase customer.  You know, the other thing was I got to that program, because I worked there in a minority program to some of the four, the guy named Davy Huddleston [ph.], who was in HR [human resources], kind of put this program together, and attracted a whole bunch of students, from not only Yale, and places like that, but a lot of the, you know, African American oriented universities [HBCUs].  And so you had this wonderfully good, you know, exposure, and it, those, pra- it made me realize, and even since then, just in my career just how important those kinds of programs actually are, to acclimating, 'cause here, I considered myself a person who didn't have, you know, a lot of hardships growing up, and had a lot of exposure, but I had no idea at all, what a commercial banker did, or what an investment banker did, or any of those kind of things that people sort of seem to take for granted, when I was coming up, as an option.  And I never would have known about it, you know, had I not had that, that chance.  And so you know, I pound that table whenever I can, you know, to create those programs and get that exposure for people so they can make educated decisions about their futures.
Story_ID: 615056
Speaker 1: You were there for two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then, then you decided to go to Harvard?
Speaker 2: Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], yeah .
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I decided to go to business school, and happened to get into Harvard. The reason for going, wanting to go to business school was that I--well, I enjoyed the Chase [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.] experience, quite a bit and learned a ton, thank you.  The challenge for me was that I really liked more equity oriented products, I thought. In other words, experiences that I were very debt oriented for very large companies, and by having this broad exposure across a lot of different companies, and you know, the kind of loan review that we did, I could see that I actually sort of took, was much more attracted to and understood better, some of the smaller businesses, the growth oriented companies, and that informed my next decisions, about where I would go for my career, so that was the significance of that experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 615057
Speaker 1: Harvard University, Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], I guess right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that's where we're at, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes, 1986--1984, when I started.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was that like.  Fir- First of all was there many black people in--
Speaker 2: No, there were not,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I believe--I don't know how exactly Harvard does it, but it seems like they have a large class every year, but they divide them into sections and so and every section has about ninety to a hundred people, so you do feel like you're getting a small university education and lots of attention, and so on, but in each section it seemed like there were two black people in each section and five people from commercial banking, one from marketing and you know, so they kind of set the sections up, by creating a, you know, a cross section of people, across function, across gender, across you know, a lot of different categories, so that was how they did it, for the first year.  And then the second year, everyone would get mixed up.  So there were a small number of people, and also we were--you know, Harvard has a curve and so, you were also very aware to make sure that you were not at the bottom of the whole class because, they were going to ask you to not come back the next year.
Story_ID: 615058
Speaker 1: What were some of the, I guess, more interesting courses, and the things that you focused on, you know, while--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's not like going to a liberal arts place, which was a little disappointing for me. Of course, I should have known that, but you know, I liked school, I'd always loved being in that kind of environment, but the course that--I liked all of the capital markets courses, they were sort of both math and finance oriented, and sort of informed me for my later career, but the ones that actually I did well, and that I--surprised me were organizational behavior ones, which dealt a lot with people, and circumstances, and how do you manage and deal with sort of difficult issues, and stuff like that, and that was actually a surprise for me because I was pretty, you know, mechanical about a lot of things and was surprised that I would actually do okay with that, but it actually, ultimately, had some other influences on the rest of my career too, which I just happen to pay attention to because I took those classes.
Speaker 1: So, they were useful over a protracted period of time (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think initially, it felt like, oh gosh, I know this stuff already because, you know, they try to get experienced people and you have all these cases and you know, my, I, can say what I want to, this person can say what they want to, and you know, who's right, who's wrong, right?  You know, you don't, really know, so at the time, it feels like what are we really learning here, but later in life, it--you start to tap back into those series of experiences, you know different situations, that are either overt, or frankly, just very subconscious, so it does help, and there's no question, that it obviously helps you in the door in certain places, and some of the jobs that I chose to go into, having, at the time having a business degree, and having one from Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], in particular, was the difference between going and not going, of getting those opportunities.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you say though, that when you look back at it, the thing that you learned about people, as important as the techniques and the procedures, or, or, or--
Speaker 2: Actually, the people part of it, that was more, much more important, and apparently, not an uncommon thing for people who go into business, who go to business school, who are like twenty years later, that, that human, component, how to deal with certain situations, ends up being more important than the technical components.  The Chase [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.], for me and my job, the Chase experience was absolutely critical, and superb and superior, the Harvard Business School courses that were related to it, were further tests, but they weren't, they didn't actually teach me the basics, if you will. I had those from before, so it was more of an opportunity to practice, more of an opportunity to interact with people who have been in those professions, and so I was consequently a little bit more knowledgeable, when I went to go apply for those jobs, you know, those are ways in which it helped.
Story_ID: 615059
Speaker 1: Are there any, prof- professors who stand out that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, not because I actually had him as a professor, but Jim Cash [James I. Cash, Jr.] in particular, he was an Afri- he was the African American professor on campus [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts]. Linda Hill [Linda A. Hill], also not a professor that I had, but she was another African American professor there, and you know, what makes people stand out, in a sea of non-African Americans, because, you know, trying to get some level of credibility, in these very, closed, environments I think, sort of, are good, positive examples, you know, for people like me, who are sitting on the other side of the table, but in a similar situation, and they were very successful, and continued to be.  So, Jim Cash, continued to, he was--kind of had an IT orientation, in information technology, so, you know it was obviously, a hot area. He was on a few boards, and did a lot of consulting, so you sort of looked to him as a great model, and when I think--maybe more recently, he might have been head of the Harvard Business Review.

Speaker 1: Anything else about Ha- Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] before we graduate you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: You know, I think the only thing I would say is it really was important for me to pursue the profession that I had so, you know, while I don't remember all the details as much, it was critical, to have taken that step, and number two is that a lot of people, that actually, I interacted with in my later life, also had gone to Harvard, but not, I didn't actually, necessarily, know them, or know them well, while I was there, so it's just another touch point, when we talk about the Harvard Business School network and what have you, has proven to be important.  In fact, my next job, came from--I didn't know before I went for the interview, but one of the people in my section, his father ran the firm, and you know, so when I went to interview, so of course, you know they were able to check me out, having been in that particular section.
Speaker 1: So, I guess what I hear you saying and I'm slow--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --the relationships you make there and the acquaintances make there are very important, later on.
Speaker 2: From a professional standpoint in particular, you know, with the networking and you know, that's where my early relationships, also have been enormously helpful to me in my career, and I give them tons of credit, but they also are personal friends which I protect, you know, very personal friends.  The Harvard Business School network, actually was just critically important to be able to vali- get validated, you're validated, you know, from graduating, you're validated because you knew people in your section, and interacted with them, and you know, somebody picks up the phone, and they said, "Yeah, you know, Michelle's [HistoryMaker Michelle L. Collins] a nice, nice person, yeah, she seems smart enough," or whatever, and you know, that, those couple of words actually can get you in the door.
Story_ID: 615061
Speaker 1: So you finish your degree in 1986. You're, you're age, aged twen- twenty-six, with an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a position a lot of people would like to be in.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So your first job was at William Blair [William Blair and Company, LLC], where, where's William Blair?
Speaker 2: William Blair is based in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, and you know, I didn't feel so powerful when I left, because, you know, I knew that I wanted to get back to Chicago. I'd chosen investment banking, because it had the finance and sort of tangentially related to the math thing that I talked about earlier.  But Chicago didn't have a lot of investment banking, even though it was sort of the number two or three, financial center in the country, so I wasn't sure what state I was in. Harvard didn't do a lot to try to, you know, even a lot of New York [New York] firms, if you will, that could come on campus and were very visible, and Harvard went out of their way to accommodate 'em, it seemed like, Chicago was like, on the other side of the world, so there wasn't a lot of like information to, you know, glean from the, the, sort of resources that they had on campus, so coming back to Chicago was a little bit of the typical that you do here, and that is, you have to look up your companies yourself. You have to kind of figure out if I can--if there's some Chicago relationship, I can use to sort of help get in the door, and that was the case with William Blair.  It was the only, the largest, privately owned investment bank in the city, and so we weren't going to the offices of other, you know, the Morgan Stanleys [Morgan Stanley Wealth Management], or Goldman Sachs [Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.], or whatever, didn't try to do that, but the--but it was sort of headquartered here, and I went to that place precisely because it was equity focused, in contrast to my learnings from Chase [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.]. They were focused on small and medium sized companies, in contrast to my experience at Chase, and it happened to be, oddly enough, what exactly I was looking for, and it was pretty much the only one of its kind, I subsequently learned, but fortunately I had a chance to get in the door there, partially through some of those, those relationships at Harvard, and then also because some of my friends here in town had worked there before.
Story_ID: 615062
Speaker 1: What would be a typical day [at William Blair and Company, LLC, Chicago, Illinois] when you started? Wha- what would you have--what would you do?
Speaker 2: Well, my first--you know, the first few weeks were, were, were odd because you know, they didn't actually have a lot of young people there. They didn't--it was a very senior group, so they didn't have to actually know how to train people, or that sort of thing, so I did a lot of analysis. It was, you know, looking up companies, valuing companies by going into their annual reports and collecting information. It was very internal, and frankly felt very solitary, but part of that was it was 1986 and the mark- you know, you're trying to find your way, within the department, but that migrated after the 1987 crash, the business kind of started to rebound, and so consequently, you're working then, on teams, as a junior member, doing some of the similar analyses, but now you're going with cli- going to clients and you know, trying to piece your wares, that what some of the senior people on my team would be doing, and then when you tried to deliver on those promises or decide that it really wasn't for us, and, so that was you know, between 1986 and 1991.  I was sort of the junior and getting to be a little bit more senior member of the team over time. You know, you work with different partners, and you experience everybody's way of doing things and how they evaluate things. You end up having sort of a philosophy on a lot of stuff as an independent partner there.  And I became partner in,  at the end of '91 [1991], '92 [1992], I believe, and you, you have to start with working on running your own deals, and so, you know, my--you end up having some areas of focus, because you end up working on a lot of the same kind of businesses. It could be the same industry, the same geography, it could be the same type of transaction that you might pitch, and for me, it was a little bit of both, during that time period. It was a lot of initial public offerings, and subsequent equity offerings, as opposed to a lot of MMA [money market account]. That was what the market was calling for, and a lot of wonderful, growing companies, who were really using technology, to kind of make their businesses very efficient, and in the process it turned out to be a really good product, if you will, for the public markets and so I had some, some, you know, unique experiences I would say in working with distribution businesses, and direct marketing companies, taking them public and watching them grow and become big companies.
Story_ID: 615063
Speaker 1: I just want to make sure we break this down to any students watching this--
Speaker 2: Okay, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so they'll have a real sense of what you do--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, how you do it.
Speaker 2: Well, I think a couple of things about the first years versus the later years, and it's very interesting that few of the skills that make you successful as a young person, are the skills that you need as a older person, so you establish yourself, in the before period on your analytics, on your ability, to work really hard, long, hours, to be accurate, do a lot of you know, sophisticated financial analyses, and things like that, present them verbally, you know, come up with the right conclusions, so it's kind of an apprenticeship, if you will, the way that business works and how you learn it. Later, knowing that you've had a grounding in this, you actually never have to touch a computer again, because you've got all the younger people working for you now, to do all that stuff, but you need to understand it, or you know otherwise, you're going to make a mistake, but the skills that make you successful as a partner are being able to present and find new clients and be able to mobilize the firm that you work for behind your particular project.  So consequently, you're not hi- the main thing is that you're not hiding behind anyone now. You are on your own and so, if you have product that you are bringing to a salesforce, so you take a company public, you're offering shares to the public market, so you need a salesforce to do that, so you have to present something to your firm and you have to hope that your track record and the analyses that you've done on that deal, help your salesforce buy into wanting to sell it to their clients.  So you kind of have an internal first cut, and that just comes with years of credibility of, you know, doing it day in and day out and not doing a lot of bad deals in the way things worked at William Blair [William Blair and Company, LLC, Chicago, Illinois], and subsequently, you had to find your own clients, whether you're pitching them, or you get a referral from somebody else. It's you know, knowing when to kind of--, "Okay, this is the perfect client to do my service for. You know, let's go after that one, and this one I'm not going to ever be able to do a great job on, so let's let them go to another firm," or something.  So different sets of scales. I think that if you're a young person listening to me, you know, you gotta do one set of things really, really well early on. You hope you don't lose that, but you gotta be mindful that you gotta develop all of your presentation skills, with all of your ability to actually get business, and own that business, and fight for your numbers and do all those things, later on, and so then, the networks matter, all of your reputation matters, because basically when somebody hires you, they're like, well, "Who did you work for before?" And they call up that person and they say, well you know, "I got this Michelle Collins [HistoryMaker Michelle L. Collins] sitting here, and I heard she did a good job for you, and what did you like, what didn't you like," you know, so everything is based on your kind of word in the past, and you know, your reputation ultimately becomes paramount.
Story_ID: 615064
Speaker 1: You were a partner at, at William Blair [William Blair and Company, LLC, Chicago, Illinois] until 1977--'97 [1997], right?
Speaker 2: To '97 [1997], yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, who are some of--well, I see some of the people here in the research, that you worked with.  You care to comment about some of them?
Speaker 2: Well, you know just that, you know, I absolutely loved being around these entrepreneurs. I mean, I had a great opportunity to see companies really get built. You know, I noticed that a lot of people, are the people that are the most successful, you know, kind of this weird combination of incredible insecurity and incredible self-confidence, but it was just, you know, you couldn't--I should be paying them for that experience. It was just really, really, fulfilling I guess, and nice to have been able to help them.  So there were a couple of companies that they took public, early on, many, many years ago, maintained a relationship with the people that own and run those companies, and therefore through those relationships got a chance to see how a company gets from, you know, $200 million in revenue, to you know, $5, 6, 7 billion in revenue.
Story_ID: 615065
Speaker 1: Some of your clients included Henry Schein [Henry Schein, Inc.], CDW Corporation, Lands' End, Inc., Coldwater Creek [Coldwater Creek, Inc.], and United Stationers [Essendant, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and some of the people you were working with were, E. David Coolidge III [Edgar David Coolidge, III], Rick Kiphart [Richard Kiphart]--
Speaker 2: Dick Kiphart, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Ned Jemmota.
Speaker 2: --Jannotta [Edgar D. Jannotta].
Speaker 1: Jannotta, okay. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Those were my three bosses (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm. (Laughter) They were, you know, I would say first of all, companies, I guess, a couple of things, first of all, I picked those ones, the names you have, are ones that were public companies and successful, so for every one of those, there are a whole bunch that are not, (laughter), you know, we can't name because they don't exist anymore, but they were distribution, direct marketing, there were some common threads in terms of what they did, and that's number one.  Number two is Ned, who was managing partner of the firm, and Dave Coolidge, was the person who hired me, and was who I worked for the longest directly, and then Dick Kiphart, who took over from Dave, when Dave became CEO, and subsequently, vice chair, all were very, very, important, relationships in some form or another. I mean, you know, I had to try to earn their confidence, over the time. In order to be successful at William Blair [William Blair and Company, LLC, Chicago, Illinois], the way it worked, it was a private partnership, you know, your numbers mattered, but you know, you had to get along to, make your way there, and they gave great counsel, and so you--they were very different from one another, so, you know, you can learn from anybody, and then they continued to be among, currently on a public board, where Ned is on the board, and on the non-profit board, where Dick is on the board and actually chair, I dealt with him and I'm still working for him, but so they ended up being pretty important people.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Two of the three, you know, came out of Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], one out of Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois].
Story_ID: 615066
Speaker 1: Says here you served as director of McWhorter Technologies, Inc. [Eastman Chemical Company] from '94 [1994] to '96 [1996]. Is there a story there?
Speaker 2: Actually, that was a referral from Dick Kiphart [Richard Kiphart]. McWhorter was a spinoff, from a chemical company called Valspar [Valspar Corporation], with a long time link to our client, and I think we may have asked Dick, either if he wanted to be on the board, or if someone else he could recommend, and so he recommended me, and that, so I did join that board. It was a little bit short, because strategically, the chemical company was going on, it got acquired in '96 [1996], but it was interesting because, 'cause it was my first time sort of being on the board, with a lot of people that had very large company experience, you know, large chemical company, these are ex CEOs, and one of the early buyout luminaries, you know, with Harris Chemical [Harris Chemical Group, Inc.],so it was an interesting experience, but not a long one.
Story_ID: 615067
Speaker 1: What about CDW Computer Centers [CDW Computer Centers, Inc.; CDW Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Okay, that was, that was a company that I took public, in '93 [1993]. It had been a very successful company. I'll admit on camera that I didn't know whether they'd sell another computer. You know, of course, years later they sold now, billions of dollars' worth, (laughter), computers, but it was a--it was a wonderful experience, because the company just had a culture that was created by its founder that was incredibly motivating, it was replicable, it created, you know, ten thousand families, you know, families in jobs, and things of that nature, and so it was one, for me to see entrepreneurship up close and personal like that, was an extraordinary experience, and I stay close to that company, joined the board in 1996, and left last year, when it was sold to a private equity firm, but it was as close as I would ever get essentially, to actually seeing how that actually took place, so it was very extraordinary for me.
Story_ID: 615068
Speaker 1: Well, what about Savota?
Speaker 2: Svoboda (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Svoboda-
Speaker 2: Svoboda Collins [Svoboda Collins, L.P.].
Speaker 1: --Capital Partners with LLC [Svoboda Capital Partners, LLC] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay, right, well that, when I left William Blair [William Blair and Company, LLC, Chicago, Illinois] in 1997, it was to form with a partner, his name was John Svoboda [John A. Svoboda], a private equity firm, and what we wanted to accomplish there to raise capital from investors to invest in small and medium sized companies, as they tended to be the kind of companies, that we serviced as bankers at William Blair, and John and I had worked together, within William Blair's corporate finance department for twelve or thirteen years prior to that, and proceeded to work at--it was initially Svoboda Collins, because I was partner there, and then I left, left last year, so we changed the name to Svoboda Capital Partners, and so it--I was there for basically ten years focused on investing and the same kind of companies that we'd always advised, you know, small and medium sized distribution business, business service companies, and consumer companies.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, you were involved--is that, now, that's not still, okay.
Speaker 2: That's between 1998 and basically--January 1998 and January of 2007.
Story_ID: 615069
Speaker 1: Now, what about Coldwater Creek [Coldwater Creek, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Coldwater Creek was another client of mine from William Blair [William Blair and Company, LLC, Chicago, Illinois], that was initially a cataloger of women's apparel, and I took them public in about, 1995, and as I was leaving, Svoboda Collins [Svoboda Collins, L.P.; Svoboda Capital Partners, LLC]. I mean, leaving William Blair. I was asked to join their board. I accepted and stayed on their board until 2004. They're now a retailer of women's clothes, meaning they have stores, lots of them, like three hundred or so, and it's been a pretty unique growth story, although, you know, retailing is kind of challenging these days, obvious, the economic environment, but they have grown a big business, from basically, a two person shop, (laughter), you know, way back when, so that was another experience, another board experience that I learned a lot from, during that time period.
Story_ID: 615070
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about Molex Incorporated? Now that's 2003 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Let's see, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well Molex is a company that is based outside of Chicago [Illinois] proper in Lisle [Illinois]. It is an elect- it's an electric connector company, so of lot of the things that you use in any of the technologies, the things that you connect your cellphone to your computer, to whatever, they make all those very tiny connecting, you know, items.  It was a client of William Blair's [William Blair and Company, LLC, Chicago, Illinois] that I was aware of for much of the time that I was at Blair, but I in 2003-ish timeframe, they invited me to join their board, and I did. It's a family, the Krehbiel family had a majority interest in the company, and still kind of controlled the company, but they're public, and you know, and so I started as a public company director, for that company.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, I guess, this PNA [PNA Holdings, LLC], yeah.
Speaker 2: PNA is actually a portfolio company, meaning that we invested in at Svoboda Capital Partners [Svoboda Capital Partners, LLC], when I was there, and so I sit on that board, currently as part of my affiliation still, with Svoboda Capital Partners.
Story_ID: 615071
Speaker 1: Any such thing as a, as a investment philosophy or, or--
Speaker 2: Well, I would say the closest thing that I have to that, is really what was in the Svoboda Capital Partners [Svoboda Capital Partners, LLC], I mean, we worked really hard, I mean, it was our entrepreneurial opportunity, and, you know, we had a chance to really form a, an investment criteria, that seemed to work, you know, we, we got started, the first few years, we tried a lot of different things, and everything didn't work, you know.  So between 1998 and 2002, we'd invested in several companies. Some of them were reasonably successful, and some of them weren't successful at all.  Two thousand two [2002] post, we had refined our criteria, and we had a lot of successes, and with some of those philosophies, related to, were, you know, excellent leadership, so typically the CEO, that we were looking at investing behind. We wanted to be either demonstrated success, very invested, meaning that they, we're putting our money in, but we want you to have some money and skim in the game, as they call it, and somebody who's really focused on, you know, the much bigger picture, that they're not looking at--look to just cash out, but to really kind of grow their business for a long period of time, and that's in common with some of the experiences that we've had before, that's probably crier- criteria number one.  We liked to look at business that both have good growth prospects but also hide margins, that could go across a lot of different industries, so that's just sort of a financial parameter, and we also wanted, going back to the CEO part, we were looking for partners who were really looking for someone to partner with.  In other words, the CEO that feels that they know everything that they need to know to be successful, no matter how attractive the investment opportunity, if that person wasn't gonna be receptive to any outside input, and we hoped we had some to give them, whether it was from ourselves or resources that we might have, if they weren't receptive to it, we wouldn't invest in it.  And it was an important, they sound very subtle, but they were incredibly important lessons that we learned, because it made a huge difference in our investment performance number one, and gives you the courage kind of to walk away from situations that look almost too good to be true, and usually they are (laughter), so.
Story_ID: 615072
Speaker 1: Since 2007, you're the pres- you've been the president of MC Advisory LLC [MC Advisory Services, LLC]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly, that's just my own consulting firm, and basically when I stopped working as a managing director, at Svoboda Capital Partners [Svoboda Capital Partners, LLC], I still have responsibilities there, as an advisory board member and I'm on the investment committee for the second fund.  In September, I formed MC Advisory to begin to assist in small and medium sized companies, in a consulting fashion, so a lot of the issues people would sort of, maybe through referral networks of what have you, seek my advice, on how to raise capital, and that's basically been my career for the last few years now. It's illogical, but oftentimes, you would find that once you start talking about that, well, you find that there's other issues. They need to build their teams, they think may be sold, they don't really want capital, they want to sell themselves, a whole host of different issues, which I find incredibly exciting.
Story_ID: 615073
Speaker 1: Tell me something about some of your minority clients and, and, and your, your interest in helping them?
Speaker 2: Oh sure.
Speaker 1: Minority clients.
Speaker 2: You know, I've had the good fortune to be able to spend some time with people who are running businesses that are either in the community, or you know, employ a lot of people of African American descent. It's something that I've always wanted to do, but it wasn't really a primary focus in any of the things that I've done in the past.  So, what I find right now is that there are companies, that are right in the same size businesses that I've always worked with, that I can lend hopefully, some expertise, a lot of those companies are growing, sort of fit all the criteria, that I just talked about, and have really good futures ahead of them and so you're looking for ways in which to enhance those opportunities or stabilize those opportunities.  And I just had a, you know, it ranges in terms of what you do for them, but, you know everything from helping them build a board, to you know, finding the right advisors, to position themselves, to raise capital so we're looking for that down the road, or some cases it's, I'm not sure you're gonna be able to raise capital, so you might have to try to, you know, close ranks a little bit. It ranges, the different things that I might be able to help them with, but hopefully more of a resource, you know because, again, I've watched a lot of people be very successful, being entrepreneurs, and also being really convinced that that's important activity for African Americans to actually build their communities.  And so while there's lots of things that go on in terms of, you know, getting resources, in the, in our communities, and education, and a whole bunch of other kind of resources, having stable businesses that are really there to serve, will, you know,  give us jobs and we'll have our own jobs. We can control our destiny, destinies, we can actually build our own wealth, and I just think it's an incredible venue, you know, for us to really participate in, and you know, it's why I watch with interest, and I participated with interest, the Urban League's [National Urban League] new initiative on entrepreneurship, among other things, but very excited by it because, you see a lot of these businesses that have been out here and where have they gone for, for resources?  Well now, their league is there to sort of provide some of that guidance and some networking opportunities for them to build their businesses, and you know, at the end of the day, a lot of them just need customers, more customers than the ones that they've got, so, you know, I like that whole idea of building a, building those kinds of businesses in our communities.
Story_ID: 615074
Speaker 1: What kinds of businesses are, are we building that are successful today?
Speaker 2: Well, the, you know, they actually range, I mean to some of the ones obviously that we all know about or you know, within the financial field, you know here in Chicago [Illinois], we've got Ariel [Ariel Investments], but we've got, you know, a handful of those companies, in the financial world, on Wall Street we have Loop Capital [Loop Capital Markets, LLC], so that's your financial--and they're not my clients by the way. Those are just people who are successful--there are IT [information technology] companies, you have Blackwell Consulting [Blackwell Consulting Services], and they're actually two family members, who have their own businesses there.  You may have seen some of the success stories, that are beginning to come out of the Urban League [National Urban League], with, you know, frankly the shoe stores, that are the ones in Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois], you know, there's another company that I'd heard about through that process that, you know, basically provides accounting services and bookkeeping services, and are kind of an outsource solution, which is a reasonably hot area, for a lot of companies today and she's building her business and you know, and affecting a lot of companies, her upper clients actually, in a positive way, and some of those clients, actually are minority customers, in and of themselves, so, you know, it really feeds on itself.  And so, and then there're just the number of people who aren't in the main part of the program, this is the Urban League program, where they're, you know, in the construction field, in the, you know, outsourced businesses services field, but also, just others who are actually going through some of the training classes that they have.  And, at the end of the day, you know, my hope is that at least that program, and others like it, will produce a lot of companies that, you know, will employ a lot of people and, and create a lot of wealth for the people that are working there.
Story_ID: 615075
Speaker 1: What advice would you give just to a young person of, you know, in business school today, that would like to follow your-yeah--path (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's thinking about doing it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, I think that, you know, if you, if you--one is getting enough experience, so that you don't have to go through so many barriers just to get started so, you know, especially if you've had the benefit of going to business school and really knowing your basics, then I would say, you know, that the most important thing is if you've gotta dream, go for it, but use your network, get some advice, work with some other people, so that you don't--so you can increase your odds of success, if you will.  It might be people who would work in the company with you as partners, it could be having, creating some advisory board, board members who could actually help you and guide you as you get through certain things, and but, you know, my biggest advice is don't, don't be--don't let the business school--you come from business school and you have this expectation, and you know, you're gonna make all this money and you know, have all these nice things, and you can have that, but don't let those things get in the way of your dream.  I think that's the problem with business school. They don't promote entrepreneurship. It promotes getting a good job and getting a lot of dollars. That's not the short term thing. If you get the long term goal, you're going to create a lot of the wealth and you'll be--you'll have more than enough money, I mean, you'll pay back your student loans and you'll do all that stuff, it's just really important to get started, and not fall into that trap of you know, trying to get the high paying job.  And there's--I have a friend of mine a guy named Stuart Taylor [Stuart A. Taylor II], who went to college, and to business school with me [at Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], but he, focused in on that particular issue, which I hadn't actually paid particular attention to, was that coming, when you're coming out of school, you know, a lot of people have to get the consulting and investment banking jobs, so they can, you know, pay back those loans, and you know, he was trying to encourage people.  You, you, have to pay them back, but you know, don't limit yourself to just those kind of two professions.  Go ahead and get the kind of experience that you need, if you have to work in the right--particular industry, so that you can start your business, or if you have your idea already, you know, come, let's talk about it, and let's get that dream started.  And I thought that was an excellent, an excellent, contribution frankly, to a lot of young people coming out of business school.

Speaker 1: You're basically working for yourself now [at MC Advisory Services, LLC], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is--do you have a, I mean--where do you see yourself in the next few years, I guess in terms of?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's interesting, it can take a couple of points, I think that I will continue to be doing this, in some form, whether that is just me, or whether it is me with, you know, people working with me, but I will also continue to be an active investor. I like, you know, getting these very entrepreneurial situations. I like part of the deal, when you invest in some of these companies, it's that you're an active participant, on the board in terms of really helping them grow, help, and, and, the smaller the company, the more work that you actually have to do, and finding customers, and helping them analyze their books, or putting them into the right policies, or what have you, and I get a lot of joy out of doing that, number one, but it also, you know, you, you, it's necessary to do to make that investment work well, so I could see myself, not only doing the existing consulting part, but I'm hopeful that I will have, you know, made several strong investments, that have grown and have you know, contributed, whether it's how they've employed people, how they've created wealth for the owners of the company, and ultimately with me as an investor, has made it fun, return, and made it worthwhile, to take some of those risks, but it will be some form of that, the percentage of time that I will have spent on each of those, I'm not sure how that'll play itself out.  And, and, just as an example, I found the right company, I could easily see myself just working on that company, and, and to the exclusion of other things, so that's--it's just a function of opportunity, and circumstance, and you know, the timing sort of coming together.

Speaker 1: Okay, I want to talk about some of your volunteer activities here and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I know you're, you're, past president of Chicago Sinfonietta.  Is that pronouncing--am I pronouncing it right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: Sinfonietta, so, well, tell us about that and what, what, that time was.
Speaker 2: Well, that was interesting, Sinfonietta, is a mid-sized orchestra that is focused on, on promoting diversity in classical music arts and primarily in symphonies. I became affiliated with that organization in about, eight to ten years ago, by a board member, and found myself about four or five years ago, helping them through a challenging period, they, as a typical small, arts organization, you don't have a lot of resources, and they tried to take a step up, if you will, had a nice affiliation that they wanted to pursue, but it kind of was an overreach for them, and so I happened to be at the table, and became very involved at the time, 'cause we had to sort of rebuild our management, and what have you.  The organization, itself, is the nation's most diverse orchestra of the top one thousand orchestras.  Only 3 percent of the players, are of African American descent, and the Sinfonietta has a 35 percent minority participation in its orchestra, and one of our goals is to not only keep those musicians employed and active, and you know, participating in the community, but to encourage a lot of young people who, pursue classical music, to continue those pursuits.  And you know, a lot of it's, not popular, when you're, you know, listening to some other things in school.  A lot of people don't have the resources for doing it, you know, meaning the dollars to kind of invest for extra instruments and a lot of lessons, and so on and so forth, and finally those who are--show the talent, but, and dream of being in an orchestra, we love to try to help them get into those orchestras and there's a lot of things that you have to do in terms of your training and preparation for that, so we wanna be a resource for those people.
Story_ID: 615078
Speaker 1: What are some of the other volunteer activities that you're involved in?
Speaker 2: Well, another one is Erikson Institute, it is an early, childhood, graduate school of education, institution here in Chicago [Illinois], and one of the founders was a woman named [HistoryMaker] Barbara Bowman, who is in our--who lives in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] also, so--
Speaker 1: --and she's the daughter of Robert Taylor [Robert Rochon Taylor].
Speaker 2: --that's the daughter of Robert Taylor, and mother of [HistoryMaker] Valerie Jarrett, and wife of [HistoryMaker] Dr. James Bowman, so illustrious all the way around.  Barbara, you know, has, has created an incredible, kind of research organization and you know, turned that into a graduate school of education.  She has retired, just a few years ago, from leading the organization. She continues to teach and lectures all over the world and everything.  But the new person who's president, is actually expanding that model, and so my activity on that board is really helping them continue to expand building a building, so that we have people for, places for our students to come, and be very visible.  We're trying to get into a little more hands on, direct service, because, at least in my own view, that we have a lot of great knowledge, and we affect a lot of people who touch young kids, but again, from my very selfish perspective in the African American community, the more we can do to kind of get these kids early and give them some support, you know, the better off they'll be, so Erikson Institute, is another one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have, you know, I'm also involved with the Field Museum [Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois], and excited that I recently joined the board of the Renaissance Schools Fund, which is building the new charter school, on initiative, right here in town, and just another area that I have a lot of interest in, so those are just a sample.
Speaker 1: I hear you have a profound involvement with the Chicago Historical Society [Chicago History Museum, Chicago, Illinois] too, they say.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a--I've had a long history there. I'm actually no longer on their trustee board, you know, they, they have a, you know, great role here in the city by you know, collecting and archiving you know, a lot, all parts of, quite frankly, the Chicago history and I'm happy to see them actually, really include everybody in that.  I was aboard when Doug Greenberg [Douglas Greenberg] was there and I stayed while [HistoryMaker] Lonnie Bunch was running things, and went on to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], to run the African American museum [National Museum of African American History and Culture] for the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution], and but, left when he left, but I continue to have a lot of interest in what they do.
Speaker 1: Okay and I also see notes for Chicago Urban League [Chicago, Illinois], YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], Chicago Symphony [Chicago Symphony Orchestra], Presbyterian St. Luke's [Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, I'm no longer trustee of Rush Pres, although, it's a fine organization, but just at one point, I wasn't able to continue with it, but yeah, I've--the YMCA, I recently joined, probably about a year and a half ago.  Just has again, a lot of activity, involvement in the communities, the, you know, I mean most of these organizations are, you know, terrific. Chicago's got so many of them, which is really the hardest thing, is to choose, pick and choose, where you spend your time, but I try to stay you know, really focused on the educational components, 'cause I really understand that generally, and the some of the other attributes, the social service, and some of the things with the museums, are places where I can you know, hopefully get some community relationship with those big institutions, but you know, there's a lot of great organizations here in town, and   Chicago's one of those, you know, let's get out there and do it, (laughter), so you have to be really careful to make sure you pick only a few that you can handle.
Story_ID: 615079
Speaker 1: Then you happen to be a member of several professional organizations, like The Chicago Network, the Chicago Finance Exchange, the women's corporate directors, the Economic Club of Chicago, the Commercial Club of Chicago, the Henry Crown Fellows Program [Henry Crown Fellowship Program], and then of the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.], and there's probably more--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Um-hm, um-hm yeah, those are, you know, I'm a--love people and you know, not a classic network, but I wanted to just always learn from other people, so those organizations partially because they're financial oriented, a lot of them actually female oriented, and I initially became involved with them, because it was a great balance, to my work, which was primarily male dominated, and I love working with men, but, you know, I didn't have any sort of balance, if you will.  So The Chicago Network is primarily for you know, women, leaders of their organizations, whether they're independently owned, or you know, big companies, where they're women that are running major divisions.  The Chicago Finance Exchange, for senior financial executives, in different companies, again, from small, large, whatever, women corporate directors same thing, and a lot of those are educational, but as I said, you know networking is a big part of that as well.  Henry Crown Fellows Program has been pretty exciting. That's a value based leadership program that was founded by members of the Crown family in conjunction with the Aspen Institute. They have about twenty people per class that they pick every year, and I was fortunate to be chosen for the triple crowner class, third class, and I forged really great relationships with people of completely diverse backgrounds, and you know, interests, but they're all achievers, and you know, help you sort of keep informing yourself about you know, what your responsibility is in the world.
Story_ID: 615080
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently, if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Differently?  Actually, I don't know. I don't have a lot of regrets, about anything that I've done in the sense of, you know, I wish I hadn't done that. I mean, I'm sure, you know, I made plenty mistakes, but nothing like that.  I think that big thing that's on my mind, is I really believe in this entrepreneurial, you know, it was something that I believed in a long time ago and I've taken this kind of circuitous path, to kind of inform myself, you know, and I think whether, me personally, or me, funding somebody, or me helping somebody really start some really good businesses, is what the next twenty years is going to be about.  Ultimately I think that's the best contribution of my skillset, is going forward.
Story_ID: 615081
Speaker 1: When you look back again, what today would you consider to be your legacy? Well, you're still pretty young there--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Legacy.
Speaker 1: --to think about that.
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh, I don't really actually have a legacy. I don't think of--I don't think I could have one yet, you know, I just hope that the totality of the different things that I'm involved in and I do actually think not so much about legacy, but just that I touch a lot of different places, and the question is, are you making enough impact when you're doing that?  So I guess that it's you know, when you look back over the whole course of my career, whatever that is, that you know, people will feel that I've been very sincere and committed, about you know, both the achievements, but in particular, really focusing on our community, really trying to find ways for us to be successful.  I, you know, I think I've learned a lot, and have benefitted a lot, from you know, both my community, and then just the exposure that I've had, and I think that if I could get--give those opportunities to other people, those people would similarly find you know, enough success, and enough achievement, and happiness, with what they're doing, like I have, so, how do you do that?  I not sure that I have all those answers, but I'll do it in a way so that I can use my skillsets, and, and a lot of that is in business, with entrepreneurs, and the like, so that's kind of what I think about in the next twenty years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 615082
Speaker 1: We always ask this question. What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, lots and lots of those, you know, I hope we prove to thrive, okay, I don't mean to suggest that we won't survive, but I think we really can and should thrive.  I think there're pockets of it, in part, because some of us have been given a lot of tools and resources to be able to do that, some of us don't have those tools, and I think we need to spread those out, 'cause I'm confident that if we can, we can all share in more progressive, and you know, see more progress within our community, but I also think part of that thriving is that, we continue to have--continue to find a very strong sense of ourselves, and I think a lot of it kind of gets diluted, because we actually have all these other experiences, and we sort of assume that if the African American culture will continue to exist in the way that, you know, we look back on it, that has its challenges, but also some wonderful triumphs.  How do we ensure that going forward?  I worry sometimes that some of our, some of our successful people, you know, I don't know if they're always finding a way to kind of to give back, and I just feel that we should all be looking to do that.  No matter who we are or what our circumstance, and so, for example, one of the things that I've begun to say to people, you know just in my family, or would ask or care what I think, (laughter), you know, we don't have to like, save the world, only have to like, you know you can't--you don't have to save all, just because I don't have this, I can't do, you know, this big thing, but we can just start at home.  You know, my nuclear family is, you know, intact, but I've got cousins that, you know, need some support, here and there, and I don't just mean a check. I mean, guidance and encouragement, and access to resources, you know, so maybe I you know, can't make a big endowment some place, but I can actually affect maybe four, five, six, seven, people, who will affect through their families more so.  I, I just think we have to do a lot more of that kind of stuff in order for us as a group to really thrive.  It just requires a lot more of us taking individual responsibility, for others, our neighbor, you know, our cousin, our, you know, whoever else, in order for us to thrive.
Story_ID: 615083
Speaker 1: Oh, we haven't talked about your fam- family.  Do you have any children, or?
Speaker 2: I don't actually (laughter), but I have three great nephews, and lots of cousins, and that allows me to be really nosy, and say some of the things I just said which is you sort of notice that, you know, some of my cousins maybe didn't finish school, but should have, so when did they get off that track and why they got off that track, and you know, can I be of--can I be helpful, in whatever way, encouragement or financial assistance, whatever it is, you know, that's what not having my own kids actually allows me to do, I think.  But I do have three wonderful nephews which give me great joy, and the rest of us in our family, which is always nice to see.
Speaker 1: Okay, and have your parents [Elizabeth Terry Collins and Rosecrain Collins, Jr.], been able to see you become as successful as well?
Speaker 2: Well, they're around, you know, and I think they, you know, take pleasure in the fact that, you know, I'm being self-sufficient, and doing fine, but you know of course, they're parents so they can also make sure they keep, you know, pushing forward, as well, so you know, they--setting expectations are good, and you know, I think trying to rise to--you know, I look at what my parents have accomplished and I just feel in my own way, I've gotta take that bigger step, if you will, so I keep the pressure on, if you will, to finally, at least have, even more impact, and more success.
Speaker 1: I think someone was telling me, in the course of the research, coming in, that your, that your parents were confused about what you were doing. They didn't understand what it was that you're--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I know my father was like, "What is this investment banking thing?" You know, and actually I think the comment, 'cause he loved the fact that finally, after I was at William Blair [William Blair and Company, LLC, Chicago, Illinois] for about ten, eleven, years, you know, and he said, "What, you're gonna leave there and go do this private equity thing," and you know, he said, "You know, I finally figured out what the investment banking was about, and you know, and now you're going to do something else."  Which I'm not sure whether he fully understands it or not, but, you know, I was happy that I did the private equity thing, and that it came out fine, but, but that was kind of funny, because he didn't really know, it's true, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 615084
Speaker 1: Is there anything we have not mentioned, that we need to talk about before--oh, there's something.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: No? Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not, I think the only thing I haven't really talked about maybe enough, was although you touched on it, in a couple of different ways, but the sort of education, you know, I mentioned my parents and my dad's [Rosecrain Collins, Jr.] sort of, kind of discipline, you know, very focused sort of approach, my mom [Elizabeth Terry Collins] being very empathic, the--this education piece that I see in this sort of, nurt- getting in early, and a lot of the things that I'm doing through--in, the non-profit world right now, and it left you open with a question, how are--how am I made up of both of them?  I think I spent a lot of time in this education piece, in early, that comes from my mom, you know the kind of, you know, start a business, achieve in school, do these things, you know, that comes from my dad, and actually both of those things are very tied to how I spend my time today, oddly enough, and I don't think it was sort of by design. It was, you know, maybe it's just what you know, or you seem to be successful by looking at them, but those are two pi- I think that's the main piece. It's just, you know that I got a lot of that education piece from my mom, so--
Speaker 1: So these two strains are still feeding what you do?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they are.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, okay, now is there anything else I have not asked, that we need to get--
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  You know if, you know, the only other thing I would mention is--'cause you haven't said much about my sister, but you know, she's obviously been very important. She's the brain of the family. She, you know, has a lot of sort of natural talents, but she's very, you know, even more family oriented, in part, because she has three boys, so, you know, I think, so people know, the two of us, and they know me as sort of out there, you know, and Adrienne's [Adrienne Collins King] a little bit more you know, quiet, if you will, always has been the case, but you know, she's actually sort of the star.  So, (laughter), that's probably the most important, you know, when I think about it, that's probably the most important part, is that she's like, you know, she was the one that always had the straight A's. I didn't actually do that. She was the one that always had the clear decision making on things and keeps things pretty, you know, clear, and focused, where she's going, and I'm the one that's always wondered, well what about this or why not that, and you know, so that's probably the only other piece that I really didn't even talk about but that's about it.
Story_ID: 615085
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy. Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered, you know, as a sincere and honest person, a good, you know, daughter, sister, friend, that hopefully had an opportunity and had some evidence, basically of, of really helping the African American community.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Thank you.
Speaker 1: That's a fine way to be remembered.
Speaker 2: Sure, thank you.
