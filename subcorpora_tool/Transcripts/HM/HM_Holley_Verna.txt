Speaker 2: T-A-L-A-S-S-E [sic.] I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back, far back can you trace and then what do you know about them?
Speaker 2: I know her mother and father were General [General Richardson] that was his first name, her mother's name was Mattie [Mattie Griffin Richardson], they were Richardsons, and then--
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind the name General?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of, except that it was a way of bringing recognition or the fact that he could be in control, you know, or give orders (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's a good way to put it but that's a, I know that's a trend in, in the South, the name--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, occasionally you see name Major--
Speaker 2: Yeah. 'Cause his [Holley's husband, HistoryMaker Melvin J. Holley] father's name was Major [Major Holley, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah or you know, even Lawyer. You know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: You could be named Colonel or something, you know?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, he didn't have a middle name, I don't remember him ever going, or saying his middle name, so I'm assuming he had none.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and your grandmother's name was?
Speaker 2: Mattie.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Mattie Lee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you trace your family back any further than your grandparents?
Speaker 2: There was, her mother's name was, was it Jennie [ph.]?  And I think that's as far back as I can go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, then does that take us back to Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: It takes us back to sl- almost slavery (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Slavery? Almost?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so are there, are there any stories that passed down the family about slavery at all?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, what did your ancestors do on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: As far as I know they were farmers, sharecroppers, domestics.  As far as I know, none of my ancestors were college trained.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or had the opportunity to go to college.  They had a desire to be educated but the opportunities just did not lend themselves.  I do know that my mother taught my dad [Henry Dorsey] how to read, she had eighth grade education, he only had third grade education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I believe because of that, they insisted that my sister [Grace Dorsey] and I particularly have as a priority school, schooling and we had to, we had to do well at school.
Story_ID: 612960
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Pearl Richardson Dorsey] say about growing up?  Did she, did she pass on any stories about growing up and what it was like for her?
Speaker 2: It was, it was difficult for her, she left Alabama and went to West Virginia, and I believe that's where my two older sisters [Madeline Richardson and Beatrice Richardson] were born.  She did domestic work and while doing this domestic work, working in a kitchen, the fire, I understand that the fire was for, for an oven was so warm that it burned some part of her eye so that she was almost declared legally blind.  And of course, there was no, no opportunity for medical help, so she, she wo- you know, just had to deal with that for the rest of her life.
Speaker 1: So the family she worked for didn't--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --didn't do anything?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, not that I am aware of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did she, did she find it hard to get work after that, after that?
Speaker 2: No, she was able to work, but, you know, as far as reading, I remember she would have to hold the, the book close to her face so that she could see the words.  But she was very, very knowledgeable woman in fact, when my family and I get together and talk, they often talk about how she was like very authoritative and everybody did what she told them to do, she was authoritarian (laughter), you know?  She knew how to, to take care of her body, she knew how to, you know, take care of the house, she was an excellent cook, and so she was knowledgeable about many areas and she sought to help relatives get their lives together.  And so, when she to--you know, told you that this would be good for you then they listened, and most times if they did it, they found themselves, you know, glad that they followed her advice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she was that kind of person.  Unfortunately, she passed away when she was fifty-two, she had cancer and (background noise) probably had died, had dealt with this for a good number of years (background noise) that we weren't aware of.  So, when she finally got medical help she only lived three months, at that time I was thirteen.
Story_ID: 612961
Speaker 1: Give me your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: My father's full name was Henry, H-E-N-R-Y, H, and I don't know what the H meant, Dorsey, D-O-R-S-E-Y [Henry Dorsey].
Speaker 1: And what is, and what was his date of birth and place of birth?

Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born when his mother [Jessie Ware Whitehead] was sixteen years old, that's when he was born.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: And shortly after he was born, his father [Henry Dorsey] died.
Speaker 1: Now he was born in Americus, Georgia?
Speaker 2: He was born in Americus, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: I don't know very, very much.  I know that he left, he left Georgia probably when he was about seventeen or eighteen years old to get away from the oppression and I do know that he traveled as a hobo--
Speaker 1: Now this is your father?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Traveled as a hobo and he traveled with one of my mother's brothers. And so they went to different cities looking for work.
Speaker 1: Now did he meet your mother's brother on the road? Like--
Speaker 2: I'm not really sure, I don't really know how they, how they met (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is, since they're from two different place- places though (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know?
Speaker 2: Probably on the road, I, I--that would be my guess.
Speaker 1: Now those were the days for hoboing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where you can--a lot of people travel, it wasn't uncommon.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: My father hoboed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.  But that's, that's, you know, that's what I know about him.
Speaker 1: Did he have any stories from his hoboing days?
Speaker 2: I don't recall any of them.
Story_ID: 612962
Speaker 1: He [Holley's father, Henry Dorsey] had one brother whose name was, John Thomas [John Thomas Dorsey], he was younger than him.
Speaker 2: So, so there's no information at all about his, his parents or grandparents or, at all?  And what they were doing in Americus [Georgia]?
Speaker 1: They were, they were sharecroppers.  At, at this point I can't remember.  His father's name was also Henry [Henry Dorsey], I do know that and I think her [Holley's mother, Pearl Richardson Dorsey] mother's name was Matilda [Mattie Griffin Richardson]?  Right?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, well his father died early right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And what about his mother [Jessie Ware Whitehead]?  Did his mother live very long (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yes. She lived, she lived a, a long time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She lived to be about eighty-five perhaps, eighty-five, eighty-six.
Speaker 2: And did she stay there in Americus?
Speaker 1: No, she came to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And then she re- she remarried, she remarried a James, to a James Whitehead.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did she come to Detroit before her son or afterwards?
Speaker 1: After.
Story_ID: 612963
Speaker 1: You said your father [Henry Dorsey] went to the third grade, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I've heard.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, now is--now how did your parents meet?  Is there a story?  Eventually with him hoboing and with her brother and stuff, I guess they, is there a story about how they finally met?
Speaker 2: I really don't know how they met.  (Laughter) That's funny I, I, I really don't know.  I don't--my sister [Grace Dorsey] might know, but I can't remember, you know, exactly how they met.
Speaker 1: I guess when you figure the brothers are linked there somewhere?
Speaker 2: Yes, probably.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But they stayed married, you, you know, until she [Holley's mother, Pearl Richardson Dorsey] passed away.
Speaker 1: Now when did they, did you know when they got married?  Or, or what town they finally got married?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: So you don't know if it was in pen- Pennsylvania or Detroit [Michigan]--
Speaker 2: I think, I think it was in Pennsylvania.
Story_ID: 612964
Speaker 1: Now whereas he [Holley's father, Henry Dorsey] had only one brother [John Thomas Dorsey], there were several sisters, there were six sisters I believe.
Speaker 2: Okay, he had six sisters?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay now, did, did they move to, to Detroit [Michigan] too eventually (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All but two of them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  But all of them came, and it was interesting because the house that they had in Detroit, the house that my parents had in Detroit, the people who migrated from the South, they all stayed with them until they got the, a job and could, you know, get a house of their own.  But my parents were like the, the foundation.
Speaker 2: Were the anchor for them--?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, the anchor for the rest of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that's--
Speaker 1: And that, that was only, not only true of his brothers and sisters and maybe a few aunts and uncles, but it was also true of my mother's family.  Her sisters and brothers came to Detroit and also stayed with my parents until they were able to get on their feet.
Speaker 2: Okay, now is there a--what year did your parents come to Detroit?
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty--'28 [1928]? Nineteen twenty-eight [1928].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And what drew them to Detroit specifically?
Speaker 1: Jobs.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  My father was able to get employment at Chevrolet Gear and Axle [Chevrolet Gear and Axle Plant], and he, he worked there for tw- thirty-five years and he retired from there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He died when he was about seventy-three, and I believe he died in 1976.
Speaker 2: Chevrolet Gear and Axle?
Speaker 1: Chevrolet Gear and Axle--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, in Detroit.
Speaker 2: So that, in those days that was a good job?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: For, for black people coming up from the South?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He had benefits and things and--
Speaker 1: Yes.  And it was at the same location--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That, that long.  I'm not sure it's still there but I know that, you know, that's, that's where he worked.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mother [Pearl Richardson Dorsey] did domestic work.
Story_ID: 612965
Speaker 1: What kind of a personality did your father [Henry Dorsey] have?
Speaker 2: A very authoritarian personality, authoritative.
Speaker 1: Now how did they manage to get along (laughter) to--
Speaker 2: Well there were some times (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two authorities in the house, you know.
Speaker 2: There, there--I understand that there were some, you know, some struggles, but there are struggles in any marriage, you know?  But, they were able to, you know, to work it out.
Speaker 1: So did they strike a balance?  Or was there an ultimate authority, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, strike, they struck a, a balance eventually, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But my father was, it was--and, and that was true anywhere he went.  That was also true at the church [Bethany Tabernacle, Detroit, Michigan] where we went, he was a deacon and he had kind of a gruff voice and most of the people were they, they would say, "Well, I was afraid of your father."  But he was just kind of like a, just a gentle giant really (laughter).  He, he spoke that way, but, but it was, you know, he was merciful and he was kind.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, now when you consider your parents' personalities, they're, their talents and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think either one of them because I am not authoritative, I don't think.  (Laughter) Because I can remember as a kid, they would often times tell me that I would have to, I, I was very quiet, I was crier, if you, if you s- if you spoke to me a certain way, I would just burst out in tears, and I did this, I remember doing this until I was at least seventeen or eighteen years old.  And so, they would often get after me and, you know, other members of my family would, would say, "Well you're never gonna be a teacher," or "You're never gonna do this because you need to quit that crying."  And eventually I decided I wasn't gonna cry anymore and I, and what, when I decided I wasn't gonna cry, I quit.  And even in the classroom, when I got to the high school [J.W. Sexton High School, Lansing, Michigan], the kids would say, "Doesn't that bother you?"  I said, "Yes it bothers me," but I didn't cry. And, and maybe eventually I became authoritative because no kid came into my classroom and disrespected me, I did not disrespect them, and they knew that I ran a classroom that, that was disciplined, that they, you came here to learn, no fooling around, you know.  So maybe by then, I did become authoritative and I kind of think I am now a little bit, but I don't think I am to the extent that my father and mother [Pearl Richardson Dorsey] were.  I don't think there's any kid who comes here to take piano lessons from me who would say, well I'm afraid of you, maybe one or two, because, you know, I want them to play correctly, I want them to play the classical style, I want them to use a certain hand position, sit correctly, the things that were imparted to me, I am trying to impart to them.  So, maybe in that sense, I'm a little bit authoritative.
Story_ID: 612966
Speaker 1: You've got brother and sisters right?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.
Speaker 1: Okay ho- how many and where do you fall in order?
Speaker 2: I fall kind of like at that end.  I have a brother [Lee Richardson] who was twenty years older than me, he has since passed away, we do not have the same father, I have another sister [Madeline Richardson] who was seventeen years older than me, she--we do not have the same father, she has passed away, I have a sister [Beatrice Richardson] who is thirteen years older than me, she is still living, she is eighty-four years old, and then I have a sister who is two years younger than me, and she is, she will be seventy this year.  Yeah, so that's, there, there were five of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The two of us, the two younger ones have the same father, the three older ones have different fathers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there any musicians in the household besides you?
Speaker 2: My younger sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  The other three did, chose not to go to school, as far as I know, did not even finish high school.  But my sister who is two years younger than me, her name is Grace [Grace Dorsey], she has finished high school, and she's gone on, she was a med- medical secretary and plays quite well, plays for churches still.
Speaker 1: Plays the piano?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, plays piano. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She has a choir, senior citizens choir, but I'm the only one that, you know, really majored in music and went on to teach and do a lot of accompanying, that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 612967
Speaker 1: Tell us, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory would, would be of my grandfather who taught me how to read when I was three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He--and at that time, they lived, well my grandfather and grandmother [Mattie Griffin Richardson] lived with us and when they passed away, they were living with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: Now this is your mother's--?
Speaker 2: This is my mother's father (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) father.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: General Richardson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He taught me how to read when I was three.  So as a result, when I got to kindergarten, I already knew how to read, and they double promoted me two times, which academically may have been good, but socially, probably wasn't the best.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that might have been one of the reasons why I cried a lot (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were the youngest, most innocent one--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, that was in the cl- the class?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, so I graduated from high school [Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan] when I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I started teaching when I was twenty.
Story_ID: 612968
Speaker 1: Can you describe your neighborhood for us?  Now you grew up on the north, what's called the North End of Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yes, but we lived, we lived in what is c- like the edge of Black Bottom, which was on Canfield Street, between Hastings [Street] and St. Antoine [Street].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was right next door to the McFall Funeral Home [McFall Brothers Funeral Home, Detroit, Michigan], which was a very, very--one of the two or three funeral home, black funeral homes that were in Detroit at the time.  And so my, my parents [Pearl Richardson Dorsey and Henry Dorsey] were friends with the McFalls because of their funeral home being on the corner of Canfield right at Hastings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then we moved.  Well I was born in '36 [1936], when they lived in that house, (background noise) and then in 1941, I--we--my family (background noise) moved to Englewood, 261 Englewood [Street].
Speaker 1: Now is that on the--one the east side too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's the North, that's the North End.
Speaker 1: That's the North End?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that house was between John R [Street] and Brush [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then we moved fr- to Englewood, between Woodward [Avenue] and John R. And those streets were just outside of Highland Park [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I don't believe that that time no blacks lived in Highland Park as far I can, as far as I remember.
Speaker 1: Unlike now, when it's--
Speaker 2: Unlike now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) it's, it's all black now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, High- Highland Park is like city within--
Speaker 2: Yes. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the City of Detroit? Like Hamtramck [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the enclosed by the rest of the city?
Speaker 2: Right. Right.
Speaker 1: Now, well you started off on--well, I guess with all these neighborhoods in mind, then with some specific references, give us a sense of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay.  When we lived on Canfield, there was a streetcar that ran right all the way down Hastings Street, from downtown to probably the boulevard area.  But that was one of the sights I remember or the sounds I remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now I want to interrupt you a minute, now it's I guess it's important that when you were between the, when you were time you were born and five, Hastings Street was still thriving right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes. The businesses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that was like a business, major business strip for poor people and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --immigrants and to shop and, and do things, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And I think it was taken over by the expressway right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They, they--
Speaker 2: Right, they no longer exist because of the expressway.  We lived across the street from a large Catholic church, which is still standing.  The house where we lived on Canfield has been redeveloped and it's now apartments for Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan] medical students.  The only thing that is there, that I remember is a fire hydrant (laughter) that still remains and that Catholic church, those are our landmarks of where we lived.  So that's one of the things, oh the, the businesses, Barthwell- Barthwell's drugstore [Barthwell Drugs] was very, very, very prominent in that area, there were several movie theaters--
Speaker 1: Was the Paradise [Paradise Theatre, Detroit, Michigan] over there, or?
Speaker 2: Paradise was farther down, maybe about two miles from where we lived.
Story_ID: 612969
Speaker 1: Okay, I was asking you about the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The Hastings Street streetcar, that was one of the sights--one of the sounds. The black businesses, the Barthwell's books- drugstore [Barthwell Drugs], that one sticks out most in my mind. There were a lot of clothing shops up and down Hastings Street and it seemed like no one was afraid to walk that street, it was always bustling, I say that, why it was a little more quiet because there weren't, there weren't the businesses on Hastings, on St. Antoine [Street] that were on Hastings Street, McFall's Funeral Home [McFall Brothers Funeral Home] was right at the corner of Canfield [Street].  There were some churches, New Bethel [New Bethel Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan] where Aretha Franklin grew up was two streets from where we lived. There were other churches like Ebenezer A.M.E. [Ebenezer A.M.E. Church, Detroit, Michigan], the, the school where Diana Ross went, Balch [George W. Balch School; Golightly Education Center, Detroit, Michigan] was very close to our house and I ended up teaching at Balch just the year before I moved here [Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: B-A-L-C-H.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was known as the only elementary school that had an, an Olympic size swimming pool in it (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did that happen, where they, you know, an Olympic size pool?
Speaker 2: Oh dear, but it was a good school. A real good school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Diana Ross attended that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were the projects over--they, they weren't there then, were they?
Speaker 2: The projects were there then, but--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the projects were a bit farther south probably about a mile south.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I had some relatives who lived--
Speaker 1: Who was the name of those?
Speaker 2: Brewster [Brewster Douglass Housing Projects; Frederick Douglass Homes, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Brewster, right.
Speaker 2: Brewster Projects (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Brewster Projects, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, they were much different--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --then than they came to be.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 612970
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).

Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was, met its demise?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, what was it like, what?
Speaker 2: Well, I came from a very strict background and Paradise Valley was not allowed (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So Paradise Valley had a reputation of being kind of a--
Speaker 2: It was rough.
Speaker 1: --racy and rough and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was rough.  But if, you know, if you were a drinker a carouser and all of that and my father [Henry Dorsey] said, "No, you're not going down there," well, guess what?  We couldn't go down there.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: Until we were older--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and then I, even after that I, you know, I had no des- you know, desire to go down there.  My sister [Grace Dorsey] might have (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sure she did.
Speaker 1: So it was off limits for people who, unless you were a drinker and carouser and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, if you like the shows and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that, that kind of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So it had shows and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I know there's a lot of music and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there were people there, who you know, became very, very famous who got their start there, but we do--my sister and I often kind of joke, the Dorsey girls, no.

Speaker 1: Well, Black Bottom [Detroit, Michigan] was still there, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Before, before it was torn down?  What did it look like?
Speaker 2: Well, the people there, you know, pretty much kept their homes up. We had relatives who lived down there, Melvin [Holley's husband, HistoryMaker Melvin J. Holley] has, you know, his, his [paternal] grandmother [Sophia Purdie] lived down there, so we, we would travel back and forth, you know, there.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it, it was mostly frame houses, or what?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. That's it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, small houses or big ones?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The small--
Speaker 2: Small houses, there were some big, some very large houses, some churches were there that were very, very foundational to the black community.
Speaker 1: Now were people kind--really crowded up in and packed in at Black Bottom in those days?  Or had the real estate kind of opened up around--
Speaker 2: I think it was kind of opened up and, that I remember, you know, again I'm, I'm a kid, you know, so I, I, again, I, you know, I wasn't really aware of what was going on that much (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well was it typical I guess for one family to occupy a house or there would be more than one family in a house?
Speaker 2: More than one family most times, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because of the, again the migration from the South, you know, you, you have people coming and they're gonna stay with this family until they get on their feet, until they find a job, until they find a, a house of their own, you know, that kind of--
Speaker 1: It was now in the days the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) relationship.
Speaker 1: --demographics seemed to have changed a lot where, you've got a house here, you, you and your husband are two people live in a house?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You probably wouldn't see that then, right?
Speaker 2: Probably not.
Story_ID: 612973

Speaker 2: No we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But there was a--
Speaker 2: No we were, we had moved.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they sent us home from school and we were kind of on lockdown (laughter) from what I remember, you couldn't go outside to play, you had to stay in the house.
Speaker 1: So, so did the, the reverberations of the riot like spread to other parts of the city?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, very much so.  And, you know, the danger of your getting hurt if you went outside was very great so, the rule was, you can't go outside.  You might have been allowed to go out to the backyard, but everybody was just kind of (gesture) shut down and, and locked in. It was no fun.
Story_ID: 612974
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about school now.  You started out at Trowbridge [Trowbridge School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I was only there one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went to Dwyer [Dwyer Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], and I was there for the rest of my elementary school days, it went to the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Now did they skip you at Trowbridge when you started (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They skipped me at Dwyer.
Speaker 1: At Dwyer?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how, how many grades did they skip you? You said two?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did, were there any special teachers or mentors in grade school?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had some excellent teachers there, there were even some African American teachers who were there at Dwyer, and some of them were--oh, the other interesting thing was that my first teaching assignment was at Dwyer.  So, when I went back, I was working with my co-workers were some people who had been my teachers, so that was very interesting (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that sounds like an interesting experience.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And of course, they were glad to see me and, and you know, glad that I had finished college [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] and was now in the teaching field and
Speaker 1: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I stayed there for two and a half years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I take it you were a good student in grade school?
Speaker 2: I was a very good student in grade school.
Story_ID: 612975
Speaker 1: What were you like when you were a little girl?  What were you interested in?
Speaker 2: Well my folks [Pearl Richardson Dorsey and Henry Dorsey] made me take piano. We had this large upright piano that they had purchased for my older brothers and sisters to learn and they refused, so they were determined that my sister [Grace Dorsey] and I would take piano and learn to play the piano so, that was their goal for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, that was one of the, one of the things that we had to do.  We had to get good grades at school, we had to take piano lessons, we had to go to church [Bethany Tabernacle, Detroit, Michigan], those were the three things that were primary in our lives.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Now--
Speaker 2: We weren't allowed to, you know, visit with many neighbors, we weren't allowed to, we couldn't even go to the show, (laughter) it was just that, that tight.  The only time when we got a chance to go to the show is when we went to visit my aunt who lived in Rochester, Pennsylvania.  Well she didn't mind us going to the show, so sometimes we would go and we would stay for, to see the picture two or three times, 'cause we knew we wouldn't get back (laughter), until the next year when we went to visit her in the summertime.  But my, my parents were very, very strict. Very, very strict.
Story_ID: 612976
Speaker 1: Now were they--what church did they belong to?
Speaker 2: They belonged to a nondenominational church and it was called Bethany Tabernacle [Detroit, Michigan], which still exists. It's in a different location.
Speaker 1: Now was that like a, was it a, a Sanctified church or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --a holy--okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was known as a bible teaching church and the bible teaching was to, so, it was so that your lifestyle could match what you were learning.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then, it was just one of the kinds of churches where you don't dance, you can't--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --you know, you don't have a--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you don't partake in popular culture?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's what I thought I--when I said Holiness or, you know, I don't know how it's--or Sanctified, I mean it, did, did the people shout in church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: That sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: That didn't do that?
Speaker 2: Very, very structured.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, very structured.
Speaker 1: --different from--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, some of the other churches?
Speaker 2: And I started playing for that church when I was nine years old because I had taken lessons since I was six, so I was reading music fairly well and we sang from a hymn book.  So, there was a, a man at the church who played but he was also playing at two or three other churches.  So my dad [Henry Dorsey] decided that since I was taking lessons I should play for the, our church and I had to start out pretty much with one hand playing, you know, the songs--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and then I was able to put both hands together, but I was still studying piano and the teacher that I had was also the organist at Ebenezer A.M.E. Zi- A.M.E. Church [Ebenezer A.M.E. Church, Detroit, Michigan], so she would help me with learning the hymns.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did they, they sing standard hymns and--
Speaker 2: Then sang standard hymns.
Speaker 1: --basically--
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in church.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you had to play with one hand, huh, at first?
Speaker 2: At, when I first started, yeah.  But, you know, it was keep trying that was, that was the encouragement, keep trying, you'll do better, you know (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did.  I kept, I kept, I, I stayed at that church until we moved here [Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I started playing for, when I was about nine and we moved here when I was thirty-something?  Thirty-five?
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: Almost forty.
Speaker 1: So I take it, radio and popular music was not a big feature of growing up at all?
Speaker 2: No. Unh-uh. It was--we, we weren't allowed to listen to that.
Story_ID: 612977
Speaker 1: So you were at Dwyer [Dwyer Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] through eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You would have come out of eighth grade when you were eleven?  I guess?
Speaker 2: I came out when I was twelve.
Speaker 1: Twelve?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, then you went to high school and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Went to high school, went to Northern High School [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a ninth grader.
Speaker 1: Now that part of Detroit [Michigan] has produced a lot of influential--
Speaker 2: Exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) famous people?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr. and HistoryMaker Nathan Conyers] being two of them.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Um-hm.

Speaker 1: Damon Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --grew up over there.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who did you know growing up that was part of that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well the McFalls who owned the funeral home [McFall Brothers Funeral Home, Detroit, Michigan] where we lived next door to on Canfield [sic. Englewood], they lived on the next street, Woodland [Street].  Oh there was just many people--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who became teachers, principals, doctors, lawyers, just a, a wide variety of, of occupations they became.
Speaker 1: Okay, anybody in school with that, that we know that from the, from music law or medicine--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] George Shirley, he ended up with the Metropolitan Opera company.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he went to Northern High School.  In fact, we had the same choral teacher, [HistoryMaker] Eva Evans, Eva Allmon Evans, she was deputy superintendent here in Lansing [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (MELVIN J. HOLLEY):  Martha Vincent.
Speaker 2: Martha Vincent, she was, Martha Sanders Vincent, her mom and dad were teachers, and she became a teacher I believe also, she was married to Dr. Charles Vincent, a doctor.  So all the, all of the people who came through that era, their goal was to, to be successful in occupations--
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: --and their lifestyle.
Story_ID: 612978
Speaker 1: Was Northern [Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan] predominately black--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) high school? No?
Speaker 2: When we, when we first went there, there was a good mix of, of blacks and whites but, you know, eventually it became an all-black school pretty much.
Speaker 1: And when you were there, it was only like 50/50?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: Probably beginning to be 60/40 maybe.
Speaker 1: On the black side, or on the other?
Speaker 2: Sixty on the, on the black side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about the teachers?  Did you have any black teachers?
Speaker 2: A couple. Most of them were white.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, di- where there any special teachers or counselors or, or mentors either in school or out of school that, that encouraged you?
Speaker 2: The choral music teacher there encouraged me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The English people, English teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mainly though, I think those two eras, areas influenced me.
Speaker 1: Now, were, were you, were you still real shy in, in--
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: --in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, very much so.
Speaker 1: Did you get involved in clubs and things or activities in high school very much at all?
Speaker 2: German club, I was on the yearbook staff, pretty much those two.  Again, you know, my dad [Henry Dorsey] restricted, you know, the things that we could get involved with.  I was never into sports, I think I went to, I don't think I even went to one basketball game while I was in high school 'cause, you know, the, the parameters, he just didn't allow it.  So again, our act- our activities revolved around the church [Bethany Tabernacle, Detroit, Michigan], school, piano.
Story_ID: 612979
Speaker 1: I ended up being an accompanist for--in a vocal studio, the Celeste Choral Vocal- Vocal Studio [ph.] which I learned a lot.  I mean, it, I just wish I had kind of decided to go into professional accompanying, because I think I, I really could have done that.  And I had thought about being a concert pianist, but at that time the, you know, the, the openings for being, to earning a living as a concert pianist being African American was just un- you know, that, that didn't make no, any kind of sense then.
Speaker 2: Did you know any blacks that, who had achieved as a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in classical music?  Did you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I knew of them, that Natalie Hinderas, she was one--
Speaker 2: (MELVIN J. HOLLEY):  Roland Hanna.
Speaker 1: --Roland Hanna, but he was in the jazz world.
Speaker 2: (MELVIN J. HOLLEY):  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and he grew up in our neighborhood, he grew up and went, I believe he went to Northern [Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan] or either Cass [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan]. And sir- he became Sir Roland Hanna.
Speaker 2: As a piano--was he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As a, as a pianist.
Speaker 2: Piano player, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, professional.
Speaker 2: He's black?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now wh- well, when you were coming up, along, I guess Marian Anderson, Paul Robeson?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were, they--
Speaker 2: Roland Hayes?
Speaker 1: Were--yes.
Speaker 2: Maybe the other, I don't know who else was considered like a top classical musician, I mean, you know, a performer.
Speaker 1: Right, [HistoryMaker] William Warfield.
Speaker 2: Yeah, William Warfield.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay. But as a pianist there weren't, there weren't many, there any, hardly any.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Natalie is the only one that I ca--that comes to my mind, you know, right away--
Speaker 2: What, what about Philippa Schuyler, was she--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but she was--
Speaker 2: --important then?
Speaker 1: She was a little, you know, older.

Speaker 1: I remember going to my first concert to hear a pianist, I was in, I was about nine years old and my piano teacher took me. It was at Masonic Temple [Detroit Masonic Temple, Detroit, Michigan], and it was Vladimir Horowitz.  That was the first concert that I ever attended.  And I said, think I still have the program from that.
Speaker 2: And that was at the--
Speaker 1: At the Masonic Temple.
Speaker 2: Masonic Temple.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In Detroit [Michigan], which was the major performance hall.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: At--
Speaker 1: In fact our school, they would bus our school--a group of kids from our school to hear the symphony, they always did a series of concerts for school children. It was usually held in the morning and it was at Masonic Temple.  And then something else we did which was very enjoyable for me, and many other kids, there was also, always a time in the program where we sang a song that we had been prepared for by our music teacher and we sang it as the orchestra did the accompaniment for us.  And I remember almost all the words for some of the songs (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well what were some of the songs?
Speaker 1: 'Funiculi Funicula' was one. If I were a--(unclear) I'd play on my Spanish guitar. And it, they were always songs that were very lively.  And we also did the descant for 'America the Beautiful' and, you know, it was fun.
Story_ID: 612982
Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school [Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan] what, what were your prospects?  What did you--what were your career goals and had you set up college yet?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I was gonna go to Wayne State [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] because my father [Henry Dorsey] said there was a college there in our city and if I wanted to go, that's where I had to go.  I really wanted to go to U of M, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] because I felt that, that they kind of had a better music department but what I did at Wayne State was certainly very, very adequate and it prepared me well to be a good teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, you graduated from high school in?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: June of 1952.  And at that time they had a January 1952 class, you know, they, there were two graduations each year, so I graduated in June of '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, so you started at Wayne State that same, that fall?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  So how did you like Wayne, Wayne State?
Speaker 2: It was good, yeah.  I ended up being an accompanist for the women's glee club, I liked the choral work that we did, I liked the, the friends, the, the friends that I had were from my elementary school days, some of the ki- people that I had met through our church [Bethany Tabernacle, Detroit, Michigan] were friends, and they went to Wayne.  So, it was a good, it was a good, good experience for me, I went on the bus or the streetcar, (laughter) we didn't have a bus then, the streetcar ran down Woodward Avenue, and at that time we lived near Woodward Avenue so it was just a half a block to catch the streetcar to go there, right to Wayne State, so it was very convenient, so I think, I think I did well.  As a result, after teaching for quite a few years, in 1984, I was named teacher of the year so, I suppose I, I did okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did you take advantage of the museums and stuff when you, you know, as be--being associated with--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Wayne State?  'Cause that whole Cultural Center [Cultural Center Historic District, Detroit, Michigan] they call is--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) is over there too.
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to--
Speaker 1: With the Detroit Institute of the Arts [Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan], and--

Speaker 1: Okay Mannebach.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: She was an excellent teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I had a good background from my first piano teacher whose name was Alberta Harris.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was able to build on what she had done with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Margaret Mannebach was my piano teacher, the choral person was Harold Tallman, and then, so those were, those were two of that I can remember right away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, Malcolm Johns [Malcolm MacLean Johns], he was the other choral person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, so did you?  You, you majored it in music education?
Speaker 2: Music, music education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.

Speaker 2: No because I was vocal.

Speaker 2: (Laughter) I can't think of anything right now, it was just a good school, it was, it had a good choral part- choral department, the piano department was excellent. We did the 'Messiah' [George Frideric Handel] we even did the 'Messiah' in high school, that's where I first was introduced to the great classical choral works, which I still love very, very much.  [HistoryMaker] George Shirley was influenced by the, the person's name at our high school was Claire Weimer.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.

Speaker 2: Very influential in my life, just by being who she was, the music teacher.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm and the same with Claire Weimer who was at Northern High School, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did they give you a sense that, that you could, you know, achieve an--anything?
Speaker 2: It was a dream. Yes, but again at that time, you know the dreams for African Americans were kind of, you know, really shaky.
Story_ID: 612984
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite classical piano player or, in those days?  Or someone you considered to be the best?
Speaker 2: Yes, we used to listen to a broadcast and of course that was the time of radio. TV was not, well it, it didn't come into being until I was almost twe- eleven or twelve.  But we used to listen to a radio broadcast called the 'Old Fashioned Revival Hour,' came out of California. And the pianist on that broadcast, his name was C- A-T-W-O-O-D, his first name was Rudy [Rudy Atwood]. He had a classical background but he also played the hymns and incorporated that classical background into hymn playing, and so I was very, very much influenced by him, especially when I played for churches.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, now did your church [Bethany Tabernacle, Detroit, Michigan] play any of the music of Thomas Dorsey [Thomas A. Dorsey]?
Speaker 2: Probably only the 'Precious Lord, Take My Hand,' the other ones, I don't remember us singing them that much.  It wasn't until I got older that we, that I'd you know, became acquainted with the other songs that he had written.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Maybe 'Peace in the Valley,' but mainly, you know, just those two.
Speaker 1: And, and was Aretha Franklin's father, what is it, Reverend C.L. Franklin?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was he a major influence on the music in the Detroit [Michigan] area?
Speaker 2: Probably but, you know, it was, that was a big church, our church was very small so we didn't really, you know, have that much connection with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, did you have a favorite singer in those days?
Speaker 2: I don't recall any.
Story_ID: 612985
Speaker 1: Now what was graduation like, you know, from Wayne State [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan]?  Did you, did you know what you were going to do next?  You, you were gonna, going into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --public schools?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I had interviewed for the job so I knew I had a job--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Dwyer [Dwyer Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] as a first year music teacher.
Speaker 1: Now what's it like to go back to the, Dwyer as a teacher (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I worked with, with some of teachers who had been my teachers and again they were very glad to see me and very supportive and very helpful and I enjoyed it there.  The same principal was there the same secretary was there (laughter), same, same custodian people, custodial staff was there.
Speaker 1: So what year is this when you start at Dwyer?
Speaker 2: That was 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1956 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fall of 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Had, had the demographics changed in terms of the students and what they, I mean were the students basically the same kind of students?
Speaker 2: No, the--it had changed, so that it was almost 99 percent black.  In fact, it might have been 100 percent black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were still--some of the same teachers, you know, that were there, some of the same white teachers were there, still there.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a, did you tend to start to view them a diff- in a different light, you know, after being, you know, being a peer there?  I mean did--?
Speaker 2: Pretty much it was the same, you know, you kind of respected them as, as--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --being--knowing more than you did, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't consider them more like a peer?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I, I think, I think it because of my age, I was just twenty, I think that had something to do with it and then the fact that they had been my teachers and, you know, I still looked up to them and I still respected them very, very highly.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there were none of them that seemed real big at, when you were in high school [Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan], then when you got to Dwyer, they didn't seem so big now?
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so, all right so, how, how many years did you teach in Dwyer?
Speaker 2: Two and a half.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause my first child [Mark Holley] was born when, in 1959, so I left probably at the end of '58 [1958].
Story_ID: 612986
Speaker 1: Now did you maintain the same social habits once you, you got out on your own and started teaching then that you did when you growing up in terms of not listening to the radio and not participating (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no, I changed.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Changed.
Speaker 1: They say some people they, they had a study the other day that most people have a different religion now than the religion they were raised up under, they've changed and everybody seems to--
Speaker 2: The foundational beliefs I still keep, but some of the, like I do if there's something in the theater that's worth going to see, (laughter) I do go to see it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I do go to some concerts that perhaps I wouldn't have been allowed to go to.  But the foundational stuff is still there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Very much there.
Speaker 1: You probably wouldn't be a regular at, in Paradise Valley [Detroit, Michigan] if there was one now (laughter). Okay (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Story_ID: 612987
Speaker 1: Now in two and a half, two and a half years later, not--well during this two and a half years, the Civil Rights Movement is starting to jump up and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --down, down--south, did you pay a lot of attention to that?  I mean, did the people in Detroit [Michigan] pay attention to--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was going on down in, in--
Speaker 2: Definitely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Birmingham [Alabama] and, and Montgomery [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any relatives involved in the movement down south?
Speaker 2: Not that I can remember, you know, right off hand, no.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] used to come to Detroit, you know, quite a bit?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did, did you ever hear him speak?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 612988
Speaker 1: So did you move to Lansing [Michigan], you know after?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't move to Lansing--
Speaker 1: Oh, until the '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: 'Til the '70s [1970s], right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, so where did you go after Dwyer [Dwyer Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: After Dwyer, I went to Sampson [William T. Sampson Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], and from Sampson came many of the leaders in the black community in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: It was on the west side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was near Tabernacle Baptist Church [Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan].  And there were other stellar churches like Hartford Avenue [Hartford Avenue Baptist Church; Hartford Memorial Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan] was over that way, St. Stephens [St. Stephen A.M.E. Church, Detroit, Michigan], and they had ministers who were in the public eye, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay so th- this is an elementary school?  Sampson or--
Speaker 2: Sampson is an elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It also went to the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Kindergarten to eight grade.
Speaker 1: So who, who was there when you were teaching?
Speaker 2: Our principal was William--
Speaker 1: (MELVIN J HOLLEY):  Billups.
Speaker 2: --Billups, William Billups [William St. Clair Billups], who was one of the first black principals hired and he would encourage his teachers to go into administration.
Speaker 1: That way, any of the, the famous Detroiters there when you were at Sampson?
Speaker 2: Not that I could, not that I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay 'cause you said there were lots of figures--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well who were the ones that you, you know?  It good to name them.
Speaker 2: In the community.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, their names are not coming to my mind right now.
Speaker 1: All right.  I thought that--okay, so, so you're at Sampson Elementary School for--
Speaker 2: I stayed there for about two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I went to Bal- no, let's see did I go to Balch [George W. Balch School; Golightly Education Center, Detroit, Michigan]?  No, I think I came out again (laughter) for maternity leave. And then I went to the int- the, the integration--well let me go back a little bit.  When I started teaching in 1956, there were only certain schools that black teachers were assigned to, when I came back in 1964, from maternity leave, then they were sending black teachers all over the City of Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was sent to a school, A.L. Holmes [A.L. Holmes Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], and I believe I was the first black teacher assigned to that building as a music teacher or as any kind of teacher.
Story_ID: 612989
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit.  Now we, we skipped your marriage now.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: How, how did you meet your husband [HistoryMaker Melvin J. Holley]?  That's a big deal in life, so?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were a group a churches that fellowshipped together and he went to one of those churches and he had four, three sisters and their father [Major Holley, Sr.] and mother [Ethel Jones Holley], they had like a family choir and because our church [Bethany Tabernacle, Detroit, Michigan] did things with their church, often times I would play for their family choir to sing.
Speaker 1: Okay now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Especially when we traveled with our minister he, he traveled to Canada, he traveled to many other parts of Michigan.
Speaker 1: Now what year did you meet your hus- your husband?
Speaker 2: Oh he says that I met him, or that we met when I was twelve or thirteen, but I had a dad [Henry Dorsey] who said no guys in this house at this time of your life.  But, he says he knew who I was because I played, so I was always, you know, out front kind of like, but that's how I think we met, because I played for his family choir to sing a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so what year did you start dating or?
Speaker 2: Probably when I was fifteen, so that would have been 1951. But shortly after that, he went to the armed services so, that kind of separated us for a while.  Which my folks were saying that was good (laughter).  And then we got married in 1957.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so married in 1957?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Recently you celebrated your fiftieth wedding anniversary?
Speaker 2: Yeah, last June.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: This past June.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's a, that quite a--it, do you have any advice to people as, as to how to stay married for fifty years?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah just stay together.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know?  Settle those differences because eventually they all won't amount to much anyway.
Story_ID: 612990
Speaker 1: How many children did you have?
Speaker 2: We have three children.
Speaker 1: Three children?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And at this stage, we were talking about when you're at Holmes School [A.L. Holmes Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], you--there were two I guess, right or?
Speaker 2: No I didn't, I didn't home school.  But I had two children a year apart (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No at Holmes the school, you said you--
Speaker 2: Oh, at Holmes?
Speaker 1: You said that you were at A.J. Holmes [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: A.L. Holmes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had two at the time.
Speaker 1: So yeah, you had two at that time, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Two children. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's about that, that's about what year is that?
Speaker 2: Okay, the first child [Mark Holley] was born in '59 [1959], the next one [Timothy Holley] was born in '60 [1960], but then when I was assigned to A.L. Holmes that was in 1964.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--no it must have been later than that, 'cause Millie [Millicent Holley] was born in 1964, so it must have been in 1966, when I was at A.L. Holmes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so this is a, this is a predominately white school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't believe there were any wh- any black children in that school and it was in Redford [Michigan], or near Redford, which was again another community like a suburban community outside of Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well what was that like, being the, one of the first black teachers?
Speaker 2: Some people accepted me well and then some people didn't.  But that's life, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, no, nobody did anything really bad to you then?
Speaker 2: No, a few name calling incidents but other than that and those were by kids--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) who I know had learned it from their parents, so.  But the, the staff, the staff that I mostly worked with were very kind and we, we did some really pretty good things together. We did some plays where we kind of rewrote some of it and presented it and the parents were always very pleased with what we did.
Story_ID: 612991
Speaker 1: You remember the 1967 riot?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right?  So, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: By then, I was at another school.
Speaker 1: So you were only at Holmes [A.L. Holmes Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] for a year or?
Speaker 2: I was only at Holmes for just a short while because then I went to Balch [George W. Balch School; Golightly Education Center, Detroit, Michigan]--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) after A.L. Holmes.
Speaker 1: Balch School?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's B-A-L-C-H (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) B-A-L-C-H
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, and, well okay, so this on the--
Speaker 2: That's on the east side.
Speaker 1: On the east side?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where did the riots start?  Did they start on the east side?
Speaker 2: No, they started on the west side--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --12th Street, Boulevard [Rosa Parks Boulevard], well not quite even after, that far, 12th Street and Clairmount [Avenue], but that's where that started and then kind of dominated the west side of Detroit [Michigan] and then kind of spread out after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: There was something called the Algiers Motel incident or something that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --triggered off of police brutality?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And I can't remember where the Algiers Motel [Detroit, Michigan] was--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but, yeah, that was a, a common place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But how extensive was--I mean it was, I guess one of the worse riots in U.S. history (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh it was. There are places now when we go back to Detroit that it's still residue of, of what happened during the riot.  Vacant lots and boarded up buildings, it's, it just breaks your heart because some of those areas were very, very, well respected and very well kept up and to see them in such disrepair is, it's, it just, you just shake your head in disbelief.
Speaker 1: So did, in your opinion, did the riots change Detroit?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: You know, permanently?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think there's a bitterness perhaps, well, I don't know, it's this anger and a bitterness that seems to still, you know, be in the city.
Story_ID: 612992
Speaker 1: Do you remember where you were when you, when you heard that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was bringing someone home and we were in downtown Detroit [Michigan], I was taking her home near Holbrook [Avenue] and, near Holbrook and Oakland [Avenue], just east of Oakland and we heard that Dr. King had been assassinated and I hurried and got her home and, and fortunate- fortunate was able to get home myself, you know, quickly, and I still lived, you know, quite a distance from her.  But that's, that's where I was when I heard that he had been assassinated, we were in the car together.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now were there riots that followed that too or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it was just a year later, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, in the same area or different?
Speaker 2: Pretty much the same area but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but again, you know, it quickly spread, just very quickly spread, so.
Story_ID: 612993
Speaker 1: Well tell us about like mov- now, now how did you wind up moving to Lansing [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well we moved to Lansing because of my husband's [HistoryMaker Melvin J. Holley] job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was employed by the Michigan National Guard [Michigan Army National Guard], and so they were phasing out the radar units and the options were to move here or to not have a job at all.  So we had three children [Mark Holley, Timothy Holley and Millicent Holley] at the time so, we decided to, to move here.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that was in 1970?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970], well '69 [1969].  We didn't move here until 1970, because he drove back and forth from 19--for a year he drove back and forth from Detroit [Michigan] to Lansing every day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he started making a transition in '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: By 1970, you moved?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had to make the move.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: 'Cause wearing out the car and wearing out him--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Course our family never got to saw--see him (laughter) so, and our kids were ten and eleven and five at the time.
Speaker 1: Now, I know we were talking before when we started shooting and your husband was saying that Lansing was a tough place to fit into if you're from the outside.  Well did, did you find that to be true?
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very much so.  I did not meet any friends until, well really we got into the group, the Nelson Singers [Earl Nelson Singers] group.  Music has always seemed to be our salvation in a sense. The camaraderie, the camaraderie that we find with other singers and other musicians has always seemed to be a calming effect for our family.
Story_ID: 612994
Speaker 1: What schools did you teach in, in Lansing [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I started at, (pause) it's now the Neogen [Neogen Corporation] building, what's the name of the school?  What was it (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I started really as an aide at Harley Franks [Harley Franks Elementary School, Lansing, Michigan] and I worked with another teacher, this was not in music, she had just been hired by the Lansing School District and she was from Indianapolis [Indiana], and her husband was on staff at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  So I started working with her, but I only did that for a year because I was an aide so when they, you know, we found out that I was, that I had a teaching certificate, then I applied for a teaching job at, it wasn't Cedar [Cedar Street School, Lansing, Michigan], the principal was, principal at Cedar and the--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oak Park [Oak Park School, Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 2: --Oak Park, Oak Park was my first school here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was this all black school (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No. This was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --mostly Hispanic. There were some black kids there and some white kids, but mostly Hispanic.
Speaker 1: This is in 19--or what?
Speaker 2: This was in 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, '74 [1974], excuse me '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Now, you said Hispanic, we--were they like Puerto Ricans or Mexicans primarily?
Speaker 2: Mexicans mostly.
Speaker 1: Mexicans primarily.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I went to Cedar because the principal was, he was principal at Oak Park and Cedar and so they didn't have a music teacher at Cedar so he wanted the same for both buildings, so, I was half time at each school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From there I went to Barnes elementary [Barnes School, Lansing, Michigan], I think.  The teacher that was there had retired so I came in after that person.  Then I went to Otto Middle School [C.W. Otto Junior High School, Lansing, Michigan] which was junior high then and I was half time between Otto and Sexton [J.W. Sexton High School, Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they only gave me twenty minutes to get from one school to the other, so I told the principal, "This is gonna kill me. I need to be in one building or the other building," so he said, "Well, plan on coming to Sexton and we'll build up the--see if we can build up the choral program."  So that was the challenge that I had, to, to build up the program so, I just kind of went out into the hall and said, come sing in my--come, come, come get, sign up for my class and, you know, get in choir.  There have been some kids who have graduated from Sexton who have gone into music as a profession, some are opera singers, some are pianists, and they've done very, very well.
Speaker 1: What is your, has been your sense of the commitment of the Lansing [Michigan], I guess, board of education to, to the music and the arts?
Speaker 2: There's been a desire, but it's been difficult to keep it going.  The outlining areas do have pretty good music programs, but for Lansing, it has been difficult, difficult area. Some schools have excellent music departments.  And one of the problems, I think now is that we have these magnet schools and so there's very little music in the magnet schools that I am aware of and there might be, you know, some pretty good ones still.
Story_ID: 612995
Speaker 1: Now you became director of fine arts at a certain point?  Now, is this a position in the, in the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for the overall schools or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wasn't director--no, just, just for my school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just for Sexton [J.W. Sexton High School, Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So that put you in charge of not only there choral program, but all the fine arts?
Speaker 2: In, in our, in our school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and so there was a band director, there was an orchestra person, the drama, all of those were included and so a lot of times we would do programs together.
Speaker 1: Now, what would you consider the highlight of, of your tenure I guess as a, at, as director of fine arts at Sexton?
Speaker 2: The quality of programs that we did.  I meet people all the time who, who were at Sexton at that time and they remembered the programs that we did and the quality of the literature, the, the musical literature that we did, the camaraderie and the, the, the oneness of, it's, it's not just the band program, but it's the band, choir, drama program.  So that cohesiveness, and which, which really was brought about by the teachers, the teachers who, who were, were directing those programs, the fact that we were able to work together and to present kind of like a united front because this is fine arts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were at Sexton until?
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993].
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-three [1993].
Story_ID: 612996
Speaker 1: You're involved in other activities here in Lansing [Michigan] other--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) than the school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, tell us about some, some of those?
Speaker 2: Okay.  When we first moved here we--about two or three years after we had moved here we, we became involved with a group called the Earl Nelson Singers.  Earl Nelson had started a choral group and the purpose of this choral group was to keep the heritage of the spirituals alive. And so most of the people in the group at the time when he started it were African Americans, he was also a teacher, a vocal music teacher at Otto Middle School, or Otto Junior High [C.W. Otto Junior High School, Lansing, Michigan] as it was at that time.  And so he started this group in 1963, their first concert was given two days after the assassination of John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy].  They started to cancel the concert, but decided they should do it in, in his honor, in his memory and so, the group was started then and it is still going on now, he later became a state representative and then later a state senator, and then moved to the department of minority education and retired from that job and moved to Punta Gorda, Florida.  In 1978, when he was very heavily involved in the political scene, the group wanted to continue singing after he had decided not, that he didn't have time to continue directing the group, so the singers said, well why, asked me, "Why don't you take the group."  And so, somewhat reluctantly I did and we are still singing and we do a concert every year plus we sing at various churches and we sing for banquets and several venues like that.  There are about--
Speaker 1: Okay so, when you took over in 1968?
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And so, we, the group is now of about, has about forty-two, forty, forty-one, forty-two people in it and we still sing the spirituals, we sing the classical arrangements of the spirituals. The (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this is similar to the Fisk Jubilee Singers?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, yes.  Now--
Speaker 1: Or John Ward Chorale [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah. All right.
Speaker 2: The Brazeal Dennard singers [Brazeal Dennard Chorale] in Detroit [Michigan], we do the classical arrangements like the one, the, the arrangements by William Levi Dawson, Harry Burleigh, Hall Johnson, Moses Hogan, most recently Robert Morris [sic. HistoryMaker Robert A. Harris]. Those men who have classical music training and are using, have used their skills to arrange these spirituals so that a choir such as the Earl Nelson Singers can, can continue to sing them and keep them in the ears of as many, as will listen to them.

Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: She died.
Story_ID: 612998
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Probably, when I was taking piano, probably work a little harder (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Get to know more choral literature.  Now that I'm older, there are several things that I wish I could have done more of and those are two things that I, I should have read, I need to read and I just don't seem to have, even at retirement, don't seem to have time enough to read.
Speaker 1: Now if you don't learn or practice certain things when you're young, do, do, I mean is it, is it hard, is harder to get, to do them when you get older?
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those, those skills are still with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, I'm saying--
Speaker 2: You mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) if you didn't--
Speaker 2: --as far as piano?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you said you--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh I still, I--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you said you wish you'd had practiced harder--
Speaker 2: --I still have those skills--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but I, I need, there are other skills that I wish I could add on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, so you can always develop your skills and--
Speaker 2: Always.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Always learn something different, new.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, or improve.
Story_ID: 612999
Speaker 1: Now do you have a, any kind of a, I guess a musical philosophy, or?  About, you know, classical spirituals, or any classical music and how they should be presented, or?
Speaker 2: I've, well, I guess I have an appreciation for a wider variety of music now, there was a time when I would say, perhaps only--I only knew hymns, but as I grew older, I've learned to appreciate the spiritual, the gospel, other classical pieces, compositions from other countries.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, my sphere has broadened, so I'm just not in one little narrow area.
Speaker 1: Now, do, did you have a favorite composition or piece that--
Speaker 2: Piano composition?
Speaker 1: Yeah, or choral--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) composition.
Speaker 2: All right that, I can't narrow it down to one, I like the Chopin [Frederic Chopin], I like the Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven], I like the R. Nathaniel Dett, who was African American composer, I like the Hall Johnson arrangements, all of this, it's just a ton of stuff that I really, really love and I collect as much of it on CD [compact disc] as I possibly can.  And people who know me, if they see something that they think I like, they will buy it for me thinking that I don't have it and sometimes I will already have purchased it but, I just have a love for, for music, choral music especially.
Speaker 1: So you've been the director of this group [Earl Nelson Singers] longer than the founder [Earl Nelson] was the director?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And he comes sometimes if he's visiting in Michigan, he will come to the concerts or, if we have something that's on CD that, you know, we think he will enjoy, we send it to him.
Story_ID: 613000
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for, for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: When I was a kid, it was always impressed upon me and my friends that we should learn as much as we could.  I don't--and I'm, I'm sure that's being encouraged with some kids.  But, there is a huge segment of kids that somehow, I think that's missing, I think the era of TV and the quality of TV has somehow damaged minds.  There was a time when, when you wanted to just learn and just soak up everything that you could possibly learn and nowadays, it's like learn as little as you can, and somehow you will, you know, make it, you will survive. And that saddens me.  Because I know that the human mind is capable of, of learning tremendous amount of material but you gotta vo- you gotta apply yourself and I, I feel that that, the application part is, is missing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Missing.  And I hope we get that back, I, I'm just hoping that the, you know, the, it will come around where, you know, learning is supreme again.
Story_ID: 613001
Speaker 1: Now, when you--again, if you glance back at everything you've done so far in life, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I hope that I'd, that, that the kids that I have had an influence upon while I was at the high school [J.W. Sexton High School, Lansing, Michigan], some of the grade school kids, that's been so long ago, that they have already, you know, they've already graduated from high school, college, you know, have their own families and are in whatever occupation they, they're going to do.  But the kids that I have been able to influence at the high school level and the ones that I am influencing now who are my piano students, I am trusting that something that I am doing with them is imparting to them the, the quality of instruction that was imparted to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, there is nothing that I feel that, what I received from all of my teachers in school, especially my choral and piano teachers that I'm able to impart to the students that I have contact with now.  I'm hoping that it will be imparted to them in a way that they will be able to use for the rest of their lives.  I'm, I'm using it for the rest of mine and, you know, things that were instilled in me as a early elementary kid, I still, I, I'm still using that and I'm, I improved upon it and I've been able to enhance it and, and it's been a blessing to other people.  That's what life is all about and if you, that's all, that's all you can do.  I feel that's, that's the legacy I hope that I will be able to leave to the kids that I influence as it has been given to me.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family, now you just celebrated your fiftieth wedding anniversary--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in 2007?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your, you--you've got grown children now right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us what they're doing and?
Speaker 2: My oldest son is Mark [Mark Holley] and he is living in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, he is in computer assisted design work, and he graduated from high school here in Lansing [Michigan], went off to find himself, did come back home and went back to community college and did finish in the computer assisted design program and that's what he is in now.  I'm thankful for that, because he was kind of like going off the deep end, he had gone off the deep end, but through prayer and people who--the, the very people he was trying to get away from, meaning my husband [HistoryMaker Melvin J. Holley] and I, and our family, he ran into people just like us in parts of the South where he went. And so, they had a very good influence on his life.  He came back to Lansing, went back to school and finished.  My second son [Timothy Holley] is a musician, he is a cellist, he graduated from Baldwin Wallace College in Ohio [Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio], and also from Michigan, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] in the master's and the doctoral program, he is on staff at North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina] and teaches there and also plays in the North Carolina Symphony.  He is also working as, in the honors college there as well, he's married and has two children.  And then my daughter, Millicent [Millicent Holley] is a pathology assistant and she works at the University of Michigan hospital [University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She also has a mortuary of science certificate and has done some work in that field with my brother-in-law [Oscar Holley], and now those are our three children and we just have the two grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, who are thirteen and fifteen now.
Story_ID: 613003
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you that I should have asked you, or--before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: My faith in God, the fact that I was convinced at a very early age that I needed to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, that has made a tremendous difference in my life, I believe.  And I can remember stages of my life where I recommitted to that decision, I can remember doing it when I was nine, the first time, sixteen, when I made a new commitment to this person, Jesus Christ, and then again when I was married [to HistoryMaker Melvin J. Holley], again when I was moved here [Lansing, Michigan] and felt that this was the worse place in the world (laughter), but because of my faith in Jesus Christ, I can see, and even though I'm past seventy now, I can see his hand directing the things that I have been involved with.  That's, that's the most important thing I believe in my life, in spite of all the teaching that I have done and I'm, I hope that the people that I have had an influence on have been able to see that the relationship with--that I have with Jesus Christ, the fact that because He loved me, I can love someone else and it doesn't always have to do with whether I like your behavior or not, but because He loved me, I can love another person.  I saw a girl just yesterday, and she was one of the--a real problem kid, but you know, she spoke to me and she said, "Oh Mrs. Holley [HistoryMaker Verna Holley], I'm, I remember what we did in your classes," and I'm thinking, but you gave me all these grey hairs, you know.  But that's, that's why I hope that, you know, I'm able to show through my life, whether I'm at school or whether I'm at church or whether I'm in the community, no matter where, that, that people can see that I have a relationship with a person who has made a difference in my life, and his name is Jesus Christ.
Story_ID: 613004
Speaker 1: Well, my last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) As a person who loved music.  Well, as a person who loved music, love Jesus Christ, loved to, to be with his people, just love people, I, I, just like to be with people.  And when I can't, you know, like I, I don't like to stay in the house, this, this bad weather, you know, it's too bad to go out, but as soon as this clears up, I'm out the door, 'cause I've gotta be with people.  And I might not even talk to anybody but just, I'm just a people person, you know?  So, I'd like to be remembered as, as, as a person who loved music, loved to share with others, I don't have to get paid to be able to play for other people, I, I will play for you just 'cause I can, and if, if you ask me to play something that I know, heck yeah, I'll do it for you, okay?
Speaker 1: I'll just say incidentally, we, we're sitting in a room here with what, about four or five pianos.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you teach music here in your home?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  This is my retirement job, I guess you would call it, but I enjoy doing it and I enjoy the parents that I am in contact with, as well as their children and I appreciate the privilege of being allowed to work with their children.
