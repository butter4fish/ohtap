Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you what I call People magazine-ish type questions.  What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.

Speaker 2: I guess it would be northern Michigan up near Mackinac Island [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying, or bible verse?
Speaker 2: I was thinking about that.  I imagine the thing that attracts me most is Edmund Burke's statement; he was a British philosopher of the 17th century [sic. 18th century].  He said, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people do nothing," and I've always remembered that.
Story_ID: 633385
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your family and let's begin with your mother's side of the family.  Tell me your mother's name and spell it for me, and tell me where she was born and when she was born?
Speaker 2: All right. My mother's name was Marguerite, M-A-R-G-U-E-R-I-T-E Roberts [Marguerite Reed Roberts].  She was Marguerite Reed; that was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Reed, R-E-E-D (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) R-E-E-D, yes.  Um-hm, she was born in Chicago, Illinois.  Her parents came from Paducah, Kentucky and she had--one--she was one of six siblings in her family, she was the oldest child.  And she lived in Chicago for most of her life and near the end of her life, she--well, she then moved to Detroit [Michigan] with my father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.].  And then she came to live with us in the last few years of her life.
Speaker 1: When was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in about 1906, I think.
Speaker 1: And her parents you said were from Kentucky.
Speaker 2: Yeah, her parents were from Kentucky.
Speaker 1: And what were her parents' names?
Speaker 2: Her parents' name was--they were Felix [Felix Reed], her father; and Nora [Nora Robinson Reed], her mother, my grandmother and grandfather.  He died before I ever knew him.
Story_ID: 633386
Speaker 1: Did you know your [maternal] grandmother?
Speaker 2: I did know my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A very forceful matriarch who ran everything.
Speaker 1: Now, they lived in Kentucky and did they live on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They moved to Chicago [Illinois], though, very early when my--so they, they, they were born in, in Kentucky.  But most of their lives were spent in Chicago, so I would say Chicago was their home.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, tell me about your grandmother, Nora [Nora Robinson Reed]?
Speaker 2: Nora was one who became a widow after she had six children.  At an early age, her husband [Felix Reed] died of heart attack at fifty-five years of age, so she had to raise those children by herself.  And she became the, the central authority for the family.  Very loving, very wise, and very authoritative, I guess by necessity.  She inspired all of her grandchildren, there were quite a few of us maybe about twelve or thirteen.  I can't remember how many, but you always knew if you wanted to know the answer to anything what you ought to do, you went to Grandma.  Now, my parents [Marguerite Reed Roberts and Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] were well educated but she always thought she knew more than they did.
Speaker 1: How much education did she have?
Speaker 2: Oh, maybe elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did she ever talk about life in Kentucky?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you have no information about where they, about whether they lived on a farm?  Did they sharecrop or--her family that is?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.  Now, her mother [Maggie Robinson] was a very strong woman, her name escapes me but I think that whole matriarchal strength came through her.  And she lived in Chicago too but she had moved to Chicago, and she was a very, very strong person.
Speaker 1: What about your--did you, you visit your grandparents, well, your grandmother when she lived in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Because we lived in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that was one of the wonderful weekend excursions that you could do.  You could get away from the, the heart of Chicago and go out to Lilydale [Illinois] where she lived in a small, poor suburb and sit with her.  And I learned so much from her.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that you and she talked about or that you learned from her?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My parents had raised me to realize that I was living in Chicago and that you couldn't always be friendly because it might be dangerous.  She was very concerned about the fact that, as I was growing up, I didn't have the civil graces that she thought I ought to have.  So she was one who said, "You don't say yes and you don't say no.  If you see an adult, you say, yes ma'am and if you see a man, you say, yes, sir."  And she, she said, "You speak to people."  And we had been told, in Chicago you gotta watch who you speak to.  I had a friend of mine who was kidnapped at one time, and so people were very afraid of that.  And so she was one who said, "No, no, you speak to people and you learn to do some things that are civil and you will be able to get along."  She also had a very strong sense of being independent.  She wanted me to be sure to get a business of my own so I could be my own boss.  My grandfather worked as a valet in a large hotel and he spent all of his life in the lavatory swishing off dust from people who came in.  She said, "I want you to have a drugstore because then you can be in charge of your own life and can determine what you're gonna do."  She was fiercely independent and she didn't want us to be dependent on anybody else or to have to really work for anybody else, where we couldn't determine our own destiny.
Speaker 1: I see.  And, of course, she passed this on to her children as well.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that sense of independence was very much in my mother and in all of her children.  She had six children, five girls and one boy and they were all characterized by that in, in varying degrees.  My mother was the first child and she has that, you know, authority that the first child has because the first child becomes the caretaker and protector of the rest of the children in a sibling arrangement.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories, your mother, about growing up?
Speaker 2: Not too many, I mean, we were there with my grandmother and she could sort of tell us some things, you know, that were going on.  So I think it was assumed that we knew what the stories were, but there were not too many stories that were related to us as children.  We just had a sense of the spirit of indomitable courage and that you could do anything that you wanted to.  And she, she told her children that she wanted them to try to achieve if they could as well.
Story_ID: 633387
Speaker 1: Now, what school did your mother [Marguerite Reed Roberts] go to?
Speaker 2: My mother went to Chicago Normal [Chicago Normal College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], she, she became a teacher.  And, at that time, you could teach with two years of college education.  She later went back when we moved to Detroit [Michigan] and got the full baccalaureate degree at Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan] but she taught for many years, you know, in that manner.  And she got a master's degree from Wayne but that was later on in her life.  The thing that I loved about her is she got her master's degree after I finished college [Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee], and she was determined to believe that age never stops you from progressing and from doing what you need to do.  And I think that's what she instilled in me and my sister [Jacqueline Roberts Michael].
Story_ID: 633388
Speaker 1: Describe your mother [Marguerite Reed Roberts] to me, tell me what type of relationship you personally had with her?  Just, in your eyes, describe her to me?
Speaker 2: Well, the same strength that I talked about was evident.  One of the things that happened that will always stand out in my mind, when I was thirteen years of old--age, I was stricken with tuberculosis and, at that time people didn't know what sort of drugs could be used to overcome it, and a lot of people had been dying of it earlier than when I was born.  And my father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.], who was a minister, was just terribly worried because I was his only son and his oldest child.  And the doctors were trying some new experimental medicines on me, and we weren't too sure whether they were gonna work or not.  And he had sort of taken a fatalistic view of it and was sort of running and hiding and not wanting to face me, knowing that this might be the end.  In the middle of all that talk about the unsurety of whether or not I would live, my mother came to me and said, "Boy, we gonna make this, you know, I'm gonna hang with you and you gonna live don't worry about that."  And, it was the strength that she gave me then because a lot of times healing is psychological as well as physiological.  It was that kind of strength that she gave me to say, you're gonna make it against insuperable odds that, that God is with you now.  She was not a preacher, but she became my pastor at that time and told me I could do that.  And that was the thing that really sort of stood out in my mind.  And people like that, who had that kind of strength, you know, really stood out for me.  I had another woman who was a good friend of my mother's, who said when I was ten years of age, "You're gonna go somewhere."  She said, "I can tell by the way you walk, you hold your head up and you, you--," and she said, "Always keep that in mind."  Now, mind you, I was born in the time of segregation but living on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] you didn't really know it because I thought the South Side of Chicago was the whole world.  But, but she was preparing me indirectly for the kind of person that she hoped that I would become.  And so, my mother and her friend and other people in the family on the matriarchal side were very influential (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was her friend's name?
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Speaker 1: You can't remember, okay.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Weston [ph.], that's her, but, you know, she was---
Speaker 1: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I hadn't thought of her for years.
Story_ID: 633389
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father a little bit and tell me his name, and spell it for me, please (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Joseph Lawrence Roberts, Sr. [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] and I'm the junior.  He was born in Monticello, Georgia, Jasper County.  His--he was one of nine siblings, they were born on a farm, his father was Russell Roberts, his mother's name [Sallie Roberts] escapes me right now.  That was my grandmother, I never either of them.  They were gone when he was fourteen years of age and he was on his own.  They had a farm, sixty acres, they were very proud of that.  They weren't sharecroppers, they were growing their own groceries, and also supplying commodities for the market.  They grew strawberries and other things.  My grandfather, Russell Roberts, was very proud of the fact that he had his own land because this was the time when sixty--forty acres and a mule did not come to us even though it had been promised to others.  And he was able to acquire this land.  I don't know how he got it but he was able to grow things on it.  But the thing he prided himself in he had, out of the nine children, two sons and seven daughters and he said he was just proud of the fact that none of his daughters had to work for white people in the kitchen or do anything demeaning or servile.  And he would sell his crops and he, you, he fought for that for years.  He died and my grandmother died, my grandmother died first and then he died later.  And my dad sort of had a responsibility for all nine children, at fourteen years of age he had nobody to actually help him.  And so, a little later on he was able to find out about opportunities for education and he decided to go to Knoxville [Tennessee].  A friend of his, Judge Lublis [ph.], who became a judge told him about that.  This is around the time of the First World War [World War I, WWI].  And he went there, left the farm, and entered high school.  He had dropped out of high school in his junior year to try to help his father pay the mortgage and do the rest, but after he died he wasn't able to do it, so they stuck with the farm as long as they could.  And he went back to do his senior year when he was twenty-one years of age at Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee].  That was the time the freedmen bill [Freedmen's Bureau Acts of 1865 and 1866] had made it possible for blacks to go to school and finish secondary education and get a baccalaureate degree at the same time.  So he did go back to school, worked in the fields, and did a number of black youngster who had been on the farm.  And worked in kitchens and did all kind of things like that to try to make it, and he was successful in matriculating in Knoxville College, which shows us the value of the historically black college and university [HBCUs].  He finished there and went on to seminary, McCormick seminary [McCormick Theological Seminary] in Chicago, Illinois and completed that.  And then became an African Methodist Episcopal minister.
Speaker 1: Was that the religion of the family from the-the denomination, I meant (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The denomination was African Methodist Episcopal, yes.
Story_ID: 633390
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your mother [Marguerite Reed Roberts] and father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in his first church in Chicago [Illinois].  He saw her when he was going to Sunday school and church, she was playing tennis.  And one thing led to another.  I think the fact that she seemed to be opposite of what he was about sort of attracted him, because opposites attract.  And they got to know each other and subsequently they, they married.  He tried to build that little church out there.  The thing that I want to also say about my father though that I admired so much, when he went to McCormick seminary [McCormick Theological Seminary, Chicago, Illinois], he was the only black student in his class.  And because he was dirt poor, he had to work in the kitchen and do whatever he could, and he couldn't afford the books so he'd have to wait until one of his classmates would let him read the assignment after he had read it.  And he was able to make it through seminary that way, and was determined to do it and finished the course in three years, that's the normal course of seminary--four years college, three years seminary.  And he did that and he graduated, and it was just with a sense of great pride that he did that.  And I have another part of that story that I'll tell later.
Speaker 1: All right, and so he meets your mother at his first church? State (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His first church, St. James A.M.E. Church [St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church] in Chicago, Illinois, which still exists.  And they married subsequently, and to that union two children were born.  I was the first and my sister, Jacqueline Michael [Jacqueline Roberts Michael], was the second sibling.
Story_ID: 633391
Speaker 1: When you think back, if you think of your first childhood memory, what would it be?
Speaker 2: Hm, my first childhood memory probably would be the Coppin A.M.E. Church [Coppin Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois], I mean, I had friends there.  We were there sixteen years, so I was there almost through high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: What's the name of it?
Speaker 2: The Coppin, C-O-P-P-I-N, named after an African Methodist Episcopal bishop, Coppin A.M.E. Church in Chicago [Illinois].  And a number of my friends were there.  I went to elementary school in Chicago and I knew a number of people there, you know, and I can think of people who were influential in my life who were in that church.  Clarice Norris [ph.] was one who took care of us while my mother [Marguerite Reed Roberts] taught and my father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] was doing his church work.  And she read to us every night.  And I think our love of reading and the expansion of imagination came through what she did.  And it just taught me how very important it is for us to take time to read to our children and with them, even if they can read.  Television, of course, has destroyed that because we no longer use our imagination.  We think we have it, but television to me was a great disappointment.  I could see in my imagination things far more glorious and far more meaningful to me than what the television did.  It, it diminished my imagination and diminished my, you know, my hope and, and, and a number of other things for me.  I like the world of dreaming and visions.  I was devastated when I found out that it wasn't a Santa Claus, I mean, I--it just never was real for me again, you know, to find out how it really came about.  So maybe I live in, in metaphors and mythology.
Story_ID: 633392
Speaker 1: With your mother [Marguerite Reed Roberts] and father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.], when you think about either one of them, what characteristics do you think that you received from your mother and your father?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let me start out with my father.  My father was terribly disciplined, he had to be.  Terribly much a workaholic, he had to be.  Believed in integrity, believed in morality, and was very loving but was rather stern.  He had a quiet sternness about him, I mean, he didn't believe in, in beating you and doing things like that but he also believed that you should do things.  He insisted on me taking music lessons, for instance, playing the piano and I didn't see that at first, but I did learn to do that.  And he told me early on, he said, "You'll appreciate that, this one of these days."  And I did become a fairly accomplished musician, and I appreciated it later when I went into ministry and when I had a fuss with the organist.  And when she stomped out, I was able to jump up and go on with it.  And so, there were some things that he said that I didn't really know about at the time but I really appreciated, because he was one who believed that you ought to be disciplined, growing out of what he had to do to survive.  He would have never made it if it had not been that.  And I think that's one of the things that we lack now in, in this unfettered generation which we live.
Speaker 1: And your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother had that indomitable strength.  You can do it, you know, don't let them stop you.  My father was a bit of a pacifist, and I don't wanna say he was passive, but he might let things slide.  My mother would not.  She was far more confrontational and I've found that, that confrontational attitude that she had has been very beneficial.  Now, I know how to cloak it in humor, I know how to get what I want done, I know how to put a spin on things.  But I haven't had the trouble my dad had in the ministry because I didn't take certain things from people.  I mean, you know, if we were gonna have a confrontation that's fine, I hope you stay in the church but, if you don't, we will keep going.  And if there was an obstacle put in my way, I always felt it could be overcome and you could get around it, and there were always alternative ways to get things done.  And that's been a part of my life.
Speaker 1: And you got that from your mother?
Speaker 2: I got that from my mother, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was she the disciplinarian though in your home?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, she wasn't the disciplinarian.  My father more could say something and, you know, you were really scared when he said something.  My mother would whip you but you knew you could get away, you know, you could--finally, she'd, she'd calm down.  But she would, she would do the hollering and the, you know, the belt whipping but, I mean, he would just say a word and it was done.
Story_ID: 633393
Speaker 1: Just a thought when you were talking about your father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] and the things that he had to go through, his siblings, they all were able--did they all go to college?
Speaker 2: No, no they didn't.
Speaker 1: Did they--where did they go once the farm--they couldn't stay on the farm?  I know he went to Knoxville [Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went to Knoxville College and his younger sister--one of his younger sisters went to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], but the rest of them may not have gone to college at all because there was nobody to support them.  There was no Pell Grant, nothing like that, you had to do it on your own.  And without a father [Russell Roberts] and a mother [Sallie Roberts] and no money, and the farm gone it was just difficult.  Some of them worked on the railroad.  My Uncle Fleetwood [Fleetwood Roberts] worked on the railroad and he, he made a vital contribution to that.
Story_ID: 633394
Speaker 1: So, your family lives on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], tell me what the South Side of Chicago was like?
Speaker 2: The South Side of Chicago was sort of like what we're trying to build in the HOPE VI communities here.  It was a mixture of people from all walks of life.  You had Dr. Lawless [Theodore K. Lawless], who is the famous dermatologist who lived down the street from us, and you also had a woman of the night, who lived on the other side of us.  And you, you had this mixture of folk, you saw life in microcosm.  Rich and poor, learned and unlearned lived together because there wasn't the opportunity to escape to the suburbs and to try to get with your own kind.  There was a real sense of community there, you know, and I, I saw some things that were very influential to me.  I saw how some men would come and support one of the ladies in the community, bringing groceries to them and they were married and lived elsewhere, and they were not black.  And you begin to sort of pick up on a number of things, you know, that were going on.  It was a very good educational experience.  There was also the feeling that you had role models in front of you and you could decide which way you wanted to go.  And you were able to see the values in people who had not achieved academically or professionally but who had some other qualities of steadfastness and determination that were very, very good.  And it taught you how to live and deal with, and learn to love in a way a number of people because they were on your block and this was your neighborhood.  And I think it was far more meaningful than what we see now today when we talk about neighbors.  I think neighborhoods have been destroyed.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me more about the people in the neighborhood, who owned the grocery store or the candy store?  Where did you shop?  And this was a totally black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Totally black neighborhood on the South Side.  And there weren't the A and Ps [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company] then, you went to the butcher for one thing, you went to another person for something else.  The shops and the stores were basically owned by people in the Jewish community.  There was an ice cream store, Baldwin's [Baldwin Ice Cream Company], that was owned by a black person and everybody patronized it because we were so proud of it, and because he had good ice cream.  You know, barbeque and shrimps and all of those things that were ethnic delicacies could be bought from black people but, basically, it was a small grocery store that had you tied in.  Of course, you could go downtown to the big stores and, you know, get what you wanted to when you, when you wanted to get some clothing or something like that.  But in the immediate neighborhood you would be serviced by the small store down at the corner or by the drugstore.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you remember the address or the street that you lived on?
Speaker 2: I lived on 53rd [Street] and Michigan [Avenue] right in the middle of the block, 5348 South Michigan.
Speaker 1: And was this a house or an apartment?
Speaker 2: It was apartment, six apartments linked together and we lived on the first floor.
Speaker 1: And how many rooms were in your apartment?
Speaker 2: Oh, maybe two bedrooms.  You slept--for a while, my sister [Jacqueline Roberts Michael] had one, my parents [Marguerite Reed Roberts and Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] had another and I slept in the dining room on a cot.
Story_ID: 633395
Speaker 1: Before your father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] went to--well, were you--was your father a minister when you were born?
Speaker 2: He was, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Marguerite Reed Roberts] was a teacher?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what was it like, were you a latchkey kid?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.  There were people in the church who sort of acted as nannies and my people paid them.  And so, I could come in, you know, and find somebody there at home.  That was fortunate, I was able to get--and I learned a lot from those people.  Just a, you know, a whole lot of stuff about maturity, they were older and they were wise.  And they would just give you a few lessons, you know, that you had not had before.  And they were not at all opposed to maybe slightly contradicting your parents in some of the behavior patterns that your parents might allow that they would not allow.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Strict disciplinarians, you know, take off your school clothes, put on the other things, you know, you might slow around with your parents.  But, I mean, if you didn't do what they told you to do, they would crack down on you, you know, I mean right away.  So you learned certain things about them that--and about life and discipline that, that helps you know that everybody doesn't love you and everybody isn't gonna be permissive, and everybody isn't gonna let you get away with stuff.
Speaker 1: Do you have a story that you can share about that?
Speaker 2: Let me see, I'm trying to think of one.  There were so many, nothing comes to mind right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Who were your friends in the--in your neighborhood [in Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Folks who lived in the houses near me.
Speaker 1: Do you have any lifelong friends from that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Because--yes and no.  Let me say, because we moved.  Being Methodist, we had to move from place to place and we moved to Detroit [Michigan].  You weren't able to keep those ties going.  I have some friends whose names I remember, and some who come to you now, you know, when they pass through town and might say something.  But, no, those friendships didn't last.  I would say I established more friendships in college [Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee] and those friendships have lasted through the years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see, I see, all right.
Story_ID: 633396
Speaker 1: Tell me about elementary school, what elementary school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to the Edmund Burke Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois] and to the A.O. Sexton Elementary School [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  And when I quoted Edmund Burke a while ago: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is good people do nothing." I didn't learn that at Edmund Burke, I can't remember what I learned at Edmund Burke.  It wasn't always a pleasant place.
Speaker 1: And, why was that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we had all sorts of people who went to Edmund Burke.  We had gang fights and stuff like that, you had to learn how to survive, you know, and it was the survival of the fittest.  And if you were fairly well-off, by that I mean, you know, none of us were that well-off, but I mean if you had a little more, there was a little envy and jealousy and, you know, and there would be some robbing and taking your money and trying to do all this.  So you had to get with people who you knew and you had some favorite folk who you knew.  So that was a thing that, that characterized Edmund Burke.  A.O. Sexton was the second school I went to when my people moved, it was in a better neighborhood and I think it was more influential in my life because it started saying you can have aspirations for things that are ahead and things that are good.  So, then in Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois] was the place that I went to, to high school.
Story_ID: 633397
Speaker 1: So your family moves, what year do they and where do they move?
Speaker 2: When we left Chicago [Illinois] or?
Speaker 1: Okay, Sexton [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School] is where?
Speaker 2: Sexton is in Chicago.
Speaker 1: In Chicago.
Speaker 2: It's a elementary school in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you moved, so that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We moved from 53rd [Street] and Michigan [Avenue] to 61st [Street] and Rhodes [Avenue], and that's when I went from Edmund Burke [Edmund Burke Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] to A.O. Sexton Elementary School.  It was the neighborhood school.  And then after graduating eighth grade I went to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois], which was a neighborhood school.
Speaker 1: Now, you said your experience at Sexton was better than at Burke.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And why was that?  Well, tell me why.
Speaker 2: Well, at Sexton School I discovered that there were more people who were like-minded, you know, who, who, whose parents were sort of pushing them in the same direction.  And there was less envy and jealousy of you if you were aspiring to do something.  They had clubs that were designed for people who were thinking about going to high school and to college, you know.  And, and those kind of things were motivational.  The teachers were more inspirational, they didn't act like, and I'm not putting teachers down, they didn't act like they were just trying to hold you in check so that you wouldn't, you know, just break away.  But there were people who were there who were very inspirational.  I remember Mrs. Hudson [ph.], my mathematics teacher, and she was a very short woman, but she called on you to be disciplined.  And I was amazed that she would have a class of people who would obey her.  I mean, we were afraid of Ms. Hudson.  Now, she taught us mathematics but she was very, very inspirational in the way she taught you because she let you know you had to do something.  Then we had a white teacher, Mrs. Moore [ph.], who always made us figure we could achieve.  She said, "Look, there are a number of people in your grade and they're taking math and I hear that the class down the hall is doing better than you are, you're not gonna let them get away with that."  And do you know, we knocked ourselves out trying to do better than another class.  I don't know whether it was true or not, but it gave us the, the catalyst to actually try to, to do better.  And so you had the feeling that now things were getting lighter, you had the feeling that you could be optimistic, that you could achieve.  And that carried itself on over into Englewood High School where a guy named Pat Buchannan [ph.] and a few more of us who were striving to do things competed with each other academically.  I mean it was sort of a joke, but there were other people who were sort of goofing off but we would wanna know who got the best score.  We would talk to each other on the phone, you know, "Man, I beat you at that," and, and so that would go back and forth.  And it sort of revved up all of us to see if we couldn't do something to actually overcome.  I'll never forget graduating from A.O. Sexton School, Benita McCall [ph.], who is a classmate of mine, we were at a little party on the graduation night and she said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph L. Roberts], we made it."  And I looked at her and I said, "Made what?  We just got out of elementary school, this is nothing," you know, but you began to sort of differentiate between people who had higher ambitions.  And maybe I was fortunate, you know, because of the context in which I was born, and she might--I didn't know anything about her family but, I mean, it was that sense that you could make it.  And I ran into more people who said, "I'm gonna try to make something of my life."
Story_ID: 633398
Speaker 1: My father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] told me at fourteen, he said, now--he was older when he got married, he said, "You are gonna have to realize that very soon you might have to take over responsibility for a family.  You are the oldest child and I am older, so be sure to get all you can now so that you will be equipped to do it."  And, you know, you related the story of how at fourteen he had no parents and that always stuck with me, that you have to be ready to take responsibility for your family.  And the story that he told me about his life influenced me at that point.  So, you begin to get more experiences of achievement and more stories of inspiration based on hard work.  And that's the thing that really characterized my years at Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Of course, that's when I got TB [tuberculosis], was not able to participate in sports, felt very badly about that.  I could run well, I thought I'd be a track star, but they had to limit me.  I had to take Aureomycin and I had to drink a malt every day, so I felt a little depressed at that time.  But the thing that was glorious about it, even though I could not do athletic stuff, I was reading more just to try to find something to do.  And I enjoyed reading Jack London's 'A Call to the Wild' [sic. 'The Call of the Wild'], I'll never forget that and a number of other books that influenced me.  And I, I grew a love for reading.  I was able to achieve things, National Honor Society and all those other kind of things, but they weren't the robust things, you know that one would really hope to do in high school.  But I did enjoy my high school tenure.  In the junior year at high school, the bishop moved my father from Chicago [Illinois] to Detroit [Michigan].  And that was an earthshaking time in my life.
Speaker 2: The teachers at your high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A.O. Sexton [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no, in, in high school, were they also the type of teachers that were trying to influence you and encourage you to go to college?
Speaker 1: I would say not as much as the teachers at A.O. Sexton School.  They had a larger group of students to deal with and they couldn't give you the individual attention that you needed.  I felt that they were good teachers, but they'd lay it out as if you were more mature than you probably were and say, "Okay, here it is.  Pick it up, but get with it and run with it.  You're gonna, you're gonna be sixteen or seventeen soon."  So I felt a shift in the support system that was offered by those who taught there and I didn't have the affinities with my high school teachers that I had with the teachers at A.O. Sexton.

Speaker 1: You talk about spending time reading, what about your music?  Did you continue with your music lessons?
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough, at thirteen I quit my music stuff.  My dad [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] had me then take organ 'cause he thought I was tired of piano and that might be challenging.  I did that for a while but then I quit it, because I just didn't wanna do that anymore.  He was a disciplinarian, you had to be at the piano at 7:00 in the morning or you'd get a spanking.  You played from seven--you practiced from 7:00 to 7:30 every day.  I can see that as valuable now, I didn't like the way he coerced me into that.  And so, I did drop that off.  But I got into choral music with the church and a bunch of other things, you know, which, which always interested me.
Story_ID: 633400
Speaker 1: You talked about being a dreamer, what were some of the things you were dreaming about at that time?
Speaker 2: Some of the things that I was dreaming about was ways that I could make a contribution to the world but, let me be very honest--the first dream I had about a profession was that I would be a dentist.  And I wanted to be a dentist because I remembered as a child, maybe when I was about eleven or twelve, we had a family dentist who almost killed me when he extracted a tooth.  And I had fixed in my mind--I said it to myself.  I'm gonna go to dental school and hope one day I get him in the chair, and pay him back for what he did to me.  So, I mean, that was a, you know, a fleeting thing and a, a sign of immaturity.  I later thought of law because I loved to read and I loved to argue.  And so, I said, you know, this might be something that I might want to do.  I wasn't thinking about ministry at the time, because later on I had a sort of negative experience with ministry.  When we were in Chicago [Illinois] and I was coming up on my senior year at Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois], the bishop decided to move my dad [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] from Chicago to Detroit [Michigan], which meant I wouldn't be able to finish my senior year in Chicago.  And my friends were there, I had grown up there, I had been born there.  And he asked for leniency and the bishop did not allow him to stay one more year.  He had done an admirable job in Chicago, had remodeled the church [Coppin Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois], built an educational building, and done a bunch of things.  And I thought the man should have left him--let him stay.  And I'll never forget the day he received his assignment to go to Detroit, we were going into the DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois]--and he--the whole church had been praying, just believing that the Lord would make a way for him somehow.  And I just didn't--I, I thought I had a better sense of reality, maybe growing out of my mother's [Marguerite Reed Roberts] ability to deal with what is, and I said, "You're not gonna be assigned back to the church in Chicago.  He's determined to move you to Detroit."  And my dad who was of a more pious and gentle nature said, "No, the Lord's gonna make a way."  Well, that night, and I'll never forget it, at Englewood High School when they read the assignments, they read his last and we had entertained the conference.  I don't know if you know anything about African Methodist Episcopal but we had entertained the conference in our church and everybody was in there.  And that was gonna be the big thing, would the bishop move him or would he not.  And he said, you know, he was gonna move him and he thought he was--this was--this would be appropriate.  And I'll never forget that my father broke down and cried.  I was sixteen years of age and my sister [Jacqueline Roberts Michael] was there, she cried and my mom cried.  And we were driving home, and he allowed me to drive home because he was just out of control. And I said to myself, you know, I will never put myself in a position where another person can determine my destiny.  And I didn't know anything about life, I mean, that was an oversimplified thing.  But, anyway, that's what I said and that stayed in my mind.  And they used to talk about the godly judgment of the bishops, I never thought they had godly judgment.  I always thought that they had human judgment, I thought they put on one shoe just like me.  And for that reason, there was a hostility that grew up in me toward the whole system of the episcopacy, where you can take a family and move somebody from one place to another because--and sometimes it works very well.  Sometimes it very much needed, but to a sixteen year old, who was coming up on his senior year in high school, it did not hit me well.  And I thought the man should have been more flexible.  And so, it turned me off on ministry and I was thinking about everything else.  But gradually, as I got into college [Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee], a number of things happened that made me reconsider it.
Story_ID: 633401
Speaker 1: Now before we go on to Detroit [Michigan], while you were coming up in your father's church [Coppin Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois], what activities were you involved in, in the church?
Speaker 2: I was involved in the youth activities.  I used to work with the youth group and we published a little gossip column, a little, you know, a letter and we all enjoyed that.  We, we hung together quite a bit, we were all about the same age and we had grown up together and known each other since we were very young.  So we would have dances and other things, and that meant a lot and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  When you grow up in an African Methodist Episcopal preacher's home in the days that I grew up, you always had to be a little circumspect.  And I couldn't do everything that everybody else could do.  For instance, we were not allowed to go to the movies on Sunday and, you know, that's just as archaic as it can be now.  My children [Carlyle Roberts, Cheryl Roberts Richmond, and Cynthia Roberts Emory] did whatever they wanted to but, I mean, we were not allowed to do that.  And I always resented that but I had a corps of friends who sort of hung with me and some would go on Saturday.  But, you know, I was pretty popular among them and then of course in the choirs, because I knew music I was able to do pretty well in that and I could--I wasn't a good singer but I could read music, and so I was able to get along. So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did your father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] teach you to read music?
Speaker 2: He really didn't, he tried to play the violin but he was never good.
Speaker 1: So you had a music teacher that taught you to read music?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I had a music teacher, Mariel Rose [ph.], yeah, very, very good music teacher.
Speaker 1: Did you belong to outside organizations like the Y [Hi-Y] or Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] or Cub Scouts?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I was a Boy Scout, Cub Scout, Boy Scout and I, I didn't become an Eagle Scout but went through all of that and found that very meaningful, because it got you out of doors, you know, and it taught you some skills that you had not known before.  There was a scout master, Robert Laurie [ph.], who I'll always remember, who later went into the ministry who was very formative.  He had been in the Second World War [World War II, WWII] and we respected him.  He was young and he was vibrant, you know, and he would have us doing things and was a strict disciplinarian, but he was close enough to our age so that we would respect him and, and would go along with what he did.  He later became a pastor and, I'll never forget, later on he invited me to preach for him.  But he was a very influential person in my life.
Story_ID: 633402
Speaker 1: You move to Detroit [Michigan] and what part of Detroit did you move to?
Speaker 2: We moved into--on, on Edison Street.  It was north of Clairmount Avenue; I don't know whether it was before you get to Highland Park [Michigan] it, it had no description per se.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, this was about 1951?
Speaker 2: About '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Fifty-two [1952]?
Speaker 2: That's when we moved, we moved to Detroit.
Speaker 1: And, the high school again, the name of it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The high school I had gone to was Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And what we did, it was decided after--I should have stuck this in--when I was not able to stay for the last year, it didn't look like it 'cause dad [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] was gonna be moved, my mother [Marguerite Reed Roberts] decided that she would stay in Chicago [Illinois] with my sister [Jacqueline Roberts Michael] and let us finish that year.  And that's how it happened.  And so my dad was already in Detroit for one year before I actually came to Detroit.  So I didn't come (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you graduated?
Speaker 2: I graduated from Englewood High School
Speaker 1: Englewood.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, that's right.
Speaker 1: In, in '52 [1952]?
Speaker 2: In '52 [1952], and really I was a mid-term person.  I graduated in '53 [1953], January.  You know, they used to let you come in and it didn't have to be September to June, it could be January to January.  I was born in February so I was with the January class.  So in '53 [1953], I graduated from Englewood High School and we moved on to Detroit.
Story_ID: 633403
Speaker 1: But that's when I went to Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee]. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, and how did you decide Knoxville College because your father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] attended?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, my father had gone to Knoxville College and to show you how determined he was that I would go to that college.  On the day I was born he sent a telegram to the registrar saying, "In 1953, my son--."  Now you see how little freedom I had--, "My son will be enrolling in the freshmen class at--."  Now, I was, after high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] as high school came to an end, I didn't know what I wanted to do.  I didn't know whether I wanted to go into the [U.S.] Army or do something else, I may have been striking out for some freedom that I didn't think I had in the hotbox of being a preacher's kid.  But what happened, because I had not thought of anything and did not know which way I was gonna go and Korea [Korean War] was coming up and being very strong, I decided to go on and try Knoxville out.  Because I heard James Colston [James A. Colston], who was the president of that school, and he really inspired me.  And he introduced me to positive black men who had been influenced in historically black colleges [HBCUs] because he's a Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] graduate and had been under the tutelage of Benjamin Elijah Mays [Benjamin Mays].  He was one of Dr. Mays' boys and they had that same spirit in them that had been infused by Dr. Mays, and I think that's the gift of historically black colleges and universities.  You have strong personalities in there who tell you, you can do it and who tell you, you have to work hard to do it.  And that's the reason as I look back at my college experience and my graduate school experience, even though I went to schools that were academically better, my, my dearest memories are of Knoxville College and what happened there.  Even more important to me than Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] and Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey].
Story_ID: 633404
Speaker 1: Well tell me about--more about Knoxville [Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee], who were there, the professors that, that taught there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Interestingly enough, the professor who I probably remember most is Wilhelmina Colston [Wilhelmina White Colston], who was the president's wife, who taught history.  And I've just published a book ['Sideswiped By Eternity: Sermons From Ebenezer Baptist Church,' Dr. Joseph L. Roberts, Jr.], and I dedicated it to her because of what she did.  She told us that, as long as black print is put on white paper, you can get it if you will study and read.  I went to Knoxville College when the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] was not opened to black people, when white America was doing the stupid thing of saying, "We will not let black student go to state institutions, but if they want to they can transfer to another school in another section of the country and we'll pay for it."  So there were people in Atlanta [Georgia] who couldn't get in the University of Georgia at Athens [Georgia], who ended up in University of Michigan in Ann Arbor [Michigan].  My aunt was one of them and she got a much better education there, and it shows you the costliness and wastefulness of segregation.  But anyway, she was one who said, you can get it.  All right, University of Tennessee would not allow us to get books out of that school and take them back to Knoxville College, our library was paltry.  But she told me, and I had a double major, she asked me at one time, "Do you know who Disraeli [Benjamin Disraeli] is?"  And I was a senior graduate, and Disraeli was the first Jewish prime minister in Britain and I didn't know about him.  She said, "I want you to bring a report in tomorrow morning on Disraeli."  And so, I said--she said, "And we don't have any books in the library on Disraeli."  She said, "You have to go over the University of Tennessee into their library and, you know, do what you have to do there."  She said, "Now when you get there, they're not gonna let you go back in the stacks but they will bring the books out to you and you take your three by five cards and jot your notes down and bring them back here, and give a report in the class."  Well some of my classmates just laughed, ah, "You know you're catching it, you gotta go over there, gotta ride the bus to get something."  But I believed in her so much that I went on and did it, and I'm thankful that I did it because it taught me one lesson.  It is true, that if black print is on white pages it doesn't matter who you are, you can wrap your mind around it and get the truth out of it and actually be able to succeed quite well.  And so, it was that kind of impetus that she gave that was really important.  I know she told me at one time when she found out I was going to seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York], she said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph L. Roberts]," and she never heard me preach, and I preached her funeral.  She said, "Joe, I never wanna come to church and be so bored by your sermon that I have to try to remember all of the kings in the Tudor dynasty," which was King Henry VIII and the rest, she said, "but I will do that if you are boring and shoot, I might walk out on you."  And so she taught me the fact that, as a speaker and an orator, you need to be able to contact with where people are.  So I would say Wilhelmina Colston was one of the people who influenced me more than anybody else at Knoxville College, there were other professors but she was the guiding--we called her Mother Colston.  She had no sons, and maybe she favored fellows a little more than she did girls, I mean, I don't wanna go into that but that happened.
Speaker 1: Was there another professor there?
Speaker 2: Well, Frank Gordon, who is a minister, taught religion there.  And, mind you, I was in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, he was Presbyterian.  He heard that I was thinking about seminary and so he got me to join the Presbyterian church and said they would pay my way through school.
Story_ID: 633405
Speaker 1: How did you make that determination that now you decided (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, I didn't wanna be an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because of what they had done to my father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.].  I swore--
Speaker 1: So that was the reason that--oh, you were just not gonna go in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I said that back there when they moved him that they would never get--I don't remember if I stuck that in, but when my parents were crying and my sister [Jacqueline Roberts Michael] was crying and I was the only one took them home.  I said I was not gonna be a part of that, where a person would determine my destiny.  In the Presbyterian church you have no bishops, so nobody determines your destiny.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you didn't--you--when you spoke of ministry you meant in the A.M.E. denomination (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, denomination that's--I need to clarify that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  I thought you just decided you were not going to minister at all.
Speaker 2: It was not--no, I'd never be a minister, no, 'cause look where I am now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Exactly.
Speaker 2: So, something must have happened I must have met Paul and Jesus on the road to Damascus [Syria].
Speaker 1: Okay, I got you now.
Story_ID: 633406
Speaker 1: Your major?  You said you had a dual major (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was history and sociology with a minor in religion.  Now, I do have to say, that at Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee], Charles E. Morton was very influential.  A black professor there who had gone to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and had gone to Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary] in New York [New York] and was working on his Ph.D. with Union--Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York].  And he--there were eleven of us who were religion minors and he--Presbyterian paid my way through school but selecting a seminary and getting in to that seminary was his job.  And he sort of took it on, that wasn't his assigned job but he would take his religion majors and tell them where you're going to school.  And he went down the line and said, "You will go here, here, here, here, here."  He said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph L. Roberts], I'm gonna arrange for you to go to Union Seminary in New York where I'm trying to get my Ph.D. [sic.], and you better not mess up, because it will reflect negatively on me.  You better go up there and you better do well."  And so I felt very privileged coming from this little black school [HBCU] without the resources in libraries and in faculty, though they were good faculty folk, to be able to go this topnotch school where people from Exeter and other places had gone, you know, and, and to be a part of that mix.  And I always felt indebted for the inspiration that can-do-ness that, that black college planted in me.  And I would have never made it I don't believe if I hadn't had the reinforcement that they laid on you, and that's the reason I'm for black colleges.  And it's sad to see them going out now because of the lack of funds.  Basically, that's it.  Sometimes the professors did not have the terminal degree, not the Ph.D.  Mrs. Colston [Wilhelmina White Colston] didn't have it but she brought so much to it, she had a master's [degree] from AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] but, I mean, that master's was more to me than people who had the Ph.D. and felt themselves in an elitist category.
Story_ID: 633407
Speaker 1: Now, you were a very good student in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And in college [Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee], well, you must have excelled in your classes for your professors to want to help you to go on to achieve, you know, a higher degree.  Tell me what it--tell me some more because the story about having to go the library and, and the segregation coming from Chicago [Illinois] to Knoxville [Tennessee] how was that transition for you?
Speaker 2: Cultural shock, it was a cultural shock.  Now, interestingly enough, I was naive because all I saw were black people on the South Side of Chicago so I didn't run into the racism.  But we hadn't even cracked the West Side of Chicago to say nothing of the North Side of Chicago.  But you can go for miles and miles and not see
Speaker 1: Wait, we need to stop for a moment, please.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1: I was talking about Charles Morton [Charles E. Morton] and how influential he was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we were talking about the cultural shock.
Speaker 1: The contrast--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, the cultural shock.
Speaker 1: I think that came out clearest to me in that illustration that you used but it was another one that was very meaningful.  After I got to Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York], I had a young lady, who I was interested in, in Knoxville and I came back to Knoxville to see her.  And having been in New York [New York] and having lived in Chicago, I forgot about--(background noise) let me deal with that.  I can deal with that.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, yes, you were telling me about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, as I was saying another instance of the difference between the North and the South was glaringly brought to my attention when I came back to Knoxville to visit my girlfriend after the first year at Union Seminary in New York.  And I was on a Greyhound bus, I got off and I had to wait for a while.  And I was going into the restaurant and I went into the restaurant and blacks were not allowed there.  And then I was going into the waiting room, I didn't pay any attention to the sign.  I went in there and some person came up to me who, you know, looked despicably dressed and disheveled but he was white and he told me, calling me by the N name that I had no business in there.  Now, I'm coming down from New York with my tie and my (unclear) and I said, here it is.  It does not matter, there are still people who have racist attitudes and that's a reality that I had sort of forgotten.  Never ran into much in Chicago but in New York, and so that was a sort of cultural shock, which was good, because it brought me a wakeup call and said, you know, it is not all right.  There're two nations, two systems of justice and two methods of acceptance.  And you're not accepted by both groups.
Story_ID: 633408
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Knoxville [Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I graduated from Knoxville in 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you left right away to go to New York [New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York], um-hm.  And I was there for three years, graduated in '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk about New York.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Now, Chicago [Illinois] is considered a, a pretty, you know, it's a big city.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Knoxville's [Knoxville, Tennessee] a small town.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now you're going back to another big city.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But there is a difference between New York and Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your experience there?
Speaker 2: Okay.  One of the things that I noted right away was the sense of community.  I worked in a church [Church of the Master], you do this as an intern, in a church in Harlem [New York, New York].  And I noticed how the New Yorkers conducted themselves.  For instance, they might invite you to Sunday dinner, and I'm a little preacher, little intern in the church.  And they would invite you in, or even any day they invited you in, and they would give you all you wanted to drink but when it was time to eat they would go back in the back and eat and not offer you any dinner, you know, and all.  And maybe this was just one family, but they were living in a brownstone and I sort of, I sort of caught this.  There was a certain coldness about people there and a sort of indifference.  But the thing that I liked about New York was that--Union Seminary is at 122nd [Street] and Broadway, Juilliard School of Music [The Juilliard School, New York, New York] was across the street, the Hebrew seminary [Jewish Theological Seminary, New York, New York] was across the street and Columbia University [New York, New York] was right down the road.  The elevated train ran right by your windows, I mean, so you'd hear all this noise all the time.  The president of Union Seminary told us--Henry Pitney Van Dusen that the beauty of Union, if there was a beauty, was that it was mixed up with all sorts of traditions and this is the world in which you will be pastoring.  It isn't a quiet little place, it's a place where you will run into that.  And I think it equipped me for a number of different audiences and a number of different demands that were quite diverse, often contradictory.

Speaker 1: The thing that I loved about New York [New York] was that you got so many diverse cultural influences too.  I mean, you could hear students practicing at Juilliard School of Music [The Juilliard School, New York, New York] all night long, and you could go to Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York] and just run into a whole lot of things.  I wasn't--the school is almost in the heart of Harlem [New York, New York], so I could go to a 125th Street and just run into things at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], to go the Savoy [Savoy Ballroom, New York, New York] and all that kind of stuff.  And there were sort of loose social connections there.  I mean, if people had been drinking enough, they'd fall right in with you, you know, and, and I hadn't been used to that.  I'd been sort of narrow, you know, do I know you and there wasn't an--and I enjoyed that.  And, I'll never forget the first time I was invited to a party in Harlem and I was coming home from the party at sunrise.  And I'd never stayed out all night, you know, and, and gotten a--and my dad [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] and mom [Marguerite Reed Roberts] because they didn't know anything about it.  But I thought this was liberation, I said this is wonderful.  I'm finally an adult, you know, I'm able to do what I wanna do.

Speaker 1: I worked for Jim Robinson [James Herman Robinson] at Church of the Master [New York, New York], and he started Operation Crossroads Africa, where he would take students to Africa.  He was an outstanding Presbyterian pastor and he was very influential, very alert to what was going on in Africa.  And we were just coming up, you know, to realize that we had brothers and sisters in Africa, who had been under colonial influence and now were gradually getting free in different places.  And he would go to Ghana and other places with Operation Crossroads to Africa.  I was just a student pastor at his place and I worked with a youth group and a college group, but I saw the things that he did and it broadened my vistas and made me really think that I wanted to, you know, do some other things.  He would spend time you as a, a mentor and that was the practical side of the thing.  And you were able to get stuff from him, he was very influential.  Another person who was very helpful to me at seminary was Robert McCracken [Robert J. McCracken], who was pastor of Riverside Church [New York, New York], which is right around the corner from Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] and he taught preaching.  And I'll never forget, he called me in for the evaluation and said, "You have the gift of your people and you can probably go from the cuff.  You can remember what you're gonna say and articulate it.  But write your sermons, write them out word for word.  Don't read them but have it down," and that was invaluable lesson because when I got ready to write my book ['Sideswiped By Eternity: Sermons From Ebenezer Baptist Church,' Dr. Joseph L. Roberts, Jr.] all I had to do was just pull the transcripts up, scratch out stuff that seemed foolish and put some more stuff in there.  And, you know, that made it possible.  So he was very influential.  The great professors at Union Seminary are people in our field, Reinhold Niebuhr, Robert McAfee Brown, David Daniel Williams [sic. Daniel Day Williams], and the list goes on.  The stars were there when I was there, and I had a chance to study with them and it was just very exciting and beneficial.  The other thing that I remember about Union Seminary was the fact that we had chapel every morning.  Union Seminary is made up of a number of different denominations and each morning you would be able to hear somebody from another denomination who was on faculty.  A person who you would not normally, a person who was world renowned, so I had a chance to hear some of the greatest preaching and that couldn't help but influence you.
Speaker 2: Who were some of, of the, the preachers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I mentioned Robert, Robert McAfee Brown, David Daniel Williams, James Muilenburg, other folk who were there.  We had no black professors at the time, at Union Seminary.  That's been changed now, wonderfully changed.  James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone], who is an authority on black power, has been there for years, James Washington [James M. Washington], who wrote very significant works about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and what he was about, certainly was there and has come in subsequent years.  But we didn't have too many people.  I was a classmate of James Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.], who became pastor of Riverside Church, and Oscar McCloud [J. Oscar McCloud] and others.  And so, I'll never forget when James Forbes and I were looking in at Riverside Church just around the corner.  We said, "What a magnificent house this is," never dreaming that he would become pastor of that church later on.  So we have made some real progress since that time.
Story_ID: 633411
Speaker 1: Talk to me about the difference in the denomination.  You went from A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] to Presbyterian, tell me what the differences were for you?
Speaker 2: Okay.  The thing that I think made the difference for me was the seat of authority.  The seat of authority is democratic in the Presbyterian church; the congregation elects their pastor.  If my father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] had been a Presbyterian, he wouldn't have had to leave Chicago [Illinois] because the people loved him and would have voted for him.  But, in the Episcopal system, the power is in the hands of the bishop so he can ignore the wishes of the people and just put you in wherever he wants to put you in.  And I think that was the main attraction for me.  Second thing, the African Methodist Episcopal church was not able to offer scholarship money to you because of our conditions, you know, I mean, I'm not being critical, knowing that we just didn't have the money was there.  The Presbyterians had all of that money and they could pay your way all the way through school, so I always had my graduate work at Union [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] and at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] paid for.  Really, something that was due to me but I was grateful, you know, to get it and, and, and other ethnic minorities were really grateful for that.  The third thing that I liked about the Presbyterian church is, even though it did not have a bishop who told you what to do, it did have certain connectional rules.  It did have certain rules of governance that the people had to follow, and it had a general assembly which spoke to contemporary issues.  It just wasn't the Bible, the blood, and the blessed hope.  But it was how are we gonna involve ourselves with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in Selma [Alabama] and other things like that.  And they were always about doing something in that area.  And they especially were dedicated to community organization and economic development, and I found that very attractive.  The fourth thing that I liked about the Presbyterian church was, when you got out into the church, they would guarantee you a minimum salary.  And I got out and got married [to Esther Jean Wortham Roberts] and I needed a minimum salary, it was not a lot but you had a floor that you could actually live on.  In the A.M.E. church you got what you could get and there was nobody backing you up, there was no denominational support that would give you a supplement to actually help you make it through.  And so that was another thing that I found attractive in the Presbyterian church.  Now, in terms of theology, Calvinism is not like Wesley [John Wesley], I mean, you know, Calvin [John Calvin] believed that we are predetermined and predestined, Wesley believed in free will and so they were quite different.  Presbyterians are colder, more analytical, more intellectual.  Methodists are more free spirited, you know, the, the, the flame that runs from heart to heart and breast to breast, that's a Methodist term, you know.  And so, you would find a higher sense of spirituality in that particular church.  But I went on into it and, of course, when I got the scholarship they assumed that I was gonna work in the church.  I mean, I couldn't do--and so I said I'd go on through with that, you know, to be able to get through school.  And so that was--those were the reasons I was attracted to the Presbyterian church and I worked in it for a while.  Then after I'd been in two churches, I was given a national position.
Story_ID: 633412
Speaker 1: Before we go forward, after you graduate--well, get your degree, I wanna talk a little more about your, your personal experience, your personal experience or relationship with God.  When did you know that you--or, well, yeah, when did you know that you had your own personal relationship with God?
Speaker 2: I think one of the influential things for me was coming out of that sickness [tuberculosis].  I really felt that it had been through the power of God and support of my mother [Marguerite Reed Roberts] and medical science that I actually was able to come through that, you know, and, and find that very meaningful.  And I, I felt that I owed God a life of service and of gratitude.  I mean, I wasn't on any big mission but I really felt that, you know, that would be a thing that I would be called on to do.  The other thing that was very influential to me was to see the way God guided things in my life and that's how I knew he was real.  For instance, when I didn't know where I would go to seminary or how I would pay my money, there was Charles Morton [Charles E. Morton] saying, "I'm sending you to Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York]."  When I didn't know how I was gonna pay for it, there was Reverend Frank Gordon, saying, "If you join the Presbyterian church, we will pay your way through."  And when I graduated from seminary and had no church to go to, there was an executive named Ted Rath [Theodore Rath] in the synod of New Jersey and I went over to him and I said, "You know, I'm getting ready to get married in three weeks and I don't have a job, you know, what can I do?"  And he said, "I'm sorry, I don't have anything for you," and was empathetic and all that, and he said--and I was getting ready to go out of the door and he said, "Wait a minute, there's a church [Weequahic Presbyterian Church, Newark, New Jersey] that we're about to close.  We're willing to support it for a little while longer if we can get somebody to go there.  Will you take it?"  I said, "I certainly will."  I saw the hand of God working in my life in ways that I had not planned, it came by surprise and that reinforced my faith.  It made me feel that, you know, God would make a way.  So in those instances two weeks before I was getting married, I got a church.  A small church but it was very, very influential in my life.  And some of our best relationships happened there.
Story_ID: 633413
Speaker 1: You talk about getting married, who did you marry?
Speaker 2: I married the secretary's daughter at my father's [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] church in Detroit [Michigan], which means it probably was good for us to go there, because that's where I met my wife.  She was a very fine young lady and has been a wonderful wife.
Speaker 1: And what's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Esther Jean Wortham Roberts.
Speaker 1: And how long were you married?  I mean
Speaker 2: We've been married since Jesus died.  We got married in 1959, you know, you can do the math, forty-eight years--
Story_ID: 633414
Speaker 1: What was the name of your first church?
Speaker 2: The first church had an Indian name, it was called Weequahic, W-E-E-Q-U-A-H-I-C, in Newark, New Jersey [Weequahic Presbyterian Church, Newark, New Jersey].  It meant deep cove, I don't know how it related to that church 'cause it wasn't in a cove.  But, anyway, that was the name that it had and it had started in 1910, and there'd been a number of pastors of that church through the years.  It was small, I was the first black pastor of the church but again I had said they were about to close it down so we didn't have too many people in there.  I remember the first Sunday I came we had fourteen people who were in attendance.  We were able to live right next door to the church 'cause they had a manse and that took care of housing needs, so even though the salary wasn't a whole lot at least I didn't have to pay rent and so that made a big difference for us.  And it was in a community where Jewish people had lived and black people were coming in.  You know, modest, a modest income and modest means.  And so we were able to do some things that were very, very creative and unorthodox in that place.  We decided in--when we were trying to fix the church up, because we were aid receiving, to sell chicken on Saturday.  And we'd fry chicken, and I'll never forget it, we'd fry chicken and I'd help to deliver it, I mean, I've always been hands-on with the people.  And one woman, Mrs. Ford [ph.] who we'd deliver the chicken to, we were so busy trying to cut it up--she wanted a drumstick separated from the upper thigh.  And one of the brothers when we were doing it, pulled it off like that.  And I had to deliver it to her.  Before I could get back to the church she had called the church and said, "Some dog had this chicken I can tell by the way it's all torn up.  And it's a shame, I want my money back."  And it was so hard to tell her what we had done but we were able to do a number of things in the church through efforts like this.  And sort of bring the people in the community who were members of the church together with us, and that made a big difference.  We had a fight in the church.  A fight was over where the church picnic was to be.  This is my first church, I'm twenty-four and I had suggested that we might have the picnic--it wasn't so much where but how we were gonna get to it.  They had always taken cars to the picnic and I suggested that we might be better off taking one chartered bus rather than having all the traffic.  And there were people who had been there years before who said, "We've always done cars and we not gonna let this young preacher come in here and change us."  So we had to have a meeting of the church on whether or not we would use a bus or whether or not we would use the individual cars.  And that's when the people rallied to me on an issue as small as that.  That was my first church fight and my first victory when we got that done.  Then later on at that church, there was a man who had been there, and now mind you this was a predominantly white church with black people coming in, he had been there and he was as old as my father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.].  And he took offense at the fact that I was as young as I was running the church.  He said, "Boy, my son, my youngest son is older than you and if you think I'm gonna take orders from you, you got another thing coming."  So he started causing confusion in the church, and he used the fact that he had been there longer to say he knew what the people really wanted.  And so we had this back and forth and we--I went to him over and over again--lived right across the street from the church, right across--and tried to bring him over.  But my wife [Esther Jean Wortham Roberts] told me one day, she said, you only have sometimes fourteen to fifteen people in church on Sunday.  It grew subsequently, but she said, "You're wasting time on one man and neglecting thirteen of us who are ready to move."  And that taught me a great lesson.  I said, you know, I will not spend time on him.  We lost him to the church, his wife was the organist at the church.  She quit on us and walked out but I was able to keep it going for a while, you know, and I would play and preach and do that, but we found somebody who came in and was able to help us with that.  But those were experiences, I was there for about two years in that church.
Speaker 1: And how many members were there when you left?
Speaker 2: When I left we had a 125.
Story_ID: 633415
Speaker 1: --You did a number of things to get the people to come back, to come who had never been there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To come, to come.  These Baptists and folks, they had never been Presbyterian you know what I'm saying.  But it really doesn't matter about denomination, it's whether or not you can relate to the people and can do something meaningful in their lives.  So, from that church [Weequahic Presbyterian Church, Newark, New Jersey], I had two daughters [Cheryl Roberts Richmond and Cynthia Roberts Emory], one while I was there, her godparents came out of that church.  And then my second daughter's godparents, when I moved to another church, came out of that church too.  And it was just really beautiful.  I had a man named Odell White [ph.] and Marie [Marie White (ph.)], they were in the church and they were in my new members class.  And I'm coming up there with all that seminary stuff, you know, and going around the room, read this, read that, read that, read that, and he didn't come one day.  And his wife called me and said, "Odell is not coming because he can't read."  And then I said, "Wow," and so I got to know Odell and talk to him and said, "Brother, let me talk to you about what we doing in the class."  And I sort of filled him in orally on what we were doing and didn't make it a big threat.  And he felt very much welcomed there, but he was very adept at fixing things and he lowered the baseboard around the house in the little room where we were gonna put my daughter, who was yet to be born, so that the air wouldn't be able to come in.  And he did that and we were so appreciative for what he had done--we had no money--that we said, "Will you and your wife be the godparents of my first daughter when she's born?"  And they were just thrilled with that.  That was the kind of thing that really helped.  I was student body president at Knoxville [Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee] so I knew how to get along with people, you know, from--and I, I love people.  And so that, that's, that's an illustration of something that I will always take from me from that first church.  My children's godparents barbequing chicken and being cursed out for tearing it up and doing all kind of things, and letting a dog get it before I brought it to Mrs. Ford [ph.].
Story_ID: 633416
Speaker 1: After two years, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to East Orange, New Jersey, which is a stone's throw.  I was--they call you, you know, and there was a church that merged, that it had 350 members in it.  Mount Carmel Presbyterian Church in Newark [New Jersey] merged with the Elmwood United Presbyterian Church [sic. Elmwood Presbyterian Church] in East Orange to become the Elmwood Church [Elmwood United Presbyterian Church, East Orange, New Jersey].  And they called me there in '62 [1962] I should say.  I was there from '59 [1959], '60 [1960] almost three years but it was in the middle of the year.  And I came to Elmwood with 350 people, a nice facility, and you know, I was really--I mean I really thought I had hit clover because now there were gonna pay me a salary of six thousand dollars a year plus a house, you know, I just thought that was the greatest thing in the world.  'Cause I had been at Weequahic [Weequahic Presbyterian Church, Newark, New Jersey] for four thousand [dollars] and I called my folks [Roberts' parents, Marguerite Reed Roberts and Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] and said, "My goodness," you know, I've really made it big time.  That particular church I stayed with from 1960 until 1970, and in that time did a bunch of things.  The church had a good music department, we grew.  Weequahic Church was in the middle of a residential area and it is very important I discovered to be sure that you're on a main line and where people can see you, and remember you or forget you but at least they know you're there.  You couldn't find Weequahic unless you knew where you were going.  And so, they didn't have MapQuest, so that's what we ran into.  And I took the church, in part, because it was a promotion because I now had two children [Roberts' daughters, Cheryl Roberts Richmond and Cynthia Roberts Emory] and because I wanted to be where we could be seen and do a bunch of things.  And that's where I spent a good little bit of time.  We decided to remodel the educational building, didn't get a chance to finish it before I left but it was in that particular time that we saw church grow from 350 to one thousand.  And by 1970, we had, we had seen that particular growth and a number of things had transpired that really were very meaningful.
Story_ID: 633417
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were some of them?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the most memorable one was the fact that I was chosen to go to England, Scotland and Wales by the National Council of Churches [National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA] to be a team of six preachers who would preach over there, and I was able to take my whole family.  So I had my two little girls [Cheryl Roberts Richmond and Cynthia Roberts Emory] and my wife [Esther Jean Wortham Roberts] and we all went over there, and we had just a wonderful time.  And then, in 1968, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died and all of the churches everywhere were having commemorative services for him.  And the churches in the Oranges, that's East Orange [New Jersey], West Orange [New Jersey] and Orange [New Jersey], got together at a big Baptist church and asked me to preach the sermon commemorating the life of Dr. King.  And so I did that and that was another--I mean, not knowing that I would ever be here.  In '68 [1968] still Presbyterian, you know, so that was a thing that really got to me out of that experience.  But, I think the fact of the people got excited about building and knew they could do things, and were willing to try it, that was good.  The most important thing though for me was, when I got to Elmwood [Elmwood United Presbyterian Church, East Orange, New Jersey], they were an aid receiving church.  They were on welfare.  They could not pay their pastor or take care of their bills, and I told them--I came on April Fool's Day, I said, "Maybe I'm a fool but I'm gonna tell you--," I was getting cocky now--, "I'm gonna tell you that, if we are not off aid by April, 1963, I'm resigning."  And I, you know, I--they might of been glad to have me do it but we were able to get off.  And that was very significant for their self-esteem, because they could do it.  People can do almost anything they want to.  But, anyway, they did it, and they got off that.
Speaker 1: What was the process that they went through to be able to do that?
Speaker 2: Give, give more, give the tithe, you know.  I mean, they, they had it, but they were so used to the crutch.
Speaker 1: But you were able to explain why they needed to do that for their own benefits (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh, yeah, um-hm, for their own benefit, um-hm.
Story_ID: 633418
Speaker 1: This is during the, the height of the Civil Rights Movement (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was going on in the community there in Englewood?
Speaker 2: No, no, at Elmwood [Elmwood United Presbyterian Church, East Orange, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Elmwood, I'm sorry, Elmwood (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were going through a fight to try to get black administrators in the school system.  And we were trying to get vice principals, believe it or not, we had no principals.  And so I got in the middle of that fight with Dr. E. Alma Flagg, who was a person in the congregation, who hoped that she would be able to make it.  Now, she was in the Weequahic [Weequahic Presbyterian Church, Newark, New Jersey] congregation but, when you are in close proximity to two churches, you still are pastor of both.  So we were fighting that battle with all of the black people who were trying to get promoted and we were able to succeed in getting that done.  Now that seems like a small victory.  Then Selma came up and I didn't do the march on Selma [Selma to Montgomery March], and that was 1963.  I was Elmwood at the time.  As I look back on it, I really wish that I had but I just had another baby and, you know, things were really pretty dangerous there.  Some of my white liberal friends said, "Come on down, you know, come on down."  I said, hm, I don't know.  And I didn't do that.  But, I mean, we got into other things that were involved in, you know, in the whole civil rights struggle.  We were very much involved in the voters right act of 1965 [Voting Rights Act of 1965] and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  And I would explain it to the congregation and tell them, you, you've got to take advantage of this, you know, because voting is very--well, the, the normal thing.  And they would, they would get into it and they, they felt it was very commendable and because of our work there, we were able--I think that's the reason they asked me to speak about Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  There was a lot of police brutality going on, and we fought that.  And, when I say we, I mean other clergy persons, this wasn't a solo thing.  But I was able to meet with them and they said, "This guy is progressive."  Now, Union seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] was known for that, being progressive--prophetic and progressive and probably more liberal than other seminaries were.
Story_ID: 633419
Speaker 1: Did you have any relations, relation--a relationship with the King family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's very funny that you should ask that.  I'm, I'm a good friend of former Congressman Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III], who headed UNCF [United Negro College Fund] for years, and who left [U.S.] Congress to pastor of Bright Hope Baptist Church in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And he was--his family had been at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], his daddy [William H. Gray, Jr.] was president and all that kind stuff.  He invited Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] to Montclair, New Jersey for a big event that they were having, and the whole town was out.  It was Sunday afternoon, and he had us all, all the clergy were to line up and to go in.  And so, I hadn't been in town that long but I lined up.  I'd got in a little late and he said, "Now, you get right here," so I got there.  And, as we were walking up the auditorium, the audience just got up, you know, as I passed along and I was enjoying the adulation so I walked slowly, you know, and they were just cheering.  Gray ran up to me and said, "Fool, will you move on.  Dr. King is behind you, they're not cheering for you.  They're cheering for him."  I felt like two cents in Chinese money.  But, anyway, that's, that's, you know, that was my first encounter with--I didn't get a chance to meet him but, you know, I actually saw him.  And then I heard him lecture at Trenton College [Trenton State College; The College of New Jersey, Ewing, New Jersey] and he was marvelous.  I think that's when I understood his genius.  He was not on an ego trip, he was very much concerned about being one with the people and lifting them up.  And, as I'll talk about later, one can see that in the way he, he manifested his ministry.
Story_ID: 633420
Speaker 1: Now, in 1963 the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me what your thoughts were at that time?
Speaker 2: I just thought that was just marvelous, you know, I said, this is really putting the axe at the root of the tree.  And I thought it was a beautiful thing to see happen, and I was very much moved by--my father [Joseph L. Roberts, Sr.] was still alive.  He was able to be there too, so it meant a lot, meant a lot.
Speaker 1: Did you attend?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: You did attend.  So, did you have busloads of people go--or did you go on a bus or did you
Speaker 2: I went with a group.
Speaker 1: A group of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, with a group of people.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, and so you in--did your church [Elmwood United Presbyterian Church, East Orange, New Jersey]--was your church involved--now, you talked about voting but was the church actively involved in voter registration?  Did you have a, a drive (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did we have a voter registration drive?  We, we hadn't had that, we developed that later on but we did urge our people to take advantage of the opportunities to vote.  One of the things that was true, activism usually emanated from the black Baptist church.  Presbyterians, black ones, were few in number and sort of conservative, you know, and not, not really up on the ball.  But these people were pretty alert and they knew what they needed to do especially since they had fought for school positions for black administrators and that had not been there.  So they knew that voting was the way you get it and putting protests on, and pressure on is the way you get it.
Story_ID: 633421
Speaker 1: Now, the congregation grew from 350 to a thousand, did it become a, a majority black church or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  It had been mixed but, I mean, it was a majority black when I got there with the 350.  And they continued, you know, in that vein.  We, we had very few white members and those were people who were there years ago who weren't going anywhere.  And we had some, you know, wonderful experiences with them.  In Weequahic Church [Weequahic Presbyterian Church, Newark, New Jersey] it was interesting because this was the first time they had a black pastor, and I was accustomed to taking communion to people.  And one woman had let it be known, a white woman, that her husband was sick she didn't want any black preacher coming in there and bringing him communion.  And, I'll never forget, Al Wohl [ph.] was his name, I was going out there that afternoon with the communion and so I went to their house and gave him communion.  We sat down and talked for a while, she was there and I left.  That was a transformative experience for her because she hadn't seen a black person who was bold enough to do something like that.  And she was able to see the love of the Lord, when he died, she asked me to come from Elmwood [Elmwood United Presbyterian Church, East Orange, New Jersey] and bury him.  And we had some experiences like that which were, you know, really, really capital.  And, again, it's my mama [Marguerite Reed Roberts] saying you do--and my grandmamma [Nora Robinson Reed] saying, you do not acquiesce to evil.  The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people get chicken hearted.

Speaker 1: Reflect a little more on, on the 1960s and what was going on?
Speaker 2: Well, of course the March on Washington was the thing that awakened us all to what needed to happen and it called the nation together to see that it was a large problem.  I think the 1964 civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964] was very, very significant and I took it as my duty to interpret it to our congregation, because under the 1964 civil rights bill of course was Title VII, which called for the federal government not to allow discrimination in hiring.  That was just very important for all of us to know.  And we'd been doing battle on some small problems in East Orange [New Jersey] on that, and in Newark [New Jersey] on that with the principals trying to get into school systems.  The 1965 voting rights act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] was it, I mean, one had to remember that, that voting was really ours after the civil--I'm sorry, after the Civil War.  And that from 1865 to '77 [1877] we were able to vote.  And then that all was taken away from us with Jim Crow laws, and I said you cannot sit this thing out, you know, we've got to do something about this.  This is a way we can change the nation, and that's what Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was telling us.  Give us the vote and we'll change the nation.  And so I was trying to get people who were in the Northeast and the North and the Midwest not to be so complacent and apathetical.  I think activism--political activism seemed to come out of the South because this was the place where the crunch was felt more visibly.  When you don't feel the crunch, you think you can stay in your comfort zone and that's the thing that I've always felt was so sad about those of us who lived in other parts of the country and did not feel the heels of oppression on us.  We weren't, we weren't sensitive to what this was, you know, we had little fights but we didn't know anything about Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama] and all those other kind of things.  So I thought voting rights was very important for us if were ever to do anything in this nation and of course it's been seen since that time.  And then the 1967 housing rights bill [Fair Housing Act of 1968], which really didn't pass until after Dr. King's assassination in '68 [1968], that's when we had hoped that it would come.  But then Dr. King and the Vietnam War saying, you can't have a war in Vietnam, you can't have a war of guns and a war of butter at the same time.  And you remember when we were going through the poverty--war against poverty, he said you can't do that.  I mean, you, you can't kill people off elsewhere and have money to do what you need to do for them here.  That's the same thing I think we're learning today, we can't spend $2 billion on a war and take care of people who are very much in need at the same time.  But, I, I sensed the fact that he was broader than any of us, that he saw justice having a long arm.  And I said, I need to make sure that I never let the people I am working with sink into narrow ruts.  I was determined not to do that in terms of what I did and the things that I got involved in.  And so I was in Amnesty International and a bunch of other things.  The Presbyterian church had sent me to Africa two or three times and I was able to get some sense of where we were there and then to contrast that with what was going on in, in Europe.  And, and I was aware of the Middle East crisis and how we had to do something about that because some of ours--I was concerned Jesus was a Palestinian Jew, so there's no argument about, you know, the Jews fighting the Palestinians.  If you're not gonna kick Jesus out of the Bible, then you've got to admit that he was both Palestinian and Jewish.  And I think our lack of knowledge about how these things connect have really sort of messed us up.  And, and so I was concerned about the Vietnam War, about the fifty-eight thousand who were being killed and drafted, and I've always been concerned about that.  And about the brunt of the fact that the oppression falls on the backs of poor people.

Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970] you leave Elmwood [Elmwood United Presbyterian Church, East Orange, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And where do you go?
Speaker 2: I come to Atlanta [Georgia].  I come to the national office of the Southern Presbyterian church [Presbyterian Church in the United States].  You see, the Presbyterian church didn't settle the Battle of Appomattox [Battle of Appomattox Court House], the Civil War was not over until 1983.  There was always a Northern Presbyterian church [Presbyterian Church in the United States of America] and a Southern Presbyterian church built on the foundation of racism.  And, you know, the government settled it at least in, in words faster than the church did.  So I was working for the--I had been in the northern church as it was called, now it's called the southern church to work on social action and race relations.  And what I was called on to do is work with congregations in sixteen states in the South to try to see if we could move toward reconciliation through empowerment, and that's what I told them I would bring.  I was not concerned with integration; I was not concerned with assimilation.  I was concerned with how we can actually share our power with one another and make up for some of the things that have been done in the past.  So I came and worked with various churches to try to see that happen.  And of course that threw me into some very large white southern churches and some of them were surprised to see me, in the first place, being a black person.  And I guess I got into the greatest amount of controversy when we were fighting apartheid in South Africa and I was siding with Nelson Mandela and talking about the evils of that, and how America had actually a partner in maintaining apartheid, because that's what we had, had in this nation without calling it that for so many years.  So, we would go on that and, you know, they would write letters to my boss and say, "You know, why don't you get rid of him?  We don't wanna hear what he has to say."  I felt very free though, you know, because I always said to myself I could grab my Bible and go back to preaching if I had to.  But I was working with these various churches, I met some wonderful people in the midst of that and I don't mean to categorically put down any race because I'm with Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson].  I have no permanent enemies nor permanent friends, but just permanent issues.  And if I find I'm able to coalesce with people on issues, doesn't matter what color they are I able to do that.  And I have--I know enough about human nature to know that we are all evil and we're all good, and that pigmentation of skin means nothing if we know nothing about our character.
Story_ID: 633424
Speaker 1: So, was this a successful mission for you?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  I--the denomination decided to restructure itself, the southern denomination [Presbyterian Church in the United States].  And they decided to have six major departments.  I was with the board of national ministries and they had one that they'd created the Board of Corporate and Social Mission [sic. Division of Corporate and Social Missions], they were gonna separate it out.  Foreign missions and Christian education and the rest, and I had come up with a work unit on social corporate and social mission.  They decided, because I had made the thing up, that I was the only one who knew about it and I was the best one for it.  Finding your niche in the market, so they made me the director of the board of, of corporate and social mission equal to all of--there were six of us who had control over a $4 million budget.  Now, I mean, I didn't actually control it but, I mean, you know, I was--that's what they said.  The church responded pretty well to us, but when we got into certain civic and social issues like apartheid, like condemning the war [Vietnam War] and all that kind of stuff, it meant that certain people reduced their giving which had an effect on us, you know, at the top.  And we all had to deal after the reconstruction of the thing with cutting down, and when people get ready to restructure and save money, they always cut out people.  So I had to make the decision about who I was gonna dismiss and some of those people I had just brought on a year before and they were good friends.  And I had to dismiss one person because we didn't have the money to keep him, and all of us had to take a cut.  And so when that happened I was not comfortable.  I said, "This is not a Christian thing to do," I mean, you know, but who said capitalism was Christian, anyway.  So, I said, you know, I didn't like it and we didn't have the money to do what we needed to do.  So, I said I'm gonna start looking for a church, now, this was 1974, I'd been here since '70 [1970] working with the Presbyterians.  Again, Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III], who had introduced me to Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], indirectly was a very good friend of the King family and he knew Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] was getting older, Daddy King was seventy-five in '75 [1975].  And he said, you--, "I'm gonna introduce you to the Kings, you need to help them out."  Now, mind you, Martin was dead.  A.D. [Alfred Daniel Williams King], his brother, had drowned and Otis Moss [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr.], who had been here for a while, went back to Cleveland [Ohio] so he had nobody really to help him.  He didn't know whether any of his grandchildren were go into ministry, but it was a gap there and he needed somebody.  So, why don't you go over and preach for him?  So I'd preach every now and then.  Daddy King was impulsive, but what happened that really shook us all from center to circumference, Mama King [Alberta Williams King] was killed in this church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] at the organ on the fourth Sunday in June, 1974.  And the church really never got over that.  They had called me into a meeting and said, "Why don't you come and be his co-pastor?"  Well, I knew that wasn't meaningful because, you know, we don't co well at all.  I mean, you gotta have one Tarzan and one Jane and one cheetah, but we can't have, you know, two bosses--not two black men.  We don't--white folks don't do that well either.  But, anyway, we decided to go on with it, you know, and he--they said, "Why don't you come in and--," and I just said no, I couldn't do that.  I'd rather stay where I was.
Story_ID: 633425
Speaker 1: On the day she was killed, I was supposed to preach here [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] but I had to do some work for the Presbyterians and I wasn't able to come.  I got the news, came over here immediately after church, went over to the house immediately.  And Mama King [Alberta Williams King], she's--that's another chapter, I wish you could--she was the power behind the throne.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm gonna let you talk about her (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, god, she was marvelous.
Speaker 2: I need you to talk about her.
Speaker 1: But, anyway, when she was killed, one of the members of the church said, "We been trying to get you to come over and help Dad"; that's how they put it.  "And this morning they killed Mama King and they killed Mrs. Jimmie Mitchell," she was a trustee.  And they would have killed more but his gun jammed.  And she said, "How many more people are you going to let die before you leave that place where you are and come over and help your own people?"  Well that did it, you know.  I mean, you couldn't say anything, the lady didn't have any theological sophistication but God was working with her, so I was smitten.  And I called and said I would.  But I said, "Let's get a committee together," 'cause I'm used to, you know, the way people did it in the Presbyterian church and we're whimsical in the Baptist church.  We do whatever we want to, you know, and we make up the rules as we go.  So, Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] had me meet with a group of people after his wife had been killed and said, "You know, we wanna really see whether or not you will come."  I said, "I'll consider it, let's get stuff together."  So he got up at the next church meeting, told the people, "I want all of you to come tonight," and four of 'em came out--four hundred of 'em came out.  He said, "Now I'm tired, I've been through enough.  I've lost two sons and all that kind of stuff," said, "I got to give this thing up."  And it was just shock.  He said, "Now it'll be a dog's breakfast if I just try to get somebody in here and elect them."  Said, "I'm gonna tell you need to get as your new preacher so we won't have a whole lot of confusion and this thing will go right."  Now, mind you, I already had the endorsement of Mama King.  He said, "You know that Presbyterian boy, who I've had over here every now and then," he said, "y'all ought to call him as the pastor."  And the chairman of the deacon board, Robert Collier [Robert J. Collier], jumped up and said, "He's not even a Baptist."  King said, "That doesn't matter, I can make him a Baptist overnight."  So, they voted me in unanimously, you know.  I bet some of 'em regretted it afterwards, but anyway, they put me in and he called me the next morning.  Said, "When you gonna get started?"  I said, "Well, what are you talking about?"  He said, "Well, when you gonna come take over the church?"  I said, "Dad, what a--?"  He said, "You are the pastor, I resigned last night and they elected you the pastor.  When you gonna get started?"  Well, I just didn't know how the--newspapers were calling me.  So I knew I had to finish my term at the Presbyterians and that's what I told him I'd have to do.  This was November, I couldn't come until August, this was November of '74 [1974].  I couldn't come until August of '75 [1975].  Now, Mama King had been killed in June, this is November, that they decided.  He, he gave up.  She was the glue that held things together in so many ways in this church.  And so he said that, and to make a long story short, I came in August, 1975.  Greatly suspected and with a lot of grave misgivings on the part of other Baptist preachers.  You know, they said, "Well, why in the world you call that boy?  He's a Presbyterian, he ain't even a Baptist."  And, "I would have come," that's what they told him.  He said, "I knew you would have come and I knew where you were, that's the reason you not here," (laughter). I mean, he was like that just, upfront. I mean, loved you but, I mean, he'd insult you if he wanted to.  So, I mean I had to go through that new boy on the block, foreigner on the block, you know.  And certain people had certain things against you.  But, gradually, you know, we, we were able to sort of win the day and have people look beyond it and see how it might work.  A number of Baptist preachers were saying you not gonna make it there six months, you'll be gone, they gonna chase you out.  The King family is gonna rethink this thing (laugher), you know.  But, you know, we were able to make it.
Story_ID: 633426
Speaker 1: I want you to talk about your relationship with, with Mama King [Alberta Williams King]?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You said she was the glue.
Speaker 2: She was the glue that held everything.  I see Mama King as the--Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came from a great family.  She was probably the inspiration for him.  Quiet, unassuming, but she knew how to control things and she controlled them positively.  Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] was rough and brusque and--but good hearted, do anything for you.  If you had a flat tire, "Come on girl let's go out there and change it."  You know, I mean, he, he's that kind of person hands on.  Mama King was sophisticated, she came from A.D. Williams [Adam Daniel Williams], her mama was Jennie Williams [Jennie Parks Williams], they were pretty sophisticated, and I think her mother was.  And they always believed in college education, she went to Morris Brown [sic. Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and then later to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], I think.  But the point was she knew how to deal with the people 'cause she had been born in this church.  And now we're talking about a woman who is in her seventies, but people will tell you, she made a difference in my life.  She would, you know, she would just--and she did that for us.  She scouted me out before I became pastor, she'd come over to our church--our house.  We had planted some tomato plants, she'd say, "Jeannie [Roberts' wife, Esther Jean Wortham Roberts], where those tomato plants, I need some tomatoes."  And Jeannie take her out there to the place.  She said, "I need a tomato plant," said, "Now pluck those big tomatoes off first 'cause I don't do well with (laughter) and I might not grow 'em.  And let me have that big plant, I'll take it home and put it in my yard."  I mean, she was like that, and you just give in to her and, you know, she'd know--you'd know what she was gonna do.  She directed the music here, she was very influential in, you know, a lot of things that went on here and gave guidance and wisdom to people.  Again, she represented the continuity.  This was her blood, her husband married into this family but, I mean, it was really the Williams' church, 'cause he--her father had been here since 1894.  So you have her in here from 1894, well, whenever she was born, until 1974.  So this was her thing, you know, and she, she really ran things.  She had a warm congenial atmosphere about her.  They would come over and tell me to come by the house, we'd play the organ, she played the organ too.  And she'd say, "Joe [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph L. Roberts], you want anything to eat?"  I said, "No, ma'am."  We'd be sitting down--now, Daddy King loved to eat.  It'd be on a Sunday night; she wouldn't say anything.  She'd go back and push a hot plate of chicken in front of you with biscuits.  And we'd go to--I mean, she just knew how to do those things, you know.  So she got everybody and people just loved her.
Speaker 1: Where did you live in Atlanta [Georgia] when you came?
Speaker 2: I lived near Greenbriar [Atlanta, Georgia].  See, when I came with the Presbyterians, I bought a house.  And, so I had a house when I came here, when I came to Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And, so they used to visit--you used to visit their home and they used to visit you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.  She did more of the visiting, he didn't really know me.  Big--Daddy King was, you know, busy.
Speaker 1: Well, how did she get to know you so well?
Speaker 2: Through Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, Gray and the Kings had been friends through the years, and they trusted what Gray would say.  Very tight, you know.  So, and they went way back in Baptist circles, so that was how it was.  I was--that's how I got in.
Story_ID: 633427
Speaker 1: What were your, your thoughts or did you have any fears of having to fill some big shoes coming in as pastor [of Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  The yes part was the expectations of the people about this place and, you know, they would think that, you know, you got to really be singing 'We Shall Overcome' and you got to really be a giant.  The no part was that I was pretty sure about who I was, and that I realized people came to this church because of the life and now death of Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  That's the reason that 750,000 people have visited this place a year--school kids in the middle of the week, I'm not talking about on Sunday.  But I realized that the first Sunday--I was here preaching the first Sunday in August, they said, "Let the visitors stand."  The church only held seven hundred people; the new one [Horizon Sanctuary, Atlanta, Georgia] holds two thousand.  But, when the visitors stood, five hundred people stood.  And I looked at my wife [Esther Jean Wortham Roberts] when we were on the way home, I said, "We made a mistake, we made a mistake (laughter).  They ain't got no members here, you know, just visitors."  And visitors are like people coming through a revolving door, you know, they look, "Is Coretta [Coretta Scott King] here?  (Makes sound) I'm out of here."  That's what you had, I mean, it was a tourist spot.  And so I did have some misgivings about that, because their interest was not in me but in, you know, the memory of Dr. King.  But I was very comfortable with that, because I was a history major and I was a Presbyterian, and Presbyterians believe in the sovereignty of God.  Because that was there, I could deal with the fact that I was not the reason for people going to church, and the preacher should never be the reason for people going to church.  That's the reason we've had crazy things like James Jones [Jim Jones] and, you know, people drinking cyanide because he told them to do it.  And I, I fear that with mass churches today, 'cause we have a lot of that.  But I think one of the things that really happened, I began to see the fact that this was basically a church that was a country church.  And that Martin had lifted it to national and international proportions, but this would have happened to any church that had such a person in it.  So, as Mrs. King, Coretta King, said, "It's gonna take fifty years for the church and the world to catch up with what Martin was about."  And I never forgot that.  And it was true, I mean, people did not know, and people here did not know that.  They, instead of calling him Martin Luther King, called him Mike, you know.  I mean that--he was going--and, "I played with Mike," and all that kind of stuff, "I ate chicken with him and did all kind of stuff."  I mean, he was able to live in both worlds.  He was very comfortable with himself, very comfortable with people of any class.  And I mean he had such a brilliant mind, and was so well-trained that he was able to represent us.  He was the prophet for our times.  So I counted it an honor to be here to try to interpret to people what he was about and to try to chart the course for the future of this church as one of the many stations where the memory of Martin could play out.  But I never had delusions of grandeur about myself or about this institution, I had appreciation for who he was.
Story_ID: 633428
Speaker 1: You said that this was really a, a country church.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you feel that you needed to now elevate the, the members in, in the church itself to bring it to a status of an urban church and a church where now could reach out in the, the surrounding community?   Because, when I think of Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], I think of it as a historical site, you know, and not so much as a place to go to worship.  But in recent years, you know, after the King--after King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death it was a period of time when it was just seen as a historical site.  But now it's a church where people come to worship, they have begun to understand that this is a vital part of the community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, was this part of your course to, to bring it to another level in that way?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  I'm, I'm very ambiguous about things I say 'cause I don't think there's a white or black side of anything.  I appreciated the fact that Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] had been here for forty-four years as senior pastor and four years as assistant pastor.  And he had that warm, country way.  Now, remember, we'd just got here into the cities, I mean, we were basically a rural people.  The nation was basically agrarian until, you know, we came into the cities and I don't know what's gonna happen to us now.  We're going through gentrification but, anyway, the point is I appreciated what the church was and did not wanna jettison what it was.  But thought if we could add to it so that people would get a well-rounded view of what a church be at in comprehensive ministry.  I always worked to make sure that this church was intergenerational, and intercultural, and inter-educational.  What do I mean by that?  When we would--I would make appointments for men's day and women's day, I would always take one of the old members, who had been here for years who might not be that sophisticated in terms of book-learning, but who had wisdom and I would team them with a younger member who could be--go through an apprenticeship with him.  Then I'd let the congregation choose the third person, so there was always an inclusive thing and never exclusive.  It wasn't a matter of trying to make the church more accommodating to people who came from round the world, because they would come anyway.  I mean, if, if it'd been a storefront because of Martin they would come.  But I was concerned, and you hit it, by not having the church come out being only a monument.  But I always said, we must be an instrument.  And there's a difference between a--you can go to Grant's Tomb [General Grant National Memorial, New York, New York] and see a monument, dead as a doornail.  But, if you wanna see an instrument, then you look at what Dr. King did because he was very significant.
Story_ID: 633429
Speaker 1: We also try to teach that people come here [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], not because Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died, but because he lived.  And therefore we must try to pick up some of the things that he was doing while he was alive and keep them alive.  So that got us into community ministries, we started a senior citizens center, a daycare center for senior citizens, because a lot of our people had to leave their older relatives at home and they weren't sure that they would take their medicines or do anything like that.  And they didn't have the kind of activity that they needed to have.  So, we established the Intergenerational Resource Center [Atlanta, Georgia].  I started it with the senior citizens who were in the church because I wanted to solute them.  I didn't wanna throw away the elders, but let them know that even though they were not King, they had been here when King was here.  So they certainly had more knowledge than we had, and we needed to listen to them.  So we would try to provide some way for them to have someplace to be safe while their siblings were working but in the organization of the church.  I always said, let's keep the people who have been here for years in positions of power and let them not think that we're gonna sweep them away because something new has happened.  I analyzed what the church was and I don't think it's a crime if you have a lot of people who are older to say that in all probability your services ought be geared toward them.  Why punish them because they are no longer young.  I mean, they got us to where we are, can we not honor them in that.  And I think the people caught that, they knew that, you know, I love them from that point of view.  And they were willing to work--so, no, no, we, we, we, we tried to say we wanna do things in this church that are commensurate with the international flavor of Dr. King.  We wanna be a church for all nations so that when you hear our music, yes we do gospels and spirituals but we also do classical numbers.  Because we wanna say that our people are able to do anything, and we wanna be inclusive for those folks who don't feel that they can just stay in one narrow rut.  And so, it was lifted up.  A lot of community organization things were done in it.  We're building a community center.  And across the street where we have work with folks getting GEDs [General Educational Development], we hope to open a sixteen hour a day nursery for mothers with children knowing how many mothers don't have any place to leave their children.  A number of things happen so that we got out of the mold of what you asked about a historical church.
Story_ID: 633430
Speaker 1: Now you talked about being an intergenerational church and I wanna know--you spoke to the fact that the elderly and, and those who were here [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, stayed in key positions.  But were you able to bring in the younger generation?
Speaker 2: We were.  I said we mixed, you know, the folk who came in.  Now there were some young people here, I don't wanna say they were the only ones that--the older people were there and ones here.  You did have younger people then you had children.  A good thing that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] left and we were able to grow on that, you know, so that we could be inclusive but I was just saying that we never got to the point where we said we have to emphasize one group to the exclusion of the other.  And that's what we were trying to show.  We did have the growth of, of, of people who came into the church, they were concerned about the offerings that the church had because we had a number of community action things, the senior citizens thing, the teenage mothers ministry.  There were a number of girls who were getting pregnant in the neighborhood and we got mentors in the church, women in the church to work with them through that particular struggle.  We opened a food co-op so that people could be able to buy groceries at wholesale prices right here on Saturday.  We fed people on Sunday mornings, the homeless people who were around us 'cause we were right downtown.  We tried to make sure that we did that.  We involved ourselves in an organization for international students because we have so many of them who come here.  And we were in AMIS [Atlanta Ministry with International Students], I can't remember what the acronym stands for but, anyway, it stood for international students and we would welcome them as they came here.  We were willing to welcome them as they came here.  We were willing to work with Hosea Williams' daughter [HistoryMaker Elisabeth Omilami] in the feeding of folk and, you know, and we, we did that.  And we had we called an inasmuch fund, if you were broke and in need of help, we would give you some help out of here with some monetary assistance to try to help people, you know, get what they needed.  And so the church was very much involved in that.  We then started thinking about how we could expand that ministry, we wanted to do something with the department of labor in Georgia to try to help with the whole job situation.  And a number of people weren't able to get jobs because they didn't have their GED [General Educational Development], we still have that on the drawing board.  We wanted to work with the juvenile delinquency courts to try to help people get GEDs and see what we could do to actually help them.  We started a thing we called project spirit, which was tutoring in the afternoon for kids who had trouble with reading and math, we said, "Forget No Child Left Behind [No Child Left Behind Act of 2001].  What can we do?"  And I think there are resources in the congregation that churches seldom use because, if you're not reading the Bible, the blood or talking about the blessed hope, they sometimes don't see any way that they can use you, or cooking dinners and--but I tried to tap into those people.  It drew people who were interested in this kind of ministry who were interested in, in, in, infesting the community.  That's a bad word to use, but in, in an attempt to try to draw folk in and that's the thing that I saw.  Brenda Sanford [Brenda E. Sanford], who runs our senior citizens corps, we started with five hundred dollars with that.  That now has a budget of $650,000 a year.  She was able to do that single-handed, she was a registered nurse but I think she got her call from God in doing that.  And she was able to sort of transform things for us and really help us, you know, a lot in that particular area.  Some of the other things in Project Spirit, we got some of our retired teachers to work in that to try to help students pick up and learn as they could.  And so, some of those things really helped us.  Now we've decided to try to do a sixteen hour a day nursery, because with a number of women who are raising their children by themselves, they don't have--and because of the 1996 charitable choice act, people have been pushed off welfare into workfare.  But with minimum wages being as low as they are, they can't do all that at once.  And so for that reason you have to set up institutions where you can do something to help them.

Speaker 1: My criticism with the church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] has been that we have built educational buildings that we only use at night and on Sundays.  It's a terrible waste.  If you look at--right now, this building is serving all that it could be serving.  It's a terrible waste to build a building like that.  If were in business, we'd go out of business because we were not using space efficiently.  And so I've always challenged folks, coming out of that background that I had in community org and economic development, to do something to help our community.  The thing that I think is the most telling story that reflects the fruit of what we were able to do in outreach--when John Kerry was running for president, and by the way we've had all the presidents and candidates in here, but he came by and it was on youth day.  And one of the young ladies--we just turn the pulpit over to our kids on youth day.  One of the young ladies was giving her ten minute sermon and she said, "I'm very happy to be here," she said.  "And I am doing pretty well, and I thank God for this church and for its teenage mothers ministry."  She said, "Because I became pregnant and this was the place I knew I could come that would welcome me and support me through it all."  She said, "I wanna tell you that, not only because of your support but, as one of the partners in my support system, I am finishing high school, I have this kind of grade point average, and I thank you for telling me that I could keep on keeping on."  I told John Kerry, I said, "That's the greatest sermon you will hear as you run to be the Democratic nominee.  You won't hear anything better than that."  And I think that's it, the living examples of actions taken by people.  And that's been my hallmark, that's been what I'm famous for.  To move it from a monument to an instrument, and I feel pretty good about that even though I did build that $8.5 million edifice [Horizon Sanctuary, Atlanta, Georgia] across the street (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we're, we're gonna talk about that.

Speaker 1: In 1984 Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] dies.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, and tell me what that meant to this church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Had he been away, you know, so long that it really did no impact or--well, tell me?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  Daddy King was preaching all over the nation but this was his home.  I mean, he'd been here forty-eight years.  So when I came, he said, "I'll get out of your office upstairs."  I said, "No, you stay in there."  I took an office down here.  I knew, you know, his wife [Alberta Williams King] was gone, his two sons [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Alfred Daniel Williams King] were gone.  Where are the attachments?  His root system had been disrupted.  So he stayed and he was with us very often in church on Sunday.  He was loved, I loved him and all the rest of us loved him.  He had his own way of doing things.  No, he was very much here until '84 [1984] when he wasn't in town.  He would come and sit in the back of the old church, and he'd come in a little late and people would see him.  And I would see him, and we do things disorderly in our tradition, so I said, "Dad, come on up here!"  "No, Joe [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph L. Roberts], I ain't coming," you know, we'd go through this for about five minutes and then he would decide to come up.  He would walk slowly up the aisle greeting--it'd take me about twenty minutes to get him up to the front, you know, and he was a pretty hefty fellow, had a lot of girth.  And so, we had to pull him up and sit him down and, you know, he, he'd say something.  He was very much loved.  And when he died, the bottom fell out for a lot of people.  He was my bridge, I walked on him and I, I have always realized that you stand on the shoulders of yesterday and move toward today.  And, and I loved the old man.  Now, he didn't do things the way I did it but his spirit was great.  The thing about Daddy King that I'll always remember, he was not afraid of anybody and he could manipulate racist judges and make them come to their knees.  Let me tell you how he did it.
Story_ID: 633433
Speaker 1: We had one young man here [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] who was in serious trouble but it was his first offense, and Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] and I both went to the courthouse.  And he'd do this all the time and he was a lawyer.  And he said, when they were getting ready to sentence the young man, "Judge I wanna have a word to say."  I said, "God, what you gonna do?"  Said, "I just want you to know," and he start walking up toward the--to the bench.  Now you know everybody's scared of him, and respected him.  "Yes, Dr. King."  He said, "I just want you to know that I know that you and I are old men."  "Yes, sir."  And he said, "I've done some wrong in my life and you have too, haven't you?"  He said, "Yes, sir." Said, "Now, if everybody punished us for what we did, we'd be in bad shape, wouldn't we?"  "Yes, sir." Said, now, "Judge, I wanna throw this young man on the mercy of the court.  And this is his first offense.  And I don't want you to sentence him as harshly as you might, remembering this is his first offense.  But even more importantly, remembering that you and I have done a lot of wrong things in our life that we didn't get caught for, for.  Am I right, Judge?"  He said, "Yes, sir."  The boy got off, boy got off.  And that was Daddy King's genius, he was able to do that.  So people missed that, you know.  He taught me also, he said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph L. Roberts], never mess with anybody at the bottom.  If you go in to talk to somebody at, at a corporation, see the CEO, don't see the assistant to the CEO 'cause they can't do nothing, no way.  Go and talk to them and, and, you know, get it done."  He enjoyed being Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] father 'cause he got extra fame coming to him.  And we'd be driving down the street, he loved chicken.  He'd say, "I want some chicken," (unclear) I'd be back in the office.  "Ain't nobody here to take me to Church's [Church's Chicken].  Will you take--?"  "Sure, Dad.  You know, what the hell," but don't put that in there.  But, anyway, I said--and it was delightful going with him.  We'd be going down the street and it was no U-turn, he said, "Turn around right here."  I said, "Dad, I can't do that, you know, we're in the, we're in the middle of the block."  He'd say, "What'd I tell you, turn around.  I'm Martin Luther King, Sr., they ain't gonna bother me."
Story_ID: 633434
Speaker 1: The other story, when Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was president, Jimmy Carter made a, a mistake, a flaw when he talked about having neighborhood schools just when we were doing from minority to majority schools.  In other words, we were finding that the 1954 desegregation thing still had us re-segregated with ability grouping and all that kind of stuff.  So there was an attempt to that and, and Carter sort of inadvertently talked against it.  If you kept neighborhood schools, you'd have black schools and white schools (unclear).  So, he said that and they were just jumping all over him like they jumped on him when he talked about the Middle East, and they thought he was talking against Israel.  And Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] came out the next day front page of the paper, put his arms around Jimmy.  He said, "He didn't really mean that, he's good to his heart."  Well, that saved Jimmy Carter.  One day we were in the office after Carter was elected and Daddy King told his secretary, and we were all sitting in there just sort of chewing the fat, and sometimes he was lonesome, you know, his wife [Alberta Williams King].  "Laura [ph.]--."  What was her name?  I can't remember, but anyway, whoever she was, "Call the president."  And so, she said, "The president of the women's?"  "Now, they ain't but one president, who do you think I mean?  Call the president at the White House [Washington, D.C.]."  I said, "Lord, have mercy."  You know, he called the White House.  And King said, "This is Martin Luther King, Sr. I want to speak to President Jimmy Carter right now if he isn't busy." (Laughter) Well, they said, well, "He's tied up right now."  He said, "Well, look, tell him to call me back in fifteen minutes." Carter was back on the phone in fifteen minutes.  The man knew how to use power, he knew how to get things done.  And his genius was being able to stretch it just as far as you could go and get what he wanted to be effective, you know, he wouldn't eliminate you, he would call on the good that was in you, and the guilt that was in you.  He'd make white people feel good and guilty at the same time.  And, you know, "Now you gonna do this, aren't you?"  "Yes, sir."  And that was, that was his genius.  He was marvelous.
Speaker 2: Did you pick up some of his techniques?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the business part and going to the top, don't take anything from a subordinate.  Oh, yeah.  I mean I learned a lot from him, a lot.  And that's the problem with us, we sometimes think that it is the academic institution that you actually learn your trade.  But you learn it in experience, you don't--I mean, you, you get some theories but until it bumps heads with people and they do correctives on you, you don't know what you really know.  So, having now retired, I do consulting and I'm much smarter now from the knocks that I got than I ever was from the academic awards that I received.
Story_ID: 633435
Speaker 1: Your next initiative as you were going to go into was the, the new sanctuary [Horizon Sanctuary, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me, what made you decide that it was time to do this and what challenges did you have to go through to get it accomplished?
Speaker 2: You don't want to know.  I can tell you what made me decide to do it (laughter) but I can't give you the challenges that I had doing it.  All right.  We have seven hundred seats, we had a membership then of about eighteen hundred.  At that time, we had one service.  I went to two.  But you would have at the first--at, at the eleven o'clock service before we had two, you might have 350 visitors which meant you could only get three hundred of your people in.  People don't like to fight to get into their own church.  So, with the flow of tourists, their presence became a disincentive to people who belonged to the church and you wouldn't wanna join.  You can't get in there.  So I tried two services for a while and that alleviated it some but it didn't do all of it.  And this building was sort of run down, it had been built in 1922.  I, I then knew we needed to have more room.  In an effort to be inclusive, I said, "We need enough room for our membership and for visitors" not to exclude any, 'cause Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was always gonna be here.  So, that's when we got the idea of building a church.  All right, some of the obstacles.  There was--people put value on sacred places and this was a sacred place.  They'd grown up here, their parents had grown up here, you know.  They knew it, and it was the place where Martin King preached.  There was the place where Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] preached.  It was the place where Martin Luther King was buried.  It was further complicated by the fact that the Department of Interior [U.S. Department of the Interior] declared it a historical entity and this sanctuary over here is on the registry.  They agreed that they would come and send rangers, and that's what we have over there now, to take people through the place.  I was all for that because I had to heat it in the winter and cool it in the summer for people all during the week, getting the money from our people.  I said, "If you are gonna say you're gonna have a national holiday for Dr. King," which Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] fought for, "the nation ought to put some money into the place where people will wanna come to actually see where he had worked."  And so, that's what we realized and we said we would be able to do if we gave this sanctuary [Heritage Sanctuary, Atlanta, Georgia] over to the National Park Service.  Now I couldn't find any place to build but the federal government had some land across the street and I--we, we got to the point where we said, "Well, why don't we have an even exchange?  Why don't I let you lease the old church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] for fifty years and then you let me have the land across the street to build a new church." And I had tried over and over again to get land all around here, and it was just a mess.  Some people ratcheted the price up on me.  Later on I found out, because they didn't wanna see another church other than this one, you know.  I didn't find out that until, you know, sometimes after I had retired.  Some people said, when we were gonna do this even exchange, they went as far as the Department of Interior to try to kill that off and wrote letters to the White House and all that kind of stuff.  And, I don't wanna go into who did what 'cause I really don't know for sure.  But, anyway, they, they really didn't make it easy for me to get it.  And we wrestled with that.  Finally, we were able to get an agreement where the government leased this building for fifty years, we retain ownership of the old sanctuary.  And they gave us land across the street for that building that you see, and we have ownership to that.  So we are one congregation with two sanctuaries.
Story_ID: 633436
Speaker 1: It would have never been pulled off if we had moved away from here [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia].  There would've been such a hue and cry, and I wasn't stupid enough to do that.  I knew that the connection was with Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and so as long as I could stay in close proximity to him and where he was buried and all that kind of stuff, we would be in good shape.  So, that's what we decided to do.  Then it was a matter of trying to get the money to do it.  We proposed that the new sanctuary would cost--we got estimates five million [dollars] and the educational building, the new one that I wanted to build--community service building--would cost three [million dollars].  Well, the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia] came, the housing market had been down, it'd got a shot in the arm and that sanctuary escalated from five million to eight [million dollars].  So, the congregation had been sold on five.  I said, if you will raise the eight, I'll go get the other three or four.  And that was the agreement we had.  We didn't have enough money to do that, we had to borrow six and a half million dollars.  We went to banks and they pulled the rules on us and they would not let us borrow six and a half million.  The thing that finally--and we went to white banks and, you know this: "We think you're doing a great job in the community yak, yak, yak, yak."  Bottom line, nothing.  We went to the Citizens Trust Bank [Atlanta, Georgia], which is the black bank here, and James Young [James E. Young] is still president.  He's wonderful.  His daddy was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] preacher, he knew how the bishops kicked you around.  And he said, "I cannot loan you $6.5 million, but I can loan you a portion of that up to what I can loan."  He said, "Let me go around the nation to other black banks and see if we can put a package together of $6.5 million."  He said, "Now, the reason I'm gonna do this is because I knew--," and it was so ironic, it was deja vu.  He said, "I knew that, when my daddy was building a church, they would always meet the mortgage note even if they had to go out and fry chicken (laughter)."  I said, "Oh, Jesus, we're going back to where we were."  He said, "I know you'll make it."  But that kind of faith white bankers couldn't understand.  We've always lived on the edge; we've always had to walk the tightrope.  He understood it, and we got the money, and we never missed a payment.  We have not yet, it's a sizeable thing.  So that's how we did it.
Story_ID: 633437
Speaker 1: We have a, a church [Horizon Sanctuary, Atlanta, Georgia] built in the African motif, it was purposely done that way.  I wanted it to be an African meeting house.  Have you been over in it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, the wood around the side represents the straw of the African meeting house, the windows, the open flaps, in an African meeting house.  The symbolism of the crosses come from the churches of, of the Coptic churches of Egypt, all of those are African symbols.  And we made sure that we put all African symbols in there so that our kids, by visual stimulation when you explain what the, the symbols are, would be able to understand that.  Now, we--it wasn't an Ethiopian cross it was some other cross, where in the Crusades, the Crusaders were not able to overcome this African village.  They were able to stand it off, and that, that also said something about it. We had hoped to put stained glass windows in there but we didn't have the money.  But I said, that's a blessing because it's closer to what the flaps of an African meeting house would look like.  Then I snatched a little of my European history and said, you know, the English Puritans didn't believe in stained glass windows and they had in, in history what they called the iconoclastic controversy, where the Puritans went into Catholic churches with beautiful art and tore out all those windows, and destroyed all the icons and it was terrible, you know.  I, I'm still much of a mixture to like that.  But, anyway, I told the folks they did that because the Puritans said, "When you're in church, you should be able to see the world not get so insulated in your own holiness that you cannot appreciate where people are in the world."  And we're right in the heart of housing projects and the rest.  So that the poverty around us also visits us on Sunday morning.  And I was always a preacher who was able to correlate Jerusalem with Atlanta [Georgia].  I never have preached a sermon just on a biblical passage without trying to point out how it, it, it impinges on us and that's what Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] did.  I mean, he was able to see the two and you can see that visibly by looking out of the window.  That girl who was saved came from the projects across the street, the one who got pregnant.  And so that meant we were in it.
Story_ID: 633438
Speaker 1: Are we doing it now?  I think we're gonna move into it, we need to get a Hispanic minister in here as an assistant because so many Latin American people are moving in the area.  But we have a lot of other things that we need to be doing and that I think we are doing.  We are hooked up with a thing called Genesis Shelter [Genesis Shelter, Inc.] where mothers who have children can leave their children if they're afraid of their husbands coming to beat them, they are secure there.  We're, we're involved in that.  We're involved in My House [ph.], which is a, a refuge for abandoned babies left at Grady [Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia], and these women go and take care of those children.  I mean it's a, it's a hidden thing, you know, I mean, you can't--these are people who have gone through the, the, the domestic violence stuff and we try to, you know, minister to them.  Then internationally we've gotten our people involved with Heifer International rather than giving silly scarfs and shoes to people--you know about Heifer International?
Speaker 2: Yes, where you can buy the animals and send them to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You buy the animals and give 'em to people.  Uh-huh, yeah.  We also were involved in a project where we were taking care of girls who were raped in Africa and who needed operations to try to fix their insides up.  We had gotten hooked up in, in one of those.  And, and now, if I was pastoring, I would be involved in trying to get people to give bone marrow because the statistics show us that minorities who are waiting for a bone marrow transplant, those who are suffering from leukemia, are not able to get it 'cause our people are not giving enough of the bone marrow.  But, I've seen this in little examples of, you know, they'd show on TV a kid who had cancer then he went out and recruited folks like that.  I think a preacher has to always have his antenna up to that.  The blessing that we're into now, we have a wonderful young preacher [Raphael G. Warnock] who is bringing in more young people.  And I think what happens you bring in people around your generation if you're really alert.  But you don't get all bent out of shape if somebody else comes in and is able to attract people you are not able to attract, because the idea should always be continuity.  You don't wanna stop the church when you leave it because then you've made yourself an idol.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, I mean, you were fairly young.  I mean you were forty when you first came to the church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was forty.
Speaker 2: So, I mean, that's a, a, a middle-aged group of people that you would have attracted anyway.  But--
Speaker 1: I attracted some young folks, a lot younger than me. That's all right, though.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was old but--
Speaker 2: You--my point was that you were not old (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's all right, thank you.  When you get old you get sensitive about those things. A side note, did you have a relationship with Coretta Scott King?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was a trustee at the church, a wonderful person, very loyal to the church.  Of course, her stage was the world, so, I mean she'd come here from time to time when she--whenever she could.  But she worshipped regularly here and was very supportive of anything that we were doing, so we found that very meaningful.
Story_ID: 633439
Speaker 1: Two thousand four [2004], you make a decision that it's time for you to retire [as pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], and tell me about your decision?
Speaker 2: All right.  I had been here, in 2004, twenty-nine years and I always thought to myself that I'd like to enjoy a few years of my life other than in ministry.  I'd been a minister since I was twenty-four and in 2004 I was sixty-nine, so I said, this is the time for me to sort of stretch out and do something for myself.  I'd accomplished most of the goals that I had here, felt it was a continuity that could be picked up by somebody else and they could take it to even higher heights.  So, I knew that we would go through a process of selection.  I didn't choose to do it the same way I was chosen, you know, and that bothered some people who thought they would get it because they were friends of mine.  But I decided to be more democratic about it.  And so we had a committee of nine, and they went out and, and asked for applications to be filled out.  I wrote the application because I wanted to tailor it for what I felt were our needs.  And applicants, some thirty-six, wrote in to us and filled out the application.  After it was read by the committee, they narrowed it to about six and they interviewed those six.  And then they set up a priority list of people they wanted, and it was good because we had put it out nationally and the people who we got--some of the people who replied, responded, we didn't even know them at all.  So it wasn't like a hand-picked thing.  I had nothing to do with the committee after it was established, I wanted to have nine people on there so if they got to a split, just like the [U.S.] Supreme Court, you'd have one person who could tilt it and make it a five to four.  They worked very, very well for several months.  There were four officers and five members in general.  The chairman of trustee board, deacon board, vice chairman of both boards so those four officers and then five laymen.  Those persons were selected, the five laymen, by the board of deacons and the board of trustees.  They voted on it, and then they put them on the committee, and it was pretty representative of the whole congregation.
Speaker 1: And they decided on?
Speaker 2: They decided on Raphael Warnock [Raphael G. Warnock] to present him to the congregation and he, he came first for an interview.  People were able to ask him any questions they wanted to, he was invited to preach, and he was their first candidate.  And then we presented him.  We only presented one candidate, we said--we had put 'em in priorities so we presented him and we said he'd have to get 66 percent of the vote.  If he did that, he would carry the day.  He got 80 percent of the vote so it was over the rest of the people.
Speaker 1: How did you feel the first time you heard him preach?
Speaker 2: I thought he was wonderful.  He's a great preacher, a fine young man.  Have you met him?
Speaker 1: No, I haven't.
Speaker 2: Oh, he's wonderful.  I don't think he's here today, I think he's off on Friday but he'll be preaching Sunday if you're around.
Story_ID: 633440
Speaker 1: Since 2004--he [Raphael G. Warnock] came on in 2005 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Five [2005], that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and since that time, he's initiated some, some new things?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, wonderful things, wonderful things.  Far more contemporary, far more responsive to the needs and desires of a younger constituency.  And probably far more informal in ways than I was.  He comes out of a Pentecostal background and I'm out of a Presbyterian background.  And they're just as different as night and day.  But, it's, it's brought some vitality to us.  I think that, and this is not original with me, in a church you go through periods of form and then you have vitality and every now and then you've got to break out of your form so that vitality can express itself.  Then you have another form that comes on you, and that's the principle of the reformation.  I see him bringing vitality to the form that I left, and, and forming new forms.  He will do that and, at the right time when he is finished, some other young man or woman will come in and bring in a, a, an expression of vitality.  So that's how, that's how it's been done.
Speaker 1: Now, where did he come from?
Speaker 2: He was in Baltimore [Maryland] at the Douglas Memorial Community Church there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But earlier than that, now, he was at Abyssinian [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York] as an assistant pastor with Dr. Calvin Butts [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Calvin O. Butts].
Speaker 1: Calvin, yes, okay.  And I think he might of been at six--was he in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: He was in Birmingham as an intern for a while.  And with Dr. Porter [John Thomas Porter] at 16th (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama], okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: 16th Street Baptist Church was the one that was blown up, right?
Speaker 1: Yes. No, he wasn't there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, it was another church.  I can't remember the--but it wasn't 16th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, maybe, Sixth Avenue [Sixth Avenue Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Sixth Avenue, that's it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, you got the sixes.
Story_ID: 633441
Speaker 1: Tell me since your retirement, what have you been doing?
Speaker 2: Well, I soon after retiring was called on by a church that faced a tragic situation.  They had a young forty-four year old minister who dropped dead.  And the church was just traumatized, and they had been through some splits before.  You know, we Baptist defy the axiom that says, a house divided against itself will not stand.  We say, a house divided against itself becomes two houses, and two houses divided against themselves become four.  That's how we grow.  This church had been through a number of splits and then this experience with him.  So, I came on in September of 2006 after--that, that was about eleven months since I retired and stayed with them until June of this year [2007].
Speaker 1: What church was this?
Speaker 2: This was the Mount Olive Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] here in town on Martin Luther King Drive [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive].  And we went through the process of finding them a pastor and trying to suggest some organizational stuff that they could go through.  And they have now found a pastor.  And I have now left and just, you know, sort of doing some of the things that I wanna do.

Speaker 1: As I said, I wrote that book and I've been going around signing, you know, autographing it for people.
Speaker 2: Tell me the name of the book.
Speaker 1: 'Sideswiped By Eternity' ['Sideswiped By Eternity: Sermons From Ebenezer Baptist Church,' Dr. Joseph L. Roberts, Jr.], 'Sideswiped By Eternity.'
Speaker 2: And, and what is it about?
Speaker 1: It's a collection of twenty or thirty sermons that I preached under different categories here [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], but the title was now the one I was gonna do.  I was gonna do 'How Shall We Overcome?' But the John Knox Westminster Press [sic. Westminster John Knox Press] people got it and they saw the sermon that I preached on--after 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  And I did two and they were called, Sideswiped By Eternity.  And I felt, with all of the thousands of people who died in the middle of the blowing up of the World Trade Center [New York, New York], there were those who did not die but just got sideswiped by eternity.  They could have been in eternity, but I had turned it around and said there were people who helped other people in the middle of that.  So whenever you meet somebody who helps you, you're also being sideswiped by the power of eternity, by the power of the divine God.  I had experienced that in my own life when I was going to visit a member and I got hit by a car crossing the street. And--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on a second.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And so I gave it that title at the suggestion of the publisher, and it's into its second printing now and it's, it's doing pretty well.
Speaker 1: And what year did it come out?
Speaker 2: It came out in 2005 [sic. 2006].  It was sort of a wrap-up, you know, of, of some of the things that I had been talking about.  Now, I don't know whether I'll write another book or not.  My children [Carlyle Roberts, Cheryl Roberts Richmond, and Cynthia Roberts Emory] are urging me to write another book because they said that was a book of sermons, you know, and sermons have a sort of idealistic way of describing things.  But we think you are just as strong in instructing young preachers on how to get along in a church.  Now, they've done a study on me at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to see how I did this transition from being a Presbyterian to a Baptist and they studied it every year.  And they say (laughter), it's sort of funny you get the reaction to people, you know, to that who--, "How did he do that?"  But, they said what you ought to really do is write a book about how you get along with people and some of--I don't wanna say the tricks of the trade--but what we need to know about how you treat people.  And, you know, and the Bible says, "Though I speak with the tongue of men and angels and have no love, I am become a sounding brass and tinkling cymbal" [1 Corinthians 13:1]. People are more concerned about you caring about them than they are about your oratory. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's, that's very true.
Speaker 2: That's, that's what that all is.
Story_ID: 633443
Speaker 1: What have you not done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: What have I not done that I'd like to do?  I'd like to realize in this time of scaling down--I'd like to do a few things that I didn't have the opportunity to do when I was in the pastoring.  For instance, our crowd at 7:45 used to always love to go to see the Falcons [Atlanta Falcons] before we lost Michael Vick, (laughter) to see the Falcons at the stadium and they would have these side bar things, you know, and I'd like to do that.  I'd like to go to some football games on Sunday, maybe it just might be an adolescent rebellion.  Just to do some of the other things that, I don't wanna say normal people do, but that you are restricted from doing if you are a pastor.  I'd like to, you know, to go to a few ball games and, and just--not just watch them on television.  I just become a couch potato.  My wife [Esther Jean Wortham Roberts] and I were talking about that today.  I do a lot of preaching in different places but that's an extension of what my work always was.  I'd like to break away from that and just do some other things.  I believe what Jesus said, "I've come that you might have life and have it more abundantly" [John 10:10].  He didn't say I've come that you might have a church and have it more abundantly.  I think abundant life is bigger than a church life, so I'd like to do some of those things that
Speaker 1: Would you like to travel without having to preach?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  I've travelled so much that traveling doesn't have the same excitement for me.  I bought a little cottage in northern Georgia, I love the solitude of that place but, you know, I've got a wife who wants to go and so we're trying to meet in the middle somewhere.  She was talking to me about going to Florida for a timeshare.  Well, I've done six trips in the last six weeks, I'm tired of pulling things through, you know, the, the airport.  And once you've seen one beach, you've seen them all.  Now, you know, I mean I, I love the San Diego Zoo [San Diego, California] and a number of other things but you get to a point in your life when you don't say I've seen it all, but I'd like to see a few different things.  And I'm not opposed to scaling down and doing little or nothing.  I know they say, you'll drop dead if you do that, and the people joke about that because I'm not here at church much.  I'm all--they say, we knew he'd be--but the beauty of what I do now is I can say no.  You know, and if somebody has a problem at the end of the service, they said, "We'd like to talk to you about this."  I say, "You got a pastor, go see him."  I used to always have to spend half the afternoon talking with people, you know, about things here that they wanted to talk about.  I also enjoy the fact that I can get away from the minutiae of the church.  People have perennial issues and they come back recasting them in another form, but it's still the same stuff.  And you have to hold yourself back from telling them what you really feel.  Now I don't have to see them, I just don't come.  And so, that's, that's been a blessing.
Story_ID: 633444
Speaker 1: Well, you talked about your wife [Esther Jean Wortham Roberts].  Tell me, tell me more about her and, and your two daughters.
Speaker 2: Okay, and I got a son too.  I didn't include him too.  My wife grew up in Detroit [Michigan].  She was my father's [John L. Roberts, Sr.] secretary's daughter and we married--very athletic, played tennis, whipped me in it, you know.  And so to pay her back, I married her.  But, anyway, she's a wonderful person.  Teaches science, has taught in the public school system here in Atlanta [Georgia].  Retired earlier than I did, very mechanical, very scientific, much better than I am.  That side of her brain is, is really developed.  We've got six grandchildren and they say, you know, one of 'em says always, you know, "Grandma's about a genius."  And she just eats it up, you know.  And so, she enjoys that.  Involved in the church, a sort of quiet person but has a lot of personality and is extremely bright.  She's not like me and I think that's all right.  I think it's all right to be incompatible, because in the areas of her strength, she complements my weakness and vice versa.  So we have already said, it's all right you don't have to be compatible.  To be compatible is to be boring, 'cause you both alike, you know.  And, so that's a thing that I figure has been so very meaningful.  She's been a good companion through the years.  I've had some health issues; she's always been very supportive in those.  But we enjoy each other and enjoy things.  I'm more outgoing than she is, she's quiet but she's deeper than I am, much more profound than I am, much smarter than I am.  And I realize this.  When I got ready to marry her, my father said, "You made a good selection."  He was all for that, you know, because he thought she really had it.  I have three children.  One daughter is a physician here in town, the other daughter is a lawyer.
Speaker 1: What are their names again?
Speaker 2: Their names are Cheryl Richmond [Cheryl Roberts Richmond], Dr. Cheryl Richmond and Attorney Cynthia--ah, what's her last name--Emory [Cynthia Roberts Emory].  And my son is Carlyle Roberts and he works in security.  But they've all made us pretty proud, you know.  You have ups and downs but that's what flesh is heir to, and that's what families are about.  But they, they've, they've done very well.  They're, they're rather protective, you know, because of--I had some health issues.  They say, "Why don't you slow down, why don't you stop?"  But I think if I stopped altogether I would die. I love reading, I love research and I have fun preaching now because I can say some things and I don't have to be accountable.  And, if the folks don't like it, I'm not gonna be there after the service is over anyway so, you know, I just lay it all out.
Story_ID: 633445
Speaker 1: Well, even as you continue to preach and consult, what are your main concerns now about the African American community?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My main concerns about the African American community is the absence of the father in family structures.  The nuclear family for us is almost bereft, you know, not around.  And I'm concerned about trying to work with our fathers to appreciate what they can do, and I'm not for whipping them over the head because so many of them are behind in child support.  I'm saying it is important for you to be there to give the kind of security to your child even if you are behind in child support to let them know that somebody has them.  And I'm talking to people nowadays about the fact that among primates, monkeys, the male monkey spends 90 percent of his day protecting the young, because they can be killed so easily by a predator.  But we don't spend much time with our children and rather than just whipping up on people in the African American community for not being there for their children, I'm saying be there in support of your children.  And I know right now, and this is blacks and whites, only 3 percent of males who have been ordered by the court to give child support are up to snuff in their payments.  Ninety-seven percent, black and white, are behind in that, you know.  Now 49 percent of those same fathers are up to snuff in their car payments, so it seems that car payments are more important than children.  And, if we can reverse this so we can work with the black male, you know, we'll be able to do that.  The other thing that I am concerned about is gang warfare.  I'm hoping that we'll be able in some way to relate to gang members who figure they need a community--and all this follows, you know, if you don't have a father you're gonna look for a peer group where you can get affirmation and support.  Is it possible at all for us to try to listen to what these kids are saying and to realize that we don't always have to be punitive about it?  Now, heretofore, I've been very punitive about these boys wearing their pants way down.  But when you consider the fact that we have such a high number of kids whose fathers have been in jail, and when you're in jail, you're not allowed to keep a belt because they think you might commit suicide, you can understand how some of this comes about, you know, and seems like it's applicable.  But on the other hand when you talk about how you gonna get a job, you can't go around with your drawers showing.  So that's the thing that I'm concerned about, translating and trying to help us try to transform.  The gangs really want to be included in something, and I find with Albert Schweitzer, that if you just take a moment with a kid it can be decisive.  He said, "You don't know how many people have had an influence on my life and never knew it."  Those weren't people who'd spent a long time with him but they were people who said a word.  And, as I look back over my forty-seven years in the ministry, I see people who have done well and they come back to me and said, "You said this to me one day and it made a--," and I'd even forgotten it.  "You remember when you told me you wanted to see my grades and remember when you told me that you didn't want me to mess up like I did again?  Remember when you told me you were disappointed in me and that you expected more from me?  That was the turning point in my life."  I mean, that wasn't a sermon.  Just said, "Hey, boy, come here," you know, "you gotta, you gotta straighten up."  I'd like to get into that if I can.
Story_ID: 633446
Speaker 1: The other thing that concerns me is the whole domestic violence piece.  Fifty-one percent of all women who are murdered in the United States of America are not murdered by their husbands.  I'm sorry, are not murdered by a stranger, but by their husbands or their lovers.  How can we degrade our sisters so much that we would, you know, beat up on them like that?  The violence that I see loose in our nation is something that needs to be pronounced and I see it movies and all the other things that are catalysts for that, but I'd like to see that if it wouldn't be possible for us to do something about it.  Now, Juanita Bynum is coming up with all this stuff, saying she's gonna be the angel for domestic violence.  You know that's a lot of crud, but I do think that, that is an issue that is before folks.  I mean, her thing is money and all kind of, you know, stuff like that.  But you do see this violence going on all the time.  And how can we learn to live with each other and to simplify it?  Ralph Waldo Emerson said, the key to life is one word: simplify.  I mean you don't have to be king of the mountain, you don't have to, you know, make a whole lot of money.  It gets to very simple, and I think the blessing is going through some sicknesses.  See, I thought I was invincible until I had to have six-way bypass surgery, until I got prostate cancer.  And that helped me until I got hit by that car.  And that helped me to really learn, hey, you know, you're a dime a dozen and you better catch on to some basics and hold on to them and so you'll be able to make it.  The other thing that bothers me to is wages.  For every dollar that a man makes at a given level of management doing the same job, a woman only makes seventy-seven cents.  That means that the Civil Rights Movement is not over because Title VII of the civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964] talks about--bill talks about anti-discrimination laws.  You can't do that, and you can appeal it but you gotta get your appeal in 180 days.  But the [U.S.] Supreme Court now which is very conservative has been mean on that.  They said, "If a woman gets a check and she knows she's getting less than the man gets, a 180 days does not start from the time she gets the check but from the time the decision was made to give her less than he gets."  So, when it got to the Supreme Court, they couldn't really, you know, win at all.  The other thing that I'm concerned about is a sense of history.  We need to let our kids know something about, you know, what has been going on.  The long struggle.  We talk about Rosa Parks and the bus boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott], but there was a woman in--coming from Baltimore [Maryland] going back to Virginia, who in 1946 was told to get off the bus and she wouldn't.  And the policeman put her off and she kicked him, Kildari [sic. Irene Morgan] was her name, and when she did that they arrested her and charged her with assault and resisting arrest.  But then they told her, "We gonna fine you ten dollars for not obeying the Jim Crow laws of the State of Virginia," and she refused to pay it.  The person who defended her was none other than John--Thurgood Marshall and William Hastie [William H. Hastie] before, of course, Thurgood got to the Supreme Court.  And it went up to the Supreme Court.  And segregation on interstate travel was rule unconstitutional in 1946, nine years before the bus boycott in 1955.  I think it is incumbent--you're doing it in this history thing--to let people know that the struggle has been going on for a long time but people ignored the law.  And we had to have the Freedom Riders and all those folks get down there to try to do something with interstate travel.  That had already been settled.  And I think it's obligatory on the part of us who have a historical appreciation and are willing to do research to sort of, you know, work with them.  The final thing that I think I wanna do is work with my grandchildren, especially with my grandsons.  Because it'll be a terrible thing if I try to save the world and lose my own.  And you might not be able to do anything that will be really traumatic and vital for them, but I like the statement of, of Martin Luther, the 16th century reformer.  Somebody asked him, "What would you do if you knew you were gonna die tomorrow?"  He said, "I'd plant a tree today."  And that's how I hope my life will end.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Growth.  Not enlargement but growth.  Helping people move as I move myself, and the willingness to say, it's all right to make mistakes and the humility to admit it, and to go on.  That's what, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not spoke about that you would like to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think so, I mean, you didn't ask me about the size of my shoe or anything like that but in that case--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) All right, well, I wanna thank you.
Speaker 2: Okay, good enough.  It's been nice.
