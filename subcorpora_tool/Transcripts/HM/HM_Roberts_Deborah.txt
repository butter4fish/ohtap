Speaker 1: I'm going to ask five People magazine-ish questions, very short answers, nothing to them, except--what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Wow.  That's good.  My favorite food and what I eat are probably very different.  I suppose my favorite food is pasta, Italian; just plain old, good spaghetti.  I don't eat it a whole lot, but I actually do like pasta.  I tend, though, to eat fish and chicken and vegetables a lot, so.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Fall.  I love the beautiful leaves and just the cool weather, and the crispness, and the promise of winter and things like that.  I love fall.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yellow.
Speaker 1: A favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: The South of France.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh wow.  Favorite phrase or saying.  So many of them.  I don't know.  I mean, I guess what comes to mind, and not that I say this very often, but I grew up with: "Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you."  So that just comes to my mind because that's something that I was taught when I was a little girl.
Story_ID: 632829
Speaker 1: I want to start out by asking you about your father.  And his name was Ben [Benjamin Roberts, Sr.], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I would like to know what you know about his background and his growing up?
Speaker 2: Sadly, I don't know that much about either of my parents' backgrounds.  I know immediate relatives.  My father's parents had both been deceased by the time I was growing up.  I heard him talk about his mom; he often referred to her as Mama.  Her name was Sue [ph.].  I heard him talk about her sort of vaguely, but my dad was four years old when his mother died, so he actually didn't really have a sense of her.  His eldest sister, who we call Big Annie [ph.], her name was Laura [ph.], but there were--Annie Laura and there was another Annie [ph.] in the family, and we called her Big Annie, was sort of a surrogate mother.  And it's interesting because I learned more about her relationship with my father just in recent years as they both are aging, and my dad passed recently.  But she told me how her mother asked her--promised to ask--she told me how her mother asked her basically to promise to look after little Ben, and he was four at the time when she died.  So she was sort of a surrogate mother, and I never really understood their relationship until recently.  His father, I--you know, I don't even remember many details about his dad, which is not to say that he wasn't present in his life, but I think it was sort of a rocky childhood.  And so I know more about his sisters, elderly sisters who lived for a very long time, but not that much about his parents.
Speaker 1: And his elderly sisters, what do you know about them?
Speaker 2: Wow.  They're amazing women.  Actually, one of them, who was one hundred, Clara [ph.], just passed away last year; he has a one hundred year old sister Annie Laura, Big Annie, who will be 101, God willing, in September of 2007.  And then he has a ninety-five year old sister Dilsie [ph.], who lives around the corner from her.  So, these women lived literally around the corner and across the street from me, and I grew up seeing them all the time.  He also had other sisters; he was from a large family of nine children.  He had other sisters and a couple of brothers who lived in nearby cities or in the same city, but a little bit further away from us.  So, he had a very close-knit family.
Speaker 1: What did they share about their, their growing up?  Did they share anything, Big Annie and--?
Speaker 2: You know, sadly, when I was growing up in little Perry, Georgia, there was sort of this philosophy, I suppose, that children just don't ask a lot about grown people's business.  And so, if we did ask questions, here and there, little bits of information might be sprinkled out, but we didn't know a lot about their lives.  I sensed some of it was painful, and so, maybe there was a reluctance to really get into it.  And also, maybe some of it was just difficult.  Maybe they just didn't know that much.  Maybe their family didn't tell them that much.  So I knew my dad's siblings, and I knew that his mother had passed away when he was a child, and I knew that, you know, he had a real attachment to his family in the way he talked about them.  But, they never really shared that much information.  I remember when 'Roots,' the book 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] came out and then the television show ['Roots'] came out, so many of us started asking questions about our family history.  And it was probably at that point that I discovered merely how little I knew about both my parents, really, and their families.  And to some extent, how little they knew.  My mother [Ruth Kaigler Roberts] knew a little bit; her mother [Eula W. Kaigler] died when she was a baby.  She was raised by her stepmother [Minnie Kaigler].  It was not a great relationship, but my mother was very devoted and I did know the stepmother, but I knew they weren't really close.  And her father [Will Kaigler] died also long before I was born, and I heard her talk about Papa.  But beyond that, not much else.
Speaker 1: Now did--were you--do you think your middle name then came from--you said, you call her Big--
Speaker 2: Annie.
Speaker 1: --Annie, do you thi-
Speaker 2: Possibly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't even know.  Deborah Ann is a very common southern name, so I don't know that I was necessarily named for her.   But it just may have been a name that was known.
Story_ID: 632830
Speaker 1: Now, how would you describe your father [Benjamin Roberts, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Wow.  Because I feel--I say wow because I feel like I sort of kn- got to know my father in stages.  Physically, my dad was a very commanding presence; tall man about 6'2", thin, a big, booming laugh and voice, a big personality.  Just a really, really sort of infectious kind of a person, you know.  He came into the room and you knew he was there; he loved to have a good time.  He was also very stern with us, his children.  So he was a very strong presence.  I also, though, felt that when I was growing up, I--like so many children probably of that era, I was sort of afraid of my dad, I certainly didn't know him that well.  I didn't have a warm and fuzzy relationship for h- with him.  I yearned for that, but I was also growing up in a family with nine children.  So having any kind of one on one time with my parents just was not really that feasible.  But what was interesting was that I look so much like my father, and people talked about that a lot; the skin color, my build, my overall just look of my face.  People often called me Little Ben, or Sue [ph.], one of my dad's sisters.  And so, I looked a lot like him.  And, so I felt that we should have had a strong connection, and we didn't so much when I was growing up, but I did find that connection with him later in life as I was growing older.
Speaker 1: Now your, your, your mother, can you give her name?
Speaker 2: Ruth Nell Kaigler Roberts [Ruth Kaigler Roberts].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I want to get this straight.  Was your father born in Perry [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: They were both were born around the Perry area.  It's, it's sort of a rural community.  While Perry is a little town, there is farming and all that right around the area.  So they both lived right outside the area; they both grew up in that area.
Speaker 1: Do you know the, the--actually the name of the town your father was born and your mother--
Speaker 2: Well it's Houston County [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Perry is in Houston County.  So it was Perry, but he may have lived outside the the, the, the city, just in the county.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 632831
Speaker 1: So your mother [Ruth Kaigler Roberts], you said that she, she also didn't know her, you know, her parents [Eula W. Kaigler and Will Kaigler].
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she share any stories about growing up besides, you know, just--
Speaker 2: My mother talked probably a little bit more about growing up.  But a lot of her stories were very painful.  She had a brother who was born to the same mother, and their mother died when my mom was a baby, and she often talked about that, you know, feeling almost like an orphaned child: "My mom died when I was a baby."  She talked a lot about her father.  He apparently was a very strong influence in her life.  But she clearly experienced some pain.  She was raised by a stepmother [Minnie Kaigler], who, I don't think valued her, maybe even felt burdened by these two children.  And I think she tried to put a big face on that.  But I sensed and I could tell as I grew older that there was a painful relationship there.  She talked a lot about having to work.  Both my parents had to quit school when they were younger; they didn't go to high school because they had to work and help the family.  And she talked about that and working, and my da- her--my grandfather, her dad, had this small, restaurant is probably to elaborate of a name for it, but had some little small business where he would cook, and she helped with that business some.  But beyond that, I didn't know great details about her relatives or her grandparents or what she knew about her history.  And I don't think she knew a lot either because I think they both were raised in this environment where you just don't ask a lot of questions.
Story_ID: 632832
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Ruth Kaigler Roberts and Benjamin Roberts, Sr.] meet?
Speaker 2: That's a good question (laughter).  They met because they both lived in this little town [Perry, Georgia], and they just sort of knew of each other.  It really was a small town; everyone sort of knew each other.  How they absolutely, you know, connected and their eyes connected, I really don't know.  I knew that I--I know that they sort of knew of each other.  My mother was actually married before my father, and she had two children.  And my dad had been married as well and had three children.  So they got to know each other, and my mom was a very, very, strikingly beautiful woman.  And, I'm sure she caught my dad's eye at some point, and somewhere along the line they just started seeing each other, and fifty-five years ago got married.
Story_ID: 632833
Speaker 1: Now give me your siblings' names and, and the birth order 'cause you're the seven- seven--
Speaker 2: Seven.
Speaker 1: Seventh.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The eldest is my brother Jackie Bryant, he is--I won't try to get into ages because I--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He's sixty-four.  The eldest is Jackie Bryant, he lives in Columbus, Ohio.  Annette Traynham is my eldest sister, she lives in Houston, Texas.  Bennie Marshall [Bennie Roberts Marshall] is a sister who lives now in Perry, Georgia, again.  Janet Davis lives in Miami, Florida.  Celestine Clarington lives in Perry, Georgia, and has been just a tremendous caretaker and source of support for my parents [Ruth Kaigler Roberts and Benjamin Roberts, Sr.].  I have a brother who's deceased, Ben Roberts, Jr. [Benjamin Roberts, Jr.].  There's myself, Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Roberts].  And I have two younger sisters: Bonita Jackson who lives in San Antonio, Texas; and Belinda Spellman who lives in Savannah, Georgia.
Story_ID: 632834
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I remember that we lived in this little house across the street from the house that my parents [Ruth Kaigler Roberts and Benjamin Roberts, Sr.], or my mother lives in now.  My memories are really happy.  As I look back on them now, you know, we clearly were probably a poor family.  But when I look back on them, I think I just--my earliest memories are of just playing, you know, the classic little southern girl, barefoot out in the yard with my siblings.  Close-knit family, playing with my, my relatives, cousins and so forth around the corner.  I think just kind of playing out in the yard.  Those are the kinds of things that come to mind right away when I think about growing up.
Speaker 1: Now, what was--what was your street name that you lived on?  What was the name of the--
Speaker 2: Jackson Lane.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your address?
Speaker 2: 1321 Jackson Lane [Perry, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can you describe who else--who some of the neighbors were, you know, on the--
Speaker 2: There was a woman next door named--we called her Mrs. Honey.  I don't even know what her name is, frankly.  Annie Lawson [Annie Walker Lawson] is her name, but we called her Ms. Honey.  My aunts lived across the street, Big Annie [ph.] was across the street.  Aunt Dilsie [ph.] had not yet moved back; she was in Miami [Florida].  The Askew [ph.] family lived down the street; they were menacing children.  There was a woman down--further down the street, Mrs. Hilder [ph.].  Frances [ph.], a little girl around the corner, well, actually not only just her, but another big family around the corner.  Davis, Fra- what's this girl--what is her last name?  Oh, the Turners [ph.]; the Turner family lived around the corner from us.  There are others I'm sure would come to mind, but these are people who were like literally next door, across the street, and around the corner.
Story_ID: 632835
Speaker 1: I want you to take yourself back to that, you know, early time.  And I'd like you to tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: That's a very interesting question.  Sunlight, bright, bright sunlight definitely takes me back to my childhood because Georgian- middle Georgia, you know, I think about the summertime and the hot weather.  The smell of earth because we didn't actually have paved streets when I was growing up; our roads were rutted and dirt.  It was a long time before we got them paved.  So whenever I smell like a dusty road that reminds me of growing up.  Sights: little kids, just running around, running throughout the street, barefoot because we did that a lot when I was a child in the summertime anyway; little girls with braids in their hair reminds me a lot when I see those sights, I think about my childhood.
Speaker 1: Smells?
Speaker 2: Smells.  Fried food, fried chicken.  I can't think about or see fried chicken without thinking about my childhood.  Fried fish, everything fried.  Grits, eggs, things like that.  Just the smell of grease basically, and f- oil and food, fried food reminds me a lot of my childhood.
Story_ID: 632836
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe just family life a little bit?  Was it, was it around, you know, if you can just sort of recount some memories from, you know, your childhood.
Speaker 2: Family life for me was about just sort of a crowded household; lots of kids all trying to make our way.  And initially, gosh, the first house I grew up in [in Perry, Georgia] probably had like two bedrooms, and I don't remember where we all slept, and I'm--somebody slept on the sofa in this room regularly, and two or three in a bed here or there.  I don't think of it from a deprived standpoint because I just think that it was a big family.  We lived in this little house and, you know, that house actually still exists, although I think it's even open any more.  But if I saw it, I would probably be aghast because it was so tiny.  We eventually, when I was probably six or seven, moved across the street.  We had another home built, a big, a bigger ranch home with four bedrooms, one bathroom, again with essentially seven children, because my oldest brother and sister had left for college and the [U.S.] military.  But, I just remember, gosh, all of this just, you know, being together and playing together, fighting together, feeling like I needed my space.  Sometimes I would run the bathwater to go take my bath and I'd go do something, and I come back and one of my sisters was in it, and you know, we were yelling and fighting about that.  But we were just very, very close.  I think my parents [Ruth Kaigler Roberts and Benjamin Roberts, Sr.], now that I look back on it, my parents had tension between them.  There were struggles, and they were--and times were tough, and money was probably tight.  And I don't know that I was really aware of that at the time.  I just was aware that we had this big family.  My mother sewed.  As we got older, we would sew our clothes.  I thought it was because we just liked to sew and we liked to make our own fashions and make our own clothes.  But the truth of it is, we really couldn't afford a lot of shopping with, with these many kids.  I remember, I mean silly memories because you know you think about this stuff a lot now as you get older and you look at your own kids, but I'll share this much with my daughter [Leila Roker] sometimes.  I remember when Deborah Collier [ph.], this little girl in school whose mother was a teacher and her parents were a little more professional, had these beautiful patent leather shoes from this store, Crumpton's [Crumpton's Shoes Inc., Warner Robins, Georgia], and Crumpton's was an expensive shoe store, and I just pined, pined for those shoes, patent leather shoes.  And of course we would get like the cheapies from like the Payless [Payless ShoeSource, Inc.] or the dollar store that, the equivalent of at that time.  And so, I was aware that money was tight and that we didn't have a lot.  But, that said, I also was aware that my parents were just so invested in making sure that we felt happy and comfortable and, you know, my mother would make a pretty dress, or they would make our Easter dresses and our Easter clothes.  And so, there was a certain amount of pride about it too.  I think we all just felt happy together.  You know, there was a real closeness and a real connection there with my two younger sisters.  We had all the fights and squabbles that most kids do, but we--I think we felt very tightly connected.
Speaker 1: So were you closest with your two younger sisters is that, you know, because in a large family you have to choose your--
Speaker 2: Right.  What happens in a large family depending on the age difference is you sort of group up.  So my two younger sisters, myself and my brother, Ben [Benjamin Roberts, Jr.], probably all felt more like a group.  And then my three older sisters [Bennie Roberts Marshall, Janet Davis and Celestine Clarington] were probably a little bit more connected, and then the two eldest [Jackie Bryant and Annette Traynham] ones were out of the household at that point.  So I was closer to my brother Ben and my two younger sisters Bonita [Bonita Jackson] and Belinda [Belinda Spellman] than anybody else.  The others felt like, they're the big brothers and big sisters, so I wasn't that detached.
Speaker 1: Was there a purpose on the Bs?
Speaker 2: No, no.  And I know some people do that.  I think--maybe they ran out of creative ideas after a while (laughter), you know.  I don't know.  But I think it was just, you know, we like this name or this came up or my mother--one of my aunts named one my sisters, so, those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 632837
Speaker 1: Now you talked a little bit--you alluded to finding your space.  I want to know what you were like as a little girl.  I mean, you know, did you sort of exist inside your head, were you, you know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I s- I sort of did exist inside my head.  My siblings will tell you probably funny stories about me as a child because early on, somehow I got this idea that I was destined for some other things; some bigger things, some better things, whatever.  I just felt it.  And so I was a little bit different from my siblings.  I was very much--you know, I liked to read books.  I was very much into imagining my future, talking about what I wanted to do with my life, talking about travel.  I wanted to look a certain way.  I thought manners should be a certain way, even though maybe we didn't have these rules in the household, but I would read about families, or, you know, 'Anne of Green Gables' [Lucy Maud Montgomery], I loved this book.  And I would just--you know, I just sort of got in my head I wanted to be, and I knew I could be, a little bit more than the surroundings that I grew up in.  And so, I--when I was in high school [Perry High School, Perry, Georgia], I remember, you know, picking up yoga from a teacher.  And I would come home and insist to my two younger sisters [Bonita Jackson and Belinda Spellman], we all need to do yoga.  They would look at me, like, are you crazy?  You know, there were foods that I wanted to try, quiche.  And they'd say, "Qui-?  What, what are you ta- where are you from?"  I probably had more white friends than most of my siblings once we integrated the schools.  I had a lot of white friends, you know, so that the normal jokes about being an Oreo would come along.  So I was--I guess I was a different kid from my siblings because I sort had this light and this fire burning inside, and I wanted to--I saw myself somewhat apart from Perry, Georgia, where I grew up.  And, and not in a disdainful kind of way.  I just saw myself as different.
Story_ID: 632838
Speaker 1: What was Perry, Georgia like growing up?  What was it like?  What kind of--y- it's outside of Macon [Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: Outside of Macon, yes.  Right.  Just a little bit south of Macon.  Perry is a small town of about ten thousand people now, probably a little smaller when I was growing up.  Not exactly completely a farming community.  I wouldn't describe it as rural, although clearly there are--it's right in the outskirts.  It was a little, little bit of a town.  I think people would come in from the rural areas to Perry to go shopping, if you can believe that.  I grew up right in the middle of the whole Jim Crow experience.  And I do actually remember that.  I remember as a child of six or seven going into the colored waiting room at the doctor's office, seeing colored waiting room, and knowing what that implied, which is that, you know, you're not worthy; you can't come in here.  And going to a dentist office, for instance, and sitting in a separate room from the white patrons.  I mean, I knew all of that was going on.  But I also felt possibility.  I was coming along, too, at the same time as the Civil Rights Movement.  I knew my parents [Ruth Kaigler Roberts and Benjamin Roberts, Sr.] were.  My mother would talk about going to the marches, and my parents were invested in trying to make change.  I didn't know what this was all about.  But I did feel a sense of possibility.  Perry felt a little stifling to me because it was a small town and everybody did know everybody, at least in my black community there.  So there was that experience.  And then there was a broader experience once the schools were integrated and I knew other children, and some things started to change.  The Jim Crow laws started to ease up and so forth, and we would go about our ways in town in a way that was a little bit different.  But I did feel very much that suffocation I guess that you can feel in a small town.  And, and I felt that there was just this world out there with so much more going on, and so much more to explore, and I wanted to check it out.
Story_ID: 632839
Speaker 1: Now was your family a churchgoing family?
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what, what, what, what denomination?
Speaker 2: I grew up Baptist in the New Hope Baptist Church [Perry, Georgia], and every Sunday was Sunday school.  Now, at that point, at least in the rural part of the South, a lot of these churches didn't have a preacher every Sunday.  So we only had church at our building once or twice a month because the preacher would, you know, rotate around and go to other churches.  But we had Sunday school every Sunday.  So it was definitely--life, life revolved a lot around church, church principles, Christian values, all kinds of things that really, you know, harkened back to the church.
Speaker 1: Did you accept all that, being a questioning child?
Speaker 2: I accepted all of that up until a certain point, probably maybe about junior high [Perry Junior High School; Perry Middle School, Perry, Georgia], high school [Perry High School, Perry, Georgia].  And I just started to see, like so many children do about that age, hypocrisy.  I saw people in the church who, you know, were saying one thing in church and doing something else outside of church.  I saw couples who really didn't seem to really have the relationship they portrayed in church outside of church.  And that hypocrisy really bothered me.  And, I think probably about high school I started to question--not loudly, not boldly.  I was in the church choir.  I participated in, you know, Easter programs and Christmas programs and church services.  I wasn't like a rabble rouser.  I was sort of a good girl, even if I questioned things, I was the good girl.  I wanted to things to be appropriate.  I wanted everybody to be nice.  I wanted everything to be done the right way.  And maybe to some degree I felt like if I could impart that everybody could be happier, you know, the world could be better.  That was sort of my probably insecure way of dealing with issues maybe that I saw as I was growing up that weren't very comfortable for me.  So I accepted all that until probably I left high school and went away to college [University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And your minister's name?
Speaker 2: The Reverend Thomas [Daniel Thomas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he a fire and brimstone minister?
Speaker 2: N- yes and no.  He was the classic, you know, (makes sound) southern preacher, you know, like that.  But, not quite so fire and brimstone.  He was a big, big guy, and a big laugh and everybody absolutely loved him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any church experience that you remember that sort of sticks out?
Speaker 2: I remember church choir, going to choir rehearsals on Tuesday night.  And, and feeling a little bit of pressure, too, that my mother [Ruth Kaigler Roberts] always said, "You have to do something to serve the Lord.  You've got to do something in church.  You can't just, you know, join and that's it."  So I felt a little pressure to do something, so I'm not sure that I was highly motivated to be a part of the choir, but (laughter) I felt that I had to do something, so I did.  I wasn't necessarily a good singer, but I was in the choir.  Some of my siblings were.  I actually had sisters who had beautiful voices and who were great singers.  But that was an extension of family, church and the church choir.  And that's probably one of my memories.  I also remember, too, the pool where we got baptized in church.  And it was the classic southern experience where out back behind the church there was this cement pool, and when you accepted Christ and decided, you know, you wanted to be a part of the church, we would wear these white gowns and they'd put a swim cap on our heads if you were a girl, and a white--some kind of a towel or some kind of a cloth on your head, and you'd go back and, you know, they'd sing this song (singing), "Take me to the water," and you'd go out back and they'd do the baptism.  And it's funny as I sit here now and I think about it, I rem- it's a very vivid memory of something that I think felt very southern at the time.
Story_ID: 632840
Speaker 1: Now where- what about school, elementary school.  Where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to Houston County--let me just think what the school was called.  I went to Houston County elementary school [Houston County Training School, Perry, Georgia], and it was the black school.  And I went there from first 'til about fourth grade, and all black teachers, black students.  A happy experience as I recall. I mean, beyond kids who have fights and things like that, but a very happy experience.  I don't think that I was aware that there was this world out there, and there were these white kids out there, and that we were prohibited from going to school with them.  I mean, I'm sure I knew it at some level if somebody mentioned it.  But I don't know that I thought that there was anything unusual or strange about it, until fourth grade when there was all this talk about integration, and maybe we were going to move, and they were going to shut down the black school, as they did often in the South, and then we would have to transfer to the white school.  And there was a lot of tension and nervousness about that, what that would all mean.  I mean, I--we could have just as easily been going to the moon.  I mean granted we would see white people in town and at the grocery store and all this, but there was sort of this acquiescent kind of behavior when it came to the whites anyway.  My parents [Ruth Kaigler Roberts and Benjamin Roberts, Sr.] would step back, or if we went to the bank or the post office and there were whites there, you always would step back, they do their business and do their- yours.  So I don't even remember thinking that much about these white kids until all this talk came about that we were going to integrate.  And I thought, oh, my gosh.  What must these kids be like?  And, and they're white children, and they got this long, stringy hair, and what, what?  You know, it was, it was really bizarre in the sense that we could have been going to another planet.  And, but yet, we were sort of excited about it too, the possibility, what does this all mean for us.  And then we would hear the adults talk about a better education and better books.  And then we became aware, I think many of us, that we were using used books and outdated books and things like that.  So then there was talk about how we would have access to better materials.

Speaker 1: You were talking about the school.  I want to know what happened in fourth grade.  What school did you end up going to?
Speaker 2: We, we went to the Perry Middle School [Perry Junior High School; Perry Middle School, Perry, Georgia].  I hesitate because they changed the name later on, middle--elementary.  So we integrated and we went to Perry Elementary School [Perry, Georgia], which was the white school prior to that.  And I remember that morning clearly.  It was in the middle of the school year because apparently Geor- which I didn't know, Georgia was fighting in the courts and so forth trying to resist integration and eventually lost that battle, and there was, you know, they had to do it right away.  And it was the middle of the school year, and I remember one morning my dad [Benjamin Roberts, Sr.] having this talk with us before we went off to school about how, you know, "You are a proud people, and you are a person, and never let anybody insult you, and I want you to know this is going to be fine, and you're going to be okay."  And it was like this big talk like we were going off to, you know, to the [U.S.] military or something.  "But if somebody, you know, tries to hit, you, you can defend yourself, but I want you to know that this is fine and you are a person, too."  That kind of thing.  And I'm not sure that I really got it, but he clearly was a little nervous about this for his children.  And he also wanted to sort of equip us with a little armor going in there about self-pride.  And you know what?  It was, for me, it was perfectly fine.  I remember that day walking in and looking at these little blond girls and they were looking at us and, you know, one little girl wanted to touch my hair, and I wanted to touch her hair.  And we were really discovering each other.  I remember some of the teachers, one or two had a little discomfort with this whole thing, and you could see it.  But for the most part, I thought the kids were just curious about each other, but we were nine year old kids.  And eventually, we just played and, and felt each other out and did our thing.  And I met a couple of friends, and I remember coming home telling my parents, you know, "I met a little friend today.  I have a little white girl who is my friend," and so forth.  The high school [Perry High School, Perry, Georgia] was a different story.  My oldest sisters went to the high school, and I heard there was some tension there, and--in weeks to come, maybe there were a few fights and things like that broke out.  So maybe they felt discomfort a little bit stronger.  But my memories were just of a fairly smooth transition.  The classic questions probably arose amongst kids: "Well, what, what's your skin like?  What's going on?  What about your hair?  Are you really brown? And are you really white?"  That kind of thing.  But, it was fine.
Speaker 1: You know, you had said there was some concern about whether the black school [Houston County Training School, Perry, Georgia] would close.  Did that school close or what--
Speaker 2: Eventually it did close.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that happened throughout the South where they would close the black schools and favor the white schools, you know, the implication that, well, we couldn't send our white kids to those particular schools.  Then they eventually reopened the school, renovated it, and then made it a school that was another elementary school that all kids went to.
Speaker 1: So what happened to those black teachers?  Did they end up at Per- Perry Middle School?
Speaker 2: Not many of them.  We--in the classic case of many southern towns, blacks had to accept the white way of life, or the white existence.  And then whatever it was that we had was sort of, you know, thrown off to the wayside.  Some of those teachers moved on to other towns nearby.  Who knows, maybe some of them may have even moved on to other jobs.  But, no, those teachers actually did not go with us.  We had to--we were basically thrust into a new environment.  We had to adapt to the environment.  None of our heritage or environment was sort of brought into or assimilated into this experience.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that your teachers were all white?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were all white, at least in the beginning.  And then, eventually, you know, a black teacher surfaced here or there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is, what year is it, 1968, sixty--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969]--
Speaker 1: --nine [1969], okay.
Speaker 2: --seventy [1970].  So literally the tail end of the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 632842
Speaker 1: Do you remember other things happening?  You were, were you aware of like when [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: --you know, you didn't because you were off as a child.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Ironically I wound up going to the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] and heard so much about Charlayne Hunter-Gault.  But at that time I was a nine year old kid, I didn't know what was happening just 150 miles north of me at the University of Georgia.  As a child when you're growing up amongst that, I mean unless you had a very activist household, which we did not, you knew that there was something going on, you knew there was some unsettling situation happening.  But, maybe my parents [Ruth Kaigler Roberts and Benjamin Roberts, Sr.] tried to shield us from that in some way.  But I don't think we knew the extent to which these marches were happening and the unrest was happening around the country.  I was aware of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  I remember the pain and the sadness in my household when he was killed.  But I don't think we knew the extent to which the rest of the country was feeling, you know, the reverberations of you know these shockwaves.
Story_ID: 632843
Speaker 1: Now, so you go to Perry Middle School [Perry Junior High School; Perry Middle School, Perry, Georgia], what is--?  Perry Middle School.  Now you go there how many years if you start in the fourth grade (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to the fourth--well, from fourth grade 'til probably seventh grade [at Perry Elementary School, Perry, Georgia], and then eighth and ninth grade was our junior high school.  So, or maybe it was fourth to sixth.  I can't remember because they changed that at one point.  But then there was the junior high school after that, and there were two, maybe three grades there.
Speaker 1: So what was--
Speaker 2: And then we went on to--
Speaker 1: --the junior high school you went to?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --Perry Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then was it then Perry High School [Perry, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: And then Perry High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very original around here (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what are you--so in this school, you sort of start fitting in then.  I mean, it's not a traumatic experience for you?
Speaker 2: It was not a traumatic experience for me.  I started to make friends.  I was a pretty outgoing kid.  So I fit in pretty well.  And by the time I went to junior high school, I had sort of hit my stride.  I was going out for the cheerleading squad, and somewhat popular kid in school, had a lot of friends.  So my memories really, other than that shaky period of just getting started and meeting these new kids and blending with white kids for the first time, my memories were actually pretty happy.  They're just any other normal childhood experience of one girl who pulled my hair and didn't like me, or a little boy, Maceo [ph.], whom I liked who didn't like me or, you know, those kinds of things.  But I don't remember the pain of that experience as well as maybe my older sisters do.
Speaker 1: So you went out for the cheerleading squad.  Did you make it?
Speaker 2: I didn't make it the first year.  But I made it the second year.
Speaker 1: So how many, how many black ki- girls made it?
Speaker 2: Two or three.  There was another girl who made it the first year that I didn't make it.  You know, it was interesting, even though I felt like I had really a fairly happy experience, a contented experience, there was though this underlying knowledge that if there's going to be a black cheerleader on the squad, you know there's probably going to be one, or maybe two at most.  When homecoming came along, we had two picks from each class: one black and one white.  When there was a pageant, or some kind of a talent show, there was always some grousing, or maybe even an understanding amongst blacks that chances are the black person's not going to win.  So we sort of knew that the odds were still stacked against us, that it was still a difficult time and that blacks were having, you know, a rough go of it, even though we all mingled together and so forth in school.  So I didn't make the cheerleading squad the first year, but the second year I tried out I did.  And there may have even been two black cheerleaders at that time.  And by the time I went to high school and I continued and I was on the cheerleading squad throughout, there may have even been three of us, three or four of us on a squad of like ten or twelve girls at that point.
Speaker 1: So were there, di- what about the black boys?  Were they playing--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: You were cheerleading for what, what sport?
Speaker 2: Football.
Speaker 1: Football.
Speaker 2: And basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean all the sports basically if you did it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: There were plenty of black athletes, and that was what was sort of interesting about it because on the basketball team, the majority of the athletes on the girls team were black, the majority of the star athletes on the boys team were black, the football players; lot of black players.  So we knew that that was sort of the accepted and the acceptable sport for blacks.  But, when it came to the other kinds of activities where, you know, intellectual prowess was important or maybe some kind of physical attractiveness and so forth, we knew that blacks didn't seem to have the same kind of level playing field.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 632844
Speaker 1: Did you have--were there any issues as you got you know past puberty on, with the sports and white girls being attracted to the black boys?  Was there any of that that you remember?
Speaker 2: There wasn't much of that.  There was always the--.  There was one girl I remember who had a black boyfriend, and there was some talk about that around school.  You know, I remember specifically when I was a cheerleader in high school [Perry High School, Perry, Georgia], there was one girl, a white girl; very, very sweet girl, who clearly had a crush on this one black guy, who was a basketball player, a very outgoing, sharp, funny, just a wonderful guy.  And I knew that they really liked each other, and they spent time with each other, and there're always, you know, raised eyebrows.  But by the time I was in high school, and that was in the late '70s [1970s], I think we were sort of coming around to an acceptance, a very reluctant ac- acceptance of interracial dating.  But I, I could see that it was painful for this girl, and even for her family, that she was sort of dancing the idea that I like Roy [ph.], but, but Robin [ph.] could not bring herself to date Roy.  So, it was still a taboo situation, although there were a couple of instances here and there of a black student and white student.  I mean, I--there was a white boy who was very interested in me, and I liked him a lot, he just also happened to be a little strange.  But, I don't think that that held me back in terms of maybe wanting to date him.  I mean I was aware that it wouldn't be an easy situation, but it was still an uneasy, an uneasy situation, I think, for teenagers at that point.
Story_ID: 632845
Speaker 1: Did you have--were there any issues around color?
Speaker 2: Skin color?  Gradations of color?  Oh my, gosh, yeah.  I mean, I was the darkest skinned child in my family.  And while I don't think we had the classic sort of economically different group of people in the town [Perry, Georgia] where there was a fair-skinned, you know, set of people who, you know, did--who were involved in the classic, you know, professions.  But for the most part, there was sort of an understanding that the fairer skinned girls were prettier.  One of the teachers, the counselors at one of the schools was a fair-skinned woman.  Her fair-skinned daughters seemed to get a little preferential treatment I remember as I was growing up.  And I remember feeling the sting of that color issue very, very strongly, that I felt that I was the dark girl.  And sometimes people would even make a joke about, you know, "That black girl, that black--," when I was growing, especially before we even integrated schools.  That was just within the neighborhood.  That was not a product of anything that was going on in school, but it was just in my community.  And so, I definitely felt less attractive, less desired; less desirable because I had dark skin.  And that was something that was painful for me.  And maybe it even fueled my desire to succeed.  Maybe because of that I was determined to be better, to be smarter, to be stronger, to be, you know, all these other things because I didn't want to be defined by that, and it was it was, it was a painful thing for me.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any specific instances around that, you know that were particularly painful that come to mind?
Speaker 2: I remember a man in the neighborhood used to call me black girl.  "Hey, black girl.  How are you?"  "Hey, there's the black girl."  And that used to hurt my feelings so badly.  And I don't know that he meant it in that way.  Maybe he just thought, you know, it was just a funny thing to say, but it really made me feel distinctive, and I didn't like it, in a negative way.  And I remember when my younger sisters [Bonita Jackson and Belinda Spellman] sometimes wanted to, you know, fight with me, they knew they could push a button if they ever made a comment about my color, you know, black, black girl.  And that really hurt, and I didn't, I didn't like that at all.  But at the same time, I remember my mother [Ruth Kaigler Roberts] bending over backwards to always--if she heard if she heard something like that, I remember if my mother heard something like that she would bend over backwards to talk about how pretty I was or, "You're my special girl," or "You're, oh, you're beautiful.  You're my girl."  And I know that she was trying to make me feel better, feel less different.
Story_ID: 632846
Speaker 1: Who's influencing you as a young person?  I mean who--are there teachers around you?  Are there other adults?  I mean, who is sort of forming who you are or--?
Speaker 2: Well, the backbone of--let me think how I want to say that.  I mean, my moral inspiration was my family, my mother [Ruth Kaigler Roberts] in particular.  My mother had very strong feelings about, you know, Christian behavior and how you treat other people.  And she would have these really strange expressions like, the time of day belongs to everybody, which basically means that you should greet people.  You should always say good morning, hello to all kinds of people.  So there was a decency about her and about the way she carried herself.  You treat others as you want to be treated.  I mean, so the, the background of my moral fiber, I think, you know, came about because of my mother.  But I had a teacher, a white teacher interestingly, when I was in fourth, fifth grade [at Perry Elementary School, Perry, Georgia], named Dorothy Hardy who was just an amazing woman.  She was a very prim, white-skinned woman who had impeccably manicured red nails and red lipstick, and coiffed white hair that flipped up just so.  And she was very prim and demanded, you know, good manners, take your gum out of your-- if you ever come into her classroom.  But I just remember because she was so particular and her standards were so exact, that I wanted to be good, I wanted to be smart, I wanted to--I wanted Mrs. Hardy to approve of me.  And I--we learned, you know, poetry in her class, and we would have to recite poems, you know.  And I just remember wanting to be somebody that she admired.  And from time to time, I would get a compliment from her and it meant so much to me.  And I would say probably, and at that point, my desire to speak well, to maybe even try to think about public speaking, to, to be smart, to be better than, I think all of that stuff was sort of fire for me in Mrs. Hardy's classroom.
Speaker 1: And what grade was that again?
Speaker 2: Fourth, fifth grade.  Might have even been, it may have been fifth, sixth grade actually because fourth grade is when we integrated.  It was probably around sixth grade.  But it--she had just a, she had a monumental impact on me.  And to this day, I still mention her when I'm talking to people and talking about my upbringing and someone who had, you know, just this amazing impact on my life; Mrs. Hardy was one.  And I still would see her from time to time when I went back to Perry [Georgia] up until when she died a few years ago.  And I don't even know how much she was aware of the impact that she had over her students, but she had an amazing one on me.
Story_ID: 632847
Speaker 1: Now what subjects were you gravitating to, or did you gravitate to?
Speaker 2: English, literature.  I liked science a bit, but probably more--maybe some of the more creative subjects.  You know, I was really interested in reading, and English and history to some degree.
Speaker 1: Were you active in any organizations and things like that?
Speaker 2: I was in a few of the clubs in school that probably will mean nothing to you.  The Beta Club was one, and, oh, I don't even remember.  There are two or three others; nothing that really comes to mind that was really huge.  But a few of, a few clubs, and then I was a cheerleader.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So a lot of times spent--well, now, where were the teams playing?  Were they all other little small towns where you get--was Macon [Georgia]--any--
Speaker 2: Small towns around the area: Macon, Fort Valley [Georgia].  Counties too, we would play a lot of the county schools: Warner Robins [Georgia], probably all within a thirty, forty mile radius.  I don't think we took any big, big trips.
Speaker 1: Any, any trips to Atlanta [Georgia] because you were really--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  Not--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, Atlanta was not even in this sphere?
Speaker 2: Atlanta was the big city, and here and there, you know, some of our neighbors or some of the ladies in church [New Hope Baptist Church, Perry, Georgia] would organize a trip to Atlanta.  And Atlanta may as well had been New York City [New York, New York] as far as I was concerned, because it was really the big city.  Macon was the city for us if we wanted to go and do some fancy shopping or something like that.  But Atlanta was the big town.  And I don't think I ever went to Atlanta until I was in high school [Perry High School, Perry, Georgia].  Maybe even beyond that, but I think maybe high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, really your influence--I mean the sports, did that, the cheerleading influence you at all or--
Speaker 2: Oh sure, because you had to perform in front of an audience.  You'd be, you had to possess a certain amount of confidence.  Leadership came into play because I was a cheerleading captain at one point.  So sure, I think I--probably a lot of my confidence came into play around the time I was a cheerleader.  And I mean, first of all, I had to, I was defeated the first time I tried to go out for cheerleading [at Perry Junior High School; Perry Middle School, Perry, Georgia].  And then I finally made it, and I had to go out for it every year and try out for it every year.  So, and you know what, in, during that period, too, being a cheerleader in school was pretty hot stuff.  And then, you know, I would say probably the makeup of the school was somewhere 60/40, black and white.  I don't know which way.  But, you know, I certainly didn't feel like it was an all-white school.  But, most of, you know, the kids who had any kind of prominence in the school were probably white kids.  So to be a black cheerleader on this cheerleading squad was pretty big stuff.
Speaker 1: And you- and most cheerleaders were the popular kids too.
Speaker 2: Were the popular kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --exactly.
Story_ID: 632848
Speaker 1: Now, how about college.  How, how did you end up going to University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia]?  Where did that come into--?
Speaker 2: I wanted to get away from home.  I really wanted to go and explore and you know just move out from Perry [Georgia] and sort of spread my wings and go to a bigger place.  But then I sort of discovered I was really too afraid (laughter) to go too far away from home.  So I think it just happened by chance really.  I applied to a few colleges.  I don't even know that I applied to anything out of state.  Ultimately, I think I was a little bit nervous about that.  But the University of Georgia felt far enough away.  It felt sort of exciting and interesting.  And then I did learn about [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Hamilton [Hamilton Holmes]--oh gosh.  I can't remember; I'm going blank on the--the other gentleman's name.
Speaker 1: I forget his name.
Speaker 2: I know, who integrated the school with her, I should know.  But I had heard about Charlayne Hunter-Gault and the efforts to integrate that school.  And it was a big school, too, at the time, and the Georgia Bulldogs were very big throughout the State of Georgia.  Football was, you know, ba- basically, you know, a religion in Georgia.  So I thought this would be a big experience for me.  And--
Speaker 1: Now Athens [Georgia] is how far away from Perry?
Speaker 2: Two hundred miles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Something like that.  I mean, I remember it being about a three hour, three and a-half hour ride.  So it felt like it was far enough away from home that I was making a break, but not so far that I would be worried about this connection to my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, how was that experience?  I mean, so, before--do you remember the other schools you applied to, you said?
Speaker 2: No, not really because I really wanted to go to the University of Georgia, and I probably applied to a couple more just to see, maybe Georgia Southern University [Georgia Southern College; Georgia Southern University] in Statesboro [Georgia].  I don't really remember because I got accepted I think pretty early from the University of Georgia, so that was it; that was what I wanted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did anyone else that you know went to University of Georgia that year?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  So this was really my step towards a little independence and just sort of, you know, throwing my net out there.  My oldest sister [Annette Traynham] had gone to Fort Valley State University [Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], a historical black college [HBCU] next door, fifteen miles away from home.  And I knew I didn't want to do that; I wanted to branch out and do something bigger.  She had suggested that I try to go to school there.  So this was a big step for me because I didn't know anyone there.  Now I knew a couple of kids from my high school [Perry High School, Perry, Georgia] probably four, five who were thinking of going.  But, I was just making this decision, you know, independently.
Story_ID: 632849
Speaker 1: So how was that experience then?
Speaker 2: It was actually a good experience.  I went to school [University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia], you know, all excited and thinking this would just be my big step out into the world, and to some degree it was.  But it was also a little bit more of a realization, the real world.  I think I had this idealization of what the world would be like beyond the doors of Perry, Georgia.  And I think I thought, too, because it was 1978, that we had made such progress in this country, you know, racially in the state, racially, that once I leave the confines of this little city, you know, I'm going to see the world is just ready and waiting for me, and it's going to be open and just great.  And I remember coming up against, you know, just some real good old boys and some southerners there who were not necessarily as open minded or friendly.  And, and I felt I wouldn't say a horrible sting of racism, but I definitely felt that racism still existed.  Case in point, I was thinking about going out for cheerleading because I had been a cheerleader in high school [Perry High School, Perry, Georgia].  And I remember a cousin of mine, a woman in our neighborhood who said to me, "Well, you know, they will only probably allow one black cheerleader, and then you've got to have a black partner because they're certainly not going to have some black girl doing flips and jumping on the shoulders of some white guy."  And I remember thinking, like, wow.  That's just really like racist, I can't believe she would say that.  And then I got to school and discovered that seemed to be the case.  I remember entering some kind of a competition of some sort, and I don't even remember now what it was.  But I just remember race being mentioned, whispered.  So it was clear to me that just because I left Perry, Georgia that the rest of the world wasn't colorblind, and everything wasn't going to just be sort of opening up just because I thought it would.  And then I also remember that was probably the clearest memory I have of a racial slur being shouted at me.  Maybe when I was in Perry as a child I might have heard someone just say something somewhere, but I remember once walking down the sidewalk at college, and somebody shouting from a car something about a nigger.  And I just remember being shocked.  Not that somebody was capable of doing it, but I just had never really had a taunt like that thrown in my direction, at least not in the years that I could remember, you know, in the recent years that I could remember.  And I think it was just the realization for me that, well, the world isn't--the big world isn't quite as colorblind and open and just sort of ready for me to go out there and just, you know, pursue my fortunes in a very even, equal way as I had sort of hoped and idealized that it would.
Speaker 1: Now this was a big move for you because you're on your own, you know, you're out of the family, you know, structure.  What do you find- like, how do you find the environment?  That's, you know, I'm just trying--the school environment?
Speaker 2: I was intimidated, I was nervous.  This was a big school of like--
Speaker 1: How many--
Speaker 2: --twenty thousand people.  I knew probably two or three students from my high school who came to college there, but, you know, they were finding their way too.  I wouldn't say that we all stuck together.  One was a white girl and one was a black gal.  You know, so we--so I did know a couple of people, and there was a sense of familiarity, but this just felt like the big city.  This is a huge campus and primarily white.  I mean, I don't even remember what the percentage was of black students.  It's a little better now, but at that point, too, I mean, out of twenty thousand let's say maybe there were a thousand black students, if that and that might be generous; I don't recall.  I may be off with that number.  But the bottom line is it was very clear it was predominantly white, that the sororities and fraternities, the white sororities and fraternities were white, so there were black fraternities and sororities.  I mean there was a real divide there that I think I had either just ignored or just somehow had in my small town not been so aware of.  And suddenly I see, you know, the white fraternities and sororities; the black fraternities and sororities; the one black cheerleader on the squad, and then some talk that that was probably just the deal about how it should be done.  I really started to feel, you know, the greater pain, I guess, of, of racism, you know, in Georgia.
Story_ID: 632850
Speaker 1: Now, what was your major?  What was, what were you thinking you were gonna--?
Speaker 2: I, I started off thinking that I was going to major in drama because I knew I wanted to do public speaking, I wanted to do something before an audience.  And then I took my first drama class, and these kids were like kind of bizarre, and you know, the classic actors on campus.  And I said, this is not what I'm interested in.  So I, you know, just sort of looked around or maybe, you know, went to the catalog and find journalism, a television journalism class, so maybe, maybe that's what it is.  So I took the journalism course the next quarter, we were on the quarter system at that time.
Speaker 1: This is your first year?
Speaker 2: My first year.  And I took this journalism class.  I said, that's it.  I'm here.  This is what I'm meant to do.  And that was it.
Speaker 1: So did they have a good journalism program?
Speaker 2: They have a very good journalism program [Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, Athens, Georgia], and it was known for its journalism program.  And I'm not sure that I knew that when I went in, but I quickly discovered that.  I mean literally my second quarter when I said this is it, and I just loved it.  I excelled and I, you know, took, you know, communications law, and you know, newspaper writing, and television and so forth and so on.  And I knew that was what I wanted.
Speaker 1: When did you become aware of let's say Mon- you know, other people--
Speaker 2: Monica Kaufman [HistoryMaker Monica Pearson].
Speaker 1: --Kaufman.
Speaker 2: Monica Kaufman came and spoke to one of my classes.  This black woman from Atlanta [Georgia] who was just a powerhouse.  I mean she was hugely popular.  She was sort of the Oprah Winfrey of Georgia, at least at that point.  And I just remember being in awe and just thinking, wow, if I could just be like Monica Kaufman that would be so cool.  Wow, she's so great.  She speaks so well, she's so self-assured.  She's just you know a good journalist, you know.  She's off the cuff, just great, and she had the respect of all these people around here.  It was so clear.  She commanded that desk when she sat at the desk at the station in Atlanta, WSB [WSB-TV].  And I remember that she was so open and she talked to us and was very candid about how the, tough the business could be, but how rewarding it was.  And I believe that she even gave us her phone number at the station.  I don't know if it was her home number.  Because what was really amazing to me--she may have even given us her home number and said, "If you want to talk to me, you just give me a call, I'll be happy to answer some questions or to give you some advice."  And I just remember being struck by that and thinking, wow.  What an amazing woman.  And prior to that, I had also seen on television some of the black journalists, the very few.  When I grew up we watched CBS; it was the only station we could get with our little antenna at our house [in Perry, Georgia], and we watched Walter Cronkite every night.  And I remember seeing Lem Tucker and Michele Clark I believe was this one up and coming black woman reporter who died in a plane crash later, and [HistoryMaker] Carole Simpson, and Connie Chung.  And I just remember seeing these faces of color and thinking, wow.  I can do that.  I could do that.  I want to report.  I w- maybe I didn't know about reporting, but I want to travel the world, I want to be involved in important stories and business.  So I, I'm not sure that I went to college [University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia] with the knowledge that television and journalism, and that's what I want to do.
Story_ID: 632851
Speaker 1: Did you know you want to be, that you wanted to be on air?  You knew that for sure?  Not--
Speaker 2: I knew pretty quickly that I wanted to be on air because I was fascinated by videotape; that was sort of new on the scene.  And I felt that I had a presence and that I could, you know, publicly, you know, speak a bit.  So I knew I wanted to be on air.
Speaker 1: So were you learning at school [Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, Athens, Georgia] about the business of television?  Do you think they did a good job there?
Speaker 2: I think they did a terrific job because we had a station at our college [University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia], and I had opportunities to actually work with equipment.  I had a couple of internships which were encouraged.  I got this one coveted internship at Georgia Public Television [Georgia Public Broadcasting] one semester where I actually moved away to Atlanta [Georgia] and, for a whole three months, and reported on the Georgia legislature.  So I knew at that point that that was something that I could do, and I wanted to do.  I wasn't terribly good at it at the time (laughter), but I really felt that I had some potential.
Story_ID: 632852
Speaker 1: So you graduate.  What happens after that point?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it was in some ways I mean it was a very fortunate kind of Cinderella story.  I mean granted I was prepared and I worked very hard, but I had done a couple of internships.  I had an advisor at the school [Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, Athens, Georgia] who really believed in me.
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: And--his name was Jim Martin [ph.].  And he hooked me up with a--you know there were students who I guess he really believed in, and he would connect you with a news director someplace at some small station.  And he connected me with this station in Georgia--Columbus, Georgia [WTVM-TV], and a news director.  And really on the strength of his recommendation, this news director hired me.  So I came out of school and had a job right away working in television.
Speaker 1: Who was the news director?
Speaker 2: Dave Richardson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now was he a good mentor to you?
Speaker 2: Mm, not really.  Only because he was going through his personal problems at the time and I knew it.  But, but that said, I would say he believed in me, and he gave me opportunities.  I mean I wasn't a very good reporter.  I mean most of us when we come out of school are not.  The tinny voice and the, you know, uncertain delivery and so forth.  But he would pull me aside and give me some pointers (laughter) harshly.  But then give me another chance to try to be better.  So, I think he believed in me, I just think that he also had a lot of things going on at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you get to know Columbus, Georgia?  You had--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I spent about two- a year and a-half to two years there.  And it was, you know, it was nice.  It was actually a great first job because it was fairly close to my hometown [Perry, Georgia]; a hundred, 120 miles away maybe.  My parents [Ruth Kaigler Roberts and Benjamin Roberts, Sr.] could actually get the station, so they could watch me on TV, so I thought I was like (snaps fingers), you know, Miss Thing then; I was on television and my parents were watching me report.  And I could go home and visit with them from time to time, but yet, I had my own apartment; I was just sort of tipping out into the world.  So it was actually a very nice arrangement.  Now, that said, after about a year, I started to feel that I was sort of outgrowing the place, and, and the environment and the work experience, so I started to look around.  And probably another year later, maybe two years total I spent there, then another year later, I went on to get a job in Knoxville, Tennessee [at WBIR-TV].
Story_ID: 632853
Speaker 1: Now, did, had it been advised, you know, because that's in your industry, you know, you have to do the small town thing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and then, you know, hope to sort of move up.  Were you aware of that?
Speaker 2: I was aware.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I was aware that you had to work your way up, and I probably had seen enough or heard enough about the journalists in the field to know that that was just the route that you needed to take.  And at this point I was very much aware of network television, keenly aware of the impact of [HistoryMaker] Carole Simpson and Max Robinson and the few blacks--and Ed Bradley--the few blacks who were surfacing on television network news and were making their mark.  So I started to aspire.  I started to think, well, maybe network television.  Maybe '60 Minutes.'  Maybe one of these days.  I mean, it was obviously a great dream, but I thought, I'm just going to hang in here and I'm going to do this, and I'm going to be the best.  And I don't care, they can keep pushing me back or you know, somebody can throw something my way or you know, sexist remarks or whatever, but I'm going to fight through and I'm going to do this thing.  So I knew that I had to sort of, you know, blaze this little trail of local stations.  It was just a matter of how many.  So when I left Columbus [WTVM-TV, Columbus, Georgia] for Knoxville, Tennessee, it was a bigger market.  I was making probably thirteen thousand dollars.  I was making thirteen thousand dollars a year I think in Columbus [Georgia].  And I remember going to Knoxville, and I was going to be making seventeen thousand dollars a year.  Oh my gosh.  And they had live, live trucks, which were still fairly new in the business at that time; not every station had them.  So I would have the capability to be able to go live and go do certain things.  So it was like that much better of an experience.  And when I left Knoxville, Tennessee for Orlando, Florida [WFTV-TV], it was the same kind of thing; I was going to have the opportunity to anchor.  Each time I was sort of ratcheting it up a little bit with the responsibility and sort of the cachet of the job.  So I thought I was paving a little bit of a path.
Speaker 1: So now in Knoxville, that was WBRI, was that--was it--
Speaker 2: WBIR [WBIR-TV, Knoxville, Tennessee].  It was a CBS affiliate.
Speaker 1: It's at CBS.  So you started at CBS.  Okay, then, going over and--or in Orlando that was ABC?
Speaker 2: ABC, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the affiliates really didn't have that much of an impact on me because it was just the station.  And, Knoxville, that was the powerhouse station in the town.  In Orlando, this just happened to be the biggest and the best station--well, the best station, the biggest numbers in town.  It didn't matter whether they were CBS, NBC or ABC.
Speaker 1: But Orlando was a bigger market, though (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a much bigger market.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Story_ID: 632854
Speaker 1: Who was on the air with you in Orlando [WFTV-TV, Orlando, Florida]?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Marla Weech, Bob Opsahl.  These aren't names that would really mean anything to you.  But interestingly, I was sort of coming into my own because I was offered a job in Houston, Texas, too.  So--and I don't remember the affiliate.  K- KHOU [KHOU-TV, Houston, Texas] maybe.  But I had two stations that had offered me positions, and that was really kind of exciting, and then I chose the Orlando station.
Speaker 1: So you would send in your interview tapes you know along with--
Speaker 2: Send a resume tape out and, you know, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay.  So what would you consider significant about the Orlando experience?  I knew you did coverage of NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] launches and--
Speaker 2: What was great about the Orlando experience was that I covered the space shuttle launches, and I also was a bureau chief, which basically means that I was the only reporter in the Brevard County area [Florida] to cover the space shuttles.  But I was also responsible for covering other stuff.  So, there was a little bit of a title there attached to it.  But I also got to do fill-in anchor work too.  And then eventually, when one anchor moved along to another show, I actually got the weekend anchor gig.  So it was a chance for me to step up in terms of my experience.  But, along the way, the space reporting is really sort of my--was where the sort of serendipitous part of this whole thing happened because somebody from NBC happened to be watching one day, and NBC was looking for a morning reporter to cover the space beat, and so, I got a call from NBC and the rest is history.
Speaker 1: So talk about that.  Who actually called you?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: A woman by the name of Elena Nachmanoff, who is the head of talent and recruitment at NBC.  So she called me.  She called my agent probably first, and then she called me and just asked me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, when did you get an agent?
Speaker 2: I got an agent when I was in Orlando [Florida], and I realized that I r-  when I--when I decided in Orlando that I really wanted to make that next big step, that it was time to start thinking about network television or an O & O [owned and operated], I got an agent.  And it was a big deal because my boss at the time did not like agents.  It was almost like somebody bringing a union into a shop and the big fight, the 'Norma Rae' fight, he was not happy about this at all.  He didn't want to deal with an agent because, see--he didn't want to see the demand for better salaries and all this stuff.  And against his desires I took an agent, and it was almost a showdown, and I wound up leaving the station.  But, it was great because I got an offer from a reporter--I got an offer from a station in Tampa [Florida], and then I got an offer from NBC, and then my agent helped me--helped place me there.  And then after that, other s- other, after that, other reporters started getting agents (laughter).
Speaker 1: So how did you know to get an agent?  I mean who influenced you or--
Speaker 2: You know, you just learn in the business that this is what happens.  And as people get, you know, a little bigger in the business, this is what happens.  And then I had an agent call me at one point and say, "I've seen some of your tapes around and maybe I could help you."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, what did you think the opportunity with NBC was going to be because you, you know, at that point?  What did they think--did they talk about the opportunity?
Speaker 2: It was an entry level correspondent position, and that I would probably cover space some because they had a space reporter who wanted to focus on other things, medical and science, and they would have a second person to do that.  But for me, I mean, my gosh, this is the network and I'm twenty-nine years old.  That was just amazing to me that I would actually, in any capacity, just step into this role.  So I mean I felt that I had earned it.  I had worked very hard, but this is network television.  To me this is like the big show.  So it was--it was a big deal, and all my colleagues and friends were really quite excited about it too.
Story_ID: 632855
Speaker 1: You move where when you get this job with NB-
Speaker 2: I moved to New York [New York].
Speaker 1: You moved to New Yor-
Speaker 2: I moved to New York temporarily with NBC because they were going to train me and just have me work here for a while, and eventually put me in one of their bureaus.  So after about six months, I was sent down to the Miami bureau [Miami, Florida] to basically cover the Southeast.
Speaker 1: Can, can I ask, what did they do to train you?  I mean, was there a style or do they just sort of throw you in?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, the whole idea was not to just throw you in.  So they had me here for six months basically to just sort of be, you know, amongst the headquarters and people there.  I mean, yeah, it was sort of a softer approach I guess to just hiring somebody and throwing them to a bureau.
Speaker 1: But who's here at the time; are you observing and looking or, you know, you're just--
Speaker 2: Deborah Norville, Bryant Gumbel on the morning show ['Today']; Jane Pauley was still around; Tom Brokaw of course; and you know, just various correspondents.  Cassandra Clayton was a black correspondent who was actually leaving as I was coming in, but I got to spend some time with her.  A number of the correspondents have since left, but I got a chance to sort of see what the shark pool would be like (laughter).  And I quickly discovered that it was definitely a different environment than I had, you know, swam in before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you left and went where then?  You're s-
Speaker 2: To Miami.
Speaker 1: To Miami, okay.  And so, in Miami, what is that assignment like and, I mean, you're still--is that typical that they, you know, would bring you in to a national and then put you--
Speaker 2: A lot of, a lot of networks will hire people and then send them out to the bureau, or hire them and they stay in the city in which they hired them.  Maybe if it's Dallas [Texas] or Los Angeles [California] or whatever, and you work there.  So that was not that unusual.  It was fine.  At that point, you knew when you're in a bureau your assignment was to travel around those surrounding states.  So I--and then eventually, nine months later, they closed the bureau and I moved to the Atlanta bureau [Atlanta, Georgia].  So I would travel around whenever there was a breaking story in Alabama, or Florida, or Haiti or someplace like that I would go, and I was one of the correspondents to go chase the story.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in each of these places, that's what I'm just trying to sort of understand.  I mean, there's just the regular, you know, day to day work of covering stories.  I'm trying to understand you understanding the business, you know, behind it now.  Are--is--are you active at this point in nation- you know, NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], no or--
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, I went to some NABJ conferences and probably was a part of it, but not that active in it.  I mean at that point I think I was just involved, invested in my career and career growth that I wasn't really experiencing this all together as a black correspondent.  I mean, I, obviously I was aware that I was, but I think I was just trying to be a correspondent, and trying to be aggressive, and, and get on the air, and do all those things that I needed to do.
Story_ID: 632856
Speaker 1: And when I wasn't getting on the air so much, and the first Persian Gulf War broke out, I decided, maybe I ought to go cover the war.  And I was shocked because I volunteered to go cover the war, and then a month or two later they called me up and said, "Okay.  We want to send you to Kuwait," and I said, "What?  Oh yeah, great.  Fabulous.  Great."  And I was really, really terrified.  But at the same time, it was exhilarating because I was going to take on this huge assignment.  My parents [Ruth Kaigler Roberts and Benjamin Roberts, Sr.] were terrified and upset with me.  But, I went to go cover that conflict, and it was the best, most amazing assignment I've ever had.  I was gone for probably three, four weeks from home.  And--
Speaker 2: Give the year.
Speaker 1: Gosh, you would have to ask me.
Speaker 2: Let's see--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991]?  Ninety-one [1991].  It was 1991.  And, you know, obviously the world was a different place.  We had not had terrorism on our shores, but we certainly were aware that Saddam Hussein had these chemical weapon capabilities and so, we were all worried about that.  But I, you know, probably in my stupidly naive and just tenacious way just wanted to go and try to make some great stories and get on the map as a strong correspondent.  And I did.  And I came back with a better assignment.  I got a raise (laughter).  And a lot more respect within the network [NBC].
Speaker 2: But who- let's talk about your time in Kuwait.  You said you were there three or four months?
Speaker 1: Three or four weeks.
Speaker 2: Weeks.  Okay.  Let's talk about that, I mean, because it--had you traveled much outside the country when you went to--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, you know, because I don't think a lot of us understand, you know, what it's like, you know, just to go on, go on assignment, and how you actually go about, you know, getting your, you know getting your story.  So I just would like--
Speaker 1: That was, that was learning experience for me, too, because you have to remember I was twenty-nine, thirty years old, I had been with the network for all of one year.  And, I did not know what I was getting myself into.  And I bumped up against a lot of hostile, difficult, abrasive reporters.  But it was great.  It was great training ground for me because I learned how to fight and, and--fight for stories, not physically fight (laughter).  I learned how to fight for stories and to sort of, you know, build a little more backbone in this industry, which is very difficult.  Network television is very, very different from local news.  And it was a great learning experience.  It was a great journalistic experience.  It was a great human experience to be in a war-torn country, certainly not the same as it is now in Iraq.  But I went from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia, and it was, it was very interesting.  And I, I sort of learned along the way the politics of the business; a little bit more anyway.
Story_ID: 632857
Speaker 1: I learned a little bit more about the politics and just how it all works.
Speaker 2: Can you just give some insight into what you learned is what I'm trying to--
Speaker 1: Oh, I learned that it's not all about fairness.  I learned it's not all about who should, who, who volunteered for a story.  I learned that--.  It's very complicated, Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson].  I mean, this is almost like a story about journalism (laughter).  But I learned a lot about just, just how fiercely competitive the business is, and how much you have to really fight for a story--
Speaker 2: Can you give--
Speaker 1: --and how much you have to really--
Speaker 2: Can you give an example of something that you experienced?
Speaker 1: I remember a correspondent who is no longer with NBC, who was there at the time, a male, who saw this war [Persian Gulf War] as his opportunity to build his star power.  And I remember that he said something to me like, "Well, you know may as well get out of the way because this is my assignment," or "This is my story," or something to that effect.  And I remember just being dumbfounded by how abrasive he was and just how egotistical he was.  But I also remember thinking that that's not my style per se, that I've got to go out, and I've got to try to, you know, get my stories, and I've got to call New York [New York] and make sure people know that I'm, I want to do this and that.  But I didn't believe--.  I guess maybe my, my, my southern Christian ethic kind of came into play, whereas somebody may decide to treat you one way, but I decided I'm just, that's just not my game.  I'm just going to, you know, do my, do my job and do my thing and work hard, and let it pay off.  And, ultimately, it did.  I mean, it was really more about the day to day grind of just my energy and my enthusiasm of doing stories.  And in the end, that sort of paid off.  And this guy had all kinds of problems and troubles, and wound up having to go back home early, and we haven't heard of him since.  So, I think I learned a lot about, about ways to play the game too.  That, that you do have to be aggressive, that you do have to be assertive.  That so much of this is about being in the right place at the right time, but also standing up for yourself, sticking up for yourself.  Maybe calculating how you want to try to get an assignment, but also who you are as a person, and how nasty you want to be to get an assignment, and how dismissive you want to be of other people.  And that's just not who I am.  So I learned a valuable lesson about how you don't have to be that way, but at the same time, just about--.  I mean, I'm not explaining this very well.  It's a very--
Speaker 2: Well it's the politics of--like you had said before, it's sort of the politics, or how to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I mean that's present in every industry.
Speaker 2: But, but you know, the thing is, did anyone ever say you were too Pollyann [sic. Pollyanna]-ish?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's funny.  My sister actually used to use that exact expression.  I don't think anybody ever said that to me in this business, although people have implied here or there that, wow, you're a little too nice for this business, because it is cutthroat.  And there have been times when I've sort of wondered that (laughter).  But you know you have to know who you are.  And that's--yeah, I mean, I think people have implied that before.  But that's okay.  That's okay because I think one of the things that I have discovered over time, over the course of my career, is that I can be aggressive, I can be tenacious, I can be assertive about doing stories and getting what it is I would like to do.  But I don't have to be cutthroat.  I don't have to be totally nasty to do this job, and I think for a long time I wondered whether that would actually pay off for me.  But I think it has served me well.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's who I am.
Story_ID: 632858
Speaker 1: So when you come back from Kuwait and, what is, what is the, what, what, what is the next assignment that's a major assignment?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think I got a series.  There was a--we were doing a series of reports on, you know, I don't know, middle-class America, or whatever.  I don't remember now.  But I was assigned one of the--one of the reports on Tom Brokaw's evening news program ['NBC Nightly News'].  And that was pretty big for me because prior to that I had to scratch and dig and try to get my reports on the air, but instead I was given a prominent assignment on the evening news.  And so, that was a sign to me that things had changed, perception had changed about who I was as a reporter.
Speaker 1: Now how was he to work with?
Speaker 2: He was terrific.  I--my--somebody said to me, maybe it was my husband [Al Roker].  When I was over covering the war [Persian Gulf War], at one point I was reporting this one story and Tom Brokaw had come over to report as well.  And I was going to bring my story on the air that evening, and they had me come and sit on the set with Tom to report my story.  And I remember somebody saying, "Wow.  I saw you sitting there with Tom Brokaw, and I said, 'She's not that little reporter anymore'."  So I--Tom was a tremendous role model.  He was a wonderful person.  Was--I say was as if he's dead; he's still around.  But I you know don't work with him anymore.  But Tom was a great leader, and he was approachable, and just a real professional.  I just found him to be encouraging and a really, really lovely person.
Story_ID: 632859
Speaker 1: So after you did that, what were you looking in terms of where you wanted to be?  I mean, what, what did you have your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --eyes, eye set on?
Speaker 2: Well I always wanted to report on a magazine show.  And '60 Minutes' at that point was like the preeminent magazine show.  So I think I saw the work that I was doing at that time as a step in the direction of trying to do something like that.  So I saw myself now on the road to bigger network stories, maybe even magazine reporting.  Because at that time, the cache surrounding magazine programs was just amazing.  You know, at that point we brought in huge ratings, and these were, these were the, you know, the big shows.  That's what y- that was the, that was the spot,  the hot spot if you wanted to, you know, find something on network television that was exclusive and, and great.  So I felt like I was sort of on my way to that.  And then, just to jump forward a little bit, I was at NBC for five years, and I, at one point I got a call from Barbara Walters to join '20/20.'  And that was, that was monumental for me, too, because that was, you know, the second biggest magazine program at that time.  And when Barbara Walters called and said, "We were thinking that it would be great to have you join our program," I was like, oh my gosh.  I mean, it was like the realization of a dream, and this is something that I had seen for myself back in college [Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, Athens, Georgia].  So it was pretty amazing.
Speaker 1: But before that, you had done 'Dateline' ['Dateline NBC'].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You had been a correspondent--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for 'Dateline,' so--
Speaker 2: And that was, and that was great because it was a new and up and coming magazine show, but there was nothing like '20/20' and '60 Minutes' at that point.
Speaker 1: So when she called you--well, how did she go about things like that, did she get to know you first?
Speaker 2: N- no.  I think she just, well, who knows.  I don't even--I can't even speak, but maybe someone told her or they decided before that this might be good.  But, I think they thought a call from Barbara Walters would certainly be impressive, and it was.  And then I met with a couple of executives here at ABC after that.  And, of course, I mean, you know, there was no question in my mind that this would probably be a good move, and we did.
Story_ID: 632860
Speaker 1: I get off the plane and it had to be, gosh, almost like a twenty-four hour trip, changing planes, and I don't remember where now.  And I remember arriving into Kuwait to the bureau that was set up there for NBC, and just being dog-tired, so dog-tired that I was practically hallucinating.  But I was so hungry for a story.  But I mean, first of all I had made it there, I had made it safely and so forth, and I just wanted to go to work.  I wanted to go do a story right away.  And I remember the field producer, or senior producer at that time said to me, "No, no, no, no, no.  First of all, you're going to go to bed."  And then she started dividing us into crews of, you know, "This correspondent and this person will work in the morning, and then you and So and So will be assigned to go and do some things in the evening.  And Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Roberts], you need to go to bed, and then you'll come--."  I said I have to go to bed, but I just got here, I mean I want to go cover this, this impending war [Persian Gulf War].  (Laughter) And I remember going to bed and I was hallucinating I was so exhausted.  And, but the next morning I woke up and I was just ready, and I was raring to go.  And I was just wanted to go cover a story.  And they assigned me a producer.  And at that point, this conflict--because it never escalated into a war, if you remember.  There was sort of this line in the sand that was drawn, and Saddam Hussein and his folks rolled out of Kuwait, and--.  Actually I was in Saudi Arabia, I'm sorry.  I arrived into Saudi Arabia which is where our base of operations were, and--in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  And so, I stayed at this hotel, a very nice hotel and so forth.  And then I got my marching orders to go to Kuwait a couple of days later.  And I was so excited because I was finally going to go out and actually really cover a story.  And, it was just this long arduous ride, you know, these roads had been, like, bombed and, you know, rutted and so forth, and there were camels along the way that we would see, and the Bedouin people in their tents.  I mean it was just something that was really quite amazing.  And I saw abandoned tanks also along the way, and that's when I started to really realize that this was a war zone, and I was starting to get sort of nervous about it.  And it was, there were several hours that we traveled before we finally actually made it into Kuwait.  And we were just sort of, we were on our own to just sort of make up some story, go find some stories.  And at that point we thought that we would probably go in to see where our troops were--what life was like for our troops.  And that was going to be my assignment at that moment.  And we had a little ragtag NBC crew that had set up in this bombed-out hotel.  There was no electricity, there was no running water, you know, windows had been shot out and so forth.  But it still, sort of, was held together as a hotel, you know, had some rooms that at this point some of the domestic workers who used to work in there they had recruited to come back to clean some of the rooms.  So there was like a clean bed at least; no electricity, but a bed.  So I had a room that was assigned to me.
Story_ID: 632861
Speaker 1: And, you know, it was sort of old-fashioned reporting where we would grab a pad and a pen and just go out combing the countryside, looking for stories.  Obviously communication was sort of compromised because of what had happened in this country [Kuwait].  Also too, this was 1991, so this was before you know satellite phones and all these things were just so readily available.  We did have some satellite phones there, but we couldn't take them out with us.  So, I remember, after arriving, running out, going out in a Jeep with a driver; you had to have somebody to accompany you.  And, and going to a hospital for instance, to see what had happened to the hospitals, and what about the children who were at these hospitals.  And I did a story [for NBC News] about the doctors who didn't have supplies and what was going to happen to the people who were dependent on them.  And that story made it back and made it on the air.  Now I didn't have a sense of that because I'm there in this country, but I was hearing from other people that they were well received.  And then I started hearing stories about little landmines that were scattered out around the countryside.  And there was a story about a reporter who had lost a finger, somebody who had lost a foot--a toe.  And then, sort of the gravity of the whole thing hit me.  There was this black acrid smoke that was hanging over the place because a lot of these oil wells had been set on fire.  And during the day, sometimes it actually looked like it was dusk because it was just smoky and, and sort of filthy.  And I began to worry, too, a little bit about what I was breathing.  So there was like this, this underlying, low grade fear in me at all times, you know, traveling around this bombed out countryside, trying to do these stories.  But also, this excitement as a reporter, that I'm over here, you know, covering this amazing assignment.  And I remember calling my sister once because we had satellite phone and we could use it from time to time, and I called my sister in Miami [Florida], Janet [Janet Davis].  And she was just so excited to hear from me, and she was so nervous.  And, I mean, I can kind of feel it now.  I remember just feeling, like, almost in tears because I'm talking to my family and I've, you know, been there for probably more than a week at this point.  And she was happy to know that I was okay, and she'd seen one of my reports, and so forth.  So it was a brief conversation, but it was just a chance to check in with family.
Speaker 2: Can I ask a question?  What--how--had they prepared you about the more- the mores of the Middle East and what, what to do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not much.
Speaker 2: They just--
Speaker 1: I mean I was aware, you know, that obviously that women were subjugated and, and, you know, there was a very patriarchal society.
Speaker 2: But even how to dress or not dress?
Speaker 1: No, no.  And Kuwait was a very modernized country, so we didn't have to wear the headscarves and things like that.  We certainly saw the women in the hijabs and, you know, and the black flowing dresses.  But we, as Western correspondents, didn't have to wear them.  But I heard some of the producers and correspondents talking about Saudi Arabia and the hypocrisy, and the men who, you know, went to prayer and, you know, and gave these outward appearances, but yet they had alcohol, you know, flowing freely in the bars, and things like this.  So I heard my colleagues talking about, you know, this, this culture and how different it was and how hypocritical it was.  And women in particular, my women colleagues were really quite insulted and taken aback by, by what they saw.
Story_ID: 632862
Speaker 1: I remember going to do a report in a zoo.  I mean, you--we were just trying to find anything that was sort of either human interest--.  Because at this point, the conflict was over but it was sort of the aftermath.  Everybody was coming back into Kuwait.  The royal family had fled, now they had come back.  So I actually went to a news conference to talk to the emir [Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah]--not just alone, but a news conference with other correspondents to talk to the emir of Kuwait to find out to find out what was going to you know happen going forward.  When we were driving along at one point, we see this zoo and we pitched a story back to New York [New York] about what happens in a case like this where animals, you know, were left to fend for themselves.  Maybe we'll go in and talk to the zookeeper.  And it was a very touching story about these one or two men who stayed behind, even in the middle of, you know, this terrifying experience, to take care of animals, and what had happened, and some of the animals had either starved to death or dehydrated--or died of dehydration.  And so we did that story, and again, it aired on 'The Today Show' ['Today'], and we heard it was very well received.  So, on the one hand I was fearful, but on the other hand it was just exhilarating, you know, riding around this foreign country and picking up, you know, just amazing stories about a culture that I knew so little about.  I remember also going out to go do a story--I was assigned a story.  Some of these stories I was trying to discover on my own; some of them would come through the desk.  And one of the stories that I was assigned, and it was with a very senior correspondent, who--one of the stories that I was assigned with a very senior producer who worked with Tom Brokaw a lot, and that was actually exciting for me because I'm working with one of Tom Brokaw's producers.  But this was a story to go talk about the troops, and to go out and, and find some of the, the troops who were out in the foxholes, and to just see what their existence is like; how homesick were they; when, when did they expect to go home.  And that was a pretty amazing assignment too.
Speaker 2: So how many assignments did you do during a course of those three or four weeks?  I mean how many are you doing--?
Speaker 1: It's hard to keep count because sometimes, you know, maybe I'd file a report, and it may or may not get picked up, and then maybe there was one that did.  So, I don't know, maybe half a dozen, a dozen?  You know, certainly, I wouldn't get one every day.  You might go out and you look around, or you'd have to try to find times to interview people, or maybe they were too nervous to do the interview, and you'd have to come back and talk to them again.  There was one family in which I interviewed a man who had left his home and maybe he was a prominent minister in the government and was run out of the country.  And he was telling me how much weight he had lost because he'd been gone away from home for a long time, and, but at the same time, the women in the household were in the back, and it was obvious to me that they weren't allowed to come into the front room when he was talking to me.  So I was so aware of the cultural difference here.  I didn't know much about this particular region of the world, but I was certainly learning a little bit more about it.
Speaker 2: Did people react to you differently because you were black?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, interestingly, people reacted warmly to me because I was a person of color.  I had drivers sometimes ask me if I was Kuwaiti, if I was Saudi, if I was African.  But I certainly felt an acceptance.  I didn't feel like such a foreigner because I had brown skin.  And actually that was sort of comforting.  I felt that, maybe--in spite of the fact that I as a woman in this region that was not very open to women--I felt that maybe I was getting a little better, and perhaps accepted a little better because I was a person of color.  So it was actually to my advantage I felt.
Speaker 2: Now, when you--I just want to understand structure.
Speaker 1: Oh, and I have to tell you one more story too.  I remember when--so we're staying in this hotel, this bombed out hotel, and finally I'm sort of growing accustomed to this unease that we're all feeling; we're a little nervous because we're in this area that's been the scene of almost a war [Persian Gulf War], and there're landmines scattered about, and we're all kind of scared about our situation.  But I was finally starting to relax and feel a little better about this.  We would go to bed, you know, whatever time we would go to bed because the time difference and we had to feed our stories.  But we would go to bed, you know, really late, and it was pitch black because there were no streetlights or anything like that, so when you go to your room--and we had candles, or even a flashlight, maybe somebody had a flashlight.  So I'd go to my room, and you had to take a cold shower; so I would take a shower like every two or three days because I couldn't bear the cold water.  So this one night I was finally going to get a great night's sleep because maybe I had filed my report early, and I went to bed and I was so exhausted and so excited to go to sleep.  So I go to sleep in my bed, and I hear this (makes sounds) banging on the door, and I woke up and I was terrified.  And I had a lock as such as it was on the door, and this guy broke through the door and my heart was in my throat, and I was terrified.  Well, anyway, he was a producer or someone who had actually stayed in the hotel, like, two weeks before, and this was his room.  But because there was no order in this hotel at all, he thought this was his room and who had broken into his room and so forth.  And it scared the living daylights out of me, and we sort of worked it all out, and he went on down the hallway.  But I will never forget (laughter).  Just, again, it was a sense of just how shattered the infrastructure was in this city, and just how, how frightening really it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you also proved that you could, you know, if thrown into a different situation--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you could function within that situation.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  And that's what I felt I think when I came back home.  I felt stronger, I felt more alive, I felt more accomplished because I had been thrown into this very difficult situation, and yeah--and proved that I could not only survive, but thrive.  And I got a lot of, a lot of great feedback when I came back home.
Story_ID: 632863
Speaker 1: Can you explain to me the structure of the sta- the station structure?  Like, you have the news bureau chief, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then what, what is--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, first of all, for all the networks, New York [New York] is the center, that's the heartbeat.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  No, I know--okay.
Speaker 2: So then you've got, you know, the head of news, the president of news, and you've got, you know, all of the executive staff.  And then you've got executive producers of these programs.  In these bureaus, you've got the bureau chief.  You've got possibly a senior producer.   You've got field producers; those are the people who go out and travel with folks like me and do these stories.  So you've got like a--you've got sort of a hierarchy.  You've got correspondents; you've got field producers; you've got senior producers who more, are more management maybe who came off the road and who are s- now may be stationed in New York.  And then you've got people over them who are executive producers.  And then you go onto the more executive levels from there.  And a lot of these people have worked their way up over time.
Story_ID: 632864
Speaker 1: I am here with Neculai Burghelea, who's our videographer.  I'm [HistoryMaker] Tonya Lewis Lee, and Deborah, would you say your name?
Speaker 2: (Gesture) [HistoryMaker] Deborah Roberts, D-E-B-O-R-A-H, Roberts.
Speaker 1: And what's the date, please?
Speaker 2: That's a good question (laughter).  February--it's Wednesday, February 26th, nine- 2008.
Speaker 1: And we are where?
Speaker 2: We are at ABC studios [New York, New York], my office of '20/20,' which is where I work.
Speaker 1: Great.
Story_ID: 632865
Speaker 1: So, we're picking up an old interview, and in that interview you were saying that in Perry, Georgia it was very nurturing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At your high school you had great teachers that really kind of looked out for you.  It sounded like you had friends from all walks of life.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then you go to the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia], which seemed like it was a little different, in that--and tell me that.
Speaker 2: A lot different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I came from a small town environment.  My high school maybe had a population of three hundred kids total.  So, I really grew up in a fairly small, nurturing environment, and then I go to the University of Georgia, twenty thousand students, mostly white, a very traditional southern kind of atmosphere, good old boy atmosphere almost.  And while I was very optimistic, and I had these great idealistic views about the world and unity, and everything will be great, and blacks and whites, and I had been treated in a certain way at Perry High School [Perry, Georgia] as a leader and somebody who was on her way.  Suddenly at the University of Georgia, I meet this vast ocean of students from all walks of life, but a lot of them are accomplished, they're either from some affluent homes, some good old boy farming communities, but certainly not necessarily the most nurturing environment.  I wouldn't say that I walked into a racist environment because I'm not sure that I really felt that.  But I do think that I walked into a much cooler, distant environment with what felt like tension that might have stemmed from racism.  Some of these students probably came from schools where they had never really mingled with blacks before.  So, suddenly I felt just out of my element.
Speaker 1: And did the--
Speaker 2: I felt like a fish out of water.
Speaker 1: Did the black and white kids socialize together?
Speaker 2: Not much at all.
Speaker 1: Not much, okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I felt like there was a decision to meet--I felt like there was a decision to be made.  While at Perry High School, I mingled freely with blacks and whites, and I was on the cheerleading squad, and I had good white friends and, you know, we hung out together.  Suddenly I felt like almost we were thrown back in 1965.  White students sort of went their way.  There were white sororities and fraternities; black students had the black fraternities and sororities.  And to be honest with you, I was really shocked because I thought that larger world was more inviting, and this is where I was going to make my mark.  And even though I had heard people say to me, other adults that, "It's a different world out there; people aren't as colorblind, Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Roberts], as you would like to think they are."  Suddenly I realized that was true, and I was really shocked.
Speaker 1: So did you pledge a sorority?
Speaker 2: I didn't pledge a sorority.  And I think I just--I didn't like this whole notion.  I didn't like this sort of de facto segregation, and it sort of did exist.  While we went to classes freely with white students, and there were friends that I made, socially it was very clear that blacks students went to black dances, black clubs, had their black fraternities and sororities, and white students had theirs.  And I didn't necessarily feel comfortable just going off to the black environment.  I mean if anything I had been labeled an Oreo when I was in high school.  Black students saw me as identifying more with the activities of the white students.  Suddenly, I didn't really feel like I fit into this world with the black students of like, the steps that they, you know, the stepping shows they would do.  See, I don't even know what they're called.  The step shows that they would do for the fraternities and sororities.  I sort of didn't really want to do that.  I didn't want to own that.  I didn't want just be with the black students or the Black Student Union [Black Affairs Council].  And I remember some of the black students would come up to me occasionally and ask, you know, who I was; where I was from; "How come we don't see you at the black events?"  Almost like I was this outsider.  They had no idea often who I was.  And I think I decided, I'm going to walk a different road.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm not going to do this.  Now clearly, I wasn't welcomed in the white sororities.  It was pretty apparent after a while that they did not integrate, and maybe slowly there was some talk of a Jewish girl in a, you know, non-Jewish sorority, but certainly not black students.
Speaker 1: Would you say that you hung out with people in the journalism school [Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, Athens, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) I hung out with people in the journalism school, and I sort of formed my own little social group.  And also, on my hall, I met a number of kids on my hall whom I identified with, probably a fair amount of them black as--probably a fair amount of them white as I look back on it.  Some black students too.  But again, those black students were off and on their way to the social environments of the black students at night.  So I didn't really hang out with those kids.  And I would do things, you know, such as go to movies or just whatever, just hang out in our rooms and watch TV and pop popcorn.  And a lot of my friends turned out to be white.
Story_ID: 632866
Speaker 1: Your professors at--there, would you say by and large they were really very supportive of you?  Was there one in particular you can think of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say my professors by and large were supportive, but it certainly wasn't the same feeling that I had had in high school [Perry High School, Perry, Georgia].  And some of that, I think, is just culture shock that you experience anyway in going to college versus high school.  Once I hit the journalism school [Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, Athens, Georgia], and that was clearly my area of interest, I certainly did have some professors who left an impact on me.  This one Dr. Hough [George A. Hough, III], who was a writing teacher who was really, and really encouraged us all and made us feel like if you really work hard and you do your--what you need to do, and you are driven, and you're aggressive, and you're assertive, you will make it in this business.  So I really liked him because he was challenging, but yet he was very hopeful about this career that I didn't know much about.  And then I had other professors too, clearly all white, mostly white males, who were supportive.  Were they extraordinary?  No.  But I remember the names of a few of them?
Speaker 1: Did they ever tell you that maybe this isn't the path for you or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --maybe you could not--
Speaker 2: No.  I never heard that.  In spite of the fact that this is a southern school [University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia], and there certainly was a bit of a good old boy feeling, I never had anybody suggest that I couldn't make.  In fact, if anything, toward the end of my junior year, it was very clear to a lot of my professors that I was sort of (air quotes) distinctive.  I was sort of a different black girl.  I spoke a little differently; I carried myself a little differently, whatever that means.  And I think if anything, they thought maybe I had a shot at making it in this business.  And I had this one professor who was also an advisor of mine who sort of took me under his wing, a very classic southern guy with a big belly, a big beer belly, red cheeks, probably drank too much off campus named Bill Martin [ph.], and he was really a very good old boy, but he really liked me.  And he placed me in my first internship at WMAZ-TV in Macon, Georgia, and then right after that, helped me get my first job out of college [at WTVM-TV, Columbus, Georgia].  And he really believed in me.  But it was funny because he really had that southern drawl, and he was a good old boy, and I'm sure, probably if in a different environment, he might have been a different guy.  But he was actually very supportive of me and very, very nice.
Speaker 1: Great.
Story_ID: 632867
Speaker 1: So now I'm going to fast forward a little bit because we- I think we covered the Tennessee [WBIR-TV, Knoxville, Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and your time in Orlando [WFTV-TV, Orlando, Florida]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I'm going to take us up to New York [New York] now from there.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And I know that--okay.  So you were at--you came to NBC in 1990, is that right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety [1990].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, again now, who hired you?  It was Elena Nachmanoff, right?
Speaker 2: Elena Nachmanoff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Great.  And so, now, while you're at NBC, did you have someone who was sort of your mentor here--well, there, at NBC?
Speaker 2: There was a vice president by the name of Don Browne, who effectively hired me.  Elena Nachmanoff was a vice president for talent and she found me.  But Don Browne had made it his mission to try to diversify the network a little bit; to find younger and probably cheaper talent.  So they wanted--he wanted to plumb the depths of local news to find some promising young reporters.  And I remember coming to New York with Ann Curry.  We became good friends, and we were officemates.  And Ann ha- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you and Ann came at the same time?
Speaker 2: At the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ann came in from KCBS [KCBS-TV] out in Los Angeles [California], and I came in from Orlando, Florida.  And for me, oh my gosh.  I've made it, this is so exciting, oh, network television.  I had stars in my eyes.  But, to the establishment, the veteran reporters and correspondents who had been there for a long time, they looked at us like we'd fallen off the turnip truck.  Like, who are these like neophytes being brought into NBC News (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So were you the only two new people who started--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --at the time you did?
Speaker 2: There were, there were probably two or three others.  There was a man by the name of Brad Willis, who was also hired from the local market, and a little bit more of an O & O [owned and operated] experience.  And one more person, I don't remember whom.  Maybe Michelle Gilman [ph.] down in Miami, Florida had been--no, well, she'd been there when we were there, but she was fairly new.  But we were Don Browne's hires.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Don Browne was fiercely protective of his people.  He was l- nervous, and he was tense because I think he was taking a chance by hiring these young upstarts.  Because traditionally, the network always plucked up and coming reporters from an owned and operated station.  So, these people were more polished, they had a little bit more of a network feel about them.  Maybe they had even reported a little here and there for the network on a weekend basis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And here we were these brand new reporters.  And me from Orlando, Florida; I mean, I think people thought, give me a break.  She'll last maybe a year.  And of course, that stigma that is often attached to young black reporters, she probably can't write very well.  She probably doesn't really know that much about what she's doing.  And I was petrified because I felt that too.  And I thought, I'm in over my head.  I mean, will people really give me a chance?  And it's a very difficult world to enter into.  I thought the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] was tough.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This was, oh my gosh, beyond.  I was absolutely terrified.
Speaker 1: And--okay.  So, who were the black reporters at NBC at the time?
Speaker 2: That's a very good question.  Noah Nelson was a black correspondent in Miami.  He had a very distinctive voice, and he was a very good writer--
Speaker 1: But I mean, I mean in New York.
Speaker 2: --oh, in New York.
Speaker 1: In the State of New York.
Speaker 2: Gosh.
Speaker 1: Was Bryant Gumbel there?
Speaker 2: Bryant Gumbel was the- Bryant Gumbel was there, and I went to Bryant once to talk to him and he was very, very lovely and very encouraging.  I wanted to sort of get a feel for him, have him get a feel for me, get some advice.  He was really nice.  But Bryant was in a different category.  I mean he was a superstar.  He had distinguished himself in sports; he was just this god of 'The Today Show' ['Today'] because everybody just knew he was brilliant and amazing.  So while he was very encouraging I certainly in no way put myself in his category (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he's at 'The Today Show.'
Speaker 2: (Nods head) He was at 'The Today Show.'
Speaker 1: And who was his co-host then?
Speaker 2: Jane Pauley.
Speaker 1: Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel.  And who was reading the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Deborah Norville was on her way in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That whole debacle was happening at 'The Today Show.'
Speaker 1: Was she reading the news?
Speaker 2: Deborah was, but sh- remember she eventually took over for Jane.  Jane was leaving.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, this was happening around that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  As you're coming in--
Speaker 2: As I'm coming in--
Speaker 1: --there's a little upheaval going on.
Speaker 2: --there's a little upheaval going at 'The Today Show.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 632868
Speaker 1: But, you know, I found some res- I found some positive response.  I was being used a little bit on an early show called 'NBC News at Sunrise.'  They were giving me opportunities to anchor a little bit.  Don Browne was making it a point to put his people out there to see how we could do.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I was given some opportunities--
Speaker 2: And was the idea (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but I just didn't feel like I was there.
Speaker 2: Right.  But the idea was that you were going to really do the national--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --news?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And what--and what was--what were you--what was your position going to be?
Speaker 1: Don had a new philosophy.  Many times people were hired by the network, and minorities in particular.  And he was really trying to give minorities a shot.  So myself; Ann Curry, who's part Japanese; and, oh, I don't know, someone else.  There was a white man who was hired, who certainly didn't fall into that category, but someone else.  But he really wanted to try and give his minorities a better shot at success, because often people were brought into this world, no one nurtured or took them under their wing at all; they were sort of made to sink or swim, and often people would leave within a certain amount of time.  Cassandra Clayton was also there, and she was this very accomplished black reporter.  But Cassandra had either just had a baby, or perhaps was pregnant, and was trying to work out a new deal to work part-time, and that wasn't working, so she was about to leave.  So I would be I believe the lone black reporter in New York [New York].  And--I'm sort of jumping around, but--
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: --to make sure that we would have a chance, Don wanted us to stay in New York for a period of time, six months maybe, to sort of learn the ropes, and to get on the air a little bit, get a little confidence, and to just sort of get a sense of how this whole network thing works.  As opposed to just hiring us and sending us to out to far-flung bureaus and having us sink or swim that way, and perhaps get discouraged, and once again, losing yet another minority reporter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He had a different approach.  So that was what we were made to do: to stay in New York for a few months, and then eventually they would give us a bureau assignment.
Speaker 2: And you were saying that when you went to Kuwait, is that when things sort of really opened for you?
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had been at the network less than a year, and I just could not get any traction.  I had done a few reports here or there, but I certainly was not in the normal rotation.  I would pitch story ideas.  I mean, if I look back on them, they probably weren't the strongest ideas necessarily or they weren't in the news at the news at the moment.  I didn't realize how this machine worked.  But I would get, you know, sort of "There, there, dear," you know, little pats on my head, sometimes from people who maybe meant well but recognized that I wasn't ready for prime time.  So, I wasn't really getting on the air that much with the exception of now and again if something fell into my lap (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry to interrupt you.  But how old are you at this time?
Speaker 1: I was twenty-nine.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I was pretty young, and I was--it was a big accomplishment for me to be working at the network at twenty-nine.  But at the same time, I wasn't really completely prepared, I don't think, for it.
Story_ID: 632869
Speaker 1: So, recognizing that I just was not getting on the air, I think at a certain point--let me just make sure I get this straight--I was sent to the Miami bureau [Miami, Florida] to work.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I was doing the normal reporting that one would do, but now and again I got an assignment, sometimes I didn't or there was a possibility of an assignment I was going to get but I didn't.  And it really is sort of a dog eat dog world at the network in terms of trying to get your pieces on the air.  There's only twenty-two, now probably twenty minutes of news every night and everybody's fighting to get those stories.  So, recognizing that that was so difficult, once the Per- the Persian Gulf War was breaking out, I knew that they were asking around, and reporters were sometimes volunteering to go over there.  It almost felt like the draft where there was some talk about who was going to go report and because there was this fear about chemical weapons and a whole different kind of war, there was also talk that some reporters didn't want to go.  Many of them had families who were worried about this kind of a conflict versus, you know, Vietnam [Vietnam War] and earlier conflicts that had happened.  And I thought maybe there was an opening here.  Maybe I should just raise my hand and see what happens.  I didn't really think they would choose me.  But I did, I volunteered, I said I really wanted to do it, and I was shocked when I got a call from one of the vice presidents saying, "We'd like to send you to the Persian Gulf conflict."
Speaker 2: So, now after you covered that--I'm not, I'm not skip- I know we covered it a little bit in the other interview (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.  After we had been going and going, oh, that kind of detail.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: So I'm not to go back there, but when you come, now you come back.  And so, what happens after that?  Are you--
Speaker 1: It was an amazing feeling when I came back, because I had earned my stripes a bit over there.  People had a chance to see what I was made of.  I was in a very, very stressful environment, and yet reporting and doing some really good reporting on the air with the help of a very good producer also who had covered other stories like this, who was able to help guide me a little bit.  But I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you work with that producer exclusively?
Speaker 1: I would say a good bit, maybe not exclusively, but a good bit.  His name was--oh, gosh, Charlie [ph.]-something, I'm going blank.  I'll think of it.
Speaker 2: And were you allowed to pick the producer you wanted to work with?
Speaker 1: Not at that time, but when I came back--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I felt that I had some choices.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Clearly they were--the seniors in charge were trying to equip me with some experienced, seasoned--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --producers when I was over.  But they really only sent experienced, seasoned producers.  So I had an opportunity to work with some of the best people that NBC had.  And they had a chance to see that, not only did I have some real possibilities, but that I had chops, and I had chutzpah, and that I was hanging in there, and I was going to do it.

Speaker 1: So when I came back [from reporting on the Persian Gulf War in Kuwait], suddenly I was like a different person.  I mean they looked at me differently.  I would say a lot of the executives thought of me as a real, seasoned network reporter, so my assignments definitely changed.  They were stronger and better and suddenly fairly plentiful.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And was this--and this was now on the network [NBC] or--
Speaker 1: (Nods head) This was at the network.
Speaker 2: --in the bureau [Miami, Florida].  This was--now you were on air at the network?
Speaker 1: I was still--I mean I'm still at the network.  Even when you're in the bureau--
Speaker 2: Right, right--
Speaker 1: --you're just where the--
Speaker 2: --I know what you mean.  Right.  But--
Speaker 1: I was still in one of the--
Speaker 2: What were you doing?  What were you doing?  Were you doing national news?
Speaker 1: I was doing national news.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: For instance, we were doing a series of reports on the evening news ['NBC Nightly News'] about families and middle-class America.  Well, I was one of the correspondents that they wanted to do--
Speaker 2: And Tom Brokaw was the anchor?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was one of the correspondents--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that they wanted to use for Middle America--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, what makes Middle America tick.  So with this producer, they sent me out to the Midwest to go do a story on this one family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, that was just given to me--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as an assignment because they wanted me on the air.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was a really interesting time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And were you doing 'Dateline' ['Dateline NBC'] at the same time?
Speaker 1: N-
Speaker 2: Not yet.
Speaker 1: Not yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not yet.
Speaker 2: How long before--how long were you at NBC before you went to 'Dateline' would you say?
Speaker 1: Not very long.  I mean, things started to accelerate pretty quickly.  I joined the network in '90 [1990], I went to cover the war [Persian Gulf War] maybe a year later, and then 'Dateline' was about to start up shortly after that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So then my name was--
Speaker 2: So it was brand new show?
Speaker 1: It was a brand new show.  It was a magazine show, and anybody who was in the network at the time knew that the magazine show was sort of like the primo job.  Working and running and gunning for the evening news and for the morning show ['Today'] was fine, but if you were a correspondent on a magazine show, that was great prestige.
Speaker 2: I see.  Now, so, '60 Minutes' was going on?
Speaker 1: '60 Minutes' was going on, and so was '20/20.'
Speaker 2: So '20/20' was--
Speaker 1: Both--
Speaker 2: --so 'Dateline' was the last one to come on board?
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  '60 Minutes' was going on and that was to me the pinnacle.  And '20/20' also had been on the air for many, many years, too, and both of those were highly respected, amazing magazine shows.  And I always thought, if I could just work on a magazine show, like a '60 Minutes' or like a '20/20,' wow, then I would have really made it as a network correspondent.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So when 'Dateline' was launched and I was interviewed to be a possible correspondent on 'Dateline,' it was, my gosh, it was just a dream come true.
Story_ID: 632871
Speaker 1: During this time, Al [Al Roker] is at 'The Today Show' ['Today']?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, now how did you and Al meet (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a funny story.  Al was a weather guy on a local O & O [owned and operated], Channel 4 [WNBC-TV] in New York [New York], but he would substitute on 'The Today Show' now and again for Willard Scott.  So I knew who he was; I knew his face, this rotund weather guy who was really funny.  And I got some fill-in work on 'The Today Show' as a news anchor.
Speaker 1: So Al is primarily on the New York--
Speaker 2: He was.  He wa- that was his assignment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was not assigned--
Speaker 1: --doing national work--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is that, is that sort of how, how does that--?
Speaker 2: You know it's interesting because I came to the network [NBC] as this correspondent, and, I mean, I recognize the prestige of it, and people do look at it differently than they do a reporter for a local station, even if it is a Channel 4, which is an NBC O & O.  Al was this weather personality who appeared on 'The Today Show' from time to time.  But unbeknownst to me, he would see me on the air and notice this new black reporter on the air who in his mind was sharp and seemed to be going places.  So we were aware of each other, but we didn't know each other.  And one day, we both filled in on 'The Today Show' together.  I filled in on the news desk for Deborah Norville, who was filling in on the show side with Bryant [Bryant Gumbel], and Al was filling in for Willard.  And we got talking, and now he was r- and I was still relatively new.
Speaker 1: What year was this (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know what, Tonya [HistoryMaker Tonya Lewis Lee], let me back up.  Let me back because I think this was my first year, actually.  This might have even been before the war [Persian Gulf War].  This was before the war.  I had only been at the network a few months, probably less than a year.
Speaker 1: And you were on 'The Today Show.'  Wow, Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Roberts].
Speaker 2: And I filled in for 'The Today Show,' and Al--because--and the reason I remember it is because I still felt pretty vulnerable.  I was excited about this opportunity to fill in on network news, on the venerable 'Today Show.'  But I was scared.  And Al came over to me and we started chatting a little bit, and it was my birthday.  And I remember feeling a little bit sad.  I mean, here I am in this new place at this new job, and I'm excited but I feel vulnerable because nobody knows it's my birthday.  And Al says, "You know, somebody should take you out to lunch."  And I said, "Well, that's awfully nice."  And he goes, "Well, I can't do it today, but how about tomorrow?  I'll take you out to lunch," which was very, very nice.  And he did take me out to lunch, and it was really, really sweet, and I thought, oh my gosh, some of these network-like people are actually very nice.  So--one thing was very interesting, that when we were crossing the street at one point, he sort of grabbed my hand to cross the street, it was very sweet.  And I thought, wow, he's very doting.  And I didn't think much of it other than that.  But he was a very, very friendly guy, and he just made me feel really warm and comforted, and--he just made me feel very comfortable (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, did you know a lot of people in the city at the time?  Had you made friends?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: So he was he one of your new friends?
Speaker 2: Ann Curry was the only other person I knew, and she was brand new, too, from Los Angeles [California], and she's finding her way.  And Ann was a newlywed.  She and her husband [Brian Ross] were now on the same coast, but they had been married and have had this bicoastal marriage.  Now finally she was on the East Coast, and he was down in Maryland.  So, she was making it her point to try to see her husband on a regular basis.  We were friendly, but she was married.
Story_ID: 632872
Speaker 1: And I was beginning to make a few friends at the network [NBC], but one of the things I was learning very quickly is that it was very difficult to, to see who your friends were because it was a very aggressive, fast-paced environment.  And it was kind of different from what I had been used to in local news (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You, you were in the shark tank (laughter).
Speaker 1: I was in the shark tank.  I definitely was.
Speaker 2: So there weren't many friends to be had at work in a way.
Speaker 1: There were people who were friendly, but there were people who were also very tough, they had e- an edge to them, and life was what it was in this fast lane of network television, and that was what really mattered to them.  And, beyond that, there was not a lot of time--maybe if they did socialize, they socialized in a different way.  I mean, you got to remember, I'm--even though I had worked in Orlando [at WFTV-TV, Orlando, Florida], now recently, I'm still a small town girl (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was going to ask you about that.  You're a small town girl--
Speaker 1: I'm still a small town girl.
Speaker 2: --from Perry, Georgia in New York City [New York, New York] at the network news.
Speaker 1: And prior to that, I had always worked in environments where people were for the most part supportive, they weren't that aggressive or competitive outside of work.  Even the reporters, you know, for me when I worked in Tennessee [at WBIR-TV, Knoxville, Tennessee], and when I worked in Orlando, we became really good friends outside of work.  They weren't that competitive.  Here, people were fiercely competitive, other correspondents weren't necessarily interested in being your friend; they saw you as the enemy in a way because you're trying to get a report on the air, they're trying to get a report on the air, they want an edge over you.  They like you okay, but we're not mixing and mingling all that much; at least that was the way I felt about it when I first stepped in.  So I didn't have a lot of friend (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then Al [Al Roker] comes along.
Speaker 1: And then Al comes along, and he is absolutely friendly, and he was just so interested, it seemed, in me and my career, and proud of me in a way that almost felt small town, even though he was from Queens, New York.
Speaker 2: Now, tell the truth, did you think of it as romantic or as just mentoring kind of?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head) I thought of it as mentoring, really.  And truthfully, and Al and I have said this before, we've joked, I mean, he did not look like my type physically.  You know, he's this big guy, you know, sort of this teddy bear of a weather guy, and he just didn't look like physically my type, or I don't know, just in other ways he didn't.  But he was a really lovely guy, and I thought he could be a friend, and he would listen to my gripes and my complaints, and you know, my vents about work.  And he would give me a little advice here or there, and he just felt like a mentor; somebody who had tested these waters a little bit.  While he wasn't officially an NBC person, he was an NBC O & O [owned and operated] guy, he got it.  And he gave me a little bit of direction here and there in how I dealt with people, and how I should deal with myself, and how I needed to develop a thick skin, and I needed to recognize that work's work, and that it was very competitive but, so what.  And that it's not all about you necessarily, it may be about that person.  And he just really--he sort of helped grow up a little bit.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  So, now, when did you guys start officially dating?  Were you still at NBC when you started dating?
Speaker 1: We were at NBC.  Al was married [to Alice Bell]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --at that time, and that was another reason why I didn't really think about it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in any way other than Al is a mentor.  If he was interested in me, he will have to answer that question for you.  And he has said before he probably had like a little bit of a crush on me.  But I didn't look at it that way.  And after a while though, and he did tell me that he was separating.  I had moved on to Atlanta [Georgia] to the bureau.  So, at that point, I had moved on to other experiences; I had covered the Persian Gulf War.  Al and I knew each other and we would email each other from time to time.  But that was about it.
Speaker 2: Now, when you're--just, I have a question, when you're in a bureau, like, in the Atlanta bureau, do you come back to New York often?
Speaker 1: Occasionally, not often.
Story_ID: 632873
Speaker 1: I want to talk about what you were just saying though about, about being on air early on in your career, and what that's, that was like.  I mean did you have moments that didn't go so--obviously, obviously, we all know you had moments that went well.
Speaker 2: We all, we all did.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: I mean I remember I might have even been over at the Persian Gulf.  I can't remember if I was stateside in covering this or over in Kuwait, but I was talking about Norman Schwarzkopf [Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.], the [U.S.] Army general who was in charge of troops over there, and I called him, "Arnold Norman Schwarzenegger, Arnold Schwarzkopf.  Schwar- is it Schwarzkopf or is it Schwarzenegger?"  And somebody says in my ear, "Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Roberts], you're on live."  And I went, "Norman Schwarzkopf."  And, oh, it was--oh my gosh.  I will never forget it.  I can't believe I can still vividly remember.  It was so embarrassing.  And I thought, okay, my career is over.
Speaker 1: Right.  So how, how--why, why wasn't it?  What happened?  What--did anyone say anything to you about it?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: No one said a word?
Speaker 2: --I thi- I think, you know what?  I think we just all had these meltdowns every now and again, and while it felt fatal to me, it probably and fortunately, I think it was on like at six in the morning (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --as opposed to 7:30 A.M. or 6 P.M.--6:30 P.M.  I think it might have been a little different too.  But, I think it wasn't because, you know, I just--I was the kind of person who it was hard for people to not like me.  And I tried hard and I worked hard, and even though I may have blown that, I was back there the next day and I was trying the next thing.  And I think I just, you know, I just--I made up for it maybe.  And the next day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Would you say--
Speaker 2: --I did a decent report.
Speaker 1: Would you say that's part of the business though a little bit at the beginning anyway, that people do make--
Speaker 2: Oh sure.
Speaker 1: --little mistakes here and there?
Speaker 2: Not even at the beginning.  I remember once when I was at ABC early on, and I was filling in on an anchor desk and I tossed it to a reporter, a very seasoned reporter, who suddenly blanked out on something on air and started to cough and just--.  I don't know what happened to him, but he pulled it together and he went on.  And everybody looked at each other and thought, what happened?  So I think that the bottom line is that's part of the business.  Everybody now and again has a moment, but it better be now and again.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: If you--if the body of your work for the most part is consistent, I think maybe people are willing to sort of overlook that.  And also, I was in a stressful environment.  I was probably sleep deprived.  I mean if nothing else I would have blamed it on that.  And I'm sure people maybe chalked it up to that because I never heard anything about it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 632874
Speaker 1: Going back, you h- you said you had moved to the [NBC News] Atlanta bureau and Al [Al Roker] was still here in New York [New York].  So how did you guys actually come together?
Speaker 2: I was dating someone in Atlanta [Georgia], and it just didn't feel like it was a relationship that was really going the distance, but I was seeing him.  And Al and I still talked, and after a while it was sort of apparent to me that Al was slightly interested.  And his marriage [to Alice Bell] was falling apart.  I knew he had a five year old daughter, or four year old daughter [Courtney Roker] at that time.  And I didn't know all the details of what was going on, but I knew that he was interested.  And to me it felt impractical; I live in Atlanta, you're in New York.  And you know, we would see other now and again because I mostly reported for the Southeast region.  Now and again I came to New York, but we didn't see each other that often.  Well eventually, they closed the Atlanta bureau--or, I'm sorry they changed the Atlanta bureau and shrunk it significantly, and I moved to New York.  And Al and I began to see each other more.  And at a certain point I think recognizing that I just was striking out with guy after guy, because I had this sort of vision of who I thought I needed to be with, maybe a business guy.  I had dated a doctor years back and--nice guy and it didn't really work.  But I think I had some kind of a professional guy in mind outside of this business, be it a doctor or an investment banker.  I think I just had a certain type of guy in mind, and, y- also physically.  Maybe--I was athletic, maybe an athletic, lean, you know, classically attractive guy.  I don't really know what.  I had dated white men, I had dated black men.  I don't know what I exactly was expecting, but I just thought--I think I just sort of thought Al's not in that category; he's in a different category.  He's a nice guy, but here's my category of guys.  Meanwhile, I'm dating these guys sort of in my category of guys, and they--I'm just striking out.  And one of them was actually a new- a network news producer, a little lovely guy, but just wasn't going the distance.  And also, he was Jewish and I just sort of felt like eventually that would matter to me because my Christianity is important to me, and I just sort of thought practically I just don't know if we're going the distance, and other things too weren't working.  And then I dated another guy when I came to New York who was an in- investment banker, attractive guy, sharp guy, but for whatever reason it was sputtering.  And, meanwhile here's Al, and we'd go out to lunch, now and again we'd see each.  And at that point, it was clear to me that he was interested.  And I just thought, forget it.  And then one day, I don't know what it was, Al wants to think the turning point was when I went to Barcelona to cover the Olympics in Spain [1992 Summer Olympics, Barcelona, Spain] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I ask him if--
Speaker 1: And that was in '92 [1992], right?
Speaker 2: In '92 [1992].  And I ask him if he would just look in on my apartment and maybe water my plants once while I was away.  And he tells this funny story about how he was looking around in my kitchen and he opened the refrigerator and was struck by the fact that I had, he says, a bottle of champagne, some old musty mustard, and like a--molded cheese.  And then he looks in my oven, as Al was want to do, and notices that I had cardboard in my oven because I hadn't used it.  He loves to tell that joke.  So when I came home, he had stocked the pantry a bit and he left some flowers on the pant- on the counter with a note saying, "Welcome home."  And it really touched me.  And so, it--probably around that time I thought to myself, you're looking for this (air quotes) type of guy, and here's a really lovely guy right here and you keep looking over him because he doesn't really fit your physical idea of who you were supposed to be with, but he's wonderful.  And I actually started at that moment to look at him with different eyes.  He was reliable, he loved his mother, he was good to his parents [Isabel Roker and Albert Lincoln Roker, Sr.]; I had seen evidence of this.  He was--we shared similar values; family was very important to us.  In spite of the fact that we worked in this sort of high octane world of network news, we both had some very grounded sort of family values.  And I thought, wait a second.  Maybe I'm overlooking a good thing.
Story_ID: 632875
Speaker 1: He's now--is he still doing--he's still doing--when did he go to 'The Today Show' ['Today'] full-time?  Were you guys married by then or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were married by then--
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were married by then.
Speaker 2: --or on our way to be married.  We were engaged.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the reason I know is because there was like a little moment in his--.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Al [Al Roker] had been filling in regularly--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on 'The Today Show' by the time we be- we became an item.
Speaker 1: So that would have been what year about do you think?
Speaker 2: I have to do my math.  Hold on--when did we get married?  It's nine- it's 2008; we've been married thirteen years this year, so '95 [1995]?
Speaker 1: So you got--so that was '95 [1995] because you got married when?  What year?
Speaker 2: In '95 [1995].  No.  We got married in '95 [1995] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You got married in '95 [1995].
Speaker 2: I would say maybe it was '93 [1993] or '4 [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Al was really a major contributor to 'The Today Show,' and was making a transition from local owned and operated NBC [WNBC-TV, New York, New York] to the full show.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you're--
Speaker 2: So by the time we got married in '95 [1995] he was just becoming a regular--
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: --on the show.
Speaker 1: --ninety-three [1993]-ish, and then you're at 'Dateline' ['Dateline NBC']?
Speaker 2: At that point I was at 'Dateline.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we were an NBC media couple--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --at that point.
Speaker 1: Right.  'Cause you moved to ABC in '95 [1995], so right af- around the time you were married?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  In fact, I moved to NBC [sic.] right around the time we got married because my contract coming up, and I was beginning to wonder was it such a healthy thing for my husband and I to work at the same network, and just thinking about, you know, contractually what you want in your career, where that next step is going to be anyway (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you were looking, you were, you were actively looking.
Speaker 2: I was looking.
Speaker 1: And then Barbara Walters--
Speaker 2: And then one day Barbara Walters gave me a call and said, "I would love to talk with you about '20/20.'"  And I was like, whoa.  I don't believe this.  Because in my mind '20/20' was like, again, second to '60 Minutes.'  It was like the pentacle of the news magazine shows.  And only second to '60' because '60' was their first.
Speaker 1: So, now when Barbara Walters calls, you're a newlywed?
Speaker 2: I'm just about to become a newlywed (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just about, but everybody knows you're dating Al?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you're dating Al, on your way to being newlywed--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Barbara Walters calls.  Now, did you start '20/20' before--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --you were married?
Speaker 2: I got the call from Barbara probably in late winter, early spring of '95 [1995], and I came to ABC in May of '95 [1995], just months before I got married in September.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I started ABC at that point, and we're starting this whole new chapter in my life, and everything was suddenly just changing for me.
Speaker 1: Right.  Everything was new.
Speaker 2: Everything was new.
Speaker 1: In '95 [1995] everything is new.
Speaker 2: Everything was new.
Speaker 1: So you step over ABC from NBC after having been here for five years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, would you categorize your five years at NBC as being really good years--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it sounds like?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I would say my five years ultimately at NBC were really terrific years.  And it was sort of where I grew up in the network.  I mean, if you think about when I got there in '90 [1990], and I'm this like, you know, neophyte from Orlando, Florida [at WFTV-TV] trying to learn the business.  By '95 [1995] I'm getting a call from Barbara Walters, who thinks I'm worthy of joining '20/20.'  I mean, I felt like I really had come into my own a bit as a reporter.
Speaker 1: And how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was still growing--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but I had really come into my own as a network correspondent.
Story_ID: 632876
Speaker 1: And how was Barbara Walters?  I mean, did she sit you down and talk to you about what she wanted to do on '20/20' and have your (unclear)?  And what was she like to work with?
Speaker 2: Barbara was of course this icon and this larger than life character.  I mean not only as she revered in network news, but you know there was even a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch of her.  I mean, everybody knew who Barbara was.  I was shaking like a leaf when I met her the first time, and she was lovely.  She was definitely Barbara; she was larger than life Barbara when you meet her.  She's got this beautiful office with carpet and drapes and a gorgeous desk and photos of various leaders and celebrities from around the world that she's interviewed.  I mean that was a pretty heavy experience.  She was lovely though.  And she made me feel wanted, and desired and worthy.  And that was, that big stuff.
Speaker 1: Did you see her as a potential mentor at ABC?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I saw Barbara as somebody who could hopefully guide and lead me.  You have to remember when I grew up watching television in the '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s], Barbara Walters, Carole--oh, gosh, hold on, let me--what's Carole's last name?  Simpson [HistoryMaker Carole Simpson].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You have to remember when I grew up watching television in the late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s], Barbara Walters, Carole Simpson, Connie Chung; all of these were women who were just absolute powerhouses in the business.  And there weren't many woman.  So, to actually sit down with Barbara Walters and to now be joining her team, I thought, first of all, I had died and gone to heaven.  But secondly, I thought, well, wow.  Maybe this is a chance for some of what she knows and what some of what she has, you know, just gone through over the years to rub off on me.  I wanted to touch her garment.  I wanted a part of this.  And I thought, maybe if, maybe if she'll take me under her wing I will learn a few things and possibly, you know, come near the kind of stature that she had achieved.
Story_ID: 632877
Speaker 1: And who else was at '20/20' at the time?
Speaker 2: Lynn Sherr was here; Bob Brown; John Stossel; Tom Jarriel; Hugh Downs--
Speaker 1: And it was Hugh Downs.  So it was Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs.
Speaker 2: And then Arnold Diaz and I were both added around the same time for '20/20' as sort of new blood.
Speaker 1: Now, how, how did you get stories for '20/20'?
Speaker 2: Well, what was interesting about it--now, I had worked for 'Dateline' ['Dateline NBC'] so I didn't--.  I had worked for 'Dateline' and I experienced the magazine business, but it was a little bit different here because it was a well-oiled machine.  And while I had learned to sort of scrap it out a little bit at NBC to get my assignments, here there was a booking team, and there were people who worked tirelessly to find reports for '20/20,' and there were certain kinds of stories that '20/20' did too.  The brand of '20/20'--the brand of '20/20' was sort of family-oriented, social stories, human interest stories.  There were certain kinds of things that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Versus--what were you doing at NBC?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, 'Dateline' did those kinds of stories too.  But we did a lot of, maybe, edgy news kinds of stories.
Speaker 1: So a little more--harder news would you say?
Speaker 2: Maybe.  Maybe.  I mean, truly 'Dateline' was conceptualized by a former '20/20' producer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there were similarities.  But it was just a little different here.  And '20/20' did really have a very sort of heartland experience about it, although there were still investigative stories, and crime and punishment kinds of stories.  But I would say the vast majority was sort of--very sort of family, social; the fabric of America kinds of stories.  So the booking teams would come up these kinds of assignments and hand them to me.  And then over time, as I started to really acclimate myself, then I could suggest stories and perhaps have a story or two.  For instance, early on I wanted to do a story on Rosa Parks.  I don't remember exactly where that idea came from, but a producer and I were talking about this and how she was this legend who was still alive but aging, and wouldn't it be interesting to do a piece on her.  And I had to really convince my bosses because they weren't quite sure why we would just do a story on Rosa Parks.  And after seeing a few clips of her--she was a very quiet woman--so they weren't convinced that this was a great story for us and it wouldn't be really grabby and so forth, but eventually I was able to do the story.  And as I now look back on that, it's just an amazing, amazing opportunity for me.
Story_ID: 632878
Speaker 1: So tell me, on a story like that how--just, just so--you know, as someone who knows nothing about how--what the process is like of what you do.  So you, you come up with a story, you pitch it, they, they finally agree to it, you have a producer.  And is that someone that you pick yourself--
Speaker 2: Well this pro-
Speaker 1: --typically?
Speaker 2: This producer and I just happen to be talking about it.  In some situations, there are producers who are assigned to anchors or top correspondents who work with them on a regular basis.  Here, we just you know mixed and match, and we work with all kinds of people.  So this producer, it was a white woman who just happened to have a keen sense and feel for interesting stories that were outside of the, you know, the normal realm.  And she really appreciated civil rights stories.  She appreciated stories that highlighted women and women's issues, or children.  She just had a real open way of looking at things.  And I was so shocked that she was taken by this idea about Rosa Parks.  So, somehow together we started talking about it, and we went to my executive producer and pitched the story, which happens all the time.  But the thing of it is sometimes you have to really convince them if it's not their idea why this is a great idea.  And frankly this was a hard one because Rosa Parks isn't the most dynamic person.  And frankly, once we went out to go shoot it, it was tough.  She was not very talkative; she was not dynamic; she was not introspective.  So we were having to pull to get this little old sweet woman to talk about what she had done.  I don't think she really thought of herself as that amazing.  I know she appreciated that what she did was, you know, earth shattering, but I don't think she really got it.  She didn't talk about herself in that way.  So, consequently, we were--it was hard for us to get that on, on tape.  So, it wasn't like our finest moment in terms of stories because once we shot it, I'm not sure that my boss was blown away by the story, but I felt it was significant and I was still thrilled that we got it on the air.
Speaker 1: And is--do you--is every show that you produce and tape put on air all the time?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sometimes, sometimes there are reports that are considered, you know, bombs or just didn't make it or something about it just isn't right; it's a dud, and we don't put it on the air.  Now, we don't do that very often, especially these days because they're very costly.  I mean, these stories are thousands of--tens of thousands of dollars per.  And there was a time when money was flowing freely and we could have that luxury.  And if you shot something and somehow it just wasn't fabulous, it didn't make it t- I mean, it didn't make it to air.  And that was always your fear too.  Nobody wanted to go out and shoot a story that might not make it to air.  And suddenly, when I'm out shooting this with Rosa Parks, and she's not being forthcoming, and she's not being that interesting, I'm thinking, great.  This was my idea, I'm pitching a story and it's about this black woman, this civil rights, you know, icon, and it may not see the light of day.  I was absolutely petrified about that.
Speaker 1: So, now is this early on while you're at '20/20' you would say?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Story_ID: 632879
Speaker 1: So now, I know you won an Emmy [Emmy Award] for a piece that you did at '20/20.'
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Tell me when that was and tell us about it.
Speaker 2: I won an Emmy for a piece ["Her Lost World"] that still just resonates for me.  I mean it was near and dear to my heart.  A story about an Ethiopian American woman [Lydia Dawson] who wanted to journey back to her native continent to find the mother [Asha] who had given her up when she was a child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, first tell me what year was this?
Speaker 2: Well, we can look at the Emmy and see.
Speaker 1: On the Emmy, right.
Speaker 2: Because I--
Speaker 1: Was it 2000?  Nineteen ninety-nine [1999], 2000 I think I saw.
Speaker 2: Was it 2000?  Okay, if you saw it, then--
Speaker 1: Yeah I think it said--
Speaker 2: --because I don't really remember.
Speaker 1: It's December 1999 to January 2000.
Speaker 2: So we probably did it the year before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ninety-nine [1999].  It was around 1999 that I, that I essentially got a call one night from one of the senior producers on our staff, a woman by the name of Meredith White, who was really fabulous and smart, and just had her eye on all kinds of amazing stories that were usually outside the box.  And I had gone to Rwanda to cover a story before about, like, after the genocide, and I had pitched that story.  And I was shocked that we did it, and we did and, you know, again, it's not always that easy to pitch stories to network news about black subjects, Africa, places that they don't really see their viewers as being that focused on.  So I had done that story, and we got it on the air, and it was fine.  And I guess either because of that association or just because she liked me and liked my reporting, I got a call from Meredith White one night, on a Friday night, saying, "Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Roberts], there is this amazing story that we're chasing right now that is in Ethiopia."  "Now--," and she tells me a little rundown about it: "It's an Ethiopian American woman who lives in Seattle, Washington who's been trying to make contact with the mother who gave her up for adoption many years ago because she was wounded in a fire.  And the parents couldn't take care of her and gave her up to missionaries, and she was schooled abroad and eventually came to the United States, but never made contact again with the parents, but now wants to go.  And she's on her way over there now, and the only hitch is you have to jump on a plane like, day after tomorrow.  Can you possibly do this story?"  Well, at this point, I'm married, I've got a kid, I mean, I've got a life (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So you have a baby at this point?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  I mean--
Speaker 1: So, now, this is, you say, around 1998?  When was your daughter born?
Speaker 2: Leila [Leila Roker] was born in '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: She was born--so it was right after she was born--
Speaker 2: Wait.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Ninety s- well Leila will be ten this year.  Wait a second--I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Yeah, '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Leila was born in '98 [1998].  So Leila's a baby, and that's not a big deal because as a network correspondent, I'm accustomed to jumping into whatever and running and gunning, but to up and just go to Africa, you know you're going to be gone for maybe a week.  And I've got this baby and so forth, so I had to think about it.  I hung up the phone and I talked to Al [Al Roker] about it, and Al has always been so supportive of my career, and he has always wanted to see me go far.  So, right away he said, "We will figure this out.  We will scramble, we will get my mother [Isabel Roker] over here if we need to, we'll get--.  You should do this story, it sounds really amazing."  So, not really knowing what we were going to get, I signed on and said yes.  And I had already had my shots--
Speaker 1: That was going to be my next question (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that was another thing.  I had already had my shots because I'd been to Rwanda.  Maybe that was another reason she thought--
Speaker 1: Ah.  So they last.
Speaker 2: --this would be--was great.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  They last for several years.  So, I thought, well, why not?
Story_ID: 632880
Speaker 1: And what interesting about this story is that, when I went to Rwanda, I--Leila [Leila Roker] was seven months old.  I had to stop breastfeeding because I was going to Africa and I had to take all these shots.  And it was a real moment for me because it was sort of choosing my career at that moment, and an assignment that came with my career, over this child that I was still nurturing and breastfeeding (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was that a--
Speaker 1: --at that moment was tra-
Speaker 2: Was that a family decision or a Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Roberts] decision?
Speaker 1: That was a Deborah decision, I think.  I mean, I'm sure Al [Al Roker] and I both talked about it.  But, I literally had to stop breastfeeding her because I couldn't have these shots and do this too.  So that was the impetus to sort of make that move back into the career full force.  So, I had already done--.  But the Rwanda experience was devastating.  I had never been to Africa before.  I'm going to this war torn country, and I meet children and people who have just had their lives ripped apart, and every night I went to my hotel room and cried.  I met a little boy who just barely survived a machete attack and had a deep gash in his head and told me he still had ringing headaches.  But he was so sweet and he wanted to just talk to us, and still found some sense of something to smile about.  It was shocking to me.  But my heart ached for these children and for these people.  And I, I could- I couldn't enjoy the assignment.  It was interesting, but I was devastated.
Speaker 2: How long were you there?
Speaker 1: Four or five days.  And every day we would go out and venture into a village to meet some people and find out a little bit about their lives, and many of them had lost their parents or their entire families, and just basically find out how life was for them as they were trying to put their lives back together.  So--
Speaker 2: Now do you just talk about all this stuff with your crew that's with you?
Speaker 1: Right, but--
Speaker 2: Do you guys really talk about it?
Speaker 1: --interestingly, my crew was from Africa.  And the producer was not, but the crew was.  And so for them, this was another difficult, international assignment, but they had seen plenty, and they had seen lots of wars, I'm sure.  And so, they would want to go out at the end of the day and, let's go have dinner, and let's go have a drink, and you know those network crews, especially international crews are very different people.  And I think that's how they shake off the, you know, the dregs of the day.  And I just couldn't.  I would go back to my room every day and just sob.  So, that had been my previous experience in an African country and reporting on something like this.
Story_ID: 632881
Speaker 1: So now I'm heading off to Ethiopia on a decidedly different story, but I'm not quite sure what this is going to be like.  And also, too, we don't even know--we're making it up as we go along.  This woman [Lydia Dawson] is just sort of going on this blind journey to find her mother [Asha], and we're going to meet up with her and join her.  We start out in Addis Ababa [Ethiopia], and we're going to go with her wherever it takes her.  So she is--we meet up with her, she's this beautiful woman with her husband, and they tell me what they are trying to do.  She has two young children back in the states, if I'm not mistaken, and she has a limited amount of time to come here to try to do this.  And she has a wing and a prayer of someone who she thinks knows someone, but this remote village where her mother lives doesn't, of course, have phone service.  So, there's like these two-way radios that they're talking to people on, and there's a crackly voice, and they think they've found someone who's related to a cousin.  So it was kind of this real journey, I mean just sort of like this adventure.  So, we go with this woman on this little plane (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, we: how many people?  You have a producer?
Speaker 1: I have a producer and myself, and I suppose the camera crew either was with us or was going to meet us there.  I can't remember now.  I guess the camera crew had to be with us.  So--
Speaker 2: And how many are in the crew?
Speaker 1: Two.  So we join this friend of hers who takes us in this little crop duster plane.  And I don't even know if this guy really had a pilot's license, you know.  And we jump on this plane, and I'm thinking to myself, I hope this is safe.  And we take off and everything's fine.  Okay, we're going along, and we start shooting some of the interview on the plane, I'm asking her about her feelings and so forth; the reporter in me takes over.  But now and again, you know, just the--they have the mother of a young child and the human being takes over, and I think, what am I doing?  And at one point--when we go to land, we're about to land on this, this red clay runway, and we're sort of like bouncing a little, and again, I'm thinking, I hope this guy really knows what he's doing.  And we bounce around on this landing strip, and we land and everything's fine.  Phew.  And, okay.  So, then I feel, like, okay, maybe we're okay.  And we get out of the plane and there is just this, this plain area, this vast plain of sort of dry grass, and we get out and we look, and there are these children who are just sort lined up, these beautiful children staring at the plane and the rest of us, trying to figure out who we are, these villagers.  And I really just felt like, oh, my gosh.  I am home.  It was really--I have to--I'm getting goose bumps.  I mean unlike the previous experience where I landed in this area, and we knew right away our mission was to go and report on these victims of war, suddenly, I'm thrown into this land, this faraway land and these people--I mean, like right out something out of National Geographic, who are standing in these multicolored clothes and just sort of looking at us, but in that beautiful way the Ethiopian people sort of look at you anyway.  Even with the smudged faces and the snot strewn faces of the little kids, they are just beautiful.  And I thought, oh, my gosh.  So, we go off and we meet these people, and they are so delighted to see her and through word of mouth, they sort of know a little bit about her story.
Speaker 2: So you're just following her lead basically?
Speaker 1: I'm with--we're following her lead.  We're just following this woman.  We don't even know what we're going to find, but we're documenting her story.
Story_ID: 632882
Speaker 1: And somehow there was this connection between small town Georgia and village of wherever in Ethiopia.  I mean, while these people may have been poor and certainly, you know, were riding either on like a broken down Jeep in some cases or just walking to wherever they were going, I felt this extreme connection to these people.  And, and just sort of this pride of this woman, and they obviously recognized that she was Ethiopian; and a few of them thought I was Ethiopian.  But they just wanted to help her.  They wanted to help her find her mother [Asha]. So this little village pulled together to try to tell her where to go and so forth.  And someone came with a Jeep to give us a ride, and again, making this up as we go along, and we bump up and down these rutted roads, and we're trying to make our way, make our way.  And then suddenly it hits me, too, that, you know, there's no communication out here--
Speaker 2: That was going to be my question.  Are you able to communicate?
Speaker 1: There's no, there's no sense of communication out here.  We're just sort of at the mercy of the--Solomon, our pilot, and he's told us now, "You know what, it's starting to get dark.  I don't think we're going to be able to fly out of here tonight."
Speaker 2: So you weren't planning (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We're going to have to figure--
Speaker 2: --to spend the night there?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head) Our plan was to touch down, go see if we could find this woman's mother quickly, and get back on the plane and leave, which is how we normally do our stories.  It's all planned out with the producer, and we get on the phone and we do what we're going to do.  Here, suddenly it hits me we're just going to have to go with the flow.  So, it's going to take us forever to get to this house where we think that the meeting might take place, because we're bumping up and down on these roads and through puddles, and it just, it's just really an arduous situation.  So we finally make it to this cinderblock house, which is their guesthouse.  And they, they're talking about it with such pride like it's this sort of fancy place where we're going to hang out.  And it was, you know, obviously all they had to o- and it was so amazing because these people were so proud of this situation.  So we get there and then we realize that we don't even know where the mother is.  Someone went to go tell someone who's on foot who is going to tell somebody else to try to find the mother.  So I think, oh, my gosh.  This is not going to just feed the classic story that you just sort of shoot and go home.  And, at that point, Solomon our pilot tell us that, it's going to be getting dark soon, we can't fly out of here.  Because we just flew onto this, like, barren strip.  You know, there're no lights; there's no runway out there.  So my producer, a white woman, starts to panic a little bit because here we are out in the bush, and she's worried.  And I said, "You know what?  Let's just go with it.  It's fine."  And we brought us some water with us, and I had some nuts on me, and I figured I'll just like nibble on this.  And we sit there with Lydia [Lydia Dawson] who's waiting, because she's got an artificial leg, so she can't go walking anyway on this journey.  So, Solomon, the pilot, now is a guide for some--or Solomon, the pilot is now a scout for us.  He's going down (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because he speaks the language and (unclear)--
Speaker 1: He speaks the language, and so he's going to out and go try to find her mother.  So they go out again on this broken down Jeep, which the guys had to push just to get it to start up.  And then we hear the motor start, and they run down and jump into the Jeep with them, and they go right back down this, this dirt road that is pocked with, you know, holes and water and trenches and so forth.  They go back down on what's going to be another journey.  And we sit there and we wait, and I interview her a little bit as we wait.  And we don't know whether we're going to find the mother, whether we're going to have to leave the next day without her ever making contact, whether this story may just be a bust and we try or what.  We're just sort of waiting to see.  And we--obviously, there's no contact to be made with anybody, so we just sort get to know each other, and we talk and we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Were you scared?
Speaker 1: I was a little scared because now it was very clear that we're going to stay out here.  And I felt protected by the people, and they felt very lovely.  But I don't really know.  I mean, I'm in the African bush.  I don't know what's going on here.  So I was a little nervous; a little anxiety was creeping in.  Then it starts to--the dusk starts to settle and then it starts to get darker.  And we have--they have lanterns and we have some, you know, camera lights and things like that.  But, you know, it's getting very dark, and you can hear, like, something in the trees, and somebody--
Story_ID: 632883
Speaker 1: So, we're sitting there in the dark, and we're wondering if this thing is going to happen.  And I can see that Lydia [Lydia Dawson] is becoming more anxious too because she's wondering, you know, did she come on this fruitless journey or what's going to happen.  And at some point we hear, in the di- oh, I was talking about the wild monkeys.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So we could hear wild monkeys swinging in the trees, and you know, it was sort of clear to me that there's a jungle out there.  I mean, I don't know what's going on, but we stay inside, and I relatively protected.  And Lydia's starting to become anxious, and we all are.  And, and by now I don't even know what time it is, but it's pretty late.  And we could hear in the distance a vehicle, and it sounded like the Jeep was driving up.  But, we don't know.  Did they find the mother [Asha], or are they coming back to say, "Sorry, we tried; it's done."  So I stayed inside and my producer [Joanna Breen] went out to just tell the pr- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now this is dark, night.
Speaker 1: --the photographers to start rolling camera and we'll just see what happens.  And, we're sitting there, and all of a sudden the door opens, and this little woman who's shrouded in, like in a (unclear), walks in and she's perplexed by the cameras and the light.  But she walks over to Lydia and just starts to weep, and Lydia knows immediately that it's her mother, and the mother knows this is my long lost daughter.  And she kisses her from cheek to cheek to cheek to cheek.  There's not a dry eye in the house.  And she is hugging her, and they're speaking in Amharic, and she--but they're barely--they're not saying anything.  They're speaking the language of love.  And this woman is just holding her daughter like, you know, like she's gold.  I mean, as if she could never let go of her, and just kisses her, and kisses her and holds her.  And eventually, you know, someone says, "Let's sit down," and they do.  And trailing behind her are two other children, brothers and sisters of Lydia whom she didn't know about.  And they sit there.  And Lydia does speak the language, not as well, haltingly.  But they speak in Amharic, and just get to know each other a little bit.  And I--it's all I can do to just try to keep my tears in check.  It was the most amazing I've ever encountered in my life.  And so, then the reporter has to take over because I have to, you know, grab, this moment (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is all being filmed?
Speaker 1: It's all being shot, and I begin to ask Lydia questions, and then she asks her mother and translates, and basically says that her mother always dreamed about her, always knew in her heart that her daughter was alive and well, but just didn't know what had happened; always prayed that she would come back to her.  And so, we get this reunion and we hear a little bit about what they're thinking of each other, and they're looking at each other and the mother can see the resemblance, and then the brother joins in and they see the resemblance.  And Lydia, who is a little bit more stoic, I mean she's tearful, but she's a more stoic person, didn't just absolutely give into the emotion, but she was clearly, clearly blown away by this experience.
Story_ID: 632884
Speaker 1: And so we spend the night there, and it's a--it becomes this, like, just this festive environment and--
Speaker 2: And did the mother [Asha] stay as well?
Speaker 1: And the mother stayed.  And the host says to us, "Well, we have to go get food."  Now, of course, I'm sort of petrified about eating in Africa or any foreign country for that matter because--third world country anyway because I don't want to catch anything or, you know, get dysentery.  So, I sort of declined politely, but no, she insists.  And I think goat might have been mentioned or lamb and eggs and, you know, all these things.  So I thought, you know what, I have to give into this.  These are my hosts, and I'm going to do it.  So they go out, and wherever they ventured to, come back with some food and some bread.  And my white woman producer is like petrified and doesn't want to eat anything.  I said, "You're going to eat.  Have a bite.  Have a bite of something.  You're going to eat."  And they offer us something, and I have a bite of something.  I didn't realize what it was.  I think it maybe c- a lamb stew with some bread.  And they all sit around and they just talk the rest of the night.  And eventually, we find this room, and there was--what do you call those--the college students have all the time.  They look like beds, but they're not really beds, they're just like a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) A cot?
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Cot?
Speaker 1: No, no.  It's like a big sofa.  It's a slouchy sofa--
Speaker 2: Oh like a futon.
Speaker 1: A futon.  There's a futon in one room and, you know, we--I just curl up on it, and my producer in a chair or something, curls up on it.  And I said--you know, she keeps saying, "Well, we have to get out of here.  We have to get out of here."  I said, "You know what, Joanna [Joanna Breen], we're here.  We're here for the night.  It's going to be fine.  Settle down."  Because by now, I've just accepted--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --this really is an adventure, and this is amazing.  And I just witnessed the, the reunion of sort of life.  I mean, come on.  What else is there to talk about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And your pilot was there?  Did you feel like he--
Speaker 1: And Solomon was there, the pilot.
Speaker 2: Did you feel like he was security in a way?
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.  I felt like--you know what?  I felt like I was amongst my people.  I mean, except for the language and except for the remoteness of it, I felt like I could have been in Georgia someplace in the country.  These were my people and they were taking care of us, and they were taking care of each other.  And the essence of that warm, nurturing, proud environment to me was just so overwhelming that there was nothing to talk about.  I al- I think I also was feeling a healing going on within myself.  And that may sound pretty strange, but I'm not sure that I was always as proud as I should have been of my black heritage and my cultural experience down in Georgia, small town Georgia, especially rural Georgia and relatives I had in rural Georgia.  And I somehow maybe felt a little bit of ashamed of that and felt like it--
Speaker 2: But yet, and still you said you pitched the Rwanda story.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you brought yourself there.
Speaker 1: I brought myself there.  So I felt in some ways a healing going on inside myself.  These are my people, you know--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: These could be my people in Georgia, they're my people in Africa; my people.
Speaker 2: Her [Lydia Dawson] reunion with her mother is symbolic of your reunion in a way.
Speaker 1: Of my reunion with my life.  Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, with your people.
Speaker 1: --my reunion just sort of with my people.  You're absolutely right.  So I, I was sort of basking in it.
Story_ID: 632885
Speaker 1: And the next morning when we got up in our same clothes, and you know somehow I grabbed a brush and managed to just sort of brush my hair together, having no idea what I looked like, and smeared a little lip gloss on my face.  I've never gone on television like this before.  But I was just going with it.  We followed her to the next village because the mother [Asha] wanted her to see some other people.  And then we discovered that night--that morning a whole group of villagers from her mother's village had walked the whole night just to come see this long lost daughter from the United States.  And so, we come outside and there all these people, maybe twenty of them, standing outside just to greet Lydia [Lydia Dawson].  Oh, my heart burst.  Absolutely burst.  I mean, on the one hand this is an amazing story; as a journalist: "Wow, I'm getting this, are you getting this?  This is a great story."  But on the other hand, I'm this black American woman who is witnessing to me just the ultimate in just pride of who your people are and what they symbolize for each other and how these people came together.  And they're not educated people, and they certainly don't have any kind of communication that we can speak of; but yet, they knew that this long lost daughter from the United States was home to be with her mother, and they wanted to come and witness it.  So they were there, and I got to talk to some of these people.  And then we went off to go shoot in some other settings, and these children swarmed me and came over and wanted to talk and, you know, I mean, we just sort of talked the language of humanity, you know, I mean, I hugged them and we--I talked to them and they didn't really understand me, or a few of them maybe spoke a little bit of English.  But they were just beautiful, amazing children who were spirited; who were curious; who were energetic.  And, I was just loving every minute of it.  And later that day, we had to wrap up and head back.  And Lydia, of course, had to go back too.  And I'll never forget the scene when sh- when we walked back--when we ride back, but then get back to the field where the plane was parked and start walking back to the plane, and her mother along with her brother and sister are standing and watching, and the mother just becomes so despondent, and just so overcome with grief and, you know, huddles down onto the ground and just is clutching--.  And Lydia gives her picture of herself and her children.  And she's clutching the picture and just holding herself and rocking, and just, just, you know, overwhelmed with grief at losing her daughter yet again in a way.  And it was just powerful.  And it was difficult for Lydia, too, but she vowed that she would come back, and she has since come back I've understood, she told me.  But we came back and told the story, and everybody here at '20/20' was blown away by the majesty, the beauty, the wonder, the adventure, the reveal in this story.  I mean, it had everything you could possibly want.
Speaker 2: And how long were you there, did you end up being there?
Speaker 1: I would say three or four days; not very long.  I mean, obviously it takes a day to get there.  Well, you know, I probably arrived one night, and started shooting the next day, and then jumped on this plane that afternoon, and spent the night, and we spent the next day shooting, came back to Addis [Addis Ababa, Ethiopia], stayed that one more day, and then, I think head- headed back home.  So really only three or four days, a brief trip.  But it was so magical; so magical and amazing.
Story_ID: 632886
Speaker 1: So we came back, and everybody was blown away by this story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then, and you get the Emmy [Emmy Award] for it ['Her Lost World'].
Speaker 1: And then I got the Emmy for it.  And I didn't, I didn't really, I didn't know that it was an award winner.  I felt like it was an amazing story, and we did enter it for an Emmy.  But that night, and I just had my second child--did I have Nicky [Nicholas Roker]?  Yeah, I had had my second child.  So, yes--
Speaker 2: So, now what year is that?  What year is Nicky born?
Speaker 1: Two thousand two [2002].
Speaker 2: Two thousand two [2002].
Speaker 1: So we must have shot the story and then put it on shortly after because Emmys are ju- the Emmy contest's judging starts from the year before.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I remember I had just had a baby.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because I went to the awards.  And I was literally just coming off maternity leave and I wasn't going to go, and Al [Al Roker] encouraged me to go and said, "You know that was a terrific story.  I have a feeling, you never know."  And I said, "Give me a break."  And when they announced that we won, I was just absolutely over the moon.
Speaker 2: So does winning an Emmy change things for you?
Speaker 1: It changed things for me internally and personally, and possibly career wise.  I mean, I think I was doing fine in my career, and I don't know that it really changed things here at ABC in terms of I was viewed as a correspondent.  But it certainly changed how I viewed myself too.
Speaker 2: In a way, is it doing the story that sort of change- you mention--I think we were off camera--that story changed things for you--had a profound effect on you on many different levels?
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  It had a profound effect on me, but it also--I don't know.  It just--I felt like it really put me in a category too.  I mean, I just felt like it was the story that people were talking about, and maybe they were talking about it, too, partly because of the way I told it.  I felt like it just elevated me.  I felt like it really elevated me, and it was a story that was worthy.  It wasn't an investigative, hard-nosed story.  It was a kind of a story that was a human interest, pull your heart out kind of story.  And I felt like, wow.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: I had done something.
Story_ID: 632887
Speaker 1: So did you want to continue doing more stories like that?  I mean, as you're at '20/20' and N- ABC, were you thinking of going more the humanistic way or hard news or--?
Speaker 2: Well, it's sort of hard because even though there's value to those stories, I also know too that sometimes there's a premium on stories that are harder-edged, that now we live in an era of terrorism, so maybe stories that are investigative that maybe take a hard look at Al-Qaeda or threats in our world.  I know that those are stories that are valued a lot.  So, it's a hard one actually.  I don't want to limit myself because I think what happens is if you do, then you are restricting your career a bit.  I wanted to do more of those stories, and I still do, and I think I excel at those kinds of stories.  But I also want to remind people that I can do the other kinds of stories too.  I can do harder stories, I can do investigative stories, I can do stories that are in the news, I can interview Michelle Obama and talk politics; I can do a little bit of everything.  And I think it's very important that my bosses at the network know that so that I don't get pigeonholed, because those stories don't come along every day.  And, if you, if you become categorized, it's harder I think to, to really stay current and to stay alive in this business.
Speaker 1: So, at your--you come to ABC to specifically do '20/20.'  When do you start branching off into doing some of the other--the news, the network news or 'Good Morning America' (background noise)?
Speaker 2: My aspirations were pretty high, so when I came here, not only did I want to report--do we need to stop for the siren?
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: --born in July, and now it must have been like September or something like that.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  That's right.  Sorry.
Speaker 2: That makes sense.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And this is January, because it is the new millennium, and we did the big 'ABC: Millennium' ['ABC 2000: The Millennium'] coverage--
Speaker 1: Ah okay.
Speaker 2: --and we won an Emmy [Emmy Award] for it.
Speaker 1: Ah okay.
Speaker 2: And all, var- all of us got Emmys.
Speaker 1: I see.  I see.
Speaker 2: Whew.  I'm thinking to myself something does not feel right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm not crazy.  I know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, so we need to clarify the date.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, okay.  So let's go back--I just want to clarify the Emmy situation for the piece that you did in Ethiopia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Lydia [Lydia Dawson] story ["Her Lost World"].
Speaker 1: The Lydia story.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because as we were talking you were saying it was 2000, but you--how many Emmys do you have?
Speaker 2: I have two.
Speaker 1: You have two Emmys.
Speaker 2: Two national Emmys.  One was a group Emmy that I won as part of the millennium coverage for ABC News in general.  And then a personal Emmy that I won for Lydia's story in Ethiopia, which would have been about 2003.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you're at '20/20.'  How do you or when do you start breaking off into the other branches of ABC News?
Speaker 2: Interestingly when I got here--one of the things that I negotiated why I came here was that I really had high aspirations.  Not only did I want to be a magazine reporter, which I had started to do at NBC, I also wanted to anchor.  I wanted to be--I wanted a shot at potentially becoming the next Barbara Walters or [HistoryMaker] Carole Simpson or something like that.  So, I made it very clear that I wanted to anchor.  And the executives in ch- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At this time--just to clarify, at this time, who was anchoring the evening news and who was doing 'GMA'?
Speaker 2: Peter Jennings was anchoring the evening news.  'Good Morning America' was under transition, and John Donvan and Charlie Gibson were still there, but there was this shift, and there was this talk that they were leaving, and they were going to start a new group in the morning.  And Carole Simpson was one of the weekend anchors, or the weekend anchor at 'ABC World News' weekend ['World News Tonight'; 'ABC World News Tonight'].  So, there were people who were in place, but, you know, obviously a lot of them had been here for a while, too, and there was some talk that they were interested in sort of freshening things up and giving some of their younger correspondents a shot at some anchoring.  So, within a short time, I mean, I would say within the first year, I had anchored some on 'World News' weekend.  Pers- perhaps in the morning, too, on the news; I don't really remember that well.  But I was starting to branch out and anchor a little.
Story_ID: 632888
Speaker 1: So I was reporting on '20/20,' maybe I had done a piece or two for 'World News Tonight' ['ABC World News Tonight'], not that many, but I was also starting to anchor a bit too.
Speaker 2: So, so what's your schedule like when you do that?  It sounds--I mean, do you--
Speaker 1: It's all over the map.  It's all--it just depends.  The beauty of magazine [news magazine] work is that there is no set schedule.  So that if I'm working on a piece but it's in editing and just about finished, and I don't have a piece I'm shooting today, I can wander into the office a little later than I normally might, if I need to take one of my children to school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's what I was going to get at.
Speaker 1: --I can do that.
Speaker 2: How do you manage--
Speaker 1: That was, that was--
Speaker 2: --with small children, all over the place?
Speaker 1: It is, it is a work in progress always.  That was one of the reasons I think I was so attracted to magazine work.  Aside from the prestige, I liked the fact that it felt pretty flexible.  And I did not have children when I first began it, but I knew I did want to have a family, and children and that was important to me.  So along the way (sneeze) excuse me.  So along the way it was clear to me that I could sort of make this schedule work for me.  While it is demanding, while I'm chasing planes on a regular basis, trying to schedule interviews, trying to get my research together; on the days when there is not a pressing demand, I can take one of my children to school, I can meet Nicholas [Nicholas Roker] for his dentist appointment and still come into the office and do whatever I need to do, or perhaps maybe float that day, and work a little bit longer the next day.  Because the job really is sort of dependent on what it is I need to do.  I mean, it's guided by--now, I may also have to come in at 6 A.M., because maybe I've got to go shot something very early, or I need to catch a 6:30 A.M. flight to Seattle [Washington] so that I can do an interview that morning, and turn around and come back that night, or work until 9:00 because we're cutting a piece that's got to, got to air.
Speaker 2: Did you work throughout your entire pregnancies?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Both of them?  You did.
Speaker 1: I worked through both my pregnancies.  And I particularly worked hard during my second pregnancy because I felt like--I felt a bit vulnerable at that time, and I felt like I needed to really send a message to the network [ABC] that I was not going off on the mommy track; that I was very interested and aggressive and ambitious about my career.  And so, I worked really hard when I was pregnant with my second child because I wanted to make sure the message was clear.
Speaker 2: And Al [Al Roker], obviously has a very busy life because at this time he's now primarily at 'The Today Show' ['Today']?
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  You know what's interesting is when Al and I started off as parents, I did the bulk of the traveling in the relationship.  He was reporting weather on 'The Today Show.'  Occasionally if there was some typhoon someplace or some huge thunderstorm or tornado--occasionally if there was a huge hurricane or tornado or something that required a weather presence, Al might be dispatched to go do the story.  But for the most part, he was steadily here [New York, New York].  I was the jet setting correspondent who would be sent off to Michigan at a moment's notice, or Indianapolis [Indiana] or Argentina.  And that was just sort of the way it went, but we managed it pretty well.
Story_ID: 632889
Speaker 1: And then slow- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So was his schedule, so his schedule was more stable?
Speaker 1: Al's [Al Roker] schedule was more stable.  He got up very early in the morning and went into the office at five A.M.  But, generally speaking he was home at a decent time--
Speaker 2: So this is--I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: --or he would be home in the early afternoon.
Speaker 2: --when you do have kids?  You had kids at this point?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At this point I mean, even when we had kids I mean we were still sort of that kind of a mold of our lives where I did most of the travel, and we would have to work things around me.  We had a great caregiver, so it was never really an issue.  But I did most of the traveling.
Speaker 2: And would Al be a hands on--is he hands on?
Speaker 1: Al is a--Al is an amazingly hands on father.  It's amazing sometimes when I talk to other friends of mine whose husbands don't have any clue about their kids' schedule, or any idea how to even get them ready on a Saturday morning if you for whatever reason step out of the house.  Al will take the kids on a weekend and take them up to the country and deal with them and try to comb Leila's [Leila Roker] hair as best he can, and just completely on his own, there's never even talk or any talk about it.  Al has a very clear idea of who has a doctor's appointment this week.  He may even make appointments for the kids for school, for school conferences, will call me up, "What do you think?  I already booked it by the way.  Can you clear your calendar for next Tuesday at nine [o'clock]?  I booked the teachers."  I mean, he is--I have to say, he is extraordinarily hands on that way.  However, however, we women know that in the end the bulk of the responsibility falls on the woman.  The kid wants the mother mostly.  "I want Mommy" if something is going to happen.  The teachers will call the mom first.  My caregiver will call me first if there's anything that goes wrong, or I set the tone in the morning.  I'm there in the morning, and Al is off at 'The Today Show' ['Today'].  So, I still inherit the truth of it is the bulk of the responsibility.  I don't know where I would be if he wasn't as hands on because of it is, I feel like I'm carrying a lot of the load right now, and he is hands on.  So I have, I have such sympathy for those women out there and those single parent, you know, families, where there isn't that extra hands on, you know, behavior.  Because I got to tell you, whew, it's tough.  And with two kids now--well, now we're at a point in our lives, because 'The Today Show' has sort of expanded Al's role in some ways where he travels a lot, and Al also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And when would you say he started traveling more?
Speaker 1: I would say four or five years ago when the kids were really--I would say Al started to travel more when, you know, Leila was three or four, and Nicky [Nicholas Roker] was not even a thought, or Nicky was barely here.  Al [Al Roker] started to travel more, and then he has a production company that he has really nurtured and has become active.  And he is doing all kinds of projects with that company.  So he is forced to travel sometimes to have meetings, or he has just meetings late into the afternoon now related to the company.  But add the travel for 'The Today Show' ['Today'] onto this, and he is gone a lot.  Now his travel far exceeds mine.  And on any given week, we are, like, scrambling to look at our schedules to see who's where, and, "Oh, by the way, you remember I told you I have to go to Washington?"  Or, "No, you didn't tell me you were going to Washington.  What are you talking about you're going to Washing- ?"  "Yeah, remember, I did mention that.  Oh, and by the way, I'm hosting this event Thursday night, so are you going to be home, or do we need to have our nanny stay because I'm ho- ."  "Well, wait a minute.  Hosting an event?  Well, I'm hosting an event the same night."  "Oh, well, which event are you hosting?"  I mean that really is our life, and it is absolutely sometimes insane.  And while I love it and somebody has described these as upscale problems, and I suppose they are, it is really sometimes very trying.  Because this week for instance, Al has been gone for five days in a row on various shoots.  And I have been here, but I came off of a shoot; I had to go to London [England] days before he went off on his trip.  And in between, the kids have their schedules, and they were out of school, and one--they both got sick and, you know, it's just very hectic.  And we're also in the middle of schools in trying to place Nicholas [Nicholas Roker] in a school for next year.  So, "Oh, my gosh, is he supposed to go to see that school today?"  "No, that's not today."  "Okay, tomorrow."  And he's having a tantrum this morning because he doesn't want to go out of the house.  I've got a doctor's appointment, but Leila [Leila Roker] needs to go to the orthodontist, but she's going to be late for school.  "Al, can you take Nicky to the dental appointment?  No, you can't?  Okay, well, maybe when I finish up I can squeeze out to go do that, but I'll come back to the office because I've got a piece that I'm working on for Friday."  That's, that's kind of what our lives are like (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Story_ID: 632890
Speaker 1: With all of that going on, what kind of social life do you guys have (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, sadly, we actually--we do have a social life, but sadly, I think we're too tired for the social sometimes.  We have--I will say, we, we manage to still have an active social life.  We see friends (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So tell me--let me, let me back a little bit.  So, you guys are now married, you have a couple of kids [Leila Roker and Nicholas Roker].  How do you, you know, who are your friends, and how do you kind of (laughter)--?
Speaker 2: Who are our friends?
Speaker 1: And what's the New York [New York] social scene like for you guys--
Speaker 2: We have a--
Speaker 1: --from a, from the point of view of a small town girl from Perry, Georgia?
Speaker 2: That's exactly--that's what I was about to inject into this.  Al [Al Roker] and I have an active, thriving--
Speaker 1: Okay.  One more thing.  I'm sorry.  Not to keep interrupting you.  But Al is from where?
Speaker 2: Al is from Queens, New York.  I'm from little town Perry, Georgia.  So, we couldn't be from more opposite places.  However, we have very, very similar core values in that family is very important to us.  And at the end of the day, that's what we want to focus on, that's what means the most to us.  We're very ambitious people, we have high demanding jobs.  But in the end, family comes first.  And thank goodness we do share that value.  We have some really great friends.  We have a thriving social life in New York.  We get to experience a lot of what New York has to offer in terms of big social events and, you know, glamour settings and things like that.  But at the end of the day, our dearest friends, and many of them are either media people or people who are in the film business or the media production business, are--or investment bankers.  At the end of the day, we have a small core group of friends whom we probably just share similar values with.  [HistoryMaker] Tonya Lewis Lee and Spike Lee are very dear friends of ours.  Tonya and I bonded over our children, and just our similar situations in New York and being black women and families and trying to get our kids in great environments.  And we just share similar values, and it's not about glossy other things, but those core values.  So at the end of the day, we do have some really good friends that we would rather just sit down with over a bottle of wine and just sit down with another couple.  But we do get out.  I think the challenge for Al and me though is to limit our social life at this point because what happens, or what happened for me, especially being still the small town girl from Georgia, and I really do see myself like that even though my family sees me as like this glamour chi- chick up in New York, there're times when I pinch myself when I can't believe I'm doing certain things, going to either a certain movie premiere that is very exciting or, you know, Spike's anniversary gathering for a movie, or something; or Oprah Winfrey's South African experience.  Those things are so heady and so amazing, but at the same time, it's very stressful doing those things because we travel so much.  And the kids do complain sometimes that we're going and we're gone, and we're not really doing as much as maybe we would like to with them.  And there are those constraints that, you know, just pull at you.  There's only so much we can do.  My life is very--the career demands are very intense for both of us.
Story_ID: 632891
Speaker 1: And then we both also try to contribute to our communities.  We both host charity events from time to time.  Those things are time consuming.
Speaker 2: Do you have charities that are special to you or to you and Al [Al Roker] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I have, I have two or three that are special to me.  I mean the truth of it is people come up to me regularly and ask me to help.  So there are some that I just sort of do routinely because someone has asked me.  But I have routinely helped with the United Cerebral Palsy campaign.  There's a Women in Need group that helps homeless women that I have routinely helped out with.  There are a few that are sort of like pet groups that I just will do things for.  But, the truth of it is, I think what we have to do--the challenge for Al and me is to sort of limit these things.  This year I have started saying no more.  And it's hard because I have a big heart and I want to help out, and I feel like the only way sometimes I can give back is to lend my name or my presence to something.  I don't feel that I can physically go to the soup kitchen and serve on a regular basis, or do those kinds of things where you are on the ground and in the trenches.  But I feel like I can help a charity by helping them raise money.  But I feel like sometimes it's at the expense of either my family or other things that I need to do.  And on any given week, I may have an assignment that takes a lot of time.  And maybe there's a charity event, and suddenly there's something that's unexpected that came up; and then, maybe there's a trip that comes up that I've got to go and deal with.  And suddenly, four out of the five nights, I'm busy.  And Al and I now are trying to make it a rule essentially in our household that we don't go out more than a couple of nights a week; that we sit down and have dinner with our children [Leila Roker and Nicholas Roker], you know, four or five nights out of the week if we can.  We just feel like that is so important.
Story_ID: 632892
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.  It pains me though to be away from them because I do think about it.  And I'm smart enough to know that it affects our children tremendously later on in life when they have not had that bonding and that great core nurturing experience with their parents.  And I know our children [Leila Roker and Nicholas Roker] do have it, but ultimately, those are the things that they look back on.  And I have read these studies that say children who eat--something--do something as simple as eat dinner with their parents several nights a week are more--are less likely to indulge in drugs and early premarital sex, are more likely to be successful; kids who engage in athletic sports, girls in particular, are much more likely--.  So I think about those things and I take it to heart.  And while this may be great and gratifying for me, and I'm loving my career, and I feel like I'm making my mark and doing things, in the end, unless I turn out two really strong, great children who cannot only hopefully rise to the occasion but do better than I did in certain things in their lives, not necessarily accomplishments, but just being good people, in my mind then I really haven't done it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I can totally--
Speaker 1: And I have seen women in this business who were amazing career icons, who maybe weren't the best parents, and who have actually said that to me.  And I also stop and think about that.
Story_ID: 632893
Speaker 1: You know, as you're balancing your family and all that, there's also this very public life that you have too, and it's not just you; it's you and Al [Al Roker].  It's a very public life.  So, just to bring up the fact, for instance, Al went through the gastric bypass, and you all decided to--you know, he was very public about it.  How do you balance that?  How do you come to the decision to let the public know about that versus keeping something private?
Speaker 2: That's very interesting and it's very hard.  I mean, while I don't think of Al and I as like big celebrities; I mean, I think of people in Hollywood as big celebrities.  But I guess on some level we are because people do come up to us and they recognize us and sometimes they want autographs or whatever.  So I suppose we fall into that category.  It's very hard trying to figure out how much of that feels appropriate, and how much of that feels intrusive and inappropriate.  We certainly are not movie celebrities where we feel like people look at us in that way, in that glamour Hollywood way.  But I do think that people do look at us as people who maybe they admire and think are role models and who they want a piece of.  And I feel like sometimes people don't get it, like where to draw a line and when to pull back.  Because we're in news I think they feel that maybe they're a little more entitled to who we are because we feel a little more real to them, as opposed to a Hollywood couple who's more fiction.  So when Al decided to go public with his bypass I applauded it because I felt like at some point it will be obvious and people will know this.  But I was a little uncomfortable about it, too, because I knew for him this was deeply personal.  Al's weight has always been front and center.  And people have known that he's tried various diets, and he's lost weight and then he's gained weight.  And--it's just out there.  And he really was sort of at an all-time high, and I was very worried about him.  His weight is actually like sort of like that third person in our marriage oftentimes because I'm sort of a health nut, and I'm a fitness-crazed kind of person, and Al struggles.  And this is nothing private for us, but--and I, I'm like any other wife who hondles him a little bit about his eating.  And so, he had hit an all-time high, 300 plus, when he made this decision to do the gastric bypass.  And frankly, even though I threw it out there because I was doing an interview with someone, Carnie Wilson, who was having the bypass surgery, I was actually alarmed when he said he was going to do it.  Because it's one thing to talk about it and to do a report on someone else who's doing it, but I also was aware of the dangers.  And I knew that people could die from this surgery.  So when he wanted to do it, I was very nervous about it, and I didn't want it on me.  I certainly didn't want him to feel that he was doing this for me; that he had to figure it out.  I wanted him to lose weight, I wanted him to do it the old fashioned way.  But I certainly didn't want him to feel that this drastic measure was based on my demands.
Story_ID: 632894
Speaker 1: So when he [Al Roker] decided he wanted to do it, and then decided he wanted to document it for himself so that if he possibly wanted to do anything with it at some point, I was supportive.  We go, he does the surgery.  Fortunately, everything comes out well, thank god.  He starts to respond well and lose the weight in a short amount of time it starts to come off.  And people are talking about how good he looks.  And people knew.  And I don't remember if he was public about it right away or if he waited.  This is before the Star Jones episode where there's all this talk about it.  And frankly, at that time, people still didn't know a whole lot about gastric bypass.  It certainly wasn't, you know, in the lexicon of like, you know, everyday language.  So he was making a decision to talk about it, and then he heard that the National Enquirer was going to do a story.  And we were both absolutely stunned.  His doctor, whom we both liked tremendously, had gone through great lengths to try to ensure privacy, to get him in the hospital in a back door, to try to keep everything very low key in terms of even his name at the hospital; we had an assumed name.  So we were really, really shocked that this was going to happen.  And, Al decided to just grab it back, grab the power back and to go public probably sooner than he might have.  And, while he was not ashamed of it, I think he wanted to do it on his own terms.  And like a lot of other celebrities out there, he was forced to just go and do it.  And so he did.  And I was so proud of him and, you know, could not have supported him more.  But what got me was that, in the Enquirer and some subsequent stories, I was blamed for doing this, for forcing Al to do this.  And I was furious, absolutely furious because nothing could have been further from the truth.  And then later on we discovered that one of the camera crew members actually leaked it to the Enquirer.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so--but he had planned to--
Speaker 1: He had planned to at some point.
Speaker 2: --to be, be public about it?
Speaker 1: He wanted to get really on his feet and just figure out how he wanted to do it.  And being a journalist, he wanted to probably take people on a journey and talk about it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He had had knee surgery, and he had done a piece about that and really talked about how knee surgery works.  So he probably wanted to do it in a very responsible way.  But instead, he had to just sort of quickly figure it out.  But he did do it in a very responsible way, and I encouraged him to make sure that he was clear; that he was not advocating this; that it is a dangerous procedure; that this was his choice.  He had to make that very clear, and he felt strongly about that too.  And he did.
Story_ID: 632895
Speaker 1: And just quickly, do you feel that you need to protect your privacy sometimes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  And I feel like I'm the heavy, and sometimes I come across as the, ahem, rhymes with rich, when we're together, because people think because Al [Al Roker] is this teddy bear, this lovely, you know, jovial guy that they see on television, that they have a right to just invade him at all times and just come up and either make a joke, or be inappropriate, or ask him about his weight or, you know, just sort of accost him, even if he's with his family.  We can be sitting out with the kids having dinner some place, and someone will all but pull up a chair and say, "Oh, my gosh.  I have to tell you, Al, ha ha ha ha."  And if he doesn't, like, break into a rip roaring laugh, they're thrown, like, what's wrong with you?  Hello?  I'm your public.  Or just walk up to him with a camera in their face and like, "Let's take a picture."  And Leila [Leila Roker] is standing right there.
Speaker 1: And how do the children deal with that?
Speaker 2: The kids, the kids don't love it.  And they're at a point now where they respect it and they understand that this is part of who we are, and that we are in the public eye, but this is my dad.  And especially because we do travel and Al travels a lot, and when they have Dad, it's a special time for them to be out with Dad.  They're not loving it when somebody walks up and says, "Oh, by the way, can I--?"  So, I actually encouraged Al to, in a very gentle, nice way, if it feels appropriate to say to people, "I hope you don't mind, I'm just spending some time with my daughter.  But, catch me next time, I'd be happy to take that picture, or you know sign that autograph."  He worries about that because sometimes people are put off by it and think that he's being nasty.  Oh, wow, he's so friendly on television, but he's nasty.  But, you know, how much of that can you do?  And we also want to shield our children from feeling that there's something so extraordinary about us, or feeling that they are in this celebrity bubble.  To the extent that we can we want them to feel like we're just people.  We try to give them those kinds of values.  And we want to try to impart some of that.  And when people are coming up and asking for photo and autographs and we're treating ourselves like celebrities, that's not the message that we're sending.  It's hard though, because I don't think people always understand that, and I think people may look at me as being nasty occasionally.  And I'm always very nice about it because you know I'm a nice person.  I'm always very nice about it.  But as Al says, people want what they want.
Speaker 1: That is true (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's just all there is to it.  They want what they want.  And he was complaining to me the other day about being on a plane, and a guy like--he was just nodding off and a guy woke him up because he wanted to tell him something, and "I want you to know--."  And Al was just like dumbfounded, like hello, I appreciate that, but I'm kind of taking a nap and I'm sitting here in my seat, and they want him to be funny, and they want him to turn on and, "Be 'The Today Show' ['Today'] guy for me."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, you know, people don't get it.
Speaker 1: It's not easy.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Story_ID: 632896
Speaker 1: So going back to news a little bit.  Now you have been in the news business through George the first [President George Herbert Walker Bush], Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], George the second [President George Walker Bush], and on to--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --this new--into this new campaign.  In--over the years, have you seen the news business change?
Speaker 2: You mean politically or just in general?
Speaker 1: In general in the way the business operates on a--way--does this sort of having, you know, this--over the course of those years--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --do things change a bit?
Speaker 2: I have seen the news business change, but not necessarily for the better.  And it's disconcerting for me.  When I joined network news back in 1990, there was a thirst and even a demand for hard edged, distinctive kinds of stories.  There was always a place for human, human interest kinds of stories, social stories about the fabric of our lives.  But, hard hitting, serious, real stories was what it was all about.  And that was one of the reasons I loved network television.  It was different from the county commission meetings and, you know, the topless guy down the street; those kinds of silly stories that you have to do on local news because it makes local news, and that's what you have to do.  So I loved that distinction.  And over the period of time, over these, you know, eighteen years, I have just seen a shift, we've gone softer, and it's really, really disconcerting.  I would like to think that we are maintaining our integrity.  And at our core we still are a network news organization [ABC] that cares tremendously about real news and things that affect people.  But I also see Britney Spears on the cover, not only tabloid magazines, but also being interviewed by some of our anchors.  I also see, you know, any other kind of Hollywood story grabbing a lot of attention for the wrong reasons.
Speaker 1: And how does that affect the kind of work you end up doing?
Speaker 2: Well, it means that sometimes there's almost got to be a little Hollywood edge to a story.  If there's something that I want to do that has a tougher edge--let me just think, for instance.  Maybe, maybe I want to do some kind of a political story for '20/20,' and maybe my executive producer isn't convinced that the end of the week on a Friday night that people want to see yet a political story.  It might be a little more interesting to them if Angelina Jolie wants to talk about her thoughts about the political story because she's a celebrity; she brings in huge numbers; people know and like her, and are curious about Brad Pitt; and she cares a bit about the world.  That's, that's disconcerting to me because sometimes it feels that that's the only way to validate a story.  Now that said, I would still like to think that at our core, we really do care about what matters.  And that same executive producer who might be a little reluctant to want to have me do a story about Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] and Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] this week and how they're neck to neck in this race, also gave me permission to go to Namibia last year and do a story about HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], and how it's wiping out a whole generation of people on this continent and what it is doing to children.  So I will give him that credit.  However, I do believe during any given month it is difficult on the magazine level to sell these hard news stories.  But even through--across the board, I mean, look at the morning television shows.  They're not as hard news as they used to be.  Yes, we report on politics and the economy and all these things of the day, or what's happening in Serbia.  But, you know, we also have a fair amount of tabloid-y kinds of stories (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you think the public is driving that or do you think it's top down?
Speaker 2: I think it's chicken and egg.  I think that--I think what happens is sometimes we may step out there and do one of these unusual, strong stories--I wouldn't want to say unusual--I think sometimes we may put ourselves out there, and we may do a little bit more of a harder edged story, and maybe the ratings might not be there.  We may do a story on, you know, what's happening in Ohio, and the economy, and how people are being affected; or when the writers strike was going on and how people were losing their jobs, just average day to day people maybe weren't working.  Maybe the ratings weren't there.  And we do track our ratings.  For '20/20' we track our ratings minute by minute.  And sometimes we can see--not sometimes, all the times we can see what stories peak and what stories fall.  And oftentimes, it's those harder edged stories that may fall, and it's really upsetting to us, too, as correspondents and producers because we want to push and we want to push, but when it looks like the audience doesn't have an appetite for it, it's hard for us to argue with those stats.
Story_ID: 632897
Speaker 1: Now that said, I still believe that people really do want real news.  I really do.  I just think that we're struggling to figure out how best to do it; how best to tell the story; should it be shorter, should it be longer.  I think we're trying to figure it out because we're in this whole world of new media, we're competing with the web (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I was going to ask you about that because people talk about the fact that now with the Internet, people are getting their news from different places.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So what does that mean for you people here in--
Speaker 1: I sympathize with my executive producer at '20/20' because while, you know, David [David Sloan] and I sometimes we're going on head to head about what stories we want to put on, and he disagrees with me.  At the end of the day, we've got to deal with ratings; we've got to deal with the budget; we have to find a way to continue to exist.  We have to make money.  And, if we're steadily doing stories that are not bringing in an audience, that's a problem.  You know, our audience is eroding already.  We are competing with all these other interests out there, with cable outlets, with the web, with people getting their news--you know, even CNN, I'm sure, which used to be the network of choice if people just wanted quick news.  I mean, I'll never forget, I was doing a story last year out in Idaho, of all places, on a young girl who had killed her parents.  And while we were setting up to talk to these friends of hers, young kids, nineteen, twenty years old, something had happened that day in the news and I had missed it in the morning because I was on my way to go do the interview with them, and they were telling me about it.  And one of them said, "Oh, I saw on the Internet how these investigators are coming in to do" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I thought, she saw it on the Internet.  See, once again, she got her news from the Internet.  She was not even referencing morning television or, you know, any particular network.  She saw it on the Internet, and that is our problem.  Young people today want to get their news from the Internet at a quick little blip.
Speaker 2: So does that send you to the Internet?
Speaker 1: Well, we are doing more and more of it.  I mean, I'm hosting web programs here at ABC from time to time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So now, when did you start, when did you start hosting Web programming?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean we have web programming going on here at ABC, and I am tapped on any given week.
Speaker 2: When did that--when did--do you know when that started?
Speaker 1: A couple--a year or two ago.
Speaker 2: A year or two.
Speaker 1: I would say two or three years ago, ABC jumped into the whole--
Speaker 2: So that would be 2005, '4 [2004], '5 [2005]?
Speaker 1: Somewhere like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, I may be wrong about the absolute date, but ABC has been in the web broadcast business now for three to four years; maybe 2004, 2005.  And now, '20/20' actually has a webcast because we have to.  We have to.
Speaker 2: And is that separate from what airs on TV?
Speaker 1: (Nods head) It's separate.  So we have our program on Friday night at ten o'clock, and then on Monday morning we have a webcast.  So that if you didn't see Friday night or you want to know what we're working on for this week, here it is.  And so, sometimes on Monday, I am plucked or Friday I'm asked, "Can you come on in Monday and host our webcast?"  And it is about bringing in other viewers.  And it is so bizarre because before, I was always consumed with: how can I get on the air?  How can I get on traditional television?  And now I'm also hosting webcasts on ABC because we're struggling to keep those viewers under the tent.
Story_ID: 632898
Speaker 1: And it is a weekly struggle.  I will talk to my boss sometimes about a piece that I had on last week or maybe another piece someone else did, and Monday morning the first question is, "How did we do Friday night?  How did we do?"  And sometimes the answer is, "Ah, you know, okay," or "Oh, not great," or "Actually, better than normal."  But better than normal is not great anymore.  When I joined '20/20,' if we got a seventeen share, or, you know, a seventeen rating and a twenty-one share, we were disappointed because, my gosh, we used to blow it away.  Now if we get a nine rating, you know--I mean, or an eight or something like that, we're thrilled.  It's shocking what has happened in the business (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's changed so much in the last ten years since--from when you started in '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: It's a struggle.  It's a struggle to stay relevant, to stay alive, and so I understand that.  And so, when I get an assignment like running off to London [England] last week to interview the Osbourne kids about celebrity drug addiction, I understand that because I do recognize that that is part of what we--we're doing now, and maybe we have to do to exist.  But as long as I can also go off and interview Michelle Obama, to talk about this campaign and this election, which is so riveting, I feel like, I feel like I'm doing what I need to do.  But because of that, I've, I've really sort of invented myself or reinvented myself as sort of this multiplatform correspondent at ABC.  So on any given week, I might report a story on 'Good Morning America'; I might fill in on the news on 'Good Morning America'; I might report a piece on Imus [Don Imus] and that controversy on 'World News Tonight' ['ABC World News Tonight']; and, I might go and interview the Osbourne kids for '20/20' on Friday night.  But in my mind, not only does that make me valuable and multifaceted, it keeps me fed as a journalist.  I could not do a steady diet of cosmetic surgeries that have gone wrong and vacation mishaps and, you know, those kinds of stories, which do grab ratings for us on '20/20.'  I couldn't do it.
Story_ID: 632899
Speaker 1: So let me ask you, now that we finally have our first female news anchor, you know, with Katie Couric coming on the scene, there was so much excitement and so much hope, and things haven't all worked the way I think people expected them to.  What are your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: I think that it has nothing to do with having a female news anchor.  Maybe, maybe it just wasn't the right fit for Katie.  Katie is a consummate professional.  She is a talented, brilliant broadcaster.  We've watched her over the years just ascend.  And she's also a friend.  I really like her.  I've probably looked to her for advice when she was at NBC and I was there at the same time.  I had modeled myself after her from time to time because I love the fact that she will go out and take risks, and she became sort of like the (air quotes) anti-helmet hair TV anchor.  She was sort of like this plucky girl next door.  I love all that about her.  But Katie had a certain brand at NBC.  She was sort of this adventurer and this journalist who might ask the unexpected in a very different kind of way, who had her finger right smack in the middle of--you know, sort of Middle America.  And maybe it just wasn't the right fit.  It's just like this presidential race with Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] and Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], both poised to break down barriers.  I mean and it's so riveting and exciting to me.  The fact that Hillary Clinton is really duking it out with Barack Obama right now, to me does not suggest that America is just struggling over this issue about a woman.  Maybe they are, and at our core maybe there's a lot of polling to be done here and at the end of the day we will find out.  But I think it could very well be that maybe for some people she's not the woman that they would like to see.  I don't know that that speaks volumes about women as president.  I don't know that this speaks volumes about a woman being the top--one of the top three anchors in our country.  It may just be that Katie wasn't the right fit for a CBS audience, which traditionally has been staid and older.  And Katie had come from a network of people who expected sort of this young and trendy and hip kind of reporter.  So, I feel for Katie because I feel like it was a tough job to step into.  It was completely different environment.  CBS is a different animal from NB- CBS is a totally different animal from NBC.  And I wanted to see this work for her.  I think we were all cheering for her because it was something new and it was something fresh.  And I wanted to see her break down this barrier, and to some degree she really has.
Speaker 1: Do you think her struggles have an impact on women coming behind her or are you saying not necessarily because she's just a woman?
Speaker 2: The optimist in me says not necessarily.  Might it give us pause?  Yes.  Will set us back?  I don't believe so at all.  But we still got powerhouses in this business like Diane Sawyer and Robin Roberts, who's now anchoring aside from her.  Look, we have never had two women anchoring a morning news show together.  There's Robin and Diane, and doing very well, thank you very much.  So I don't think it necessarily means that another woman will not have an opportunity at that job.  Maybe not next, you know, the next year after she leaves, whenever she chooses to leave it.  But, I think that maybe there might be some more thinking about the appropriate woman.  I think there is still a struggle in our society, don't get me wrong.  I think that there is this whole gender thing going on.  And while we've come a long way, I think there is some question about how accepting we are of women in certain roles.  I think that we are probably torn about it a little bit in this society.  But I don't think there's anything about the way Katie delivers the news over at CBS that would cause me to wonder that.  I think it may just be about that network at this time and whether she'd fit.
Story_ID: 632900
Speaker 1: In your mind, where are you in your career now?  How do you see where you are now?  And then where do you see, where do you want to go?
Speaker 2: Oh, I always hate that question.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I always hate that question because if I answer one way, I feel like I'm not ambitious enough.  If I answer it the other way, I feel like I'm just like crazily ambitious (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There is no judgment.  This is just, you know (laughter)--
Speaker 2: No, I realize it.  I always feel like I'm being judged, you know that.  You know what?  I actually--I think for--maybe for the first time in my career I feel really satisfied.  I still feel ambitious because I want to do more, and I feel like I'm sort of hitting my prime in some ways, and I can do more, and I have so much talent that I think that has yet to be tapped.  But, I have a spectacular job [at ABC News] that gives me an opportunity to travel the country, to travel the world; to go to places that I just normally would not turn up in, and talk to people that I probably ordinarily would not necessarily sit across the table from and talk to.  But at the same time, I get to raise my children [Leila Roker and Nicholas Roker] and spend good amounts of time with them, and enjoy a really privileged life.  But yet I'm still there for my mother [Ruth Kaigler Roberts] when she's ailing, and I can take a plane down to Georgia and go check on her, and for my friend who is also in Georgia who is ailing right now.  And I can do that without, you know, apology to anybody.  And--but with also the full knowledge that my job is here [New York, New York] and people know it, and people respect me, and they know that I give it my all, and that I can go upstairs and talk to my boss about a story and say that: "I really feel strongly that we ought to do this."  And he might--not always--but he might very well say, "Yeah, well, maybe we ought to do that."  And that's on the strength of what I have accomplished.  That's on the strength of who I am as a reporter.  That is not about anything other than, you know, that I have worked my tail off, that I have demonstrated to people that I am a deliberate journalist whenever it comes down to it.  But yet I'm also a good person who likes to have fun, and who likes to treat people fairly, and that I bring something to this organization, and that I'm valued.  So I would say for the first time I feel pretty--that if it all ended tomorrow and this was kind of it for me, it's been pretty good, and I have had a fabulous, fabulous career.  And I really do feel content with that.
Story_ID: 632901
Speaker 1: Do you see yourself retiring?  I mean, look, Barbara Walters is umpteen years old--
Speaker 2: And still going.
Speaker 1: --and still going.  Do you see yourself (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know what--
Speaker 1: --going that way?
Speaker 2: --I don't see myself retiring at this point.  I flirt with the notion of stepping off the track now and again, like a lot of high powered career women do, who are balancing a family and career, because it is not easy.  On any given day, I feel like I am stressed to the max or exhausted, or I'm not giving enough in the family area, or not giving enough in the career area.  It is really, really a stressful environment for the most part.  However, I think about stepping off and, you know, just sort of being at home on a regular basis, or trying to figure out that next thing, and I'm at a loss.  So, I, I think as long as I can keep doing it in some capacity--and I do flirt with the notion of sort of reinventing now and again, and maybe I don't do this, but maybe I do television, you know, for somebody else, or maybe I do something in a different area, or webcast forever; I don't know.  But I don't see myself retiring anytime soon.  I just--I enjoy it too much.  And I think as much as I may complain sometimes about how exhausting it is, nothing makes me happier than feeling like I'm contributing in some way and creating something that's interesting, and contributing to a conversation, a national conversation about something.  I feel like when I do my pieces that's what I strive for; I want to get people sort of talking and thinking.  And when somebody stops me some place and says, "I really like the heart that you bring to your stories," (gesture) I feel like I've done it.
Speaker 1: That's great.  That's great.  That is great (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Whatever, I don't know, whatever.  But people say that, and I have to tell you, that really means a lot to me.
Speaker 1: I, I have no doubt it does.
Speaker 2: It means a lot to me when they say that.
Speaker 1: In listening to you talking, I have no doubt it does.  That's what it's about, that's what it's about.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's what it's about.
Story_ID: 632902
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Wow.  My hopes and concerns.  My hopes are that we can sort of try to move beyond maybe a self-consciousness about race.  While race will always be there as an issue that we have to deal with, my hope is that it's not something that sort of dominates us every day and that we can sort of, like, look beyond those constraints and see our lives and the things that we want to achieve, and the things that we would want for our family as just part of what Americans in general should want for their families, and that we won't sort of define ourselves regularly.  I think we will always probably look through that prism because it is who we are.  But I would like to hope that maybe race won't be a chain that is always sort of tugging at us, and that we can sort of begin to define ourselves differently and see for our children ahead something different that doesn't necessarily always have to be framed in race.  And I think that, you know, we've got a little ways to go.  I mean, even my daughter was saying the other day because I think maybe we've sort of heightened her awareness; she was talking about an incident in school in that she was raising her hand, and she says, "I think the teacher kept calling on the white students more."  Which was really interesting because we don't really talk a lot about race in our family.  But, you know, clearly Leila [Leila Roker] is getting a message that something's going on out there.  And so my hope is that, you know, that we can begin at some point to sort of define ourselves less and less by race and more and more about ambition, and achievement, and ideals and dreams.
Story_ID: 632903
Speaker 1: And what, what advice would you give to young journalists coming along?
Speaker 2: My advice is always just stick it out, stick it out, hang in there and believe in yourself.  Because the one thing I will say that is difficult that I have to sort of define from a racial perspective is that in this business, much like any other corporate kind of experience in America, or any kind of industrial kind of experience, it is not necessarily nurturing for blacks.  And I wouldn't say it's necessarily closed off, but it is not necessarily an easy experience if you are a minority.  Because for the most part, management is dominated by white males and people who have a certain experience.  And I think some of it can be benign.  But if they don't have the experience of looking at life and stories and things through a different perspective, your thoughts, your contributions, your sensibilities will be just routinely dismissed.  And sometimes that's very hard to fight against.  And it may not be direct, and you may not feel direct racism in this business, but it's just sometimes very difficult to feel that it is an environment that is friendly to you.  And I think that's where we lose people, and people become discouraged and just decide, you know, I don't need this; I can move on to something else.  I've seen it.  I've seen young, you know, interns or production secretaries here [ABC News] who just felt like maybe their hopes were sort of, you know, crushed.  And I--so my advice is always just hang in there, and believe in yourself, and know that you can get beyond it, and that you've got to thicken up the skin and just get beyond it.  And sometimes, sometimes you win just by being the last one on the dance floor.  And that's, that's what I have to say to people, because it is very easy to get discouraged.  I mean you work in an environment that's for the most part all white in network television.  And for some people that's not easy.

Speaker 1: What do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Wow.  I hope my legacy will be one of--gosh, that's so- I tell you I never even thought about that.  I hope if nothing else I inspire young women in this business, young black women in particular who maybe didn't feel there was a place for them, who maybe felt that there was plum roles occupied by the Carole Simpsons [HistoryMaker Carole Simpson] and the Connie Chungs of the world have sort of all fallen by the wayside, but that there are people who are still coming through this business and blazing a trail.  And, interestingly, and I can't believe that I'm saying this, but I will say it.  I hope also for black women of all hues because for the very longest time all the faces that you saw on network television news were fair-skinned complexion women who had a certain look, and their hair that was long and styled in a certain way.  And then I came along, and for some people, I sort of broke the mold.  And I remember people saying to me, "Oh, my gosh.  It was the first time I had seen a darker-skinned woman prominently displayed on network television."  So I hope, if nothing else, I am a reminder to young women in this business--young women first, and young black women secondly--that, that you know, you can make it.  If it's a dream of yours, that you can make it; and that it is an extremely rewarding career to have, and that, you know, gosh, I mean, wherever you, wherever you come from, if you have a certain dream, that you can achieve it.

Speaker 1: So this is a little tweak on that last question, you know.  What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Mm.  I--you know what, I ask people that all the time.  Now what do I want to be remembered for?  I want to be remembered more than anything as someone who had high standards, who really believed in great quality, but who also really felt that humanity had to coexist with that; that ambition and humanity can coexist.  And that you don't have to have naked ambition with no sense of other people, integrity, and morals, but that you can achieve something and still be a good quality person, and sort of a person who cares about the world and your family, and you can still sort of achieve great things with all those things intact.  That they're--that ambition is not devoid of the human touch.
Speaker 1: And just on a final note, would you say where do you think that comes from in you?  Would you say that comes from, from family, from home, from your town?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) At my heart, at my core, I will always be little Deborah [HistoryMaker Deborah Roberts] from Perry, Georgia.  And it sounds trite, but I am.  And I always think about how I was raised, what my parents [Ruth Kaigler Roberts and Benjamin Roberts, Sr.] instilled in me, who my parents were as people who didn't really have a lot of advantages, and I, I just will never be able to step too far away from that I think.  And I'm happy that I can't.
