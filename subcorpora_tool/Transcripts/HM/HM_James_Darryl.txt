Story_ID: 669891
Speaker 1: So we'll start with what we call People magazine type questions, easy quick questions.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is dessert (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Any particular kind?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm predisposed to like pound cake, good pound cake.  I love bread pudding, especially the kind that you find in New Orleans [Louisiana] with the whiskey sauce that goes along with it.  And I love ice cream.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yum.  What about your favorite color?
Speaker 2: That's a tossup.  I think my favorite color is blue.  As I get older--well, blue, sometimes brown.  As I get older, I think I'm more--I'm going toward, more toward earth tones.

Story_ID: 669892
Speaker 1: So now I'd like to talk about your family.  We'll talk about your family on both sides--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and going back as far as you can--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and let's start with your father.  Tell me your father's name, when and where he was born, and about him?
Speaker 2: My father, who is deceased, his name was Anthony Francis James, Sr. [Anthony James, Sr.].  I have a brother who's a junior [Anthony James, Jr.].  They're from--the family originally from Richmond, Virginia, and he came from a very interesting family.  On--he was the only child on both sides of his family.  He was the only child.  His, his--on his mother's side, on the maternal side of the family, his mother [Pansy Holmes James] had two sisters [Lillian Holmes and Mamie Holmes].  One never married, and the other, she died very young.  So he was the only child.  And then on my grandfather's [Alexander James, Jr.] side of the family, the paternal side of the family, my grandfather had one sister who married, but divorced, never had children.  So he was the only child.  And the family grew up in Richmond, Virginia.  Interestingly enough, on his mother's side of the family, his grandfather [Anthony Holmes] was a contractor.  And my father really had a very interesting knack and skill for, for building things and for making things.  My father could see something, he could, he could make it immediately.  In fact, in our second house in Richmond, when we moved, he virtually built all the furniture in the house, yeah.
Speaker 1: But his father had taught him?
Speaker 2: His, his grandfather (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His grandfather. Okay.
Speaker 2: His grandfather.  His father worked--my, my grandfather actually worked for the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  So, what's interesting is that on my grand- my--on the paternal, paternal side of the family, my grandfather's side of the family, my great-grandmother--her name is Fannie James.  And Fannie James was very good friends--they lived right across the street from each other--she was very good friends with Maggie Walker, Maggie Lena Walker, who was the first African American to found a, a bank.  It was called Consolidated Bank and Trust [St. Luke Penny Savings Bank; Premier Bank, Inc.].  And prior to the formation of Consolidated Bank and Trust, my great-grandmother worked with Maggie Walker, and it was called the St. Luke's society [Independent Order of St. Luke].  You know, back in that day blacks could not bank in, in--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --majority banking, banks, the facility (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So the St. Luke's society was a type of bank?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, before, before Rich- before the Consolidated Bank and Trust Company, St. Luke's society was a society where people could purchase burial policies and, and they could--and did, you know, did some, some banking.  And so Maggie Walker was the president of the organization, and my great-grandmother was the secretary.
Speaker 1: And do you know when the Consolidated Bank and Trust was founded?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, it had to be founded probably in the early, probably the '20s [1920s], '30s [1930s] or something like that [sic. 1903], I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, or maybe even before, but--
Speaker 1: And this was in Richmond?
Speaker 2: Richmond, Virginia, yes.  In fact, the bank still exists, I believe.  I believe it does.  I'm not sure, but I believe it does.
Speaker 1: So, your, this is your great-great-grandmother, Fannie James, who was a secretary for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Great-grandmother.  Got it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How, how far back can you trace your father's family?
Speaker 2: I can't really trace beyond my, my great-grandparents.  I really can't, you know, just that I, that I--that my father would, he'd, he would talk about his, his grandfather a lot because his grandfather really--he went with his grandfather many places.  And his grandfather taught him the trade.  And, and then, of course, when he went to high school, he learned more of how to, you know, how to really apply that trade.  And then my grandfather actually built a number of buildings in Richmond, Virginia.  In fact, my father would say, "Oh, your grandfather--your great-grandfather built this building."  And he would show me some of the buildings that he had built.
Story_ID: 669893
Speaker 1: Did your father's work turn into contracting?
Speaker 2: No.  My father [Anthony James, Sr.] ended up being a physical education teacher in, in Richmond, Virginia, and he worked at Armstrong High School in Richmond, which was one of the historically black high schools.  It was Maggie Walker [Maggie L. Walker High School; Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies, Richmond, Virginia] and Armstrong.  So he worked there for many years, and then eventually, he got a position in Spring Valley, New York at Ramapo senior high school [Ramapo High School], which was a new high school at that time when he--that was back in 1969, I think it was.
Speaker 1: When the family moved to Spring Valley?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Why phys ed [physical education]?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, my father, my father went to Virginia State College [Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], and he played football at Virginia State.  And he always, he always had a interest in, in sports.  And so he ended up being a phys ed teacher, and, and even before there was something called sports medicine, before there was something known as sports medicine, my father knew how to do all those kinds of thing.  You know, he, he could bandage people up.  He could give you what was necessary, you know, for, yeah, for sprains and the only that he couldn't do, of course, say, if it's a break--if something was broken.  But, but back in that day--in fact, something happened to me probably about a week ago.  And I took a page out of my father's book.  I, I guess I sprained my--I went to an event at another church, and I sprained my, my ankle.  And so anyway, I found myself--I was fine.  But then when I woke up that night, my ankle was paining me (laughter).  And what I did was, I did what my father would do.  He would soak your foot in some sort of Epsom salt.  So that's what I did.  And then I didn't have the, the kind of adhesive tape that he would use for, you know, for athletes.  But I had--you're gonna laugh at this, I had that electrical tape, the (unclear) electrical tape.  And I bandaged my foot up.  And the next morning, I was perfectly fine.  I took a page outta my father's book.
Speaker 1: Very good (laughter).
Speaker 2: I just, you know, I told--I was telling my brothers about--I have two brothers [Anthony James, Jr. and Kendall James], I was telling one of my brothers about it.  And he, he was laughing.  He said, "You've gotta be kidding."  I said, "No, I'm fine."
Speaker 1: That's great.  And so even though your father did not follow in his father's footsteps in terms of contracting, he did it as a hobby.
Speaker 2: He did it as a hobby and was translating into something else.  One of the things that my father did in addition to, like anything else, when you're in education, you have to, you know, to take so many credits, you know, during the summer.  So what he would do is that during the summers, he would go away to school, often in Springfield [Massachusetts] or Boston [Massachusetts] to, you know, to take the credits which were necessary in order to--for him to fulfill his responsibilities in education.
Story_ID: 669894
Speaker 1: But also during the summer, he would work at Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts], which is the--
Speaker 2: Af- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) premier, you know, black camp during that time.  And so I grew up going to Camp Atwater all my life, and so he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was--
Speaker 1: --he was the athletic director there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was the athletic director there, and what he did was that when the kids--whenever there were, there were events and activities where young people would participate in and, as a way of, of rewarding them, he would make, he'd make plaques out of wood.  If you go to Camp Atwater today and look in their main building which is called the rec hall [recreation hall], you will see all the plaques that my father [Anthony James, Sr.] has made.  No one has been able to imitate my father in doing that because he had a penmanship that was just unbelievable.  His penmanship was a cross between speedball and calligraphy.  And whenever someone would be a letter from him, they, they knew it was from him because he--also he wrote with a fountain pen.  He always wrote with a fountain pen, purple ink and whenever someone got--
Speaker 2: Purple ink? Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, whenever someone got a letter from, a letter from him, they would know immediately who--without looking at the return, that it was from my father.
Speaker 2: So tell me about Camp Atwater for a minute because that was a very important place for African American children from--I mean it still exists, but there was a time when it was the preeminent place--
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --for black children to go in the summer.
Speaker 1: Sure.  Camp Atwater was one of those experiences that it's hard to, to say in words.  But I can, you know, to the best of my ability, to be able to articulate what it was like.  It was like--it was like being in a, in a very--in a cocoon almost, a very warm and inviting environment where we had friends from all over the United States and even from places in--we had a couple of students who had come from Bermuda, the Bahamas.  And so it was like an amalgamation of, of black children who had come--it was, it was almost like the--I hate to say it, (unclear), but it was almost like the Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] (laughter), you know, camp.  It was almost like that--not totally, but, but it was something like that where people developed such great relationships and friendships that we still have today.  We, you know, it's amazing.
Speaker 2: And where is it?
Speaker 1: It's in East Brookfield, Massachusetts [sic.], which is in the, kind of the southwestern part of Mass- southeastern part of Massachusetts.  It's, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's on a lake, right?
Speaker 1: --it's near, it's on Lake Lashaway.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's in Sturbridge [Massachusetts], it's north of Sturbridge Village [Old Sturbridge Village, Sturbridge, Massachusetts].  It's south of Spencer [Massachusetts] and Worcester, Massachusetts.  It's about maybe forty-five miles southwest of--southeast of Springfield [Massachusetts], and about sixty miles from Boston [Massachusetts].  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And did--at what age did you start going there?
Speaker 1: I started going there probably when I was about four.
Story_ID: 669895
Speaker 1: So when you were four--this is, you know in, certainly in the South, you were living in the South--
Speaker 2: Yes, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, still? Yeah, Jim Crow segregation--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was still--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --significant.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this camp, for many people, represented, you know, a space far away from any of that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, definitely.  So now--and that's why I say, that's why I was saying it's like a cocoon, very safe environment.  There were things that we learned at the camp that you would not learn in many African American communities.  For example, of course, I learned how to swim.  You know, in many African American communities, it was, it was almost like, you know, either you didn't--there was no pool for you to swim in or, or either, if you were near a body--a ocean or something of that nature, your, you know, your family was kind of forbidding you from doing it because people, 'cause kids drowned or something of that nature.  So it was unsafe.  But, you know, I learned how to swim at Atwater, and as a result of it, because I learned how to swim so well, I ended up being water safety instructor.  And not only did I work at Atwater in that capacity, but I worked in Spring Valley [New York] at the, the local pool.  And so that's how I, I made my, my resources during the summer as a lifeguard.  At Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts], I learned how to fence, learned fencing.  There was a man by the name of Arthur Young who just died--we called him Pickles.  He just died probably last year.  And he brought fencing to Atwater.  We had archery at Atwater.  What black child, you know, learned archery?  We had all kinds of--we had swim meets, track meets, all kinds of activities.  So, I mean we were well integrated into, into, into all the kinds of recreational activities and, and sports, but also, there was a cultural bent at Atwater because a fascinating thing about it was that some of your most prolific and profound professors at some of the universities would spend their summers at Atwater, teaching us.  There was Bill Gardener [ph.] who had been at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and also, I think he ended up at a school in Maryland before he retired.  And he would tell these wonderful stories about what happened in these castles in England and Scotland.  And it was fascinating that when I began to travel, I'd go to, you know, go to England to these places, and I'd say, "Oh, this is what Bill was talking about."  It's just--it was just fascinating.  I mean we--our, the education we received at Atwater, you know, was--okay, it was a Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] education (laughter), basically.  It really was, the things that we learned, the values that were inculcated to us.
Speaker 1: And were most of the children from affluent black families?
Speaker 2: Not all, but--not all, but quite a few were.  And then there were a core of children who may have, may come--may have come from Springfield [Massachusetts], you know, so that, you know, it was kind of, almost like--it wasn't like the Fresh Air Fund, but it was something like that where they had scholarships in order to allow children who could not afford to come to camp to--yeah.
Speaker 1: And how did those different groups of children get along?
Speaker 2: We got along very well.  We had no problem getting along.  You know, I find that, that, that children can bypass all the, all the stigmatic things that, you know (laughter), that adults, you know, get kind of, you know, rifled in.  But, but children oversee that.
Story_ID: 669896
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me her name, her birthdate, where she's from.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's name is Laurayne, and I'm a spell it for you because it's not just the regular Laurayne.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's spelled, L-A-U-R-A-Y-N-E, Farrar, F-A-R-R-A-R, James [Laurayne Farrar James].  And my mother was born in June the 9th, 1926.  Mother just turned ninety.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.  And where is she from?
Speaker 2: She's from Bridgeport, Connecticut.
Speaker 1: And tell me about her and her family?
Speaker 2: Long history (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: My mother is from a, a very large family, unlike my father [Anthony James, Sr.], very large family.  There were six girls and one boy.  And the boy was the last one.  My grandmother virtually lived in Bridgeport, Connecticut since she was three years--when she was three years old, her family moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut.  And my grandmother lived to be 108.
Speaker 1: Wow.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Alice Gertrude Farrar [Alice Whiting Farrar].
Speaker 1: And where did the family come from?
Speaker 2: They came from Warrenton, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On my mother's paternal side of the family, my mother's father's name was Edward Farrar.  And he came from Mecklenburg County, Virginia which is like right below Richmond [Virginia].  His parents were born slaves.  And, but when there was emancipation, when they were, you know, when they were freed, they had a large family.  I think there were eleven kids to the family.  And I believe there were something like nine--it was either nine boys, two girls or either eight boys, three girls.  I can't remember right now.  But my grandfather, he moved to, he moved to Connecticut.  But he was not the first.  His brother, Ross [Ross Farrar], moved to Connecticut first.  And then his brother, Ross, when he started working, he sent for my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Why'd they choose Connecticut?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Why did they choose Connecticut?
Speaker 2: Because it, because it was during the height of the, beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and especially, in Bridgeport.  My grandfather worked for the Bridgeport Brass Company [Bridgeport, Connecticut].  So they, there were a lot of, you know, industrial opportunities in Bridgeport.  But what happened with my uncle, my great uncle Ross, was that he ended up working for the mayor of Bridgeport.  He was the driver for P.T. Barnum.  And he, you know, basically, you know, would drive him around and, and he also cooked for him.  He was his driver and his cook.
Speaker 1: So Barnum was the mayor?
Speaker 2: He was the mayor at one time.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah, P.T. Barnum was the mayor, besides having the circus [Barnum and Bailey Circus; Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus], he was the mayor.
Speaker 1: So did the circus come after or do you even know?
Speaker 2: I can't remember.  I have to ask my mother that.  But, but his, Ross' wife--her name was Euphemia [Euphemia Farrar], and Euphemia actually was a seamstress.  And she made clothes for people in the circus, like for Tom Thumb and, and, and those, and all those people like that.  She made, she made their clothes.
Story_ID: 669897
Speaker 1: So at that time, when, when your family began moving to Bridgeport [Connecticut], it was a booming town.
Speaker 2: It was a booming town, right.  But now it's a ghost town (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well. But, yeah, I mean it--as many places that were part of the Industrial Revolution.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But at that time, there was a lot of hope.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, definitely so.  Yeah, like my [maternal] grandfather [Edward Farrar] and my grandmother [Alice Whiting Farrar], you know, they, they never went to college.  I think my grandmother was the first African American to graduate from high school in Bridgeport.  I believe she was.  And, and then my grandfather--I believe he was like--he was much older than my grandmother, than my grandmother.  He was like thirteen, fourteen years older than my grandmother.  But, but their whole thing was, was about education.  And so they made sure that, that all their kids were going to be educated.
Speaker 1: And they had eleven?
Speaker 2: No, not eleven. That was my grandfather.  They had seven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had seven.  And so they were all--they all went to, they all went to school. My--I have an aunt who just, she just died.  She was in her nineties, my aunt Geri, [HistoryMaker] Geraldine Johnson--Farrar Johnson.  She was the first black principal in Bridgeport and eventually became the first black superintendent of schools of Bridgeport.
Speaker 1: So what was Bridgeport--as they're moving in, was it a segregated town?  Were there still black neighborhoods, white neighborhoods in (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, their--
Speaker 1: --and schools?
Speaker 2: Actually, my great-grandmother [sic.], she bought a house in the East End of Bridgeport, and the area was, was predominantly white.  And, in fact, my, my aunts would tell me about--my mother [Laurayne Farrar James] didn't tell me this, but my aunts would tell me that, you know, they had the, the racial, you know, issues and people would call them coons and this and that and the other as they were walking home.  But, you know, but my, my grandmother always said, "Listen, you know, you'll defy all that because of the fact that you know you're bright, you're intelligent and you're beautiful," that kind of thing.  So, so I mean they experienced that.  Also, my--the same aunt who went to, who became the superintendent of schools, she wanted to go to Connecticut State College [New Haven State Teachers College; Southern Connecticut State University, New Haven, Connecticut].  And the teachers kept saying, "No, you need to go someplace like Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] or go--," you know.  And so my father--my grand- my grandfather, who was a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], he went to school, and he said, and he said, "Absolutely not."  He says, "If she wants to go to Connecticut State College," said, "my money will send her to Connecticut State College."  And, of course, she did go, and, of course, you know, it's like, you know, there's, there's that twist of (laughter), you know, of what happens, you know, when things--when people tell you, no, and God tells you, yes, then she ends up becoming, you know, the first in these areas.  So there was, there was segregation--I mean there was--there were, you know, there were some racial issues in Bridgeport, but not to the extent that there were, like when we moved to Virginia, you know, well, actually, when my mother moved to Virginia.  But--
Speaker 1: So, your mother was born in Bridgeport though?
Speaker 2: She was born in Bridgeport, and raised in Bridgeport, and that's where she--they went to the--local schools, that they went to, they were, you know, they were few and far in between in terms of the number of, of black children who were in those schools at that time.
Speaker 1: So she primarily went to white schools?
Speaker 2: Well, they were predominantly white, but they--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but there were black students there--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --at the school, yes.
Story_ID: 669898
Speaker 1: Your parents, how did they meet?
Speaker 2: My father [Anthony James, Sr.] would go to work at the Bridgeport Brass Company [Bridgeport, Connecticut] where my [maternal] grandfather [Edward Farrar] worked.  And, of course, you know, they developed a relationship, you know, and my father would, would bring some of the other kids up, you know, from Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  They'd go in the summer.  And so, anyway, he heard that, you know, he had six daughters (laughter).  And so one thing led to another, and eventually he met my mother [Laurayne Farrar James], and that's what happened.
Speaker 1: So did they marry in Bridgeport [Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: Yes, they married in Bridgeport in my, my grandparents' backyard--well, not in the backyard.  They, they actually married at the Methodist church 'cause my, my grandmother [Alice Whiting Farrar] was the organist at the Walters Memorial A.M.E. Church [Walters Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church, Bridgeport, Connecticut] for fifty years.  And while she would go to her church--this is interesting, while she would go to her church, my grandfather would go to the Baptist church.  It was called the Messiah Baptist Church [Bridgeport, Connecticut].  And the kids would walk up the street to Sunday school to Newfield Methodist Church [Golden Hill United Methodist Church, Bridgeport, Connecticut]--
Speaker 1: Where your mother went? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So they would all go to the Methodist church, but they were all musically inclined.  They all played piano.  My grand- 'cause my grandmother, you know, played piano for years and played organ.
Speaker 1: And so how long did they stay in Bridgeport--'cause you said your--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother stayed there until she got married.
Speaker 1: And then they moved to?
Speaker 2: To Richmond [Virginia], yes.
Speaker 1: To Richmond.  So when did they get married?
Speaker 2: Sometime in the '40s [1940s], I know.  It was like in the '40s [1940s].  I, I can't remember, maybe '46 [1946] or something like that--forty--I don't know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was--why?  Your father's work was in Richmond?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father's work was in Richmond, and that was the reason (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What, what did he do?
Speaker 2: He was the athletic--
Speaker 1: Right.  So it, right--
Speaker 2: He was the--yeah--
Speaker 1: --so it was--he was at a school there?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was, yes.
Speaker 1: Got it, got it, just wanted to be clear on that.
Story_ID: 669899
Speaker 1: When you think back on your earliest days--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Probably Christmas (laughter), and that's because, I don't know, Christmas, you know, especially in, in our house, my mother [Laurayne Farrar James] was, you know, you know, it's always baking something, brownies, you know, the Christmas cookies.  I mean everything was done, freshly done.  And my mother would kill me if I said this, she wasn't the greatest cook, but she could bake some good, some good desserts (laughter), yes.
Speaker 1: That's where your love of dessert comes from?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, yeah.  And then there was always the, you know, the Smithfield ham was a big thing in Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: In Virginia, rather.  So, you know, you had a Smithfield ham, so just the smells of the house is one of the, one of the things I really remember.
Story_ID: 669900
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So expand on that.  What are the sights, sounds and smells that you remember from growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember, you know, like Sunday, that was always chicken day (laughter), fried chicken.  Mother [Laurayne Farrar James] didn't fry very much, but fried chicken, I just remember that, and I remember, you know, we lived in a place called Brookfield Gardens [Richmond, Virginia] when we were growing up.  And we would--you know, it was just my older brother [Anthony James, Jr.] and I.  My other brother [Kendall James] is ten years younger than we are. So--
Speaker 1: So they're three of you?
Speaker 2: There're three of us, yes, three boys. So I remember that Brookfield was a very close knit community.  All the families and especially, all the parents, you know, they were just starting out, but they were doing some significant thing, you know.  They were, you know some were going to medical school, some were going to law school.  My best friend's father was, he had just finished dental school.  So, it's that kind of thing, and then right across the street from where we lived, which is fascinating, Spottswood Robinson [Spottswood William Robinson III] lived across the street from where we lived when, when I was, when I was, you know, very, very young.  And my father [Anthony James, Sr.]--and it was during that, back in that day when Spottswood and others, they were talking Brown vs. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]--this is before I was born, of course, right.  I'm--before I was born.  My father would tell me about that.  He would say, he'd say, you know, Spottswood was really, you know, pulling off this thing about, you know, Brown vs. Board of Education.  So that was a, real big buzz back in the neighborhood in those days.  And I, I was just, I was just being born then.
Story_ID: 669901
Speaker 1: The fact that this was being discussed, your parents [Laurayne Farrar James and Anthony James, Sr.] were actively talking about what was going on in civil rights (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my mother was always involved in civil rights, always involved in civil rights.  In fact, my mother was the Richmond [Virginia] coordinator for the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  So I remember very well going to the--I didn't go to the March on Washington 'cause I was just too young, you know, then.  But I remember my mother--
Speaker 1: But did she go?
Speaker 2: No, no, she didn't go to the March on Washington, but what she did though, was that the people who were going on buses, coming up through Richmond, they would stop at one of the universities.  And my mother would--and they would make, they would, they would have sandwiches and drinks and that kind of thing.  I remember that vividly.  They would have all kinds of things, you know, for them in preparation.  So I mean it was like a well oiled machine in terms of really helping people to, you know, to really get up to the March on Washington.  I do remember more vividly, the Poor People's Campaign because I actually went.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was--Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had just died, so I think that was like sixty--'68 [1968]--sixty, yeah.  I think it was '68 [1968] or '69 [1969], something like that, '68 [1968], I think it was.  I think Dr. King had just died.
Speaker 1: He died in '68 [1968], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he had just died when the Poor People's Campaign, but what I remember about that was that, going with my mother and there was a priest.  His name was--they called him Pope Gregory [Edward Meeks "Pope" Gregory].  And Pope Gregory was a white priest who was, I mean a real liberal priest who was for social development and civil rights.  And he had a very small, a very tiny, small Episcopal church, tiny Episcopal church [St. Peter's Episcopal Church] on the--in Church Hill [Richmond, Virginia].  In fact, my father's good friend was, was a member of that church.  And I remember Pope being very--and Pope was from a very wealthy family.  And he didn't care what anyone said because he used his resources in order to promote civil rights.  He really did.  He was, he was quite a person.  I mean--
Speaker 1: So growing up in a household where your mother's actively involved in SCLC, you participated in this march--you're young, you're still young (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, very young.
Speaker 1: --at this time.  How were your views developing on civil rights?
Speaker 2: Well, I always knew that there was something indelibly within me to really, you know, promote the social good and the common good of people.  And I, I think that the way that I found it was through the, through the church.  And, and so, you know, I, I was--I went with 'em.  Actually, with my mother going to the Poor People's Campaign but there were the communities where there were people of color who had no water, no lights, no, you know--I mean they had outhouses, and virtually, very few amenities.  And my mother would go and we would take all kinds of items.  So my--
Speaker 1: Was she going there on behalf of SCLC?
Speaker 2: Of SCLC at the time, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And this is in Virginia.  So is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --where you're going--
Speaker 2: This was like--
Speaker 1: --a real rural area?
Speaker 2: This is in rural area.  I remember the--I don't know how I remember this.  The area was called Waverly, Virginia.  I remember it distinctly.  And I remember there was a, there was an old gentleman who was blind.  And it looked like nobody was taking care of him, and he--there were just flies all over him.  And I remember my mother going, you know, to this community because what they were, what they were--what she was advocating was that, there was a need for the city father or the, you know, the town people--(unclear) leaders to do something about the, you know, the poverty which was in the area.  And so I've always been socially minded in that way, civil rights, social issues in the community.
Speaker 1: Did your brothers go with you?
Speaker 2: Actually, my brother didn't go with me because--no, my, my other brother was--
Speaker 1: Well, your other brother [Kendall James] wasn't even born at that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was, he was kind of--he was young.  But the other brother [Anthony James, Jr.], no, why I ended up, I don't know.  I don't know.  For some reason, I went with her most of the time--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  My other brother wasn't--no.
Story_ID: 669902
Speaker 1: And what church did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: I grew up in the St. Philip's Episcopal Church in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And so, it, was it your parents or your [maternal] grandparents who were going to the two separate churches?
Speaker 2: My grandparents.
Speaker 1: That was your grandparents.  So how did you get--
Speaker 2: In the Episcopal church?
Speaker 1: Yes--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, your grandfather [Edward Farrar] was Baptist, your grandmother [Alice Whiting Farrar] was--
Speaker 2: Was A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion].
Speaker 1: A.M.E. Zion.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're Episcopal.  How did that come to be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, what happened was my father [Anthony James, Sr.] began going to church as a young, as a young person of about ten years old with my--with his aunt, my great aunt, his aunt Mamie [Mamie Holmes].  And, and he enjoyed the service, you know.  He felt that the Baptist church, first all, it was too long (laughter), too loud.  My father was really quiet.  He was, he was a gentle giant, very, very quiet.  And so then he, he, you know, he was baptized in that church and then confirmed.
Speaker 1: Baptized in?
Speaker 2: In the Episcopal church and then confirmed.
Speaker 1: As a, as a boy?
Speaker 2: As a boy, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he was going with your great aunt?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And she was part of that church.
Speaker 2: She was a part of that, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, I'm curious about choosing the Episcopal church as opposed to the African Methodist Episcopal church 'cause those are two different churches.
Speaker 2: Yes, they are, yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know why that choice?
Speaker 2: I think--my father, once again, my father was modeling my, you know, his aunt, you know, who my--this is my grandmother's sister, who went to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] as a young woman, and then eventually, she moved to New York [New York] and went to Columbia [Columbia University] and got her master's [degree] and worked in the public school system here for many years.  And so I think, I think my father, you know, really admired her, you know, and I think she encouraged him in terms of education and so, so that's basically how our family got in the Episcopal church, was through my--
Speaker 1: And he--around what year might this have been when he joined the Episcopal church?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  I would probably say, probably in the mid-'20s [1920s].  My, my father was, was five years older than my mother [Laurayne Farrar James].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 669903
Speaker 1: Just for context, the Episcopal church had already had a black man to be in the leadership role, in the 1800s, right.  There was Absalom, what's his name?
Speaker 2: Absalom Jones, yeah.  That was back in, yeah, actually, the--yeah, Absalom Jones was the, was the first black Episcopal priest in the American church, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, well--and just contextually in religious history that was unusual.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the Episcopal church always had a social, always had some sort of, you know, social development for, for people of color.  In fact, you'll--historically, you'll read where the bishop of South Carolina--this is probably back in the early--the late, yeah, the 19th century, where the bishop of South Carolina indicated that there were more blacks in his, (laughter) in his diocese than there were whites.  And that's because--
Speaker 1: South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in South Carolina, and that's because of the slaves that were Christianized.  Yeah, so this was in the 19th century, yeah.  So, so the Episcopal church has always had a--it's just in, within the last, I would say the 20th century that more black people have moved to the, to the Baptist traditions, and, but there were blacks in the Episcopal church, even from the very beginning when, back, you know, during the time of the Mayflower, there were, there were blacks, you know, who were Christianized in the Epis- Anthony and Isabel, I remember from my history.  Anthony and Isabel were the first blacks Christianized in the--baptized in the Episcopal church or it was called Anglican church then.
Speaker 1: And they were free people?
Speaker 2: No, they weren't free.  They were slaves.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they able to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They--
Speaker 1: --go to church together?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was, what they did was that--they said, "Even though you are baptized, that does not make you a free person," (laughter).  So, there was always either the gallery or the back of, you know, the back of the church or something (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But they were allowed to come to church.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they made--yeah, they were allowed to come, yes.
Speaker 1: So your mother [Laurayne Farrar James] then--your parents were both in, at St. Philip's [St. Philip's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, when, my mother married my father [Anthony James, Sr.], she, she became an Episcopalian.
Speaker 1: Oh, because he was.
Speaker 2: He was, yeah.  And she wanted the whole family to go to the same church.
Speaker 1: Well, and she had grown up where that hadn't happened.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, well, no.  When she was living in Bridgeport [Connecticut], there was a church called St. Mark's [St. Mark's Episcopal Church].  It was a very, you know, very prominent African American church, and so she had grown up--a lot of her girlfriends went to that church and were married in that church.  And she was in some of their, their weddings.  So she kind of grew up with a lot of them, yeah.  So she, she kind of was familiar with the Episcopal tradition.
Story_ID: 669904
Speaker 1: And so for you, growing up in the Episcopal church, what was your childhood like in church?
Speaker 2: Ah, interesting.  I was the kind of child who I loved church, and, in fact, I would often go to church alone.  And if my parents [Laurayne Farrar James and Anthony James, Sr.] did not take me, and as I got a little older, I started riding my bicycle to church.
Speaker 1: So how far away is church from your home?
Speaker 2: Back in that day, it was probably about two and a half miles, and so I'd ride my bike to church or, you know, there were occasions where maybe somebody was going that way, and I'd get a ride.  But, but I just, I loved church, and what I would do, I'd go to the Episcopal church--I always went to eight o'clock Mass.  I didn't like going to ten o'clock Mass--I'm sorry, eleven o'clock.  It was eleven o'clock Mass back in that day.  And that's because of the fact that at eight o'clock, we had the Eucharist every Sunday.  At eleven o'clock, they usually had morning prayer every other Sunday, and I just like, I was like, oh, no, I don't quite wanna hear all this (laughter).
Speaker 1: So the Eucharist is what?
Speaker 2: The Eucharist is communion.  The Eucharist means--it comes from the Latin word, eucharistia, which means thanksgiving.  So it's a great thanksgiving of God.
Speaker 1: And even as a child, you were able to take communion?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Not all churches allow that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what happened, I took communion, especially after I was confirmed.
Speaker 1: And is that at thirteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I was--at that time, I was confirmed like, I was probably about twelve.
Speaker 1: So but around that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was about--probably around, I was probably around twelve, yeah.  But I, but I took, you know, took communion.  And so anyway, I had to go to, I had to ride my bike, bicycle to church, and often, what I would do, I'd go to church with, you know, at St. Philip's [St. Philip's Episcopal Church].  And then I would go two blocks down the street from where St. Philip's was located on the North Side [Richmond, Virginia] to First African Baptist Church [Richmond, Virginia] to meet my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's where she--you would meet her after?
Speaker 2: Yes.  This is, this is my paternal grandmother [Pansy Holmes James], my father's mother.  And--
Speaker 1: And what did you do after?
Speaker 2: And so anyway, I'd go, I'd go to meet her, and I'd go and listen to the, to the choirs.  I loved the choir (laughter).  So I'd go listen to, you know--that's why I'm kind of predisposed to the music which is in what we call the hymnal which is 'Lift Every Voice and Sing,' which is the African American hymnal in the Episcopal church.  But I would go listen to the choir, and watch the choir march down.  I watched the little ladies shout (laughter).  I always liked that.
Speaker 1: You got a bit of both traditions--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, I did.  I, yeah, and so anyway, and then--but, you know, I, sometimes I'd go to three churches in one, in one Sunday.
Speaker 1: And did you go to church during the week as well?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh, no, just--because, you know, the only time I could go is, would be like at night or something of that nature, and then most churches were not open, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: When did you know that you were interested in--
Speaker 2: Ministry?
Speaker 1: Ministry.
Speaker 2: I was, when I was confirmed.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, the only, the only way that I can describe it, is that it was similar to Jesus going to John the Baptist and coming out of the water, you know, and the, the dove descending upon them.  In other words, I felt the spirit, I really felt the, the spirit of God anointing me when the bishop laid his hands on me.  And by the way, having grown up in the Episcopal church, in predominantly, African American Episcopal church, I was totally caught off guard and surprised when the white bishop showed up because (laughter), I thought, you know, all I knew all my life was, were black priests.  I didn't, didn't know anything else.
Speaker 1: Because St. Philip's was a black church.
Speaker 2: It was predominantly African American.  It was predomin- it was an African American church, yes, still is today, yes.  And so--
Speaker 1: But sometimes for confirmation, they do bring the bishops in, right?
Speaker 2: No, the bishop does the confirmation.
Speaker 1: He does.  Is that the tradition?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That the bishop (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: In any of the Episcopalian churches, the bishop--
Speaker 2: Yes, the bishop does confirmation.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, so, I was never so surprised.  I said--I was shocked.  I really felt something, really felt the presence and the spirit of God.  And, and I, and I'll tell you, and so I went to church every Sunday, often without my parents. I just went.
Speaker 1: Did you share this with your parents?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I really didn't disclose this until later on when I went through discernment process about ministry.
Story_ID: 669905
Speaker 1: So as you're growing up, what schools did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Albert V. Norrell Elementary School which is on the North Side of town [Richmond, Virginia], and then from there, I went to--when schools, when Richmond [Virginia] started going through desegregation, I went to J.E.B. Stuart [J.E.B. Stuart Elementary School, Richmond, Virginia] and to Chandler [J.A.C. Chandler Junior High School, Richmond, Virginia].  And then I went to Armstrong [Armstrong High School, Richmond, Virginia] for one year before we moved to New York.  So--
Speaker 1: So with desegregation, were you bused or how did you get to those schools?
Speaker 2: Actually, we caught the bus (laughter).
Speaker 1: There's no special buses?
Speaker 2: No, there's no special bus.  We caught the bus.
Speaker 1: How far away were these schools from where you lived?
Speaker 2: They were pretty far, but, but, you know.
Speaker 1: And did you have any racially charged experiences going now to integrated schools?
Speaker 2: The only thing that I can remember is that there was a teacher that I had--I think it was in fifth grade.  And I had gone to, I had gone to my cousin's wedding, my oldest cousin, he got married in Montreal, Canada.  And I remember us, you know, traveling to Canada, traveling all around, and so I came back, and I wrote about my experience.  And it's almost like she's like, "You didn't do this," (laughter), kind of thing.  You know, I, I think that she, she couldn't, she couldn't, you know, didn't believe that I, that I had those experiences or something, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?  What were you experiencing that she didn't believe?
Speaker 2: Well, at--almost as if, you know, there was a sense of--it's almost like a sense of jealousy, you know, almost.
Story_ID: 669906
Speaker 1: What prompted the move to New York?
Speaker 2: My father [Anthony James, Sr.] had been looking at, you know, really trying to develop and do something a little differently with, you know, with his educational opportunities.  And he, he started, you know, researching--and, he had a friend, actually, who had been (unclear) out of water as well, and who encouraged him to come to Spring Valley, New York.  And so that's, that's--
Speaker 1: The Spring Valley is--describe where Spring Valley is, in New York State.
Speaker 2: Right, Spring Valley is in Rockland County [New York].  It's on the other side of the Tappan Zee Bridge.  It's about thirty miles from New York City [New York, New York].  During that time, Spring Valley was a predominantly, I would say, largely, you know, a Jewish community.  And out of seventeen hundred students who went to the school [Ramapo High School, Spring Valley, New York], I would say there probably were about fifty blacks out of the seventeen hundred students back in that day.  So it was, it was a brand new school, brand new school.
Speaker 1: So you've moved now from the South--
Speaker 2: To the North, totally different.
Speaker 1: Predominantly black neighborhood in the South.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Black church.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Black--predominantly black experience.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, you're in a predominantly Jewish environment.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Predominantly white school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that transition like for you?
Speaker 2: It was kind of exciting to me because I, you know, all I had known on my--yeah, I will say this.  I can't say I, I knew that, you know, because when I--my [maternal] grandmother [Alice Whiting Farrar] living in, in Bridgeport [Connecticut], she lived in a predominantly, you know, white community.  So, you know, we had white neighbors, and so I was, I was used to that.  But, you know, but Richmond [Virginia] was just totally different.  So going to New York, it was exciting, you know, going to a new environment, having new friends, doing some different things.  For example, like, you know, Richmond, we, we didn't have hockey in Richmond (laughter).  I played, you know, learned how to--I learned how to ice skate, learned how to play ice hockey.
Speaker 1: Well, and it was much colder than you, I mean you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, of course, it was, yeah.  But you get used to that.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you moved?
Speaker 2: Thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --pivotal time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fourteen, at fourteen, fourteen.
Speaker 1: But that's a--you know, you're just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --becoming a teenager, kind of growing into yourself--
Speaker 2: Right, definitely so. Yeah.
Story_ID: 669907
Speaker 1: So you, you pick up these winter sports?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) How were you as a student?
Speaker 2: I was, I was a pretty good student.  I was pretty good, you know.  I don't, I, I wasn't like, you know, straight A's or anything of that nature, but I was pretty--I was, I was pretty decent, pretty decent.
Speaker 1: And as a teenager--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --now, this is a couple of years after you have the awareness that the ministry is your calling.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you're a teenager too.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what's happening in terms of you, as you're growing up, you're in a new town, and the spiritual calling is there?
Speaker 2: Right, well, I didn't go to church--I, initially, I didn't go to church that much, initially.  And if I did go to church, I'd go to church across the street.  There was a, a school that had--where they would have a Catholic Mass.  And so I'd go to the Catholic Mass, and--
Speaker 1: Which is similar, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, similar, yeah.  So I'd go to the Catholic Mass for the most part, and then on weekends, because there was very little to do in Spring Valley [New York], you know, especially for a young, you know, black adolescent, I ended up going to Westchester [Westchester County, New York] because all my friends who went to Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts] lived in Westchester.  So Westchester became my hangout.
Speaker 1: Which part?
Speaker 2: In White Plains [New York]--White Plains and Mount Vernon [New York].  Mount Vernon first, actually, but, and then White Plains also.  So I would go across that bridge [Tappan Zee Bridge] almost every (laughter) weekend, you know, to, to Westchester because, yeah, I could go to the Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] parties.  I could do all kinds of things, until I met Connie Russell [ph.], who became kind of like, my friend.  And there were a couple of us, you know, who kind of, you know, banded together, yeah.  So, yeah, so I would, I would--I'd be away most of the time on the weekend.
Speaker 1: How'd you get there?
Speaker 2: I'd get on the bus and go.
Speaker 1: Very good.
Speaker 2: I became very--
Speaker 1: Independent.
Speaker 2: --a very savvy traveler--
Speaker 1: --(laughter).
Speaker 2: --as a, as an adolescent.
Speaker 1: Very good.
Story_ID: 669908
Speaker 1: So you're going to Westchester [Westchester County, New York] to hang out with your friends.  What are you all doing (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, gosh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are the teenage boys doing (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, my best friend at that time, her name was Lisa Challenger [ph.], and Lisa's father had a 1965 Mustang [Ford Mustang].  And Lisa and I would get in that Mustang, and we would travel all over Westchester to go to all the parties and all the events.  If we were coming to the city [New York, New York], we didn't take the, the car, but what we would do is we'd get on the train.  And back in that day, you know, nobody bothered you on the train.  We would, we would go all the way from 236th [Street], wherever it was, you know, Cortlandt [Street], all the way down to, to Brooklyn [New York] to go to a party back in that day.  And nobody ever bothered you.
Speaker 1: And your parents [Laurayne Farrar James and Anthony James, Sr.] were fine with you just being off?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, what was interesting was that, you know, my parents were, you know, fine, 'cause they knew I wasn't going to do anything that much.  But, but Lisa's father, I think he was starting to have dementia and Alzheimer's.  And so anyway, I think he had stopped driving anyway.  So her sister was really like, you know--and her mother had died.  So her sister was like the, the guardian, so to speak.
Speaker 1: And she had more freedom, given just--
Speaker 2: Oh, she had a lot of freedom, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 669909
Speaker 1: The school in Spring Valley [New York], wh- you started in high school [Ramapo High School]? That's where it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, started in high school.
Speaker 1: --the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the large school with seventeen hundred students.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you leave there.  Where do you go to college?
Speaker 2: Went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And how did that become your choice?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a family school.  My mother [Laurayne Farrar James] had gone to Howard.  My uncle had gone to Howard.  My brother [Anthony James, Jr.] was currently at Howard when I wanted to go, and then about four or five of us went, you know, cousins, we all went there together.  So, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Really.  What year?
Speaker 2: In 1972.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-two [1972].  So what's happening on Howard's campus?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Howard has always--
Speaker 2: Everything is happening.
Speaker 1: Throbbing with energy, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, everything is happening.  It was the, it was like on the tail end of the, of the Black Power movement.  And there was still, you know, this strive for (unclear) for, you know, for black nationalism and black power.  There was also, the Black Muslims were doing something.  It was black solidarity, so we would go to some of their events.  Howard always had some of the greatest, you know, African American notables who would come there to speak to us, like [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory would come, and everybody would get his, his book.  What was that, Eat--something Eat--
Speaker 1: I can't remember the name of it, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not 'You Are What You Eat,' but something like that. ['Natural Diet for Folks Who Eat: Cookin' with Mother Nature,' Dick Gregory].  And, as a result of it, I actually became (laughter) somewhat of a half time vegetarian (laughter) doing that.
Speaker 1: He was definitely promoting it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was promoting it.
Speaker 1: --and juicing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he was, yeah.  Yeah, so, you know, some of the greatest musicians would come, especially, I remember Gil Scott-Heron, you know, people who had that, that kind of drive for, for helping people of color to, to really, you know, develop themselves and to think well of themselves.  And so--
Speaker 1: And what was your major?
Speaker 2: Major was political science.
Speaker 1: So as you're--one of the things--I went to Howard too.  One of the things that--
Speaker 2: Maybe that's where I know you (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Maybe. One of the things that's true about Howard is that, there're black people who come from all over--
Speaker 2: All over.
Speaker 1: --the country and all over the world.  Now, you had had this experience to a certain extent at Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, what did, what is it like for you coming to Howard and, and who are you meeting and what's the diversity of the campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that time, I would say about 25 percent of the student population were international students.  It was just, it was unbelievable.  I met people from all over the world.  It was a great time because of the fact that Howard had just won the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] soccer--they had won NCAA in soccer, and so it was just, it was just an--
Speaker 1: That's historic.  Howard is not known for winning things--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but what happened, yeah, but what happened--you're right, it's not historic.  But it is historic because, but Howard's not, not used to that.  But what happened was that those guys were coming from all over.  You know, we had--the soccer team was comprised of people from Nigeria, Trinidad, all over the world until the NCAA changed the rules (laughter).  That's what happened.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well, some of these guys had played for other teams, and so then the NCAA sort of said, "Well, if you're playing for another team outside of, you know, your school team, then, then you're not eligible to play."  So they changed, they changed the rulebook on us--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --when we started winning.

Speaker 1: What were your activities?  What did you do while you were at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, what didn't I do?  (Laughter) I was in the band.  I--
Speaker 1: What did you play?
Speaker 2: I played clarinet in the band.  I was in the gospel choir.  And when I first got there, I was the vice president for student government for the freshman class.  I ended up becoming the second Mr. Howard (laughter).  So, I did everything.  I traveled extensively.  I--but also while I was doing all that, I got--I became actively involved in student ministry in, in student ministry.  I was involved in the Absalom Jones student Episcopal association [Absalom Jones Student Association] for the university.  It was run by Father E. Nathaniel Porter, who was the chaplain, the Episcopal chaplain, and that's what really catapulted me in my, my really drive for ministry.
Speaker 1: While at Howard.
Speaker 2: While at Howard.  You know, I, I had it, but, but, you know, I was like, "Ah, I don't wanna do that," you know.  I didn't want anything to do with the Episcopal church, I said, because, you know, "It's an all-white church, and they're--and they're not doing anything for people of color."  And, you know, the--that was my--especially going to Howard (laughter).  So I really saw a different side of the church.
Speaker 1: Through this society.
Speaker 2: Through the society, through the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And did you learn through that society what some of the advocacy had been prior, 'cause like when you were--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a little boy, there was a lot of advocacy in the Episcopal church--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on behalf of black people.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, definitely so.  And the thing that really helped tremendously was that I traveled, you know, pretty extensively--
Speaker 1: While at Howard.
Speaker 2: While at Howard with the, with the, the Episcopal organization.  And I met people from all walks of life, and was seeing what they were doing with poverty and, you know, and some of the, some of the social ills of our society.
Speaker 1: Where were you going?
Speaker 2: I was going to like, for example, to Florida.  There was a, a conference called Morning Star where students from all over the United States had come.  And I also met black priests that I had--that were just phenomenal, just phenomenal in what they did; went to Texas, went to--oh, to Atlanta [Georgia].  Oh, that was--that's the thing that really caught me.  That really got me when I was invited to go to Atlanta to a conference.  And that really honed me in, I think.
Speaker 1: What happened there?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, you know, a part--you know, they had all kinds of activities and meetings, and I got a chance to see the Atlanta University complex [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] and, you know, see Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--where Dr. King, you know, was, was, was buried, and, and saw all those kinds of things, and it just really left an indelible impression upon me.
Story_ID: 669911
Speaker 1: While at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], you're studying political science, that you decided, next you were definitely gonna pursue the ministry?
Speaker 2: (Pause) It was always in the back of my mind, and Father Porter [E. Nathaniel Porter] always said to me--it was Father Porter, and it was another priest who's still living.  His name is Jesse Anderson [ph.].  Jesse--and they would say, "Hey, man, you know, just go for a year, an experiential year and see what it's like."  And I was like, "Nah, nah, nah, no."  But I came back--I had gone to Atlanta [Georgia] for an event, and when I, when I came back, I really had one of those Paul on the road to Damascus [Syria] experiences, and it's just like, yeah, the spirits are saying, you know, "Just go, go," (laughter).  And I was like, "No, no," (laughter).  "Go, go."  When I got back, I remember Father Porter.  He couldn't believe that, you know, that I had actually said that I would go for a year.
Speaker 1: And so where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went first to the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta for a year.  And they had a--the Absalom Jones student Episcopal--the Absalom Jones--oh, what was it called?  The Absalom Jones--they had several schools, you know, that were there, that were part of the interdenominational center and one was the Absalom Jones school [Absalom Jones Theological Institute].
Speaker 1: So that was focusing through the African (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On Episcopal--
Speaker 1: --American lens?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, so through a, through an African American lens, I met, you know, people from, from other denominations and who were really developing in ministry, and so, I mean, and I learned about good preaching (laughter) there.  And then while I was there, the first African American diocesan bishop of the United States.  His name was John Melville Burgess [HistoryMaker Bishop John Burgess].  He came down, 'cause he was recruiting students to Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut], and he met me.  And he said to me, he said, "Listen, I want you to come up to Yale for a visit."  So I went to Yale for the visit, and then the next thing I knew, he said, he said, "I need--," he said, "I think you would be good here because the--," at, at, in Atlanta, it was only good for--I could only be there really for a year 'cause they didn't have all the, all the requirements, you know, that I needed for the priesthood.  So I went to Yale, it's called Yale, and, and an arm of Yale is also Berkeley [Berkeley Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut], which was the Episcopal arm of the school.  And so they had all the requisite, you know, and certificates that I needed.  And so anyway, I went to, I went, you know, went to a visit, and the next thing I knew, I applied and there I am for a couple of years, and graduated. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you were--what, what years were you at Yale?
Speaker 2: I was there from '77 [1977] to '79 [1979].
Story_ID: 669912
Speaker 1: So what's going on in our country at the time that you are at Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut]?  You know, what's happening socially that is informing your study?
Speaker 2: It's kind of hard to say because I was so busy in my studies (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So much so that you weren't paying attention to what's going on outside--
Speaker 2: No, not that I wasn't paying attention, but, 'cause let me see, '77 [1977] to '79 [1979], I was, I was really involved with what was called the black church at Yale.  And so there was, you know, there was still that black consciousness for me.  And I don't know, I mean I felt like I was in a cocoon again, you know, that, you know, because you're, you're in an environment where you're not dealing with, you know, mostly racial issues and that kind of thing, except when I was in the--it was in one class called the, called the, oh, Dr. Allen [David F. Allen].  He was a, he was a psychiatrist.  It was called the social something for ministry.  It was, it was like a, it was like a psychology, a psychology of ministry.  It was like that.  And I remember in one class--you know, you never know what people are thinking.  But there was one girl in the class who said--and we were talking about race, or something (unclear) on nature.  And she said, so anyway, it came up that, you know, well, "What do you think about black people?"  She says, "Well, my experience has been that when they were in school, they would always cheat and steal."  She said this.
Speaker 1: Did she know that you were black?
Speaker 2: There were, there were like four or five of us in the class who were black.  (Laughter) And, man, before we--well, we let her have it.  We, we gave her, we gave her--we talked to her from like from 'Amazing Grace' to a floating opportunity (laughter), and she--I think she'll never forget that conversation.  We said, "You know what?  Just look at all the, the, you know, the people who are in, in these positions of leadership who are lying and cheating and stealing in politics," (laughter).  "They're not black," (laughter).  So, you know, we, we had that conversation.  So that was an eye opening experience, you know, at that time.
Speaker 1: That she said this--
Speaker 2: She said it.
Speaker 1: --in front of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She said it in front of us.
Speaker 1: --multiple black people--
Speaker 2: People, yes, she did.
Speaker 1: --who she knew were black.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.  She said it.
Speaker 1: Unconscionable.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what--did you sway her, I mean in your--in all of you spoke to her, but--
Speaker 2: We all spoke to her.
Speaker 1: --what happened through that conversation?  Did, did you open her eyes to what she was saying?
Speaker 2: I don't know if we opened her eyes or not, but I think she was, she went away really thinking, you know, differently about the situation.  I, I believe she did.  She was like a little puppy dog with, you know, her tail between her legs when she was leaving.  But, I mean, but, but this is the--I think the media has, you know, has done disservice to people of color in that--
Speaker 1: In what particular way did you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, like, you know, for example, you know, always showing, you know, like whenever there's an issue of, of someone doing something, you know, which is, you know, of a criminal act or something of that nature in the community, you know, they always seem to showcase someone of color, you know.  It seems to be that way.  So, just trying to show that, you know, people are people.  There're good people and (laughter) there're bad people.
Story_ID: 669913
Speaker 1: You're getting a master of divinity degree, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut]. Who, who is teaching you?  Who are the scholars, who are the academic, you know, who--who were the teachers at Yale?
Speaker 2: Right.  The teachers at Yale are people like Henri Nouwen who was just a tremendous, you know, person.  And he's, you know, he's--at the time, he's, he's well known all over, you know--not just, not just in the theological circles, but he's well known in, in the larger community.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: N-O-U-W-E-N.
Speaker 1: And he's known for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He, he was--(unclear).
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: No, no, he's not.  I think Henri Nouwen was Roman Catholic, but, but he wrote a book called 'The Wounded Healer' ['The Wounded Healer: Ministry in Contemporary Society'], and it's something that was like well--it was well read around the place.  One of the other persons who comes to--he's not on the faculty there, but he does come during the time that we're there.  We invite him for a symposium, and that's James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone], and so you're talking about black theology and black studies.  And then--
Speaker 1: Describe what he was talking about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, he was, you know, we're talking about the consciousness of that here is--you see Jesus through the medium of, of your presence, and, and so when you see Jesus, you see the image of yourself.  So he's, he's helping us to, you know, to know and to realize that, that we are, we are all in the image and likeness of God and there should be sense of love, you know, for, for yourself.
Speaker 1: How revolutionary was this?
Speaker 2: That was very revolutionary back, back then, yes.
Speaker 1: Because Jesus was considered (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  And he's talking, he starts talking about the black Jesus (laughter), you know, that--yeah, that was very revolutionary.
Speaker 1: I mean you say it very matter of factly now, but at that time--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the time, it was, it was extremely revolutionary.
Speaker 1: Right, and how was he received?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was well received because, because--not only the black students but other students too, you know, were really interested in what he was saying.  And, and, you know, whether they believed it or not, but, you know, they, they would come to hear him.  And then another person who would come--oh, gosh, what's his name?  I mean he wasn't on our faculty.  He was at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] at the time.  Oh, gosh, I can see his face, and you know him too.  Oh, oh, gosh.  I can his--oh, man.  It's escaping me now, but anyway, it'll come to me.  But we had people like that.  And then we had, who was it?  I think it was Rosemary Ruether [Rosemary Radford Ruether] who came.
Story_ID: 669914
Speaker 1: There were these, women who were starting to, women liberation theology too, and womanist movement. You know, so, so that was, that was novel, and people were coming around the country, especially to deal with women's liberation issues to Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 2: But wasn't there a black woman who--Barbara Harris [HistoryMaker Bishop Barbara Harris].
Speaker 1: Yes, and she was--but she was a bishop.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, she was the first--she was not--she was the first woman to become a bishop in the--not only in the American church but in--
Speaker 2: The Anglican, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the--
Speaker 2: And then she was black.
Speaker 1: And she was black, yeah, yeah, Barbara Harris, yeah.  But she wasn't at Yale though.
Speaker 2: Right, but in your, in your church--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you mean in my church.  Oh, yes, yes, Barbara Harris.
Speaker 2: And you mentioned what's happening with women--
Speaker 1: Right, right, yeah, Barbara, yeah, Barbara--but Barbara Harris became--she was a bishop like back in the '80s [1980s].  It was right--it was after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989], yeah, um-hm.  I, I remember because I was--because we were, we were all together at the Union of Black Episcopalians meeting at Saint Augustine's College [Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina].  I remember we're coming out of a meeting, and, and I remember her saying, you know--they were saying Barbara was in, was in the election in Massachusetts as a suffragan bishop, which is like an assistant bishop.
Speaker 2: So, just in terms of time, when were you at Yale?
Speaker 1: I was there from '72 [sic.] to '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: Okay, so her--that happened after she came--
Speaker 1: It happened after, yeah.
Speaker 2: Let's talk about the Episcopal church, and while you're in school, you're, you're committed to becoming a priest in the Episcopal church, right?
Speaker 1: Sure, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And you're learning about blacks in the church and kind of how to, how to bring all of you--
Speaker 1: Sure, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --to this church which is not predominantly black.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Story_ID: 669915
Speaker 1: What are some of the contemplations that you're having and exploring while you're in school related to stepping into the priesthood?
Speaker 2: Well, I am--as I've--one of the things that you when you're in school, you do what is called CPE, which is clinical pastoral education.  And so, and then you do fieldwork.  So I, so I did clinical pastoral education at, at Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut], and the primary care center, and that was an interesting, fascinating experience.  But also, I, I did fieldwork in several churches, and one of the churches was St. Mark's--I'll never forget this, at St. Mark's Episcopal Church [Bridgeport, Connecticut].  I remember the, the wife of the, the priest [Clarence Coleridge], whose name was Euna Coleridge, I remember her saying to me that, you know, that I didn't have a very Anglican bent because I didn't, because I was--because of my experiences being shaped at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], through my experiences of, you know, coming on the, the earliest beginnings of black theology.  So I was bringing my perspective to the church, and, and so I was not the, you know, the bell shaped, you know, kind (laughter) of priest.  I was really involved in, you know, in social issues, dealing with the issues of, of younger people and young African Americans.  And so I was trying to do, you know, taking kids, eventually when I was, when I left seminary, I would take kids on college tours just to the historically black colleges [HBCUs] because I wanted them to be introduced, you know, to, to have that experience.  So, so I was, you know, I was knowing that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And when you were challenged about not being particularly Anglican, how did you react to that?
Speaker 2: You know, I really felt proud not to be (laughter), not that I'm not, you know, proud that, you know,--I felt it was, it was helping me to become who I am--who I was, and so and I felt, and I was very comfortable with myself.
Speaker 1: And your church had been kind of changing with the times in a sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I--and tell me if this correct, possibly more progressive than some other churches?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, progressive in the sense that, yeah, back in the '70s [1970s] women became priests in the church, and then, of course, in the--in '89 [1989], Barbara Harris [HistoryMaker Bishop Barbara Harris] becomes the first, you know, woman of the--not only the American church but in the Anglican Communion to become a bishop.  And so, so that was very progressive.
Speaker 1: And even before her, Bishop Paul Moore [Paul Moore, Jr.] becomes the first--or he's, he was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, bishop--
Speaker 1: --he's the first homosexual priest ordained in the priesthood.  This was in the '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that was--yeah.
Speaker 1: --this is significant.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: I think that that was ahead of--
Speaker 2: Right, probably, yeah, probably so, yes.
Speaker 1: So, so there's a progressive bent to the Episcopal church that you are now about to become a priest in.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that--are you aware of all of this as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, I'm definitely, definitely so.  Yeah, there's, there's this--I can't say--I would say that it's the earliest beginnings of, of priests being open and affirming to others because, you know, people in seminary, you know, they just totally said who they were.  And so, you dealt with, you know, with people and their issues differently.  It's no more in, like in the closet kind of thing--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --anymore.
Story_ID: 669916
Speaker 1: And so when you graduate [from Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut], wher- what--where do you go next?
Speaker 2: I go next to, to Newark, New Jersey, and I end up--I'm there for a year and a half.  I ended up being the, the lay assistant.  I wasn't ordained yet.  And then I go to--I was at the cathedral in Newark.  It's called St. Philip's, and--it's called Trinity and St. Philip's Cathedral.  They merged the two together.  St. Philip's [St. Philip's Church] used to be the predominantly black parish, and then they merged with the cathedral, and then it--and with Trinity Cathedral, and so they, they just added the name to it.  And then from there I go to Det- I go to Detroit [Michigan].  And I was there for three and a half years.  Then I was ordained, you know, priest and deacon in Detroit, and it's there where I meet the Right Reverend Orris G. Walker [Orris G. Walker, Jr.].  Well, he wasn't the right reverend then, but he was the rector of the--it was just the reverend.  He was the rector of the parish [St. Matthew's - St. Joseph's Episcopal Church, Detroit, Michigan], but, you know, he really played a very pivotal role in my life in terms of my priest craft and knowing how to, you know, how to, to manage, you know, all the, all the effects of, of being a priest in the church.
Story_ID: 669917
Speaker 1: Please tell me about Orris G. Walker [Orris G. Walker, Jr.].  He was, he was a black bishop, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, he--yes, he was the first black bishop of the Diocese of Long Island [Episcopal Diocese of Long Island], and he was a brilliant guy, just, you know, just phenomenally brilliant, very active role in many aspects of the church's life.  For example, every year--every three years, the church has what is called General Convention.  And so all the, the business of the church takes place at General Convention every three years.  And at one time, he was head of the constitution and cannons of the church which really makes, you know, some, some really important decisions about, you know, some of the rules and regulations that are going to take place in the life of the church.  He was an excellent preacher, and he taught me the art of preaching without a manuscript (laughter).  I was scared to death the first time we went some place--we were in Detroit [Michigan].  And I had--well, we had to--what we did, we went to, there's a woman--her name was Sister Hilda [ph.].  She was head of the Church Army [Church Army USA].
Speaker 1: The Church?
Speaker 2: Church Army.  In other words, these were people back in the day who would be responsible for the, for the welfare of the poor and the needy.  And Sister Hilda had a program, especially unwed mothers, and she would teach them how to sew and how to, you know, take care of themselves and their, their children.  And she would have a Eucharist every week.  And, and so sometimes Father Walker, at that time, and I would go.  And so anyway, we were going over there to the Eucharist, and he said, he said, when we got there, he said, "You're preaching today."  I almost died (laughter).  But it taught me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you hadn't prepared.
Speaker 2: I hadn't prepared, yeah, yeah, but it taught me how to be able to use the spirit to discern what I needed to say.  And so I learned a lot from him.  I really did.  And he was, he was a tremendous--he was, he was a person who really--when we were in Detroit, he had a church really for the wounded healer, especially for wounded priests.  You know, sometimes it can be difficult for priests and sometimes lay people are not very kind.  And there were many priests who, for whatever reasons, were not, you know, either were--there was a dissolution with their church and so what he would do, he would invite them to come to be at his church.  And it was a, it was a part of their healing process.
Story_ID: 669918
Speaker 1: Talk about that some more because I think that people think more--people on the other side think more, well, we have, we hold priests to a certain level.  There're many expectations of priests, including to be able to take all of the pain that people are bringing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to the altar.  What is that spiritual process that allows you to stay strong, you--perhaps so you don't have to go to this church, but, you know, what is, what is that process like?
Speaker 2: Can I show you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: May I show you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, be careful.  You have your microphone on.
Speaker 2: Oops, I forgot.  It's--
Speaker 1: Wait, can I get it for you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are we getting?
Speaker 2: The Bible, the Bible, the Bible.
Speaker 1: Okay, but can you tell us and then we--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It is the word of God.  The Bible.  That is the foundation and the source of helping any priest to get through whatever he or she is dealing with 'cause there are times in which it's, it's very--and the priesthood can be very lonely sometimes because people have an expect--have certain expectations of you.  And then when it doesn't meet their expectations because you're human, then sometimes they can be unkind.  So you have to be rooted in that word.  That's the only thing.  And the other thing is that, rooted in the word but also you have to have either good friends, mentors, confessors, spiritual directors, people that you can bounce things off on, and you know that it's, you know, that it's going to help you to get through whatever it is because there are sometimes in which, I'm telling you, as a priest, there are some times in which I've, I've wanted to walk out the door in terms of some of the things that, you know, the un-Christian that have been said or done.  But it's what I'm rooted in, you know.
Speaker 1: And, of course, that makes sense on some levels, for a lay person.  When you have hundreds of people coming to you with their problems, 'cause generally people come with problems rather than with celebrations--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what is your spiritual process that allows you to let that go.
Speaker 2: To let, to let go of their problems?
Speaker 1: So--yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, see, I learned this from Dr. Allen [David F. Allen] a long time ago--this is my teacher in Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut].  He always used to say to us, he said, "You have to help people to take whatever it is, their issues or their problems are, and they need to be able to work it out.  You can't work it out.  You have to learn how to help them to work out," you know--for them to take, to own it and to take it.  "And otherwise," he says, "what you're doing is, you're enabling people."  And some people will get mad at you because they (laughter), they want you to give them the answer.  And you start giving them the answer, then you becoming responsible.  So I just--that's something I, I learned from seminary, you know, from Dr. Allen.
Speaker 1: A kind of tough love.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, not necessarily tough love, but, but just saying, you know, helping them to talk out whatever it is.  And also, I think the other thing is knowing your limitations.  I think that you have to know your limitations, whatever your limitations are, then you, you refer that person to, you know, to someone who has more professional expertise.
Story_ID: 669919
Speaker 1: You were describing the--it takes time to become ordained--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --after you finish seminary.  What happens during that process of between finishing your education and becoming ordained?  What do you have to do?
Speaker 2: Usually what happens is that we have two ordinations.  One ordination is called the diaconate.  And so what happens is that usually you're, you're placed at either a parish or under the leadership of someone who has, you know, has experience.  And so you, you spend time, you know, with those individuals, and that church because that church is supposed to be raising you up for ministry.  And then from there, then you're ordained a priest.  So that, you know--so, so basically, there's the--
Speaker 1: And in the Episcopal church, are priests allowed to marry?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So that's one of the big differences between the Catholic church and the Episcopal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, they are, yes.
Speaker 1: So, when you, when you were ordained, then is that when you went to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was--no, I was ordained deacon first, then priest, and then I went to Chicago probably about six months after.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1985.
Speaker 1: So part of joining this ministry is moving, you've been moving around.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, in the Episcopal church, it's different than it is in the Methodist or maybe the Catholic church, where the bishops or the cardinal may move you.  What happens in the Episcopal church, you can become, become like a--after you--when you're a deacon, you're under the aegis of the bishop.  So the bishop can move you around.  As a priest, you become almost like an independent contractor.  And you can--some priests move as often as every couple of years.  But I'm from the old school.  I'm, I'm in it for the long haul.

Speaker 1: I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So which--where was the church that you moved to in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: I moved to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What, what was it called?
Speaker 1: It's called Messiah hyphen St. Bartholomew [Messiah - St. Bartholomew Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: And was this a primarily black congregation?
Speaker 1: Yes, predominantly black.
Speaker 2: By choice?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And then you were there for a long time.
Speaker 1: I was there for twenty years.
Speaker 2: How did you pick this particular church?
Speaker 1: Well, another beatific experience, I would say.  I actually didn't go to Chicago to interview for that church.  I actually went to Chicago to interview for another church.  And while I was interviewing for the other church, there was a woman that came up to me, she said, "My name is Marcie Creque [ph.], so nice to meet you, and here's my card.  I want you to call me because--," and I thought she was from that church.  She says, "No, I'm not from here.  I'm from another church," said, "I'd like for you to, for you to interview with us."
Speaker 2: And how did she know of you?
Speaker 1: I don't know, I really don't know.  She, she heard somewhere that I was coming.  And then the next thing I knew, I, I called her and made an appointment for an interview, and, and before the interview--'cause it's a smaller church.  In fact, that church could fit inside this church [Grace Episcopal Church, Queens, New York].  It's a smaller church.  I went--before the interview, I was gonna go downstairs into the undercroft for the interview.  So I said to her, I said, "Before I go to--come downstairs, do you mind if I go upstairs and see the church?"  And when I went upstairs, I just had this feeling that this is where I'm supposed to be.  That's how it happened, yeah.
Speaker 2: So you come there to Chicago.  What neighborhood is the church in?
Speaker 1: It's in Avalon Park [Chicago, Illinois], which is--
Speaker 2: And what is that?
Speaker 1: That--Avalon, Avalon Park is a residential community, kind of middle class community, middle class, working class.  It really depends where you are and the community is.  And a lot of bungalows, those--bungalows are really big in, in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: We're in Chicago.
Speaker 1: I mean Chicago.  I'm sorry, Chicago.  I'm sorry.  In Chicago.  And so anyway, it's about maybe ten minutes away from Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], where the University of Chicago is, and it's an interesting, it's an interesting church.  I mean the people who were there--Messiah - St. Bartholomew is a merged, merged church.  St. Bartholomew used to be a pretty large church that had, you know, kind of died.  You know, the membership was, was dwindling, and so they merged those two churches together.
Story_ID: 669921
Speaker 1: So you start there [Messiah - St. Bartholomew Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois] in 1985, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What are the, what are the big issues that are happening in Chicago [Illinois] at the time that you begin in the church that are affecting the congregation?
Speaker 2: I would say that the big thing that affects people during that time and, you know, in general, and speaking generally (unclear) in a congregation is probably the influence of gangs in Chicago.  Chicago is, you know, heightened influence of gangs.  And so I had this idea about doing something.  The idea was not necessarily as much for gangs, but it's more for, for really galvanizing children from poor, poor families to be a part of the church.  So I, on my first Christmas there, I challenged the congregation to invite families from lower economic communities and families to come to the church on Christmas day.  And so we started by, you know, by having gifts and toys and that kind of thing.  And we--I said a Mass first, and after Mass, we, we had food downstairs in the undercroft.  And then all the families received gifts and toys, and that kind of thing.  So I sort of figured that that was a way to begin, at least, getting some of the young people who were in these families in the communities that, that maybe their connection with the church could make, could be meaningful and make a difference.  Well, the next time we did it, a family came.  We had, we had several families, and there was one woman who came to me after the, after the, you know, we finished all the activities, and she said, "Father James [HistoryMaker Father Darryl F. James]," she said--and at that time, she had like, like three or four or five children.  She said, "Father James, I'd like to bring my children and come back to Sunday school here, to come to church here."  So I said, "Okay, fine."  And from that we started actually a van ministry.  Members of the church gave us a van, and we, we'd pick up the kids.  When--and this is, this is what I'm saying talking about, you know, how Christians can sometimes be un-Christian.  When the kids came to church, you know, they were--they had no church decorum because they had, had no experience.  And so, when they first came to church, they would come virtually, I mean, you know, they were disheveled.  Their hair was disheveled, you know, they didn't have--sometimes, you know, they wouldn't have the clean--the proper clothing on or something of that nature.
Story_ID: 669922
Speaker 1: Some of the members would, you know, make comments about the children.  So what I started doing was that I started bringing like brushes and combs, toothpastes, toothbrushes, face clothes, towels (laughter), all that to church [Messiah - St. Bartholomew Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois].  And when they would come, you know, we'd have to go through a grooming--the reality was that in this family, particularly, most of the kids were boys.  And there was no male around to really show them how to groom themselves.  So I virtually would have to--and some of the men, we'd have to, you know, show them how to groom themselves.  And, and what is fascinating how a congregation can shift in terms of its effect on, on people who are different than they are.  You know, they go from talking about the kids, and then when the kids start excelling in school and start doing other things, then all of a sudden it's, it's like my kids (laughter).  When the kids are doing badly, "Your kids, Father [HistoryMaker Father Darryl F. James]."  And, but from that family, all the men in that family had all gone to jail.  But from that family, from the immediate family of those kids, there were seven boys and two girls.  The two oldest boys, they went to historically black colleges [HBCUs].  One of the boys is doing very well, and the only one of the boys went to, went to jail out of that family which is exceptional because they were living in areas where they were, you know, they were--the gangs were wooing them all the time.  But those kids not only came to church on Sunday, but they came to church on Wednesday.  And I think that that was their salvation.
Speaker 2: And did the gangs ever take issue with the work that the church was doing?
Speaker 1: No, well, when we would come--I think that they, they knew we were there, and they knew that, you know, they never really bothered us.
Speaker 2: Did the composition of the congregation change over time?
Speaker 1: No exponentially, but it, it did change in the sense that I found that young people are, are the greatest evangelists.  So what they started doing was that when, when people started seeing what was happening with them, then they started coming to church.  Sometimes we would have like twenty kids in the van.  Only supposed to have fourteen.
Speaker 2: Did the parents ever come?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the mother would come.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: The father was like a rolling stone, you know, he'd never come.  But the mother would come.
Story_ID: 669923
Speaker 1: And one of the things that has happened in many churches, which, which you even described with St. Bartholomew [Messiah - St. Bartholomew Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois], is that in, you know, contemporary history including back in the '80s [1980s] and moving into the '90s [1990s], a lot of people stopped going to church.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And many churches of all denominations across the country have closed or not been able to raise the kind of money that they would need.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What happened in your church?
Speaker 2: Actually, my church really started to grow, but then when I left, it just, it just started to falter.  You know, when you don't have leadership in a church, and the other problem is that you don't have as many black priests in the Episcopal church, because what happens is that when one, when a black priest leaves one church to go to the other, it leaves a gap.  And that's what happens.  So it leaves a gap and a void.
Speaker 1: So you stayed there for twenty years.  Why did you leave?
Speaker 2: I left because my family's here in the Northeast.  My mother [Laurayne Farrar James] was turning, you know, older.  In one year, four of--one of her siblings and three of her close cousins died in one year.  And I said, at that point, I said, it's time for me to come back home, you know.  So I made that decision based upon family.  And then my brother, my younger brother [Kendall James] who had moved back east, he had gotten married, and he was, he was--hadn't had children, wasn't starting to have children yet, but I knew he was gonna have children, so I said, well, I need to come back home.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get married?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So you decide to come back home?  How's the--what is the transition that you create at your church?
Speaker 2: You say how's the transition--
Speaker 1: Well, so you decide to leave.  How quickly do you leave?  Do you find the priest?  How does it work in the Episcopalian church when a priest leaves?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when a priest leaves one church, you mean?
Speaker 1: Right.  When you leave the church you've been at for twenty years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What is the transition in terms of getting a new priest?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.  It's, unfortunately, it pains me 'cause it's really been hard for Messiah - St. Bartholomew.  It's been very hard.  The transition is that usually the, the church has to undergo a, developing a profile, you know, of who they--saying who they are, you know, what they're looking for, and what the future would be for the church.  So, so what happened was that a priest did come, and he was a white priest who, whom I met too, a very nice guy.  His wife was also a priest, and he had a contract for a year because I think he was in school as well, at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  What happened was he didn't fulfill his contract.  He left before the year was up, which left another void.  Then a woman came who was in a university, so they don't have a full time priest.
Speaker 1: Even now, ten years later?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they don't.
Speaker 1: Do you stay in touch with any of that congregation?
Speaker 2: I do, I do.  Whenever I go back, I, I go see some--in fact, there was a couple, that they're in their nineties now, and I go see them quite frequently.
Story_ID: 669924
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you made the decision to come back east to be close to your family.  How did you find this church or is this where you came, Grace [Grace Episcopal Church, Queens, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came here.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Bishop Walker [Orris G. Walker, Jr.], who was then the bishop of the diocese [Episcopal Diocese of Long Island], you know, and he was telling me about this, about this church, and why he wanted me to come.  And so what happened was, I came back first as what was called the priest in charge.  And this church is predominantly of Caribbean, Afro Caribbean descent.  Of course, there's African, you know, African Americans are here as well, and some people from the, from South America, Central America are here, but it's predominantly, you know, people from the Caribbean.  And so there is a cultural--there, well, there was until I learned their (laughter), their habits and their ways.  There's a, there's a cultural kind of, you know, difference, and it took some time for me to learn it, but I learned it.
Speaker 1: And when you say Caribbean, what--Afro Caribbean, what, where--
Speaker 2: Where are they from?
Speaker 1: Where are they from?
Speaker 2: They're from all over from the, of course, the Virgin Islands is still, is American, but they're from the Virgin Islands, they're from Guyan- well, not Guyana.  Guyana's in South America.  They're, they're from Barbados, St. Vincent [St. Vincent and the Grenadines], Antigua [Antigua and Barbuda], St. Kitts and Nevis.  They're--
Speaker 1: The smaller islands.
Speaker 2: They're from all over.  They're from all over.  Jama- many from Jamaica, yeah.  Yep, and then, of course, from South America and Central America.
Speaker 1: And so coming into a very different cultural experience, even though you are a black priest, this is a new world in a sense?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a new, and it was a little difficult for me at times, you know, trying to understand some of the nuances of what this is all about.  And then, of course, you know, there's always this thing about they're from back--, "Back home, we do this, back home," (laughter).  I'm like, "Well, we're not back home.  We're here in the United States," and so--
Story_ID: 669925
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you say differences, is it, you know in, some countries, for example, Haiti, we could use as an example, there's often a mix of Catholicism and voodoo or that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: And I don't know if that extreme, but--
Speaker 2: It wasn't, it wasn't that.  It wasn't that so much as really to, to hold on to some of the traditions they did back in the Caribbean.  And I would say, well, you know, there's some things--but we also have to embrace some new things, you know.  So yeah, I, you know, I came the first year just, you know, meeting people.  I didn't change anything.  I did change something but they didn't even realize I had changed it (laughter).  They used to have rite one, which is the old, old service at eight o'clock and rite two, and one Sunday, we changed it for something.  I never went back to it.  Nobody said a word.  Had I made a big thing of it, had I said, "We're gonna change the--," oh, there would have been pandemonium, it would have been pandemonium.
Speaker 1: The time? This is the time you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it's always been--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, not the time, but the actual order, the rite of service, the order of service.
Speaker 1: Okay, got it.
Speaker 2: And, and what happened was that I went to do the rite two for, that would be done for the old service, and I, I never went back.  And no one said a word.  No one said a word.  But if I had said, "I'm going to change, I'm going to," (laughter)--so I didn't say--yeah, so.  I've had challenges here [Grace Episcopal Church, Queens, New York], but, but, but for the most part, people are--I have some really good people.  I really do.  A woman came to church yesterday who's been very sick.  And when she came to church yesterday, and she said, she said, "I had to come to church because I had to see my son."  That, that did volumes--that rang volumes for me.  You know, that she's ailing, and yet she, she came here, you know, not just to see me, but to be a part of the community, but, but it just, you know, and it's moments like that, that when the things that are not going well (laughter) (shakes head) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: We'll pause for a moment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it doesn't bother me.
Story_ID: 669926
Speaker 1: I'd like for you to talk about what it takes to run the church because the--you've talked about preaching.  But, you know, there's--a priest's job is more than what happens in the pulpit.  What is the role of a priest in a church?
Speaker 2: Well, the role of the priest is to really provide the sacraments, you know, everything from the communion to baptism, confirmation, marriage, reconciliation of the penitent.
Speaker 1: What is that?
Speaker 2: That's when someone feels that they have been--that they've done something against someone else or they feel sorry for something, then, then, you know, that can be like confession, you know.  So another word would be confession.  And then just--before I got here, I had to give last rites to a woman, you know, who was on a respirator.  So, so those are some of the things, but, but see the thing that seminary--I think maybe the seminary does teach you this now, but did not teach you--does not teach you, is that the church is like a business.  You have to run it like a business.  And (laughter) a part of it also is like, you have to, you have to, you know, to try to, to help people in dealing with stewardship and giving of their time, talents and resources to their church.  That's a tough job, it's a tough job because there are people often, don't feel like being told what to do with their resources (laughter) or their time or their, their talents.  And there's some new ways probably of dealing with that, but, but this church in particular, it's a big responsibility because, you know, you have old buildings.  Right now, actually, you know, right now I have to have something major done on the chimney of this building.  And then probably a new boiler next year, but right now, the guy to come, who's gonna come the next couple of days to do something.  So it's always something.  Then I have a cemetery that has to be cared for.  And what's interesting is that no matter what happens to this church [Grace Episcopal Church, Queens, New York], if this church's doors were to close, the cemetery has to be cared for, you know, perpetually, it has to have perpetual care.
Speaker 1: And this church is how old?
Speaker 2: Three hundred and fifteen years old.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's a long time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the cemetery surrounds the church.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And there are graves from the 1700s?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, there are.
Speaker 1: Maintaining a cemetery as old as this requires what?
Speaker 2: It requires a lot of work.  For example, you know, if you notice that some of the, some of the headstones--you can't even read them anymore, could be because of either erosion or the materials that they were made out of, you know, for that time.  And then, you know, some have fallen down.  So it, it just, you know, like when we have three feet of snow, we have three feet of snow, we have to have a funeral here.  And I still have people who have plots in the cemetery.  So it requires a lot, it's a lot of work.
Speaker 1: So there's still available space?
Speaker 2: Yes, there is, um-hm.  Yeah, people, there're members of the church who, who bought their plots years ago, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how many members do you have in the church today?
Speaker 2: I have about 315 members.
Speaker 1: And the church holds about how many people?
Speaker 2: Probably about four hundred and something comfortably.
Speaker 1: So it's pretty full.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean well, most Sundays--and I have two services.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So most Sundays, I have about 150, hundred--two hundred people.  It depends, you know, in the services, yeah.  Of course, Easter and, you know, Christmas, I'll probably have more.  But, you know, we're growing but not exponentially, but, but still, I, I find, you know, that, I find like, you know, every, every month someone new comes.
Story_ID: 669927
Speaker 1: What about young people?  What is the--is, is there an attraction for young people today?
Speaker 2: No.  Tough, it's tough.  However, what, one of the things I did though, about maybe--I did it for two, I did it for about two and a half years.  I did something called--and I wanted to revisit it.  It's just that I did, I had a ministry called New Grace Ministries [ph.], and it was designed for people, twenties to forties.  And I had a service that was like in the afternoon because I knew that, you know, trying to have a service for these young people in the morning was not gonna work.  So I did it like, you know, at five o'clock, but I made it--I told 'em, I said, "Listen, this has to be your service."   And what I did was I, I met with them for about, maybe about a month.  And what I did was I, and young people like to eat and talk (unclear) that.  So I had them over to my house every, every other week I'd have them over to my house and so we could, we could talk about: what do you think this ministry should look like? Because they had to have ownership and be stakeholders and have responsibility for the ministry.  And it started off really, it started off really good.  But then--well, but then later on, you know, young people have so many extenuating (laughter), you know, things that happen to them.  And, and then, you know, some of them are trying to, are trying to do other kinds of things or, you know, the work related activities or responsibilities.  And so, it kind of--you know, I told 'em, I said, "Listen," I said, "I have to stop this because I can't come here looking at myself," (laughter).  I said, "But this is your ministry."  But it really helped them to see that this, you know, that there was a place in the church for them.  So I'm re- I'm gonna revisit it, but--
Speaker 1: Well, because ultimately without young people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the church doesn't live.
Speaker 2: No, it doesn't.  You know, in our diocese [Episcopal Diocese of Long Island], I would say within the last maybe five years, I've been to the deconsecration of several churches, which means that, which means they're gonna close the church or gonna sell the church.  And they deconsecrate it because, you know, because it's not, it's not gonna be a church any longer.  So it's--
Speaker 1: How does the Internet and, you know, all this new technology figure into potentially supporting the growth of the church?
Speaker 2: It plays a large part.  Right now, I have a young woman--I have two young women who are working with me.  One is working with me on developing the website.  I have a website, but then I didn't have someone to be the administrator so I have a young woman--so what happened was that when it fell through, you know, it just kind of went by the wayside.  But I had--but this young woman has put the website back together.  And another young woman who put a Facebook page together for me.  So we're talking about how that can be interactive with our ministry.  Right now, I have some--also, a family who wants to buy some, some television screens for me to put up or some sort of--I'm just trying to figure out how to do this because of the fact that, you know, this is a historic church [Grace Episcopal Church, Queens, New York].  So I don't wanna put it up any kind of way.  It's gotta be--I'm trying to find something that can drop, have to drop down for that kind of thing.  But the church is going to, is gonna be different in the next, and the next, the next ten years is gonna be totally different.  They're talking about a new prayer book right now.  But they're talking about, you know, a church that does not have books anymore.  People will be using a different kind of medium.  It will, it will not be the church for me (laughter) because I'll probably be retired by then, but, but that's what's--but I'm just saying that we need to begin to move in that direction.  And so I'm, I'm talking with young people who are helping me to do that.
Speaker 1: And so do you mentor young priests or in that same way that, when you first started--
Speaker 2: I have two, I have two young people.  I have--there's a young woman I really want--she's got it, but she's running away from me.  Yeah, she's running away from the whole thing.  But, but she's gonna come back.  I did (laughter).  And I have--and there's also one other, and, and, you know, that's, you know--so, I'm, I'm looking at, you know, several young people.
Story_ID: 669928
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I wanna ask you about, you served as national president for the Union of Black Clergy and Laity for a number of years.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, it used to be called that, but it, it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, what's it called?
Speaker 2: --it's called the Union of Black Episcopalians.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, what is that?
Speaker 2: It's an organization which is designed to, to help African Americans and others in the church to, to be concerned about the fact that, you know, that people of color need to have full inclusion in the church, and that in so doing, in having full inclusion, then there needs to be issues of anti-racism, that the church needs to deal with, embracing people who are different.  So that's what the organization--and it's been around for about thirty--almost forty years, I think, for forty years.  So I was the national president, and it, and it, you know, it really--what it does, is it brings people together.  We, we have chapters around the country.  And so when issues rise up, like, you know, like the, like the Michael Garner [sic. Eric Garner] situation in New York [New York], you know.  We had to come together to speak to that, to the issue.
Speaker 1: Well, I wanted to ask you about that.  When politically charged issues come up, when--you're no longer in Chicago [Illinois], but in New York, that are similar (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: --challenges, if it's not gangs, it's often police.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the relationship that the police have in the community, and, well, how active is the Episcopalian church in--today, in civil rights, civil rights issues that, that come up and how active is your church?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have to give the current bishop kudos because he's starting to develop an anti--develop a racial justice and reconciliation kind of committee.  The only problem that I see though, is this, and I, and I've said this to my congregation because my congregation knows that I am, I'm involved, you know, I've been involved civically, in with civil rights and that kind of thing.  They, they realize that in terms of my sermons and what I do.  But I'm all for the social, for this social, for this racial justice and reconciliation commission.  The only problem I have is that my church [Grace Episcopal Church, Queens, New York] is predominantly black.  And he--and the bishop wanted us to do things with--here, to have discussion in the church.  If my church were differently--I think my, my church should have a discussion with another church which is predominantly Eurocentric 'cause I, 'cause, see, that's where the rubber meets the road.  You know, we can discuss and ponder, but the real work comes in terms of how people are feeling, what people are thinking and people of different hues can get together and be able to have those, those high level discussions.
Speaker 1: And is that something that you are pursuing?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I am. Um-hm. I'm pursuing this because of the fact that I just feel that it's not gonna work with my congregation just talking among themselves.
Story_ID: 669929
Speaker 1: And then I wanna address the political for, for a moment.  While churches are not supposed to be directly involved in politics, the, the congregations are dealing with whatever is coming up, and so we've had this election in 2016.  How--what has been the interaction with your congregation [at Grace Episcopal Church, Queens, New York] and you as clergy during this time?
Speaker 2: Well, pre-election, one of the things I did was, I, I spoke to my congregation about the importance of their civic responsibility and duty of voting.  And I spoke to them from a historic perspective, as people of color in this country.  And I think that it really worked because I had a few people come up to me and said, "Father, I've never voted," and these are people from the Caribbean, you know, mostly.  She said, "I've never voted before."  She said, "But father," she said, "I'm going to register."  And I--so if one person, if it made a difference for one person, I'm sure somebody thought about it.  The other thing was that I invited one of the organizations here to do a voter--I was gonna do it with my group, but since other people were doing voter registration.  So I had them here, and, and I just, and I just told people, I said, "Listen," I said, "you know, you have a responsibility to get to your--to get to the people in your family, you know, to make your, your vote known and, and to be counted."  Now, post-election, would you like to know what I had to say about that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Post-election, some of my members were, you know, they were angry.  Some were really despondent, and, you know, saddened and the kind of thing like that.  My sermon that Sunday was, we have been here before.  And I said to my congregation, and I raised my hand, I said, "On this day, just remember Father James [HistoryMaker Father Darryl F. James] told you, God is in charge.  God is in charge.  So there's a reason why everything happens.  We've been here before.  We've been here for Reaganomics, we've been here historically, you know."  So I've just--I just mentioned all the things--I gave them the road of all the things that have happened.  I said, "And we will survive because we're a people of hope."  I went to Micah, I think it's Micah 6:8 [sic.], that we are people who live as though--we, we do not live as though we do not have hope.  We hope for the future.

Speaker 1: As you look at your many years in the ministry and all the work that you've done in various congregations, what do you hope for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My legacy is one of being a change agent.  It may not happen systemically, but if it changes one person--I'm not concerned about buildings because we have buildings already.  I'm concerned about people and how people can live a good quality of life, and be able to, to really survive in this society and community.  But the, but the other thing that concerns me, and I've said this to my people as well, I said, "Where will Grace Church [Grace Episcopal Church, Queens, New York] be in 2050?  Will we still be at church or will we be a museum?"  I said, "It's up to you."  My annual meeting this year was in February, I think it was February.  And I, my, my--the topic of my sermon--not my sermon, but my parish of the--state of the parish speech was: it's time to build a legacy.  I said, "And our legacy is that, see," I said, "we are living on the laurels of others."  You know, these buildings were given to us, the cemetery's been given to us, our parish.  We have a residential facility for seniors.  I said, I said, I said, "Money's been left to this church.  A lot of it's spent," (laughter), "but it's been--it was left."  I said, "So what are you gonna do about your legacy?  Are you gonna give of your time, your talents--," you know, and people always think that they don't have anything to give.  I said, "Yeah," I said, "you know, the little you have goes a long way."  So what is gonna be our legacy?  And, you know, we, you know, you can't, you can't keep living off the laurels of the past.  The church won't grow that way.

Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: Regrets about being a priest or regrets about being here [Grace Episcopal Church, Queens, New York] (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Whatever comes to mind for you.
Speaker 2: No, I, you know, I've gone my life, and, you know, especially, especially, when I lived in Chicago [Illinois].  You know, everybody, ah, you were there too long.  And I was there, yeah, I was there for a, for a long time, period of time, I said, but I enjoyed what I did, you know.  I enjoyed--before I worked on the Union of Black Episcopalians, I was on the board of education for five years.  I learned so much about the political machinations of the community that I just, I just get it, I get it (laughter), you know.  And some people just don't get it.  I just under- I understand because I, I lived it.  I don't regret anything.  And the reason I'm here because, I'm here now in New York [New York] is because I don't wanna have any regrets.  I don't wanna regret that I couldn't have spent time with my mother [Laurayne Farrar James].  She just turned ninety, and my brothers [Anthony James, Jr. and Kendall James] and I threw her a surprise party.  She was just, she was floored.  She will always remember that.
Speaker 1: As will you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't--I don't have any regrets.

Speaker 1: What advice do you have for young people, particularly, young blacks who might wanna enter the ministry?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Don't take yourself so seriously.  And don't, don't take what people say or do so personally.  Your ministry will be gone if you do that.  And just always remember the good that has happened because if it's, you know, you know, things are--little things are gonna happen that are gonna be, you know, uncomfortable and unfamiliar to you, but--
Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd like to share that I have not asked?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  You asked a lot (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you so very much.
