Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Agnes Adeline Day, and Adeline is A-D-E-L-I-N-E, last name Day, D-A-Y.
Speaker 1: And ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: July 20, 1952, and the birth certificate says Americus, Georgia, but my family was from Plains, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Plains, Georgia, is the home of former president Jimmy Carter.
Speaker 2: Funny you should mention him.  My father was a sharecropper for Jimmy Carter's father on the peanut farms, and my mother was a maid in their home and a babysitter of Jimmy Carter's.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll talk about that a little later, but I just wanted to establish that.  And, ma'am, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a microbiologist by training.  But I'm a professor and chairman of the Department of Microbiology at Howard University in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Good question.  May 4, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are currently located in the Human Genome Center at Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia].
Story_ID: 21296
Speaker 1: All right, now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as a warm up.  And they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, mangos.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, green.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, summer.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.  I like to travel lots of places.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's the Serenity Prayer.  "God help me to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."  I'm still working on that last past, "the wisdom to know the difference."
Speaker 1: That's the pivotal phrase, yeah.
Story_ID: 21297
Speaker 1: All right, now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Annie Lee Harvey, H-A-R-V-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is her--
Speaker 2: Laster, L-A-S-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Sumter County, Georgia.
Speaker 1: And that's S-U-M-T-E-R.
Speaker 2: S-U-M-,yes, -T-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what year was she born?
Speaker 2: I believe it was 1908.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1908.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family, and how far back can you trace that?
Speaker 2: Not very far, unfortunately.  My mother was from a family of twenty-two.  Her mother passed away from diabetes, and my grandfather remarried.  There were three sets of twins in the entire family.  And so my mother married at fifteen, had her first child at seventeen, and thirteen children later, I came along.
Speaker 1: Now, are there any--so did your mother, I take it she didn't finish high school?
Speaker 2: My mother finished fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did she--now are there any--
Speaker 2: However, she received her GED [General Education Development] at the age of sixty-two, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She truly believed in education.
Story_ID: 21298
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any stories in the family of slavery or Reconstruction or any of those?
Speaker 2: Like I said, I was the youngest of thirteen.  So I was two years old when we left Plains, Georgia.  But I've heard stories from brothers and sisters about the sharecropping and how all the children had to work in the fields, that my mother [Annie Lee Harvey] and my father would start school in September, but then when it was time to bring in the crops, they would have to take off three or four months to work on the farm.  And most of the times, they didn't go back to school.  So my father only finished third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this break to do work or this time of--
Speaker 2: Hiatus.
Speaker 1: --harvesting, yeah, hiatus from school, was this something that was exclusively the burden of black children in those days?
Speaker 2: I don't know black versus white because like I say, I was the youngest of the family.  But I know it was a burden of those people who sharecropped.  And with all of the big farms that were in that area, there were a lot of people who were sharecroppers.  I recall my sisters talking about a white family that was sharecropping also.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your family in Plains [Georgia] worked for the Carters.
Speaker 2: For the Carters, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now, I forgot Jimmy Carter's father's name.  But did you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember it either.  Like I said, I was two years old when we left Plains, Georgia.  So I had grown sisters and brothers.
Speaker 1: His mother is, Ms. Lillian, they called her.
Speaker 2: Ms. Lillian, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, so as far as you know, was the family's point of origin, I guess in recent history, Plains, Georgia.  And that was it?
Speaker 2: Yes, my daughter has been doing some searches for our ancestry.  And she tracked my father's mother from Mississippi, and there was some talk that there was Cherokee in the family.  But we have no evidence of that.  So basically, both sides of the family were from in and around Plains, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did you know your grandparents on your mother's [Annie Lee Harvey] side?
Speaker 2: No, I met, no, I didn't know my grandparents on my mother's side at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was told that my mother's father was a Pullman Porter, and we have a beautiful, wonderful picture of him dressed in a suit and looking very distinguished.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's interesting.  So he was Pullman Porter and, but--so, okay.  So they had a farm in Plains [Georgia] but your grandfather was a Pullman Porter.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he would leave and come back periodically, I guess on his trips?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, and that, but with twenty-two children, that really stretches a paycheck.
Speaker 2: Well, which is why you had to do the sharecropping (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so the sharecropping, was that done really by his children and his wife while he was away?
Speaker 2: We've had very few family reunions, and so that part of the family history is lost to us.  Most of that generation is gone, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did your mother, and you said she believed in education.  Did she have an aspiration before she started having so many children?
Speaker 2: She wanted to be a nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She loved caring for people, and she had a lot of old-fashioned remedies that actually seemed to work.
Story_ID: 21299
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Robert David Laster, also known as Bubba.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Bubba is a common nickname in the South.
Speaker 2: Very common.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think one of Jimmy Carter's brothers is a Bubba, I believe.  Okay, and what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: No idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe he was born in Plains, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Was he much older than your mother?
Speaker 2: He was about six, seven years older than my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that would place him around 1900, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, what do you know about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not very much, not very much at all.  I believe there were nine in his family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's one of nine.
Speaker 2: And he finished third grade.
Speaker 1: And are there any stories from that side of the family--now, you mentioned a Cherokee grandmother or a story about one?
Speaker 2: Yes, his mother was named Ms. Zoe (sp?).  And I was told that she was almost pure-blooded Cherokee.  These are the stories that the family tells.  And I remember meeting her once when I was about seven years old.  She was, I was told she was a hundred [100] at the time that I met her, and she had this really long, straight, gray braid that actually pooled on the floor.  And she just sat there, and when I was pushed forward, "Go kiss your grandma," she sort of looked at me and said, "You got the same."  And then she went back into dreamland or wherever she was.  So I had no idea what that meant.  And I was glad the, the (laughter) meeting was over (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so how old were you when you met her?
Speaker 2: I was about four or five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she was said to be a hundred?
Speaker 2: That's what the family said, that she was 100.  And they said that she died when she was 115.
Speaker 1: So she would have been born in 1830s or '40s [1840s] if that was true.
Speaker 2: Yes, when--once again, we have no record of that, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: These are family, family stories.
Speaker 1: Well, the story is, the story is, you know, is all we're trying to get right here, so.  If that's the story, then, you know, somebody else would have to research it, you know.  But it's good to have the story at least to bounce off of--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --to see if it's true or not.
Speaker 2: A starting point as it were, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, all right.  Were there any stories on your father's side about slavery or Reconstruction that have come down?
Speaker 2: I don't recall meeting anyone from my father's side of the family until we went to a family reunion in Plains, Georgia.  And for some reason, we just never interacted.  We didn't remain in Plains, Georgia.  Like I said, when I was two years old, we left Plains, Georgia, and there was really, I mean most of the people could not write.  My mother [Annie Lee Harvey] was like, if anyone wanted a letter written, they would come to my mother and ask her to write it.  So there was really no written communication.  When we moved away, no one had phones.  Yes, phones had been invented by that time (laughter), but as far as Plains, Georgia was concerned and sharecroppers, no.  So, we just lost touch.
Story_ID: 21300
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there--do you have any indication what your father [Robert David Laster] wanted to do, if he wanted to do anything beyond sharecrop?
Speaker 2: Well, to be perfectly candid, he did leave the farm and told my mother [Annie Lee Harvey] he was going to go and try to find a better job, a better life.  And he would send for us.  So as the family story goes, that my mother waited a year with all of the kids, trying to work the farm because that was how we paid rent, that was how we got food, was to bring in a good crop.  And she did it for a year, and hadn't heard from my father.  So she had to pack up everyone and went to find him.  And she found him.  He had started a new life with a new person and he had become a milkman in Deerfield Beach, Florida.  So my mother moved all of us to Daytona Beach, Florida, and the joke in the neighborhood was "Ms. Laster moved to town with thirteen children and one suitcase," and we thought it was hilarious because it was so close to the truth.  But we ended up in Pine Haven Project, where she lived most of the remainder of her life.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: If there is, I don't know it.
Speaker 1: Okay, but this story, the one you just told is probably the most dramatic story?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We were not the Cosbys [Cosby Show] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21301
Speaker 1: So but this is--so you said at one time they were, you said your father [Robert David Laster] was, they worked for the Carters and your mother [Annie Lee Harvey] did what in the household?
Speaker 2: She was a maid and a babysitter.  So she would love to tell stories about how Jimmy [Carter] would chase her with caterpillars and every female in the family is scared to death of worms.  We will catch snakes, no problem.  Show us a worm, and we will either pass out or run for our lives.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your father was sharecropping.  He didn't have any direct interaction with the Carters, did he?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay, other than, I guess--
Speaker 2: So when my mother passed away, Jimmy sent a wonderful telegram, and had (laughter), when my mother came to visit me when I was in graduate school, I took her to the White House on a tour.  And Jimmy Carter was president at the time.  So she walked up to one of the guards and said, "Excuse me, but I'm Annie Laster.  I lived in Plains [Georgia] for most of my life, and tell Jimmy that Annie Lee is here to see him."  And so the guard, you know, tried to maintain decorum, but she would not give up.  She never gave up.  And so finally he said, "Ma'am, the president is not in residence at this time."  And she said, "I came all the way up here from Daytona Beach, Florida to see Jimmy, and he's not home.  I didn't raise him that way."  And so someone came and asked her, you know, "Well, who are you?"  And she gave her address and my address, and I'm quaking in my boots because these are Secret Service people she's talking to.  And she's just spilling everything and telling stories about Jimmy when he was a little boy.  And so I said, "Mom, I really think it's time to go." (laughter)  So a week after she went back to Florida, received a card from Jimmy saying, "Ms. Annie, I'm so sorry I missed your visit.  Please come back and Rosalind and I will give you a personal tour of the White House."  But I'd had my fill of my mom.  You know, the floor isn't clean enough.  You should do these windows once a week.  So it was a while before she--in fact, I don't think she ever made it back to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's an interesting story--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and about Jimmy Carter too.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was, interestingly, he's the only president that has actually continued to work physically, since his presidency, and not just for himself, but for mankind with the Habitat for Humanity.  It's wonderful.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 21302
Speaker 1: So, are there any stories about the [President Jimmy] Carter place that are passed down that would be interesting?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that one story was my brother, Joe Benny, I believe would like to--we had a mule that helped with the plowing.  And Joe Benny would pull the mule's tail and jump out of the way 'cause he liked to see the mule buck.  And one time he yanked the tail and didn't jump fast enough or far enough, and the mule got him and knocked him unconscious.  When he came to, he went inside, got my father's [Robert David Laster] shotgun and went out and shot the mule.  So when my father came home as he slowly took off his belt to, you know, mete justice out, he told Joe Benny, "You know that wasn't our mule."  So, you know, you had to rent things from the company store.  You had to buy your, your food, your clothing from the company store.  And so when you brought the crops in, then all of that was subtracted.  And nine times out of ten, you probably ended up still in debt.  So you would have to work another year to clear that debt, but in the meantime, you had to stay alive.  So it was, it was an interesting system.
Speaker 1: As a system of peonage.
Speaker 2: Yes, sort of like, not quite indentured servitude because with indentured servitude, you had a deadline.  You'd say after seven years, I'm free.  But with sharecropping, it was a never ending circle of debt, work, debt, work.
Speaker 1: So, they undoubtedly had, the cost of the mule was subtracted from whatever they--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So, and these are the restraints to making it hard to leave, right?
Speaker 2: Very much so, very much so.
Speaker 1: Because you're basically legally bound to pay this debt, right?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And then if you can't work the farm, then you were, what I was told, is you were put off and another family was moved into that cabin or whatever so that their families could work.
Story_ID: 21303
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, you were two years old when the family moved, and you told the story just now.  So what happened to your mother [Annie Lee Harvey] when she, you know, moved to Daytona Beach [Florida]?  Did she and your father reunite?
Speaker 2: No, my father was in Deerfield Beach, Florida.  My mother knew one of her sisters had moved to Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida].  So she moved there and was able to get a four-bedroom apartment in Pine Haven Project.  By then, I think the oldest four kids had gone out on their own.  One had passed away.  So that still left seven of us that she had to raise.  So she worked, she did what they called back in the day "day's work," where Monday, Wednesday and Friday, you went to Ms. Lucy's house to clean the house from top to bottom and fix dinner or whatever.  And Wednesday and maybe Monday, you went to Ms. Alice's house.  And then on the weekends, you worked in the motels and hotels across the river in Daytona where the tourist section was, as maids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21304
Speaker 1: So can you name your brothers and sisters and tell us where you fit in?
Speaker 2: Okay, hopefully, this is in chronological order.  The oldest one was Mazie (ph.) Virginia, who lived in Ellenwood, Georgia, and passed away about six years ago.  David Laster, his nickname was Treetop because he was about 6'7", is still alive.  He lives in Eau Gallie, Florida, in a nursing home.  Robert passed away two years ago.  James passed away about twenty-five years ago.  That's five, okay.  Annette, still alive and kicking, Annette Thaggard (ph.).  She was an inhalation therapist.  She believed in education too.  So she became a health professional, worked at Halifax Hospital in Daytona Beach, Florida.  Eleanor was into business so she ran several bars and package stores, passed away last year.  Susie passed away in 1975.  Sandra is still alive and healthy.  Joe Benny, still alive and healthy.  Larry who was three years older than me passed away right after I came back to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] as a professor.  He was forty when he passed away, and he had been in the Vietnam War, nicest person you ever wanted to meet.  And he's the reason why I'm a scientist today, so hopefully, I'll get a chance to talk about him.  That's eleven.  Laura passed away about three weeks after she was born.  The septum in her heart didn't close properly, and all of the children have been born at home.  So when I came along, I was the only one born in the hospital because of the situation that Laura had had when she was born.  So I'm the youngest.  So you could imagine trying to get the Sugar Pops cereal out of the variety pack when you're the smallest.  So I ended up eating Special K most of my life (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's actually better for you.
Speaker 2: It's better for you, but it wasn't the tastiest one. That's right.  Okay.  So, well, we always ask this question.  Oh, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 1: The earliest childhood memory is of me crying and being almost inconsolable.  And when I asked my sisters about it, whenever they mention Plains, Georgia, I would just get this emotion.  And they were saying, you left your favorite doll under this tree in the yard when we left Plains.  And so I must have been about two years old.  But my clearest memory is when I was four years old, and my brothers took me to the movies with them to see my first horror movie which was 'The Blob' starring Steve McQueen.  And I still don't eat Jell-O and jelly.  But I love scary movies.  I love shock.  I love mysteries.  So I blame it all on that four-year old memory of the 'The Blob'.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 21305
Speaker 1: So did you see very much of your father [Robert David Laster] at all growing up?
Speaker 2: No, he would come to town [Daytona Beach, Florida] to visit.  My parents separated, legally separated, but they never divorced.  And so my father was supposed to pay child support.  I have no idea whether he did or not.  But I do remember that he came home one time when I was about, I hadn't started school, so I must have been either four, three or four.  And he brought this big jar, mason jar, full of pennies and nickels and dimes.  And I remember him scooping me up and hugging me and his face was very rough and bristly.  And I would say, "Oh, that hurts, that hurts."  So he put me down, and he said, "Baby girl, I brought this for you."  And he gave me the jar.  So I took it and put it in my mother's room on the dresser.  And everybody was happy to see him and everything.  And they're talking and, of course, I fell asleep.  They put me in bed, and when I woke up the next morning, the jar had disappeared.  I have no idea where it went (laughter).  But I know a few brothers that were walking around eating chocolate all day.  So that was the first clear memory that I have of my father, was that visit.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.  So did he make regular visits to--
Speaker 2: Not regular.  However, when I was still in elementary school, either first or second grade, I remember one summer my mother [Annie Lee Harvey] sending us, two at a time, to Deerfield Beach, Florida, to visit with my father for a week.  When my sister Sandra and I were sent down, he took us shopping, bought us dresses and shoes for school, and then we got back on the bus at the end of the week and came back to Daytona.  So I don't know if that was the start of his child support or whether it was out of the goodness of his heart that he wanted to see his children.  But he lived in a very small house, two-bedroom house with Ms. Molly, who was very nice to us.  And so I, I thank him for that.
Story_ID: 21306
Speaker 1: Okay, now, from what you know about your father [Robert David Laster] and what you know about your mother [Annie Lee Harvey] and what you know about their dispositions, their talents, their attitudes, their looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mom, definitely.  My mother was a very strong individual.  She had to be strong to raise all of those kids.  And my mother made the greatest sacrifice that a mother could make in that she gave up her youngest child to someone else to be raised because that person could help her child.
Story_ID: 21307
Speaker 1: All right, so, now, we always ask this question, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Funny you should ask that (laughter).  I was just thinking about this the other day, had no idea it was coming.  My mother [Annie Lee Harvey] would, 5:00 o'clock every morning, take the broom and just bam on all the doors in the apartment that we lived in, "Rise and shine, make haste while the sun rises".  "Get up, get up, get up, clean up this house, go to school", and then 6:00 o'clock, she was on the bus going to her maid's jobs.  And in the summertime when school was out, I would actually walk her to the bus stop and just hold onto her dress until she got on the bus.  And when the bus took off, I would run alongside and wave to her.  And then when the bus was gone, I could still smell the exhaust, and so even now when I've smelled bus exhaust, it triggers that memory of me running beside the bus waving at my mom.  So that is definitely a smell that reminds me of childhood.  A sound, (chuckle), I haven't heard this in a while, but leather belts smacking against flesh.  I was not a bad child.  I was an inquisitive child.  And that inquisitiveness usually led to, I wonder what would happen if I did this versus that.  And my brother, Larry, who when I was born I was told, told the family that this is my sister, and he made himself my personal guard.  He and I would always dream up these experiments to do.  Or we'd go into the woods and catch snakes, little black snakes or garden snakes or we'd catch grasshoppers and things, and we'd dissect them, for want of a better term, or we would put them on ant hills and let the ants eat the flesh.  And then we'd take the skeletons in for show and tell at school.  But the sound of just getting spanked for doing something that we should have known was not the thing to do.  And back in the day, the neighbors had full permission to spank you.  Well, let's call a spade a spade.  They could whup us, as we used to say.  So one day I remember getting four whippings. And I was inside my house, so thank God the neighbors didn't know about it.  But in retrospect, I probably deserved it.  But that another story (laughter).
Story_ID: 21308
Speaker 1: Now, why would you say you deserved that?  I mean do you know believe in corporal punishment today or do you think that maybe it was--
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Annie Lee Harvey] used to say "Spare the rod and spoil the child."  And I have noticed a lack of respect in many households for the family where, you know, they use reasoning and intellect to the point where it no longer works.  So for that particular thing that I did where I got four spankings, I deserved them.  And I never did that again.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did you do?  Can you tell us?
Speaker 2: I had visited a friend, it was a Sunday afternoon.  I went to play.  I guess today, they call 'em play dates.  And she decided to make some candy.  And the girl that I visited was Evelyn Bethune who was a great-granddaughter of Mary McCloud Bethune, down in Daytona Beach, Florida.  She made some candy by melting sugar in a pot, stirring until it became totally liquid and then pouring it over, I'm trying to remember the brand name, wax paper, after putting butter on the wax paper.  She poured in little drops.  So we had candy to eat and didn't have to go to the store.  So when I came home, I said, I'm gonna make some candy for my family.  My brother, David, being the oldest that was living in the apartment at the time, had a job, and it was his responsibility to buy the groceries.  And my mother would pay the rent and the phone bill and the light bills and all of that stuff.  So David had bought a ten-pound bag of sugar.  So I said, we've got sugar.  My mom has this great, big pot.  I'm gonna make some candy for my family.  So I poured the sugar into the pot.  I took her good, wooden spoon and started stirring it, and it slowly started to melt.  And then my favorite show came on television, 'Quick Draw McGraw.'  So I ran into the living room and started watching.  I smelled something burning.  I said, oh, my goodness; ran back in the kitchen.  The sugar had started to turn brown because it been, you know, on high too long.  So I said, okay, let me take it off the fire.  I can probably still use it.  Then another cartoon came on.  I said, oh, my goodness, ran back in the living room, watched that for a few minutes, came back into the kitchen.  The spoon is sticking straight up in the pot, which means that the sugar has now solidified into this beautiful brown, Lucite-looking cube or circle.  Okay, so I try to take the spoon out.  It's stuck.  The pot that I used was my mother's favorite collard greens pot for Sunday dinner.  So, I said, what to do, what to do, what to do?  I took the pot, put it in the pantry, forgot all about it.  My brother, David, comes home.  Every day when he comes home, he takes a lemon, cuts it in half, squeezes it into a glass and the dumps like five tablespoons of sugar in there and drinks it.  He's looking for the sugar.  "I know I bought ten pounds of sugar Saturday.  It's Monday.  Where's the sugar?  Adeline, do you know where the sugar is?"  "It's in the pantry."  He said, "I looked in the pantry.  It's not in there."  "It's in the pot."  I was always a truthful child.  So he looked in the pot and said, "What is that?"  "See, see what had happened was, I was trying to make candy for the family."  He didn't want to hear it.  All he knows is that he doesn't have any sugar for his lemonade.  So he beat me.  My sister, Sandra, comes home.  She sees the pot.  David tells her what happens.  She beats me because she knows she's gotta clean that pot.  My brother, Larry, comes home.  They think he was a part of it.  He was not.  He knew nothing about it.  He got beat.  So then he beats me for putting, getting him in trouble the one time he was innocent.  And then when my mother comes home, she wants a glass of lemonade.  There's no sugar.  They tell the story.  She beats me.  Four beatings, one afternoon, never tried to make candy ever again.
Speaker 1: That sounds pretty rough.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I was the youngest.  I was the smallest, so I'm sure they held back (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, but--
Speaker 2: But that extension cord did sting.
Speaker 1: So they all beat--did they beat you with different things?
Speaker 2: My sister, Sandra, just used her hands.  She's very handy.  But my brother, David, used the extension cord because he was a tall, big guy.  I would have to look straight up in order to look him in the face.  And so he knew that, you know, my heart was in the right place so he hit me maybe five or six times.  And back then, that's what people did.  You know, you wanted your kids to grow up straight and right, and corporal punishment, as we call it now, you know, was what they did, both at home and in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21309
Speaker 1: Oh, we were talking about sights and sounds and smells.  Did we--
Speaker 2: The sight that I remember most was my mother's [Annie Lee Harvey] yard.  She won several awards for having the best landscaped yard in Pine Haven Project [Florida].  I don't know if you've ever heard of Pine Haven Project, but it has been featured on 'America's Most Wanted' several times.  And during the years before they renovated it, they had a police substation in the middle of the project and a chain-link fence around the entire area.  But back when I was growing up, people didn't even lock their doors.  They left their windows open to try to catch a breeze in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida] because nobody had air conditioning.  And because we were all living in the project, nobody really had anything anyway.  And so, you know, there wasn't that fear of people breaking in because everybody knew everybody.  So the, the sight of her beautiful yard and the bricks she put around the pine trees.  And then she planted flowers inside of that, and the, she had the grass cut every week and with the four boys that were there at the time, she--there was no excuse for not cutting that grass every week with a push lawnmower.  So, it was beautiful.  She had four o'clocks, these flowers that opened exactly at 4:00.  And when they told me that they were called four o'clocks, and I asked why, they said, because they open every day at four o'clock.  I said, I don't believe this.  So one day I asked Larry, "What time is it?"  And he would tell me, "Three o'clock."  "What time is it?"  "Three fifteen."  "What time is it?"  "Three thirty."  "What time is it?"  "Quarter to 4:00."  "Let me know when it's 4:00, when it's almost 4:00."  "It's ten minutes to four."  So we ran outside, and we stood in front of this bush, and sure enough, at four o'clock, they opened.  I said, "How can flowers tell time?"  I was smart in the books, but I didn't have a lot of what they call common sense, but it was just amazing to me that those flowers knew when it was four o'clock.  So those are the sights that I remember growing up, of having a beautiful yard, of rolling on the grass and then just scratching all day, not realizing that I was allergic to grass.  But just the sheer joy of just being in a family that looked out for you.  And I didn't have any cares, any worries, just free.  And that lasted until I was in the third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that would be, six years, I guess, you know, from the time that you moved there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21310
Speaker 1: Now, what school did you start at in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the name of the kindergarten that I attended, but it was at Kelly Field on Cyprus Street.  And it wasn't really kindergarten.  It was more like day care, and this would have been back in the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But for first grade, the name of the school was Bonner, B-O-N-N-E-R, Bonner Elementary School, one through six.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Bonner Elementary School, and, now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school, I loved it.  When I was in first grade, there was not enough room for all of the kids.  So I remember having to come to school at twelve o'clock, whereas my brothers and sisters who were still living at home had to leave the house by eight o'clock.  And so they kept telling me at twelve o'clock, you come to the school, twelve o'clock, you come to the school.  So I would basically dress myself and come to school.  And all of the first grade kids were in the auditorium, and I think that lasted for about six months.  And then they got these portable rooms to expand the classroom space.  And then we actually went into the building, into a regular classroom.
Speaker 1: So you had a lot--was there anyone else at home when you were--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They left you home by yourself?
Speaker 2: It was me and the television.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Captain Kangaroo.'
Speaker 1: So you had to know what time it was for you to go, right?  You had to be able to tell time.
Speaker 2: When the big hand got on this and the little hand got here, my brother actually used some crayon and drew the marks so that I would know that at 11:30, I should leave the house, try to remember to close the door, and walk through the projects to the elementary school.
Story_ID: 21311
Speaker 1: Now, while I'm thinking about it, I should do this, and I didn't do this and I apologize.  But tell us something about Daytona Beach, Florida.  It has a particular history in African American history, a particular significance.  And I wanted you to kind of set the stage for that.
Speaker 2: Well, Daytona Beach, Florida, as I remembered it was 80 percent segregated until 1969.  And when I say, 80 percent, let's look at it from an educational standpoint.  If an African American student wanted to attend a white school, they would have to submit an application and you had to live in the vicinity of that white school in order to say, well, it's a hardship for you to attend the black school because you lived closer to the white school, and why can't you just go there?  So there were some students who, who did attend the white schools.  Barbara Moore, who was the daughter of the president of Bethune-Cookman College [Richard V. Moore, Sr.] at the time.  I believe Evelyn Bethune, who was the great-granddaughter of Mary McCloud Bethune [founder of Bethune-Cookman College] attended there.  Diane Gaynus (ph.), who was the daughter of the black undertaker in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida], and several other luminaries' children and, and a few regular folks, but not nearly the same number of regular folks.  A lot of the sons and daughters of the teachers at the black high schools, their children attended Mainland Senior High School and Mainland Junior High School, Father Lopez High School.  We went to Bonner Elementary for elementary school, Campbell Junior High School and then Campbell Senior High School.  So in 1969 -- and I believe that was the year of the big Supreme Court decision to, to totally outlaw separate but equal -- there was a big town meeting, and they were saying that the Campbell Junior and Senior High School would be turned into a seventh grade center.  And all of the students above that grade would be sent to Mainland High School or Sea Breeze High School, whichever was closest to your house.  And we were bused.  So I had to catch the bus at 5:30 in the morning.  I believe classes started at 6:00, and I got out at 12:00 (laughter).  So, this is funny.  Come to think of it, in first grade, I didn't go to school until 12:00.  And here I am a senior, I'm getting out at 12:00.  So that's, that's interesting.  I never really thought about that.
Speaker 1: I wanted you to talk about Daytona Beach in terms of Mary McCloud Bethune and Bethune Cookman [Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] and all that, so that history being there, and you said that her descendants were still prominent--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --people.
Speaker 2: --they were still there in Daytona Beach, Florida.  The university was slowly but steadily growing.  And it's called Bethune-Cookman University now because they do offer several Masters in nursing, and I believe in business.  I'm not sure of the other areas.  I remember the first time I visited her grave, which was right on campus, and it has two large elephants on each side.  And I saw the movie, I can't remember the name of the movie, but it showed how she told sweet potato pies in order to finance putting up the first building.
Story_ID: 21312
Speaker 1: Mrs. Rose Marie Bryan, who was my third-grade teacher and also I lived with her for thirteen years, attended Bethune-Cookman College [now Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] and got her undergraduate degree from there.
Speaker 2: Now, she's a very--she's more than just a teacher for you because you lived--she adopted you basically.
Speaker 1: Basically.
Speaker 2: Tell us about that story.  Now, you liked school.  You're going to school and your third-grade teacher--
Speaker 1: Yes.  I first met Ms. Bryan when I was in the first grade.  She, her full title is the Reverend Mrs. Rose Marie Bryan because she was an ordained elder in the Methodist church.  And she preached every fourth Sunday, which was Youth Day.  She was very, very focused on children and families, helping children, trying to keep families together.  She taught third grade at Bonner Elementary School.  She was also instrumental in a suit that was filed in Florida to get African American teachers paid the same as their white counterparts.  So that was her claim to fame that I didn't really find out about until I was in like senior high school.  But getting back to first grade--
Speaker 2: But that is significant.  That's very significant--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --'cause there are teachers, there's bios of teachers now that are starting to appear on the internet, those teachers who challenged those southern states in terms of that pay.  And they were heroic because, you know, they could lose their jobs.
Speaker 1: Exactly, they could lose their lives.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so she was definitely instrumental in that.
Speaker 2: But she was instrumental in insisting and getting it approved to have an assembly every week.  And each classroom, starting from first grade on up to sixth grade, had to present a program, and in that program, there had to be something religious, something educational and so I'm trying to remember this from, you know, from being first through sixth grade.  But the first, for my class who--my teacher was Mrs. Boyd in first grade.  And I remember Ms. Bryan coming in and saying, you know, "I'm here to help you start preparing for your assembly, which is going to be, you know, two months away."  And she gave us this bible verse to learn:  "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity, I become a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal."  [1 Corinthians 13:1]  And she said, "I'm gonna come back next week, and I want you all to have memorized that."  Well, when she came back the next week, each kid had to come in front of her and repeat it, recite it.  So when I got there, I recited thirteen versus, first Corinthians, thirteenth chapter, first through the thirteenth versus.  And she looked at me, and she said, "But I only wanted you to memorize the first one."  And I said, "I couldn't help it," 'cause I thought I was in trouble.  So I'm thinking of excuses.  "I couldn't help it."  She said, "What do you mean you couldn't help it?"  I said, "I like it."  And so she looks at my teacher.  And she says, "Okay, that's good.  It's not a bad thing.  It's a good thing."  So we had the assembly, and I was spotlighted, and I recited the entire thing.  And because I was the youngest in my family, I was basically like the class--my family's clown.  You know, if I make them laugh, if they find that I've done something that they don't like, maybe they won't hit me as hard.  Or maybe I can make them laugh so hard that they'll forget about hitting me.  So I was always putting on little skits for them and, you know, acting out.  And so when I recited this bible verse, these bible verses, I really put emotion into it and stuff because by the look on her face, I really thought I was in trouble.  So I said, "Okay, now, I've gotta put on an act."  And so because of that little performance, I was like center stage when the class did the assembly.  So I didn't, I don't recall seeing her again.  I don't remember her from the second grade coming to help us learn anything, but I ended up in her class in third grade.  And in third grade, I believe, and sixth grade, you have these standardized tests that you're supposed to take.  And so I took this test.  And Ms. Bryan sent a letter home to my mother [Annie Lee Harvey] that my mother had to come in to talk with her.  And so my mother came in to talk with her, she brought me.  And my godmother was saying, "Well, Agnes has been tested, and she's reading on the ninth grade level, and she's doing math on like the fifth or sixth grade level.  So I would like to work with her because she has real potential, and I would like to help you make something out of her."  So my mother said, "Oh, thank you so much," you know, blah, blah, blah.  So to make a long story short, my godmother would get old exams of standardized tests and give them to me, and give me, and say, "You've got, you know, two hours to do this."  And so I sat there, and I would do--it was fun.  And so in retrospect, I see now why they seemed so excited.  But I was not a genius, trust me.
Story_ID: 21313
Speaker 1: Whatever my brothers and sisters learned, they taught me.  And so while I had a leg up, I was the one that would sit there and read the encyclopedia at my godmother's house.  She bought the World Book Encyclopedia.  And every year, she'd get the addendum.  And because I wasn't allowed to go out and play and visit with friends and talk on the phone, books became my best friend.  And so I would just read, and I still do.  Every room in my house has a basket with books in it, that if I find myself in that room with nothing to do or I'm waiting for something to happen, I pick up a book, and I start reading.  I pick up a journal article and I start reading.  So, and I thank my brother, Larry, for that because he's the one that taught me how to read.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were taught by him rather than--
Speaker 1: Yes, he, he was a great guy.
Speaker 2: Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 21314
Speaker 1: So, now at some point then, your teacher [Rose Marie Bryan] adopts you basically, or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or was it formal or informal?
Speaker 2: It was totally informal.  My, she asked my mother [Annie Lee Harvey], "Could Agnes come and live with me?  And I will make sure that she makes something out of herself."  And at first, it started off with me coming to Ms. Bryan's house.  Ms. Bryan lived on South Street, and I lived maybe two and a half miles away on what is now Mary McCloud Bethune Boulevard.  But it used to be Second Avenue.  And so Ms. Bryan, my mother had to go to work early that morning, so she told my brother, Emmett, to make sure I got to Ms. Bryan's house.  And so Emmett forgot the first time.  And so Ms. Bryan had described her house to her.  You know, she gave me the address, and she said, you know, "It's straight up" -- what is that street -- "Campbell Street.  And you'll see this huge red and white brick church.  That's South Street, and if you make a right on South Street and go down one block, there's my house."  Because Emmett forgot to take me, I decided to walk because I was supposed to be there at twelve o'clock on a Saturday.  And it was eleven o'clock, and I couldn't find Emmett.  So I said, well, I'm gonna walk.  So I walked from Pine Haven project [Florida] up to Campbell Street, up Second Avenue.  And then I turned on Second Avenue and I walked straight, and I just kept walking and walking and walking.  And I saw several churches.  One was red and white, but it wasn't huge.  So I said, I don't think that's it.  And I read the street sign, no, that's not it.  And then as I came over this slight rise, I saw this huge church, Mount Bethel Baptist Church.  And I said, I bet that's the church.  And I then I saw the street sign.  I said, yes, that's it.  So I went to Ms. Bryan's house.  I knocked on the door, and she said, "Who is it?"  And she came out, and she said, "Agnes?"  And I said, "Yes, ma'am."  She said, "Baby, who's with you?"  I said, "Nobody."  She said, "How did you get here?"  I said, "I walked," because she had told my mother to tell my brother to put me in a taxi and she would pay the taxi when he dropped me off.  But because I couldn't find Emmett, I didn't know how to get a taxi 'cause taxis didn't cruise the black neighborhoods, so I just walked.  And it took me two and a half hours 'cause I was in the third grade.  I was kind of small, but I, I kept my word.  I said I was gonna come, and I was there.  And so, even to this day, if I tell a student, "Look, I'm gonna be here, unless I'm sick, I'm gonna be there.  I'm gonna be on time, and I say, and I expect the same for you."  So lessons learned in childhood really carry over.  But she would have me sit on the front porch, and she lived in a two-story house.  Wow, I'd never even seen a two-story house.  And I said, "Can I go upstairs?"  And she said, "Sure."  So I walked around, and I looked in the rooms and stuff.  I said, you know, this is a mansion.  And it was, it was just so funny.  I was just so, I guess, sequestered from the real world.  But she would have me sit on her front porch, and the front porch was screened in and she had six rocking chairs, each one a different color.  And I would sit out there at the little desk, and she would give me these little papers and little homework assignments.  And I would sit out there, and I would do it.  And so for me, sitting out there in the calm and the peace and just doing homework, that was so much fun.  And so that was the beginning of me living with her.
Story_ID: 21315
Speaker 1: All right, now, did Ms. [Rose Marie] Bryan have, now, how was she situated?  Did she have other children or was she married or was she--
Speaker 2: She had been married.  I believe at the time she took me in, she was divorced.  She had one natural daughter, Joy Cassandra Bryan, who was in, either in college or finished--no, she was in college at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but Ms. Bryan had a history of taking in children from two sectors of life.  One sector was they are smart, but they're not gonna get a chance to excel unless I intervene and bring them under my care or, this child has been abused so badly and to keep them from going to juvenile detention because it's not their fault, I will take them in.  And so the police car would regularly come by, a police officer would come in.  And I remember one time, there was this boy June Bug.  I knew him because his father and one of my brother-in-laws used to go coon hunting.  And his name was June Bug.  Well, the police said they had found June Bug tied to a tree in the front of his yard.  He had been severely beaten and he was naked in Daytona Beach, Florida.  And they were saying, we don't know what to do with him.  We'd have to ship him off to juvenile.  And Ms. Bryan said, no, no, no.  I will take him in, and so he lived with her for about ten years until he grew up and joined the Army.  So Ms. Bryan really had a soft spot for children in distress, and she had an organization called the "Children's Crusade for Christ" that taught kids bible stories, songs and we would perform at the various churches.  At Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, we would solicit downtown, just like the Salvation Army would be on one side of the street, we would be on the other side with a cup saying, would you please help the Children's Crusade for Christ?  And if they gave us a contribution, we'd say, thank you, God bless you and have a merry Christmas or a happy Thanksgiving.  And doing this over a period of twenty, twenty-five years, she raised enough money to build a building called the "Children's Center" where kids could come in.  It was like a safe place.  They could come in, do their homework, actually get help with their homework.  She expanded it to the point where she was teaching adult education, and this is how my mother [Annie Lee Harvey] was able to study and get her GED degree.  She had a Board of Directors for her organization.  She became part of the United Way, and she really did a lot of great things.  She had a weekly radio station broadcast called "Children's Crusade for Christ, bringing you a message from Heaven".  And at Christmastime, she took a group of children onto television on Channel 4, the community--well, it was a community segment.  And we did a thirty-minute television show.  So she was, everybody in the black neighborhoods knew Ms. Bryan and half of the white neighborhoods knew who she was.
Speaker 1: Now, Ms. [Rose Marie] Bryan, in terms of her background, now, she's, I know she made a tremendous impact, had a tremendous impact on you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and other children.  What was her background?  I know you said before she attended Bethune-Cookman [University, Daytona Beach, Florida]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and was she close to Mrs. [Mary McLeod] Bethune [founder of Bethune-Cookman College] or did she--
Speaker 2: She talked often of how Mrs. Bethune gave her such great guidance and so was more of a teacher, mentor, I guess, Dr. Bethune was her mentor because there were only, she said there were only about twenty-five students at the college when she went, but Ms. Bryan was, I believe she was born near Jacksonville, Florida.  And she went to a boarding school, a private school that, I believe, somebody paid for her to go, but I don't know the full story.  But she had to work her way through that school by scrubbing the floors and washing clothes on the washboard.
Story_ID: 21316
Speaker 1: And I bring this up because when I was in senior high school, she [Rose Marie Bryan] decided that my character, I guess, needed a little polishing.  So one summer I had to scrub all of the floors in this two-story house on my hands and knees with a scrub brush.  And I said, "But why?  We have mops."  She says, "No, I want you to get down there and scrub it."  And this was the linoleum.  And so I said, "I don't understand why I have to do this."  Well, back then, you didn't talk back to your parents because you were liable to get, you know, slapped or beaten.  You know, that was disrespectful, and you had to say ma'am and sir and yes, ma'am and yes, sir.  So I said, "Well, why do I--why can't I use the mop?"  And she said, "No, I want you on your hands and knees."  And I said, "But why?"  She said, "It builds character."  So for a whole summer, I scrubbed everything on my hands and knees.  The next summer, someone had donated a washing machine, and it was a round washing machine on the wheels, and it had the rollers that you put the clothing through to squeeze them out.  And then we would wash the clothes in that and then hang them out on the line or we would take the clothes to the laundromat and wash them.  That summer she said I had to wash clothes by hand.  So she bought this big galvanized tin tub and the scrub board, washboard, and sheets, blankets, pillow cases, jeans, clothes, everybody.  And by then, I think she had about four foster children living there, plus herself.  I, and only me, washed those clothes by hand.  So my knuckles are slightly enlarged.  And I asked why again, and she said, "Because it builds character because this is what I had to do when I went to boarding school to pay my way through.  And I want you to always be able to pay your way through."  Well, it wasn't making any sense back then (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause there weren't any jobs doing that then.
Speaker 1: Right, but it was, I think it was the parable of Jesus washing the disciples' feet.  I was doing, washing everybody's clothes.  I was already doing all of the cooking at that time.  And so it was like, you'd have to serve the least among you.  That's the only way I could wrap my brain around it to accept that this was part of, (unclear) the education process.
Speaker 2: It sounds almost like an initiation or--
Speaker 1: Could have been.
Speaker 2: And when you look back on it, do you see any, it seems like it's psychologically linked to the days of slavery in some ways?
Speaker 1: Well, there was a love-hate relationship going on within myself and between myself and Ms. Bryan.  Yes, I loved being in a safe environment where I could actually eat three meals a day instead of one or two.  You know, there was always food around or there was a person who owned this large grocery store and shopping center chain that donated food monthly to the Children's Center.  And so she would make us pack it up in boxes and take it to families that, you know, were, really had nothing to eat.  She always had food around for us to eat.  She always bought food, you know, out of her meager paycheck.  Whenever we were sick, she took us to the doctor.  All of that came out of her pocket.  She never got a dime from the government for the foster children that she was raising.  And she didn't let us forget that either.  But she did that 90 percent altruistic and 10 percent indentured servitude because as long as I stayed there, we all had chores to do.  And it was interesting because I had an older god-sister when I first went to live with her, but she eventually got married and moved out.  And so I was in maybe eighth or ninth -- no, I was in ninth grade when she got married and moved out.  So I became the oldest, and so I was in charge of the others.  So if they didn't do their chores, I had to do them because Ms. Bryan wanted them done.  And she said, "Well, Agnes, you're in charge," and -- but I couldn't hit them.  And I said, "Well, how can I make them do what they need to do when they say they're not gonna do it, and I can't hit them?"  She said, "You can't hit them.  They are not your brothers and sisters.  They are not my children.  They have families so you have to respect that.  You cannot hit them."  She said, "Now, I can hit them because I have their parents' permission, but you can't."  So nine times out of ten, I would end up doing their chores on top of mine.  But it builds character, and I think I'm oozing with that.  It also helped me develop a sense of humor because, you know, you can only cry so much before you realize crying is useless.  It's not getting you anywhere.  You're in the same spot you were in before.  So what are you gonna do about it?
Story_ID: 21317
Speaker 1: Did you ever consider going back to your mother's?
Speaker 2: Yes, the initial agreement with my mother [Annie Lee Harvey] and Ms. [Rose Marie] Bryan -- and I was present, and I heard this -- was that I could home--I would stay with her during the week, during the school week.  And then I would be able to go home every weekend.  So I could go home Saturday morning and come back Sunday night.  So I said, that's not too bad, you know.  And so for a while, it worked, and then all of a sudden, "Well, no, I need you this weekend, so you can't go."  And I said, "Well, okay, one weekend."  And then next thing I know it's once a month, I can go and see my family and my brothers and sisters and my mom.  And then it was once every three or four months, and so sometimes, you know, I would tell her, "Look, I wanna go back and stay with my mother."  So I would go and stay with my mom, but then Ms. Bryan would call my mom and say, "Well, you know, I'm trying to help your daughter.  I'm trying to help make something of her."  And so my mother sent me back.  [crying-emotion]
Speaker 1: Take your time.
Speaker 2: I really wanted to stay with my family.  My mother would always send me back, and she said, "I'm doing this for your own good."  So it got to the point where the kids would say, "Something must be wrong with you because your mother gave you away."  And I knew it wasn't true, but in a way it was.  And as I look back on it now, I didn't see my mother's tears when I walked out the door to go back.  That's the part of the picture that's been missing all of these years.  And so I thank her even though she's passed away.  She made the ultimate sacrifice, and I thank her, and I thank Ms. Bryan for, for believing in me enough to help me become what I've become.
Story_ID: 21318
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so when you went to high school, you stayed with the Rev. [Mrs. Rose Marie] Bryan?
Speaker 2: I stayed with Ms. Bryan.  We called her godmother.  And it was interesting.  Every summer, once we built the Children's Center--when I say, "we", all the kids in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida] helped to build that building by coming, giving up their holidays and dressing in the long red skirts and the white choir tops and with the cups with the slit cut in the top and going to various sites downtown, like the post office, the bank, major department stores, and things of that nature and asking people for contributions.  We were able to build that building.  And so in high school, I was still doing that and soliciting, on behalf of the Children's Center.  Every summer, we had vacation bible school.  And vacation bible school started the Monday after school closed and continued until the Friday before school started.  And that involved picking up the kids from their homes, if they didn't have a way to get to the Children's Center, driving them to the Children's Center--
Speaker 1: Now, you could drive by this time?
Speaker 2: As, in twelfth grade I could drive, but before that Ms. Bryan would hire a woman from the neighborhood to drive.  And I would tell her which houses we were picking up kids from.  So I had to go along too.  And we would teach them bible stories.  They'd have playtime in the mornings.  Ms. Bryan would come over and, you know, give them bible stories and teach them new songs.  And Ms. Bryan played the piano, and we would prepare for various public appearances that we had to make.  And after, and then I would help, if I was, yeah, I was the oldest one by then.  So I would either cook dinner or lunch for the kids, hot lunch 'cause she promised a hot lunch or we would go someplace to pick up, like there was a place called Wimpies in Daytona that had the best chicken, fried chicken boxes in the world.  And she would go, if there were fifty kids there, we'd get fifty Wimpies boxes.  So the all the kids could have their own little box.  And then in the afternoons, the kids would have more playtime, and then they would go home by, between four and five o'clock.  And then after that, there were about 100 folding, metal folding chairs that we would have to fold up and put outside because Daytona is so sandy, the kids playing in the back would bring in sand on their shoes.  So the whole building had to be swept out.  And the building consisted of a great room which was like a living room, dining room.  It was really a house, living room, dining room.  Then there was a partitioned door section that we called the library that was full of books.  And there was a kitchen, blue bathroom, pink bathroom and two bedrooms in the back.  And then behind it, there was a basketball court.  So after everyone was gone, we'd take the chairs out and I would have to sweep the entire building to get rid of all of that sand.  Then I would have to mop it, let it dry, then put the chairs back up, and get everything ready for the next day.  And then Ms. Bryan's house was right next door.  So I would go next door and start dinner for her, me, and the foster children.  And that was Monday through Friday, throughout the summer.
Speaker 1: It, well, it just seems to me, well, to hear this story, that you're doing most of the actual physical work in Ms. [Rose Marie] Bryan's house.  And, for her enterprises?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but we got allowances.  We got $2.50 a month.
Speaker 1: Now, (laughter) that's not a lot of money--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --for those days.  I mean I'm just three years older than you, and I know that's not a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Well, no, it wasn't, but she was doing everything for us, feeding us, clothing us, either through donations coming to the Children's Center or out of her pocket.  And so I don't begrudge, on the surface, I don't begrudge the things that I had to do in order to get to college.
Story_ID: 21319
Speaker 1: Okay, well, how was high school?  Now, when you were going to high school, did you have any time to be in high school clubs or run for office or do--
Speaker 2: I was in the honor society.  I was in student council.  I was known as a smart kid.  In ninth grade, they had a ninth grade social, which was like a little prom for junior high.  And I didn't wanna go 'cause I was still into books.  I think during that time I was reading about Egypt and reading not only the history of Egypt, but the fiction that was written in those stories based in Egypt and stuff.  So, you know, if I had any free time, I wanted to read.  But my godmother said, "No, you have to go."  So she made me wear one of my Sunday dresses, and went to the high school, in the gym is where they were having it.  And so I was sitting at the table.  I saw a couple of kids that I was--everybody knew me, but throughout my life, I can only remember having maybe two friends at a time.  I had lots of acquaintances, everybody knew me, either as, "Oh, she one of those Lasters" or "She lives with Ms. Bryan," or "She's a religious one", even though I wasn't overtly religious.  But all of a sudden, I'm sitting there talking to them, and people are dancing and stuff, and all of a sudden, I hear them call my name on the microphone.  So I said, maybe I'm thinking, then they called my name again.  And everybody turned around, "Agnes, Agnes, go, go."  So I go up there, and they hand me this award for having the highest average in the entire school.  I am so embarrassed.  Even then, being a nerd or a geek was, you know, considered, you know, not too cool.  And all I wanted to do at that time was just to blend in, to be like everybody else.  At least at school, I can be anonymous, I can just sit back.  But here they are giving me this award in front of the whole ninth grade class.  So, thank you, thank you.  Whenever a speech had to be made, they asked me to do it.  So I ended up being Ms. Campbell Senior High School.  And I don't know how that happened.  Well, I know, you now, I competed, and I won, but I really didn't think that the student body liked me that much, but they really did.  They, and I had one guy who actually had the, had the nerve to ask me on a date, which I wasn't allowed to do, said, "Well, I'm gonna save you because you're the kind of girl I wanna marry, not the kind of girl that I wanna date."  And I had no idea what that meant.  So the reputation was I was a nice girl.  I lived with a preacher, Ms. Bryan, so I had to be religious.  And I was very smart, plus, I was a Laster.
Story_ID: 21320
Speaker 1: Now, what does that mean, as such, being a Laster?
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, good question.  My brothers, many of them, spent time in juvenile homes or in jail or in prison in spite of my mother [Annie Lee Harvey] trying to raise them right, not because, you know, she didn't do whatever.  So whenever there was a hurricane in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida], we ate high on the hog for a couple of months afterwards.  I guess they would call it five-fingered shopping nowadays.
Speaker 1: So they would take advantage of the fact that people's houses had blown--
Speaker 2: Not houses.  It was always stores.
Speaker 1: Stores, had blown, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did have, you know, our standards.  And my brothers would fight. In fact, the whole family would fight.  One time it was the Lasters versus the Persells.  And the Persell family was as big as our family, if not bigger.  And they had, in the projects, everybody had clotheslines.  And so it was an unspoken rule, you don't take clothes off people's clotheslines.  And so my sister, Eleanor, I'll never forget it, had saved up for this pair of red nylon underwear and matching bra because she was like, she had graduated the year before, and she had her own job and by golly, you know, she was gonna wear her some red underwear because that was the rage then.  And this Persell girl took it and several neighbors saw her take it off the clothesline.  So when Eleanor found out about it, 'cause she was still living with us, it was on.  And so I remember the youngest girl in the Persell family was named Hilda Persell, and she and I--she was taller than me, but I was sturdier.  And so I was supposed to take her.  We had a plan, and when my mother came home and found out what was going on, she said, "No, you don't steal clothes off the line from people," because, you know, people hang out clothes in the morning and go to work and then come home in the evening, they're dry.  They take 'em in.  And so my mother took on the Persell mother, brothers against Persells, sisters against Persells, me against Hilda.  And the neighborhood said that the, the Lasters won that fight, and we never had a problem again with people taking clothes off our lines.
Speaker 1: So, it was actually a physical fight?
Speaker 2: It was a physical fight.
Speaker 1: Gee, okay.
Speaker 2: It was a physical fight.  Before I went to live with Ms. [Rose Marie] Bryan, I was in third grade, I was the queen of the project for my age group.  And I had to beat Amber Gillis in order to get that title.  And so she, she was trying to bite me or something, and I just, they say I went "postal" when I was talking to my niece who was there to see it.  And I said, well, you know, it was her or me.  But living with Ms. Bryan, you were not allowed to do that.  It was "turn the other cheek," always "turn the other cheek."  So I got the reputation of breaking up fights instead of starting fights.  So that's, that's a good thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21321
Speaker 1: Now, did you have time to really, I mean it seems like you were so busy, did you have time to serve on student council, and did you get a chance to do--
Speaker 2: They only met once a month and usually in the evenings or right after school.  So I made time for that, but the physical education teacher wanted me to be a cheerleader.  And Ms. [Rose Marie] Bryan said, you didn't have time.  And I said, "But when Essie Mae was in high school, you let her be a cheerleader.  Why can't I be a cheerleader?"  "Because you don't have time.  I have things for you to do, and you're not destined to be that.  Essie Mae had limited prospects.  Agnes, you, your prospects are unlimited.  You wanna spend your time doing other"--I couldn't understand any of that.  I knew that cheerleaders were popular, and it was, it was a teenage thing to do.  And I wasn't allowed to do it.  So--
Speaker 1: So in terms of popular culture activities, now, the value of which I guess we could debate, but television, radio, movies, you know, social things like being a cheerleader, high school sports games and the social, you know, milieu there, but did you have time for any of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: No, no.  We watched 'Bonanza.'  We watched 'The Twilight Zone' as a family, Ms. Bryan and the foster kids in the living room.  And then by nine o'clock, we had to go to bed.  So our outlet was at school, you know, cram as much living as you could into those hours because when you came home, you had to either do something for the Children's Center.  You had to cook dinner.  You might be performing at a church on a Tuesday night or doing something else.  So I learned how to read a chapter of a textbook and almost memorize it because I never knew when I would have time to really sit down and study.  So it came in handy (laughter) when I was in graduate school and had, you know, a small daughter and a husband who was also in graduate school.  I had to learn how to retain the information that I was taking in because I didn't know when the pop exam was gonna come up, and I wouldn't have time to prepare it for it, you know, the day before or whatever.
Story_ID: 21322
Speaker 1: Now, the Civil Rights Movement, I think was going on while you were, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --certainly going on while you were growing up.  So was there very much attention given by the adults around you to that?
Speaker 2: That's, yes and no.  There was a lot of attention being given to it with the sit-ins and the marches and going to hear the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.  However, my godmother [Rose Marie Bryan] was between a rock and a hard place.  She had stood up so that the teachers in Florida could get paid the same as the white teachers on the one hand.  On the other hand, she now has the Children's Center with a mortgage that she has to rely on the contributions of the white people.  White people were on her board for the Children's Center.  White people were donating food and clothing to the Children's Center.  So while she agreed with what was going on, she did not participate.  She did not allow me to participate.  When afros first came out -- you mean I don't have to go to the beauty parlor every two weeks and have this woman burn my scalp with this straightening iron?  I can just let my hair go natural?  No, I could not wear an afro because it was too militant.  And we had white people coming in and out all the time.  So, and this was when I was a senior.  What I would do (laughter), is I would wash my hair the night before and I would braid it and put rollers in it, those pink sponge rollers.  Then I would leave to catch the bus, and my godmother said, "Aren't you gonna do your hair?"  And I said, "I don't have time.  I don't wanna miss the bus," because it would cost like twenty dollars to take a cab because Mainland [High School] was so far away from where I lived.  So I said, "I'll comb it out on the bus."  Well, when I got on the bus, I would pick it out so that I had a curly afro.  So all during the day at school, I had an afro.  Getting on the bus coming back home, I would pull it back into a ponytail so she couldn't tell I had an afro.
Story_ID: 21323
Speaker 1: You were at Campbell High School?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did you go to Mainland [High School]?  Wait a minute.
Speaker 2: Yes, Campbell Junior and Senior High School, up to the eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then in the eleventh grade was when they decided that separate but equal wasn't working.  We could have told them that because the textbooks that Campbell received were the used textbooks from Mainland and Seabrook High School that were at least ten years old.  So they were talking about SAT scores and all of this stuff, and, you know, the black students don't, you know, score as well, you know.  They don't know as much or maybe the exam is racist.  I'm sure a major factor was that the black schools were getting information that was at least ten years out of date.
Speaker 1: But it was equal, wasn't it (laughter)?  I'm just--
Speaker 2: No (laughter), not equal at all, not equal at all.  Maybe equal in the time that we had to spend in school.  But that was about it.  So when I went to Mainland, I went from being, for my senior year, I went from being definitely either valedictorian or salutatorian, it was between me and Theodore Andrews, who's now a lawyer in Texas, I went to Mainland where I became number forty-two.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you think that you were really number forty-two or was there--
Speaker 2: Based on the population at the white school now with all of the blacks and the whites mixed in, yeah.  I was lucky to be number forty-two because some of the courses that I took while I had read information on my own, I read for pleasure and for knowledge.  I don't read things for parables and for social commentary.  So I hated 'Gulliver's Travels' because I thought it was a stupid book.  I didn't know that that was, you know, to disguise political activism.  And so at Mainland, I really had to start reading between the lines, as it were.  And so I enjoyed that, but I was shocked that, I said, now, I've got to go and re-read every book (laughter) I've ever read to look for what's hidden between the lines.  Mathematics was, was way beyond me.  I never really liked math anyway, I'm sorry to say, loved algebra because that was solving problems and solving puzzles.  But some of the other stuff, we had to learn theorems.  I just intuited my (laughter) way through some of these math classes.  Typing, I had no intention of taking typing.  I am so glad that I did.  Physiology where they actually dissected the fetal pig.  The most we could do at the black school was go to the pond and catch some tadpoles and here they have a fetal pig that we could dissect.  You know, it was, it was just amazing.  It was really amazing.
Speaker 1: So you found, you then knew the difference between separate and unequal?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, all those years of learning that I wasted during the time that was set aside for learning, you know, I felt kind of cheated.  But I had no way to verbalize that, or vocalize it.  And so, you know, it was like water off a duck's back.  You know, I was still a merit scholar, got a full scholarship to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] for undergrad and came to Howard, had never seen snow.
Speaker 1: Well, how--before we get you there, how was the social--
Speaker 2: After integration?
Speaker 1: --atmosphere at Mainland, yeah.
Speaker 2: There were a lot of fights.  There were two of everything.  There were two presidents of the honor society.  I was one, and there was a white one from their honor society.  There were two presidents of student council, one black, one white.  There were two Ms. Mainlands, so I had to give up my title as Ms. Campbell Senior High to become Ms. Mainland Senior High.  And in the parade, her car went first, mine went behind it, but it started to rain, and I had an umbrella, and she didn't.  So thank you, God (laughter).  So, yeah, there were two of everything.  The football teams, I guess the guys said football is football.  And they just wanted to make a team.  Cheerleaders were, were blended.  Classes were integrated.  So I think that was the roughest year and it was not that rough.
Speaker 1: Now, this is 1970?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969], '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: When you graduated?
Speaker 2: Yes, graduated in '70.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21324
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so would you go off to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], now, how did you choose Howard?  Was it hard to choose Howard or--
Speaker 2: How did I choose Howard?
Speaker 1: Was there pressure, any pressure to go to Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 2: My godmother [Rose Marie Bryan] wanted me to go to Bethune-Cookman College so that I could live at home and continue, you know, to help her out.  By then she had retired from teaching.  I think she taught for thirty-two years.  She retired from teaching now, but she had a lot of health problems.  And she was still trying to continue the Children's Center so she had a director over there when the kids came in the afternoon and stuff.  But she still needed help.  She still had foster children at home.  I know Howard sent someone named Mr. Carnegie (ph.) down to present me with something from Howard University for agreeing to attend there.  Ms. Dorothy Hill, who was a third-grade teacher also at the school where Ms. Bryan taught, her two daughters were attending Howard.  Teddy Andrews who, he and I would have been either valedictorian, salutatorian lived around the corner from us, was going to Howard.  And because, I believe because I was a merit finalist because of my SAT scores, that Howard sent someone to recruit me and met with my godmother and stuff.  And the next thing I know, I was taking a picture with Mr. Carnegie as he handed me something.  And I was set to go to Howard University.  In the middle of the summer, after I graduated, my godmother said, "You know, I'm rethinking this Howard situation 'cause, you know, they do drugs and just wildness."  And when I heard that, my heart dropped.  I said, here I am about to make my big escape, and she's talking about not letting me go.  So I just got really scared.  I went upstairs.  I started crying, and so she was on the phone, no, she was talking to her sister, Ms. Eletha (ph.) Royal.  And Ms. Royal, oh, I love that woman today, she says, "Well, Marie"--'cause she called her Marie--"they have drugs and wild parties and stuff right here in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida] at the colleges here.  It happens everywhere.  You should trust Agnes to know how to behave herself when she's given this great opportunity."  And that woman was responsible for me being allowed to go to Howard.  I thanked her, I thanked her, I thanked her.  So my, my sisters Eleanor and Annette took me shopping for outfits for Howard.
Story_ID: 21325
Speaker 1: Got to Howard [University, Washington, D.C].  Everyone had to take a chest x-ray.  So I got a call back from the chest clinic.  They said, "We need to take another x-ray because something happened to this one."  Okay, fine.  Took the chest x-ray.  They called me back again.  And they said, "We need to give you a skin test."  I said, "What kind of skin test?"  "Well, we think you have tuberculosis."  So they gave me the skin test.  It was negative.  And they said, "Meanwhile, don't kiss anybody."  Well, you know, I just met this dude that's really nice, both parents are MDs, you know.  I wanted to be an MD at the time.  I said, "This is great.  Now, they're telling me I can't kiss anybody."  And I said, "Okay, fine."  So I went into the library and looked up tuberculosis, and I got scared.  I said, oh, this is not fun.  So they called me back to the chest clinic at Old Freedman's Hospital here at Howard.  And they said, well, we don't think it's tuberculosis, but we're trying to figure out what it is.  And so they showed me my chest x-ray, and it looked like someone had shot me full of buckshot.  There were these white spots all over my lungs.  And one of the older gentlemen doctors came by, and he looked at my chest x-ray, and he looked at me.  And he said, "Where are you from?"  And I said, "Daytona Beach, Florida."  And he said, "You always lived in Florida?"  I said, "No, you know, I was born in Georgia, but left there when I was two years old."  And so he was saying, "You have histoplasmosis.  And it looks like your immune system is trying to fight it off by walling it up in these granulocytes in your lungs.  So what you need is, we don't have any drugs to treat it because it's a fungus.  But you need basically total bed rest.  How have you been feeling?"  I said, "Well, I'm always tired.  I'm always sweating, and I just have no appetite."  And they were saying, yeah.  He said, "Well tell me about your sweats."  I said, "Well, you know, my pajamas are like wet in the morning," and at first I thought maybe I had a problem, but the tops were wet, the sleeves were wet.  It's like I was sweating like a pig.  And I, he said, "Well, how long has this been going on?"  And I said, "Well, ever since this past summer."  And it wasn't until maybe five years later that I put two and two together.  That summer before I went away to Howard was a very wet summer.  One of my duties was to sweep the sidewalk in the front yard.  As I swept the sidewalk, this gray cloud of dust would just rise up and then immediately sink back down.  So after I finished sweeping the sidewalk, there was this bird sitting up in this tree that I used to like to climb and take a book with me and sit up in the tree and read and get some quiet time.  And the bird was tweet, tweet, tweet, and then the bird just dropped out of the tree.  So remembering all the experiences I'd had with my brother, Larry, you know, exploring and stuff, I went and picked the bird up to try to figure out well, what's wrong?  Are you dead?  Are you just sick?  The bird was not breathing as far as I could tell, so you know, it's all up in my face, plus, I'd been sweeping the sidewalk dust cloud.  I had breathed in the fungus, Histoplasma Capsulatum, which is primary pulmonary when it causes disease.  It goes straight to your lungs, and the sign that you have a fungal disease is night sweats.  At night when you're trying to sleep, you sweat so badly that your mattress ends up being soaked.  And you have a flu-like syndrome for a very long time.  And either your body can wall off all of these fungal spores that you've breathed in or the spores can disseminate throughout your body to your brain, to your liver, kidneys, everything and it could eventually kill you.  I didn't know any of this since I made my escape to Howard and went and got my chest x-ray.  So the doctor was saying, "You need to take three to four months of just bed rest and try to get yourself back in shape."  And I said, "But I'm on scholarship."  So some days, I would make it to class.  Some days I wouldn't, had never seen snow before.  In October was when the first snowfall fell that year, and I had hot pants and go-go boots and a car coat that came mid-thigh, maybe two pair of jeans.  I did not know how to walk on ice.  Every day I would just sit at the top of the hill in front of Howard's wrought-iron gates and just slide down because that's how I was gonna end up anyway.  So on top of everything else, I think I caught the flu that winter or a bad cold or whatever.
Story_ID: 21326
Speaker 1: But I missed a lot of class time [at Howard University, Washington, D.C], and I lost my scholarship by one tenth of a point.  I was supposed to have a, maintain a 2.7 the first year.  And I had a 2.6.  So I lost my merit scholarship.  Ms. [Rose Marie] Bryan didn't have money to send me back to Howard.  Howard informed, the people in financial aid informed me that if I raised my GPA up, that they would reinstate the scholarship.  So Ms. Bryan said, well, why don't you just stay here and go to Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College, Daytona Beach, Florida] for a year, get your grades up and let's see what happens.  So that's what I did, made a 4.0 at Bethune-Cookman, and the courses were not watered down, trust me.  We had a lot of PhDs who were teaching these courses.  And so I applied again to Howard to come back in, and they sent me a letter the summer after that sophomore year saying, "You were supposed to raise your GPA at Howard, not go to another school."  I said, "Well, you did not state that in the letter."  But Ms. Bryan said, "Well, you're here anyway."  And so the way I was paying my tuition, Ms. Bryan would pay my tuition monthly based on the duties that I had to do at home.  So all of the stuff that I had grown up doing was a continuation.  I had an eight o'clock chemistry class.  I had to fix breakfast for the foster children, fix breakfast for Ms. Bryan and still walk two and a half miles to the college to get there for an eight o'clock chemistry class.  I would usually get there by 8:30, and I got a B out of that course.  But I had, and I would have majored in chemistry because I loved chemistry, but I always missed half the class.  It was an hour's class.  But in graduate school, I have a minor in chemistry.
Speaker 2: So what was your major in--
Speaker 1: It was biology, pre-med.  'Ben Casey' [doctor TV show] was big as a TV show, and who was the other doctor?
Speaker 2: Kildare.
Speaker 1: 'Dr. Kildare.'  And so I said, boy, I can do that, I can do that.  I know how to dissect.  I know how to do this and that.  And so I, that was my goal until the last semester of my senior year.  I had forty minutes between classes, and there was this class going on, and the kids seemed like they were real excited.  So I went in and sat in the back of the class.  And they had these little round plates, looked like full of Jell-O, and they were doing things to them, so I picked up a plate, and I watched them, and I did the same thing.  So after about three days of this, the professor, Dr. Marlins, said, "Excuse me, are you registered for this class?"  I said, "No, sir."  He said, "Why are you in here?"  I said, well, I have forty minutes before my last class, which was a speech class.  And I, I live at home, and by the time I got home, it would be time to come back, so I just thought I'd sit in the back and, you know, listen."  He said, "Well, you can't do that."  And I said, "Fine."  So I got up and started packing.  He said, "No, you can't just sit here and listen.  You have to participate."  And I said, "Oh, okay, sure."  He said, "And you have to take the exams."  I said, "Sure.  You got a textbook?"  He said, "Yeah," he gave me the textbook.  And so that was a bacteriology class, and I loved that class 'cause I was actually doing what my brother and I had been playing around with basically, as long as I can remember.  So he says, "Well, you seem to be pretty good at this, you know.  What are your plans?  And I said, well, I'm supposed to go to med school, I think."
Speaker 2: I said, "My advisor told me that Howard and Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] had an agreement to take their top students in biology.  And so I'm the top student here, so I guess I'll be going to med school."  He says, "Well, have you ever thought about graduate school?"  And I said, "No, what is graduate school?"  And so he told me.  And he said, "You know, I just recently got my PhD."  And I said, "Okay, what's a PhD?"  That's, that was the level of my knowledge.  And so he explained to me instead of taking the MCAT -- which I didn't have the money to take.  My advisor was gonna pay for it.  He said, "I'll pay for you to take the GRE," and he says, "You know, you seem to really like this."  He says, "You could make this your career."  I said, "I could get paid for having fun?"  (laughter)  He said, "Well, put like that, sure."  I said, "Well, sign me up."  So I took a GRE, got my scores back.  He helped me with the applications.  I got accepted to four schools in the Washington area, because I was married by then, and had a daughter and my husband was already at Howard University in graduate school.
Story_ID: 21327
Speaker 1: Well, tell us how you met your husband now because we're skipping over a--
Speaker 2: Oh, when I had to transfer to Bethune-Cookman College [Daytona Beach, Florida], I was standing in line to register, and there was this young man standing behind me.  And he had a beard, this really thick, bushy beard.
Speaker 1: Now, these are the days of the big afros and--
Speaker 2: Big afro, big beard.  And I saw the beard and it immediately reminded me of my father [Robert David Laster], that I had--well, that's later on in the story.  So he reminded me of my father, so, and he was, you know, looking like--he was an upperclassman.  So I just stood in line waiting to put my deposit down because my godmother [Rose Marie Bryan] paid my tuition on a monthly basis as opposed to a semester basis.  So he was looking over my shoulder 'cause I had my class card in my hand.  And I said, "Excuse me?"  He said, "Oh, well, I notice that you're taking chemistry."  And I said, "Yes."  "Well, I will be the teaching assistant in the chemistry class so if you need anything, just ask for me.  I'm John Day."  And I said, "Well, thanks, but I doubt I'll be needing your help," (laughter) you know.  And the rest is history.  I made it a point to do well in chemistry lab because I refused to ask for any help from him.  So he would come by and, "Well, if you'll look over here at Agnes's experiment, it's done exceptionally well," and this and that and the other.  So, you know, once he put me in the spotlight, I said, "Okay.  So what's your major?  Are you a chemistry major?"  He said, "No, I'm a physics major".  So I said, "Wow, physics."  So, you know, we would talk and everything, and he was from Savannah, Georgia.  His mother was a school teacher and his father was in the military, and he had two sisters.  And he was really nice.  But what sold me was I was, had finally been allowed to date, but my curfew was 11:30.  And you know that in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida], it doesn't get dark until 10:30.  So, you know, I had one hour--and parties don't start until it gets dark.  So if I was going to a party, I had one hour of fun before I had to beat it back.  So John came to pick me up.  He was gonna take me to a football game, no, a basketball game.  And so he came inside, knocked on the door and came inside.  Ms. Bryan, you know, told him to come in, and she was sitting there grilling him, and he was answering her questions and everything.  And he was holding his own.  I'm saying, wow (laughter), okay.  So that, that sealed the deal.  He was smart enough, and our first date, he was talking about, and so like, "When we get married, you know, how many children are you thinking you might wanna have, and, you know, you're gonna continue your education, of course."  And I'm saying, well, this is our first date.  What is he talking about?  My mother [Annie Lee Harvey] loved him.  He was, he painted her house while she was out of town, and that sealed the deal for her, painted inside the whole house.  And he was a really great guy, very smart, introverted.  And so my daughter takes after him, loving the mathematics and the physics.  Her major was biomedical engineering in college, but she takes after me with a sense of humor.  So I think we did a great job with her.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So you're married, but he's in grad school at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] while--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, where--
Speaker 2: And I was a senior at Bethune-Cookman in Daytona.
Speaker 1: Cookman, okay, all right.  So this 1970--
Speaker 2: Four, yes.
Speaker 1: --four, I guess, 1974, okay.
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973], '74.
Story_ID: 21328
Speaker 1: So you're introduced to bacteriology?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And so Dr. Marlins, Dr. Gregory Marlins, really truly assisted me in applying and getting into graduate school.  And I was accepted at American [University, Washington, D.C.], Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.], George Washington [University, Washington, D.C.], and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And I selected Howard, not only because their stipend paid fifty dollars more than the other schools, but because I felt I had unfinished business with Howard, that I lost my scholarship, not because I couldn't handle the coursework but because I was sick.  I deserve another chance.  I'm gonna prove to them that I can make this, I can do this, and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So entered into the Department of Microbiology.  At the time, it was a Master's program.  And so my husband had made this plan that he would, that I will get my Master's.  He will get his Master's, and then we both get jobs because, you know, we had the kid.  His grandmother who lived right next door to his parents in, right outside Savannah, Georgia, agreed to keep my daughter for the first year of graduate school so that we could both study and get, you know, firmly situated and get into a rhythm.  Worst decision of my life.  I couldn't focus because I'm worried about her, having dreams that she needs me, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So that lasted for a year, but for the rest of the time, she and I were together.  But microbiology only offered a Master's program at the time.  So I came in with a class of eight students.  By the end of the first semester, there were only two of us left, and at the end of the second semester, I was the only student remaining.
Speaker 1: Now, was Dr. [Floyd] Malveaux [also a HistoryMaker] in microbiology then?
Speaker 2: No, Dr. Malveaux was probably in medical school at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did do something here at Howard, and I used to know his complete story because he was the chairman of our department once I came back as a professor.  So, but he, he does have ties to the department, but his undergrad was at Creighton University [Omaha, Nebraska].  And I believe his medical degree was from Tulane [University, New Orleans, Louisiana].  He might have gotten a Master's from Howard University because I found several books with his name in it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So with the Master's program in 19--so I was the only student remaining from my entering class in the Department of Microbiology.
Speaker 1: And why was that?  Now, was it that tough that people just didn't--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was that tough, it was that tough.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I loved it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Who was your advisor?
Speaker 2: My advisor when I first came in was, I think there was like a group advisor, an advisor for the entire class.  And then as we were introduced to the various segments of microbiology, we chose an advisor.  So my first advisor was Dr. James Gregory who was a bacteriologist.  And I remember my first lab report was on mycoplasma, these little microscopic organisms that require serum in order to grow.  So when I poured the agar plates, I had to add horse serum, and I just thought that was so exotic.  And they would look like fried eggs on the plate because they were transparent.  So you couldn't really see the colony, but if you held it sideways, you could see something that looked like a fried egg.  So that was cool.  I'm still excited about those experiments that I did that long ago.  So then, we were supposed rotate to various individuals before we decided on who to select as an advisor.  So my second rotation was with Dr. George Holmes who was a bacterial geneticist, I believe that's how he introduced himself.  And we worked with E. coli, various strains of Escherichia coli and a virus called a bacteriophage.  He had done his research, I believe he got his degree from Arizona State [University, Tempe, Arizona], and he did a post-doc at Rockefeller Institute [for Medical Research] [now Rockefeller University].  So he was like a real heavy.  And he had these mutants, and he was looking at temperature sensitivity and how you induce those mutations and what are the results.  And so I did a lab with him, even though there were two students who were two years ahead of me who was taking the entire course, the lecture and the lab.  And so I asked him if I could sit in on the lecture, and he says, no, you can't because you, you wouldn't understand the first word, which was true.  But I, I did, I got a "B" out of the course.  I thought I had done "A" work because there wasn't an experiment that I did not do that I did not get some results.  But I got a "B".  And so there was some personality differences.  And he recommended that maybe I should work with one of the females in the department.  And so that's what I did.
Story_ID: 21329
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you were just saying off camera something that I think is very important to say on camera, that you were, we were talking about, I said that you went straight through to get your PhD, and you didn't, you know, get a master's and go on to something else--
Speaker 2: No, yeah.
Speaker 1: --else.  You went straight through at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I did, but it's because when I came to Howard, the microbiology department only had a Master's program.  And unbeknownst to me my husband [John Day] had decided that once I received my Master's, that he would get his Master's from physics a year ahead of me.  And he would be working and making enough money to send me to medical school, because when we first met, you know, I told him I wanted to be a doctor.  So when he told me this plan, this was after, this was in 1977 when, you know, I was finishing up the three-year Master's program.  I had passed the qualifying exams.  I had done the research.  I was in the process of writing my thesis.  The department got their PhD program approved.  And so I decided that I wanted my PhD.  And so when my husband talked about this plan of sending me to med school, I said, "No.  I don't want to be a doctor anymore.  I wanna get my PhD.  I wanna be a scientist."  And he says, "Well, why don't you wanna go to med school?"  I said, "It's not that I don't wanna go.  It's like, I wanna find out why people get sick in the first place, not just giving them something to make them feel better and identifying what's wrong with them.  I wanna find out why did this person get sick and this person in the same family not get sick, and they're interacting.  I wanna know how these little organisms that you can't even see can kill people."  So he said, "Well, if that's what you wanna do, then go ahead."  So I continued -- well, I transferred.  I had to actually apply to the PhD program.  I was accepted so I was the first person to enter the PhD program.  And actually, I was their first graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21330
Speaker 1: And just back to that.  There's like a philosophical issue here that I've read about in 'Scientific American' and other magazines where people argue that being a scientist is more about problem solving than being a physician.  And they argue that physicians have a formulaic approach to what they do, they learn certain equations and names of things and apply like a formulaic, this is what you do for this and this is what you do for that.  And I think you're alluding to that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you thought it was more exciting to actually do the research--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I think it's, medicine is formulaic in that based on observation, that if I'm going to do a coronary bypass surgery on you, that there are certain things that I have to make sure are happening with you that meet the criteria for this operation.  And there are certain things I need to do to ensure that you survive this operation.  So, yes, I have my formulas.  I have my protocol of what needs to be in place, and if I do everything right and I've diagnosed you correctly, then there should be a happy outcome.  And you will be happy, and you will live long and prosper.  And if things go wrong, then you, you know, will not survive the operation.  I did not want to be that close to the medical problem.  I was always asking what if, why, and I wonder what would happen if.  And just like when I cook, the first time I cook a meal that I've never done before, I follow the recipe.  The second time, I can improve on that.  I'm gonna ad this instead of that.  I'm gonna wait and do this instead of that.  So I've always followed the rules to a certain extent, but then I have to improvise.  With research and being a scientist, you get to ask your own questions.  You don't have people telling you this is how it's done.  You decide how it's done based on what's been done before.  So I think of science as pushing the frontier, and with medical science, we're pushing the envelope, finding new and better ways to treat infections that before were untreatable or to protect against getting polio by inventing a vaccine.  They're working on HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] vaccines now which is great, but assisting the doctors by telling them, okay, this is why the patient got sick; this is what you need to do to treat the patient, and this is a drug that we have discovered that is best for treating this particular organism.  So we're working side-by-side, the medical profession and the scientific, the biomedical scientific profession.  And now, I know you've heard this push from NIH [National Institutes of Health] to foster more translational research from bench to bedside.  So, me, as a basic scientist, I'm working at the bench with cancer cells, trying to find out what makes them tick and what makes cancer cells from African American women, sometimes be more aggressive than cancer cells from Caucasian women.  That's my research niche.  But whatever I find there, I hope to be able to build upon that so that the next African American female that goes in the hospital as diagnosed with breast cancer, "Well, you know, Dr. Day found out that you're over expressing this particular protein and as a result [phone music sound], you need this thing to block that protein and then your breast cancer will go away.
Story_ID: 21331
Speaker 1: Now, you're working on your PhD and, in the early '80s [1980s], what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: My dissertation was 'Visible Bright Field Transmission and Electron Microscopic Studies of Thick-Walled Isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans.'  Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast which is a type of fungus.  This yeast grows in pigeons.  They don't make the pigeons sick.  But they humans, this fungus likes to go straight from the lungs to the brain, skin, other organs, but it prefers growing in the brain.  The pigeons never get sick, and the reason why is because our body temperature is thirty-seven degrees centigrade.  Pigeon's body temperature is thirty-nine degrees centigrade.  So that higher temperature keeps the pathogenic components from being expressed by the fungus.  So I did electron microscopy.  So we were actually able to cut open these yeast cells and look at their nuclei and stuff.  And the focus of my studies was a lot of people who develop cryptococcosis are treated with a drug called Amphotericin B which also will tear up your kidneys if you take it too long and drug called 5-fluorocytosine which is a DNA [Deoxyribonucleic acid] analog.  So it can definitely, it's an anti-cancer drug too.  It can also kill your cells anywhere.  But the fungus was more susceptible to these drugs than our tissues were.  The problem is you have to take the drugs for a long time, two to three months.  And after that, you're considered clear.  They check your cerebral spinal fluid.  They don't see anything, but sometimes every now and then, they see a very thick, old wrinkled-looking cell, floating around.  They said, it's dead because it's all wrinkled up.  No, it's not.  The fungus found a way to outwit the drugs by making a thicker cell wall so the drugs could not penetrate.  So they're these thick wall isolates that are just biding their time until the drug levels drop in your system, and then they start growing again,.  And usually, they're now resistant, totally resistant to the drugs, and they end up killing the patient.  So I wanted to find out exactly what the fungus was doing to protect itself against the drugs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21332
Speaker 1: Now, this sounds similar to the lung ailment, I mean the fungal infection you had on your lungs when you were, when you entered Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Very similar.
Speaker 1: Is that how you came up with this as a topic?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.  After I had done a rotation with Dr. George Holmes, he suggested that maybe my temperament and my, my personality would better fit with one of the female faculty members, only because I did not yell back.  And when someone yells at me, you know, I tend to get very sensitive to that because I was taught to respect my elders, respect my teachers.  He was looking for back and forth dialogue, and I thought, you don't do that.  You're a professor.  Whatever you say must be the truth so I'm accepting this without any argument.  So he says, "No, you need somebody that's gonna draw you out of your shell."  So he introduced me to Dr. Willie Lena Austin, who was a medical mycologist, studied fungi that caused diseases in humans and animals.  And she was most of the things that I wanted to be.  We were almost total opposites.  But I knew, just from watching the interactions of the faculty, that in order for me to do something worthwhile, I was going to have to come out of my shell.  I was gonna have to learn to speak up and to speak out.  And Dr. Austin was definitely an expert (laughter) in speaking up and speaking out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I chose her as my mentor, both for my Master's work and my PhD work.  [cough] Excuse me.
Speaker 1: All right.  So that's interesting 'cause it doesn't, you know, talking to you today, it wouldn't seem like it would be a problem for you to speak out.  You seem like you're very, you know, confident.
Speaker 2: I was a mouse.  If, I remember one time my second year in graduate school, I was taking the elevator from the first floor to the third floor, and the chairman of the department, Dr. Willie Turner, got on, on the second floor.  And I got off and took the stairs.  I was so afraid that he would recognize me as being a student in his department, and that he would ask me a question.  And I did not feel competent to answer any questions.  I said I'm just not ready yet.  I'm just not ready to, to speak up.  And it was so funny, we were talking about it, this was a couple of years ago.  He said, "Agnes, I saw you.  I knew exactly what you were doing, and I knew exactly why."  And I said, and he said, "But she's the smartest one here.  So I'm gonna give her some time to get her confidence up.  And he said he actually talked to Lena [Dr. Austin] and told her to stop smothering me, to stop mothering me, that she was here to train me to be a scientist and that, and a black scientist at that time meant you had to be forceful in order to be seen and to be heard.  And so she did.  And we laugh about it now, but I say, it was a very painful lesson, very painful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21333
Speaker 1: All right.  So, now, what did you find out about these -- I'm looking for the word here because I can't pronounce it.
Speaker 2: Cryptococcus.
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: I found out that if you grow them in sub-lethal concentrations of the drugs, that it stimulates them to start making thicker and thicker cell walls by adding these mantles, these sugar residues to their cell walls.  Now, you know the difference between humans and trees, right?  We don't have a cell wall.  So we can move around.  Trees have a cell wall, so they're rigid.  And that's to protect their cells.  We don't have that protection.  Even our skin is made out of cells, so we get cut easily, things like that.  Bacteria have cell walls.  Fungi have cell walls.  Some of the cell walls are made out of chitin, which you find in insect shells.  Some is cellulose that you find in plants.  This fungus, in addition to the cellulose, has mannose, which is a type of sugar, and it also has glucose in different chain linkages, going back to chemistry.  So when they're exposed to Amphotericin B.  Amphotericin is a drug that binds to the steroid molecules in your cells, your cell membranes.  They have these lipids stuck in the, in the membrane.  Amphotericin B will bind to that and pull it out of the membrane.  So now, you have a little hole in your cell membrane.  From that hole will leak small molecules, like single molecules of glucose, ATP [adenosine triphosphate], which is the energy source for the cells.  You have this leakage, and your cytoplasm, and eventually, the cell will die.  So that's how Amphotericin B kills fungi.  The specific steroid that Amphotericin B recognizes is called ergosterol, E-R-G-O-S-T-E-R-O-L.  But that sterol part, sound familiar?  It's similar to cholesterol, which is also a sterol.  So the fungus has ergosterol.  Amphotericin B will bind to that, but your kidney cells that filter out the drugs and stuff has cholesterol in its membrane.  So Amphotericin B will bind to that and pull it out.  So the doctor is limited by the amount of Amphotericin B he can give you without killing you from the cure and the time that you can take it.  And so this fungus, you know, we wonder where intelligence starts, but this fungus says, you know what?  It's hard to get a lot of this drug circulating in the blood, much less in the cerebral spinal fluid because I'm going in the brain.  So if they just keep giving me not enough to kill me, just to make me angry, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build a thick wall so that Amphotericin B can't get through my cell wall to pull my ergosterol out of my membranes.  And that's what it does.  And so the wall was 500 times thicker in the drug-treated cells than it was in the normal cells, and there was no way the drug--they said, well, that's dead.  I said, no, no, no, no.  Dead things don't replicate, do they?  I had pictures showing after long treatment with the drugs and then stopping the treatment, these thick-wall cells slowly start budding.  The yeast buds.  That's how it replicates.  So from one cell, comes two cells.  And I said, if it was dead, it wouldn't be able to do that, and the daughter cell has a thick wall also.  So that was the proof that, you know, this person has not gotten this disease twice.  It's the same disease he presented to the doctor with, and that because the fungus got smart, the drugs are no longer working on it.
Story_ID: 21334
Speaker 1: So, is there any solution to this problem?
Speaker 2: Well, it's funny you should mention that because Cryptococcus, Cryptococosis, as the disease is called, is many times the cause of death in people who are suffering with HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] because with HIV, your immune system is compromised, and fungi that you and I normally have on our body like Candida albicans, you find it in our hair, on our skin, inside, it becomes a lethal weapon in patients whose immune systems have been compromised, like people who received organ transplants and they're on immuno-suppressive therapy or people with HIV where they're, they're policing cells have been totally wiped out by the virus.  Anything, basically can kill you, but Cryptcoccosis and Candida are the two major fungi that you see as cause of death for AIDS [Aquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome] patients.  And so they are the least likely to be able to take higher concentrations of these drugs that are gonna tear up their kidneys.  And so it has forced mycologists and pharmacologists to look for better antifungal drugs to treat this organism so that you can hit 'em hard, hit 'em fast, and wipe 'em out.  And so that's some ongoing research that, that is definitely going on here within the United States.
Speaker 1: Still is there any way to dissolve the thickened cell membranes around the bacteria?
Speaker 2: No, because the components that make up that cell wall, you will find that in some form or fashion within your cells yourself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so it's like, I like to tell my students, "Guess what?  With all of our knowledge and information, as long as we've been doing this, we have yet to be able to cure a viral disease.  Why is that?"  "Because you don't have the drugs?"  I say "No, it's very simple, because they're intracellular parasites.  They live inside of cells, not outside."  Outside, you can make a drug and as soon as they step outside the cell, you can kill 'em, but if they hide out in the cell, you need something that's gonna be able to penetrate that cell to kill that virus hiding out inside.  And when you do that, you kill the cell that it's hiding in.  So we've never been able to cure the common cold.
Story_ID: 21335
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got your PhD, now one of the, I guess, you had, you got a job--I don't know if it was right away, but with the National Institute of Health, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the National Institute for Dental Research.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what were you doing there?
Speaker 2: Okay, I worked at the National Institute for Dental Research for two summers prior to my graduation to keep body and soul together and to make enough money so that we can live on the five hundred dollars a month we were getting from our teaching stipends.  And my advisor, Dr. Lena Austin, had done a sabbatical at the National Institute for Dental Research.  And at the time, she was the only African American professional in the entire building.  And that's a whole institute.  So once she got in, made a good impression, worked hard, she said, "Well, you know, I have this graduate student.  She's looking for a summer job."  And the guy said, "Well, you know, if you've trained her, sure."  So I worked there for two summers in two different labs.  And so when I graduated, I didn't know if I was, indeed, gonna finish up everything in time to graduate in '84 [1984].  So to hedge my bets, I had applied for another summer job out there.  And so when I graduated, thank God, I was basically brain dead.  I was, I was just wiped out.  I needed a break from thinking.  Right now, I just want you to give me a protocol and let me go through the motions.  I don't want to have to come up with a hypothesis and create a protocol to test it.  So I was working with a woman named Marion Young who had just become a staff scientist in the Bone Research branch of the Dental Institute.  And so she says, "Okay, so you've worked here before."  And she gave me a list of things she wanted me to do and a list of papers she wanted me to get from the library.  But she says, "You know my first anniversary is coming up, and my husband is taking me to Rome [Italy] where we spent our honeymoon.  So I'll be gone for two weeks."  So for the first two weeks of my PhD career, I had nothing to do other than, you know, go to the library and pull these journal articles.  But this person turned out, she's like a sister to me now.  In fact, I was older than she was when we started out, and I was hired as a microbiologist for the summer.  So after a couple of weeks, she gave me a project.  She said, you know, "We're trying to isolate the gene for these bone proteins to try to determine if there's a biomarker that we could use to determine if a person is going to develop bone disease like osteoarthritis or osteoporosis.  But we have to clone these genes, and we're trying to set up a molecular biology lab.  And since you're here, you know, I want you to be a part of it.  So I'm gonna give you, you know, this project, and you can work it along with me."  So I said, "Sure, great, fine.  No problem."  So it turns out that at the end, the last, the very, the last two steps that I had to do in this three-month-long project of working on it every day, the last two days, I noticed that people were dropping into the lab off and on all day.  I didn't think anything of it.  The last day, I'm getting ready to add the final reagent, I look up.  There's standing room only in the lab.  So I said, "What's going on?"  And so everybody's looking, waiting for these little blue dots to show up to indicate that I had been successful in this project.  Ten blue dots showed up.  Everybody started cheering, and I'm saying, okay, I'm beginning to take this personally 'cause I'm thinking that they're thinking, oh, this little black girl.  She can't do nothing.  It's not gonna work, you know, because that was my weakness, thinking I'm the only black professional.  We have some black janitors, we have two black secretaries, but I'm the only one with a PhD, so the weight of the race is on my shoulders.  I gotta do well, so when people started cheering, I said, you know what?  Somebody's gonna give me an explanation.  So my boss came out, and she said, "Well, you know, Marion, Pam next door grew the osteoblast cells in culture, and Larry isolated the proteins that we're studying and purified them and made antibodies to them.  And she said, you're the second person, you're the third person we've given this project to that could not make it work.  She said, you made it work.  You isolated ten clones of this proteoglycan protein that we want to study as a possible biomarker."  And so I said, "So this is a good thing, right?"  And she said, (laughter), "Yes, a very good thing, Agnes."  So I was supposed to leave at the end of September because it was only supposed to be a summer job.  So the boss man, Dr. John Turmine (ph.), always calls me "kid," calls me into his office and he says, "So what are your plans for, you know, when this job ends?"  And I said, "Well, you know, I've been brain dead all summer, so I guess I'll start looking for a real job."  He said, "What do you wanna do?"  And I said, "Well, I don't know.  You know, I'm a microbiologist, and here I am working in basically histology anatomy, and biochemistry."  He says, "Well, would you consider staying here?"  I said, "Of course, if you would consider keeping me," said, "What'll I have to do?"  He says, "Well, I have a post-doc" -- not a post-doc -- "I have a staff fellow position open and available.  So I'm gonna put you in that slot."  I said, "Well, don't you have to do a post-doc first?"  He says, "I don't have a post-doc position.  I have a staff fellow position.  You want it or not, kid?"  I said, "Yeah, okay (laughter)."  And he says, "Don't say you slept all summer because you didn't.  You got this project to work."  And so based on that, we cloned about seven or eight different proteins that we thought were only associated with bone.  It turns out most of them are all over the body, but they have different functions, depending on where they're found.  So that was my start to being, to doing molecular biology.  It had nothing and everything to do with microbiology because you could not have molecular biology without having microbiology.  Most of the enzymes that are used to cut DNA [deoxyribonucleic acid] and past it onto somebody else's DNA, all of those enzymes are derived from bacteria and viruses.  So that's the undergird, and so I was definitely a positive addition to the lab because I was able to give the theory behind what was going on in that little, tiny test tube as well as making experiments work.  So, I felt really great, and I was able to get a couple more of my fellow melon and blessed colleagues on out there in summer positions, some kids that I had mentored when I was a graduate student.  And I got them summer jobs out there.  So it was, it was generations basically, starting with my advisor, Dr. Austin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21336
Speaker 1: Now, I don't wanna skip over anything, but in 1988, you joined the faculty of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I came back to Howard.  When I graduated, I had spent basically ten years in a PhD program, three years doing a Master's that I was told, that was not medically oriented enough.  So three years of work had to be set aside, and I had to start over with something more medically relevant since we were in a college of medicine.  So I said, "I think Cryptococcus neoformans, you know, a fungus that eats your brain should be relevant enough," and they said, oh, okay (laughter).  So seven years of taking courses, in fact, when I graduated, the, the PhD program requires seventy-two credit hours.  If you get a copy of my transcript now, you'll see I have 154 credit hours on my transcript.  So my faculty just created courses for me to take.  It was, it was great.  I loved it.  I took every one they threw at me, but in, when I graduated, I told the faculty, I said, I am coming back to Howard because I see so many problems that could be fixed.  So I'm coming back, first, as a chairman of this department and then after I straighten this department out, I'm gonna be dean of the graduate school and straighten that out.  And sure enough, I came back (laughter), and I'm now chair of the department.  So be careful what you wish for.
Story_ID: 21337
Speaker 1: Okay, we were just talking off--I don't wanna get off story, but we're talking about these germ killers that people are spreading on their hands, what do they call them?  These--
Speaker 2: Antibacterial.
Speaker 1: Antibacterial agents.
Speaker 2: Creams and gels and things.  Sometimes you need the bad bacteria around because, you know, your immune system needs to be exposed to some of this stuff in small doses so that it can represent an recognize the bad bacteria and the bad viruses when they come at you in large doses.  So you don't wanna be an extremist with using these things because you're not, in the long run, you're making resistant organisms.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and displacing--
Speaker 2: And displacing the ones that, you know, are probably keeping the bad ones in check.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21338
Speaker 1: All right, so okay now, here you have your wish.  You're at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and--
Speaker 2: I come back to Howard as an assistant research professor.  Several professors here, Dr. Thomas Smith, Dr. Lee Leak, Dr. Winston Anderson got together and wrote a research grant to develop a molecular biology program for the biological sciences, including the Department of Biology on the other campus of Howard University.  And they wanted someone to head this up who was fresh off the presses and eager and energetic.  And so my old chairman called me and asked me what was I doing, invited me to Howard to give a seminar.  I got there late because I was in the bathroom practicing in the mirror at NIH [National Institutes of Health] and didn't gauge the traffic properly, but everybody waited.  I was almost a half hour late.  And I just begged forgiveness.  I said, "You all did not raise me to treat my audience like this."  So afterwards, he talked to me about this position and said, "You know, are you ready to leave NIH [National Institutes of Health]?"  I said, "No, but my staff fellow tenure is coming to a close next year.  And I will be looking for a job."  So when I accepted the job coming back here to Howard, I had been offered a position in a Fortune 500 company to head their research and development unit on anti-fungal agents.  I had been offered another job to head my own lab group at a biotech start-up company, where it would have paid double (laughter) the amount of money that I was making as a, as a staff fellow.  And the third job I was offered would have been as a scientific review administrator at the NIH over this newly designed office on HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] to actually review grants that were submitted.  And I said, "I don't wanna be on that side of the bench.  I've been trained to be a bench researcher, to do my own research.  I can't just spend my life reviewing other people's work."  And that was funny because the lady who interviewed me came to Howard, after I accepted the Howard position, a couple of months later.  And she was the keynote speak--no, it wasn't a couple months later.  It was a year later.  She was the keynote speaker (laughter) for a Sigma Psi, scientific research society dinner where I was given an award for outstanding junior researcher because when I first came to Howard, within the first year, I had submitted three research grants to three different agencies and two of the three were funded in full.  And so they said that was outstanding and I was getting this award.  She says, "I know you."  And I said, "I know you," but I can't remember.  She said, "I interviewed you to become a scientific review administrator."  I said, "Oh, yes."  And so she said, "I'm glad you didn't take the job based, just based on you getting this award after being back here for only a year."  She said, "I'm glad you stayed at the bench."  So that was, that was sort of heartwarming and a vindication of my decision.  But, yeah, I came back in '88 [1988], and assistant research professor, and then I joined, then the Howard University Cancer Center let me specify that.  And I was told that I could join whatever department that I wished.  And I said, "Well, I'm a microbiologist so it makes sense that I go back there."  So I applied and was accepted into the department as an assistant professor, tenure track, and then associate professor.  And during this time, Dr. Georgia Dunston was chair of the department and Dr. Floyd Malveaux [also a HistoryMaker] was chair.  Dr. Floyd Malveaux eventually became dean of the College of Medicine and then Senior Vice President for Health Affairs.  Dr. Dunston, during her time as chair of the Department of Microbiology developed the National Human Genome Center at Howard University, an offshoot of the National Human Genome Center at NIH.  So she was one of my role models from my Master's days, when I first came to the department. We've had, we've been blessed in having a strong cadre of women scientists who have shown by example, you know, the things that women can accomplish.  And so two-thirds of our students, our graduate students are female now.
Speaker 1: As a direct result of--
Speaker 2: I think it has a lot to do with it, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's unlike many of the institutions that--
Speaker 2: Many of the institutions.  They're either evenly balanced or they have more males going into the field than females.
Story_ID: 21339
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were promoted to associate professor in '92 [1992] and it says here that you, you're still working on drug-resistant fungi?
Speaker 2: No, I moved a little bit afield of that.  I have basically three projects going on and involved in three different projects.  One is trying to determine the genetic differences between African American and Caucasian women with breast cancer.  It's a known fact that African American women develop breast cancer at an earlier age.  The tumors are more aggressive, and overall, they have a shorter survival time than Caucasian women.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, it's also true, white women develop it, they have more breast cancer, but it's not as aggressive, it doesn't kill 'em as often.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: That's the--
Speaker 2: And since they are the majority population, when you look at our numbers versus the cases of breast cancer in this smaller population, it's, it's still a greater number overall than when you look at the Caucasian women that have breast cancer, and the size of that population.  Now, most people thought that it was basically socio-economic, that black women didn't have the mammograms, they didn't go to the doctors often enough.  And so by the time pain set in, it was already too late, that, you know, they had already--if they had gone in maybe two or three years earlier, maybe the--well, they did a meta-analysis of nurses across the United States in the same sort of pay grade, with the same level of education, nurses knowing that mammograms are important and they still found that in, with the African American nurses or the black nurses, they had a higher incidence of breast cancer, more aggressive tumors and their survival time was shorter.  So clearly, it was not just socio-economic.  There had to be some genetic input from our genes that made our tumors more aggressive, that set us up for developing the disease in the first place and for being non-responsive to the drugs that we currently have.  I don't know if you've heard the term "Triple-negative breast cancer", but there are some women who have an ER negative, HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) negative, PR negative, and those are all receptors on those cancerous cells that are known drugs can bind to get inside the tumor cell and kill it.  If you don't have those receptors on the surface, then this thing can't stick and get inside.  And that's why in triple negative women, we basically have nothing to treat them.  Another research project that I'm working on, that I'm collaborating with, is looking at the effect of fatty acids on breast cancer development as well as the use of extracts of garlic against breast cancer cells and what is the target of the active components.  And I say, I'm collaborating on that with a young investigator that I serve as a research mentor for, Dr. Selina Darling from Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And so I just hosted her about two weeks ago to come up and do some studies.  And I, like I said, I mentioned the word generations.  So you have generations in science too.  I'm mentoring Selena, but I also have a mentor that's at Walter Reed Army Institute for Research [Silver Spring, Maryland], named Dr. Marty Jet, who helped me get established in cancer research.  So, together, we had a grant for over a million dollars [$1,000,000] to study these differences and incidents and outcomes.  And it served as a training grant as well as a research grant, and we were able to graduate four of our students with their PhD from this program.  And we had high school students as well as undergraduate students working on various aspects.
Story_ID: 21340
Speaker 1: I also study heritable and acquired skin diseases, diseases like syndrome--
Speaker 2: What is that?
Speaker 1: --Ehlers Danlos.  Marfan syndrome, all of these diseases are diseases of connective tissue.  So a person with Marfan's [syndrome] will be unusually tall, unusually thin.  They will have very long fingers.  They call it "arachnodactyly," "arachno" meaning spider and "dactyly" meaning digits.  So their fingers are very long.  They can palm basketballs with no problems.  They usually have or they may develop scoliosis where the spine is curved either side-to-side or front to back.  And they have weaknesses in the aorta which is the major blood vessel of the heart and also the blood vessels of the carotid arteries, even the lungs because you'll find connective tissue everywhere in the body.  The pro--several proteins are mutated such that the connective tissues are not as strong as they should be.  Flo Hyman, do you remember her?  She was a volleyball player.  There was Marfan's [syndrome] in her family, and after the Olympics when she was playing a game in Japan, she was just pulled out of the game.  She sat down on the bench and dropped dead.  Her aorta had burst because of these weakened or connective tissue proteins.
Speaker 2: I remember she was an "all," everything in volleyball--
Speaker 1: Yes, and if you--
Speaker 2: --one of the greatest volleyball players.
Speaker 1: --looked at her entire family, they were very tall, very slender with these long fingers.  And so several of her siblings went and had surgery to try to keep their aortas from having an aneurysm, as it were, aneurysm where the vessel just burst open or slowly breaks open.  So I do that type of research.  There's another disease called Cutis Laxa where the skin just hangs very loosely on your body.  And you look like a basset hound.  And I had tissues from an entire family that had this disease.  And we found that they were totally missing a protein that was instrumental in giving the skin its normal elasticity and tightness.
Story_ID: 21341
Speaker 1: Another disease I study is Xeroderma Pigmentosa, and the medical students love this lecture because I give them the theory of how vampires came into being.  They had a combination of Xeroderma Pigmentosa, and Porphyria which is a blood disease.  It causes the gums to retract.  People thought that if you drank blood, it would help with this blood disease, so it looks like you have fangs.  You're very pale because you're anemic.  Xeroderma Pigmentosa, there is a problem with your DNA [deoxyribonucleic acid] repair system in your cells.  Sunlight, even these florescent lights emit x-rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet rays.  So we're exposed to it every time we're in light.  Our cells can repair the damage that those rays do to our DNA.  With XP, you can't repair that damage.  So if a person goes out in the sun, they will very quickly develop blisters up to the point where they have cancers in a matter of months as opposed to a matter of ten to twenty years.  So you can't go out in the sunlight.  You drink blood.  Your teeth look like fangs because your gums have retracted, and you're very pale, definition of a vampire (laughter).  So the students, like say, "You know, that's cool, and I like vampires."  I say, "I like it too."
Speaker 2: Nobody wants to be one though (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, now, with the various vampire shows that are coming on TV, it's kind of cool to be a vampire now, if you were. 'True Blood'.
Story_ID: 21342
Speaker 1: Back to one of the, the breast cancer in black women.  I know I've heard of several diseases that affect black people at a more, that are more aggressive in black people than in white people.  And, you know, now, we've spent years trying to prove we're equal and that sort of thing, and now, I mean how do--so if we're, are human beings--what's the physiological reason for black people having this more aggressive kind of cancer?
Speaker 2: That's the $64,000 question.  If you believe the mitochondrial Eve story, then you know that modern man, all men on this earth now evolved from a female from Africa, a specific region of Africa.  So all of us are related and all of us came from the same germ line.  If that's true, then the longer something is around, the more chances you have of damaging it or denting it, breaking it, right?  So if our DNA [deoxyribonucleic acid] as people from Africa have been around the longest, we've had the longest amount of time to develop mutations in our DNA.  Now, when you speak to Dr. Georgia [Mae] Dunston [also a HistoryMaker], you'll hear how the lines between races have almost been totally erased, and there is really no racial differences in the world, that we're all the same.  It's just that our DNA and how it pairs up and how it is mutated and when it was mutated is the thing that differentiates us because I'm not totally African American.  You can probably tell by my eyes (laughter).  And you're not totally African--well, you're not totally African.  I'm not totally African.  We're the true African Americans because we're a blend of the two just like our current president [Barak Obama] is a blend of the two.  And so we are an ad-mixture.  So we cannot trace our pure lineage all the way back to western Africa.  And the same way with many Caucasian races.  The funny thing about breast cancer being more prevalent in African American women than in Caucasians is because you've heard of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene, the BRCA stands for BRCA, breast cancer, that disease and the mutations associated with that gene not functioning properly was first identified in a group of women who were Ashkenazi Jews.  So you can argue that Jews are a religion as well as a race.  But if you erase those lines around the race component, religion had nothing to do with the mutations in their bodies, then even if we are all of one, that there is something genetically associated with them marrying into their tribe over these years that has caused them to be more susceptible to breast cancer because of that mutation.  And so what I'm trying to look for in the African American female population is what gene has given rise to us being more susceptible, what change has made us more susceptible?  It could just be a simple matter of overproducing stuff as opposed to under-producing, similar to sickle cell and malaria, you know.  A lot of the slaves that were brought over here from West Africa, came from an area where malaria was prevalent, and, you know, it was killing people left and right.  And over the years, you, a parasite is only a good parasite if it does not kill its host.  If you kill your host, then you gotta look for a whole new host which is why Ebola died out so fast.  But with malaria, over the years, the body says, okay, I know you want my hemoglobin.  I want--I know you wanna get inside my red blood cells.  So what if I change the shape of my red blood cells when you start attacking so that you can't get in.  Then I won't develop malaria.  I'm okay here at sea level, but you go someplace that's above sea level or you fly on a plane or something, those sickle cells that protected you from malaria now causes you to have sickle cell disease where you have, you know, blockage of your blood vessels because these sickle cells will clump together.  So in Africa, it was protective.  Here, it's a downside.  So we're, we're, we're looking for that thing or that combination of things that come together to make black women more susceptible, have more aggressive breast cancer tumors and African American men and prostate cancer.  Again, African American men tend to have more of it, looking at their percentage of the population.
Story_ID: 21343
Speaker 1: Now, are there maladies that affect white people more and are more aggressive in terms of their--
Speaker 2: Melanoma, skin cancer, mainly because, I like to call them melanin challenged.  My medical student says I like that term.  But they don't have the protection of the darkened skin color.  But I tell my students from the Sudan, you need to wear sun block too because those rays, depending on how long you stay outside, you're getting gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet rays.  If you have a mutation in your DNA [deoxyribonucleic acid] repair system that cannot fix the mutation caused by those rays from the sunlight, then over time, you're going to develop skin cancer.  So the highest rate of skin cancer was in Australia and the lowest number of cases, of course, is Sweden and Norway.  But even us, as African American people, if we work outside, do a lot of gardening, roofing, construction, we should wear sun block.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21344
Speaker 1: Now, you became a full professor in--
Speaker 2: Nope, associate professor in '92 [1992] [at Howard University].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I became chairman in 2000, what three [2003]?  I'm not a full professor yet.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: That's still on my bucket list (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, so, okay, all right.  Now, in 2003, you appeared on the PBS Series, 'Closer to the Truth.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was that about?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was, that was wonderful.  It was a television series that asked scientific questions, and it had a slew of various people from various areas of scientific endeavor, community activism, depending on what the topic was.  And our topic was, "Will we win the war against microbes?"  And they had several people.  They had one, I think it was a Noble laureate, another one who had won, you know, a major award, Lasker Award, another one that, you know, had written twenty books on various microbes and things, and they had me (laughter).  And we sat around and talked about, you know, what are the things that are going on in medicine and in society that are making these microbes more resistant.  And then we talked about probiotics in, and the yogurt and whether that was good or bad to actually knowingly eat bacteria.  And so I talked about the Crips and the Bloods [reference to two of the most violent gangs in the United States] that live in your stomach, that you have millions of bacteria that live in your stomach, the integral bacteria ACE [collagen-binding surface component] that helps you to digest your food, that makes cofactors that you need for your enzymes, and also makes some of the vitamins that you need.  But when you go on these crazy diets and you don't bring in the proper nutrition for them to get their share of food so they can have the energy, then they said, look, this intestine isn't big enough for the both of us.  One of y'all gonna have to bounce.  And so enterobacter [a bacterial genus] says, well, I've got my AK-47 [rifle] here, and then E. coli [Escherichia coli; bacterial species] says, well, I got something that you've never seen before.  And he starts making a bacteria, starts making an antibiotic to kill off his rivals so that they will have enough food in order for them to survive.  And that's called microbial antagonism, that occurs in your gut every day.  You have lots of bacteria inside your body that could kill you.  But the good, the bad, they try to keep each other in check so that one doesn't get the upper hand.  And when you alter your diet significantly, that balance goes off.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, so--
Speaker 2: So probiotics in that case is good because it helps to repopulate without adding calories.
Story_ID: 21345
Speaker 1: You often hear in a neighborhood health food store or in these lectures that are popular today about one diet or another being more beneficial or you should stop eating one thing or another.  And it's, how do people know if they're actually killing off the wrong thing or not, or the right things or not?
Speaker 2: They will know by a change in bowel habits.  Like I say, they live in the gut, and if you get a case of diarrhea, you know, that's one thing.  If you don't go at all, that's an indication of something else.  But, you know, the main thing is for people to know their habits and know what's supposed to be happening.  I used to tease my husband when he was saying, "I just don't understand what you want."  And I would say, "Didn't you read the manual?"  He said, "What manual?"  I said, "The manual you received when you were born on understanding women."  He said, "What are you talking about?"  I said, "Every man received that manual, like we received a manual saying how to understand men.  We read our manual cover-to-cover.  You all put yours aside and said, "As soon as this game is over."  And he's talking about--I said, "It's just an analogy, John.  It means that you all just don't understand where we're coming from."  We need to know our bodies, to know what is normal so that when something abnormal happens, you're able to recognize it early enough to get it corrected. Most people don't go to the doctor until something actually hurts.  It's the pain that sends them as opposed to going for regular checkups to make sure that you're maintaining proper homeostasis or proper health.
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of the TV show 'Closer to the Truth,' the conclusion, I think, had something to do with this not really being a war, right?
Speaker 2: It's not a war against microbes because we're working together, and that the probiotic shows that micro bio--microorganisms can be highly beneficial, not only with helping us to digest and repopulate our intestines, but many of the drugs, antibiotic drugs that are being in use--that are in use today are made by other microorganisms, like other bacteria and other fungi.  We are using bacteria for bioremediation.  There's a strain of bacteria that actually eats oil spills.  I thinks a Klebsiella species that can eat up oil spills.  And so we're using, we're, we're learning how to work in harmony with these organisms, to still respect them because they can still kill you.  But know that in their proper niche, it's all positive on both sides, that they can, indeed, be a positive help.  It's not a war.  It's part--, it's becoming a partnership.
Story_ID: 21346
Speaker 1: Okay, of course, you have many, many publications (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's, it's growing.  My list is growing.  As you can see, I have very eclectic interests in research.  I, I can't work on just one thing.  I have to multi-task and so you'll see publications on medically important fungi as well as publications on breast cancer research, publications on development of lymphatic vessels.  I had a student who I was the advisor for, and he did his work out at the Food and Drug Administration in the animal section.  So we were looking at the immunology in pigs (laughter).  And so while we didn't have a good barbeque, we did get some good results from those studies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the latter part of my bibliography is dealing with breast cancer, either looking at over expression of enzymes that actually destroy connective tissue so that cancers can spread or metastasize to looking at extracts of garlic that can be used to either prevent breast cancer or to treat breast cancer.  So like I said, it's eclectic, but there is a focus associated with it, and that's looking at connective tissue proteins and how they are functioning in normal, as well as diseased situations.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 21347
Speaker 1: Now, in 2009, you had to confront a real cancer crisis in your own family.  So--
Speaker 2: (Sigh) Yes, my one and only child, my daughter, Theresa Denise, was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after Christmas.  She had been engaged for about six months and we were visiting various venues trying to decide on where to have the big wedding of my dreams.  She only wanted, you know, like a small crowd.  And I said, no, we gotta have at least 500 'cause that's my dream.  And, of course, you're supposed to live to please your parents.  But she received very excellent care.  She lives in New York, and she had stage  two breast cancer.  And they had a recent summit on discussing breast cancer, and they came up with a recommendation that women should wait till the age of fifty before having their first mammogram.  Currently, it's at the age of forty.  My daughter was thirty-four, and she had stage two breast cancer, fitting the criteria of the very disease that I'm studying.  Why?  So it hit very close to home, and I don't know whether it--I know it was not cause and effect, that it wasn't because I was studying cancer that she developed [it].  That's ridiculous.  It was more fortuitous because I could explain to her, and she could talk to me about the disease.  So when her hair started to come out because of the chemotherapy, I shaved my head, and I went up to people and said, "Ask me why I'm bald."  And they'd say, "Oh, why are you bald?"  And I said, you know, "To make people aware of breast cancer."  I said, "You have a mother, you have a sister, you have a wife, you have a daughter, you know.  Make sure that they don't wait, especially, if they're African American, don't wait until you're forty.  And if breast cancer's in your family already, you had an aunt that died from it, your mother died, your sister, then you have to start even earlier, getting your baseline mammogram done so that they can look and compare that to changes in the future."  So my daughter's doing very well.  We postponed the wedding because we wanted everybody happy and healthy.  So, hopefully, within the next two or three years, I'll get the wedding of my dreams (laughter) through her.
Story_ID: 21348
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 2010, you were selected by MSNBC's the 'TheGrio' as one of the 100 top historymakers in the making.  And in, 2011, you won the William A. Hinton Research and Training Award.  What today, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, and you're still in the midst of a career, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy, I think is tied up with the roll that I see myself playing.  I consider myself a facilitator.  I do research, I teach.  I love doing research, I love teaching, but I'm touching the lives of other people.  I'm helping young people to reach their life's dream the way my godmother, Mrs. [Rose Marie] Bryan, helped me reach a point where I could go on and become something.  Of the thirteen kids, I'm the only one that completed college, the only one that got an advanced degree.  I have a sister who's an RN [registered nurse], a sister who's an inhalation therapist.  Everybody else, blue collar, day laborers, whatever.  So I owe a big debt of gratitude that my third grade teacher saw something in me, early on, and by hook or by crook, by locking me up, by making me ostracized by the popular kids, she was able to help me develop into a person who has a career, can hold their heads up, can turn around and help the second generation of her family, the children of her brothers and sisters to reach that, to help the kids that come to the PhD program in microbiology, to help them get their PhDs and find good jobs.  So I, I like to impact people, hopefully, in a positive way and try to pay it forward.  I can't pay back my two sisters who took me shopping for clothes so that I could go off to college and look nice, but I can help their children get into college and buy them some outfits so that they can get a degree, and they can take care of their mothers.  So I try to facilitate the education of whoever comes to me.  And I have a hard time saying, no.  I do a lot of community speaking on behalf of the Howard University Cancer Center [Washington, D.C.], on behalf of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  They used to have a black colleges, black churches program.  And we would go in the churches on Saturdays and do hands-on science, making bubbles, making batteries, making flashlights, wonderful things that the deacons would be participating, four-year olds would be participating.  People bring their whole families just so they could--and I'd say, you know, science is all around you.  "I don't like science."  I said, "Oh, you don't like electricity, you don't like being able to flip a switch and turning on a light.  Let me show you how that light works.  Let's make a battery.  Let's make a flashlight."  They would say, "Oh, I didn't realize that."  So it's just becoming aware of your world around you and things you can do to make it better and the way you can help people and pay it forward.  So my legacy, I, you know, every scientist dreams of winning the Nobel Prize.  I've had that dream too, but it's not gonna be me who's going to be the first African American to get the Nobel Prize in medicine and science.  I have accepted that fact at this point in my life.  But I would like to be the one to train the person who does that.  And so I, I, my students are a joy, and I tell them, pay it forward.  As I'm paying it forward to you, I want you to pay it forward; help out the next generation.  And most of the graduates that have come out under me and out of my department have done just that.  They're in academia, still in research.

Speaker 1: Ma'am, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I think that the African American community today is a hundred times better off than when I was a child.  However, and I talk to my medical students, my dental students, my nursing students, my graduate students, and I tell them, back in the day, we had one phone in the house.  And I only was given five minutes per day to talk on the phone.  So if I had three friends that wanted to call me, I had to divide up those five minutes because after five minutes, that was it.  Now, you all can't even sit through a one hour lecture without going out to talk on your cell phone.  I said, you're not focusing, you're not learning.  Do you realize that from the time your textbook was published to this lecture that I'm giving to you today, that this information, half of this information is out of date.  I said, so we can't even keep up with the information that's coming out.  And you're falling even more behind by not focusing, not coming to class.  The, I think the generations after the Depression and after slavery, each generation wanted to give its children better opportunities, make it easier on them.  I think that it's come to a point now where you now have to get tough.  You now have to go back to a point where you demand excellence.  You don't make excuses.  If you see that the time outs are not working, then make the kid do something during that time of punishment, not just sit there playing with the video games.  Video games are great.  I love 'em myself, but there's a time and a place.  And so I don't think that we're gonna be doing the next generation a favor by not insisting that they do house chores.  Oh, we have a maid for that.  You don't have to do that; not walking the dog, not learning about animals and how, you know, that special bond between a man and his dog or a woman and her puppies.  I babysit two puppies.  I love 'em, or not learning how to earn your own money because then, you know, once a kid graduates from the college that you paid full tuition for, they come back and live with you for the next twenty, thirty years.  You want to make people who are independent, who realize we've come a long way, but we still haven't fully arrived yet.  And have them to keep pushing forward, not rest on their parents' laurels, but to make their own.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, the people that helped you, now did they have a chance to see you--did Rev. [Rose Marie] Bryan live to see you get your PhD or your brother, Larry?
Speaker 2: My brother, Larry, Mrs. Bryan, lived long enough.  My mom [Annie Lee Harvey] lived long enough, and on the dedication page in my dissertation, I mention all of them as having set me on the road to asking the questions, "Why?" and "I wonder what would happen if?"
Speaker 1: Larry passed away in 1990, and he passed away from cancer, and it affected, it took his speech first.  It was all over his body, but mostly in his brain.  So it affected his speech center.  We hadn't seen each other in about fifteen years.  He was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with his family.  I was in Washington [D.C.], trying, in school, trying to--oh, but we, you know, every birthday, we sent each other birthday cards and stuff.  And so when his wife called and said that he was ill, and I went to Milwaukee, he couldn't talk.  And we just looked at each other -- hadn't seen each other in fifteen years, talked on the phone, wrote to each other -- and the tears just started running for both of us.  And Larry, his nickname was "Boats" because he was so tall like my brother, David, that when he was in the hospital bed, they had to order a new bed.  His feet were hanging off the end of the bed, up to mid-calf.  And so he had to curl up.  And you could see the tumors growing on his sternum, little round nodules, all over his arms.  But he lived for like four months after I saw him.  So I came back and it was just hard seeing him go.  But he had a son and a daughter, and I told them stories of their dad and me when we were children and how we would disappear all day and go into the woods.  There weren't any real woods in Daytona [Daytona Beach, Florida].  It was mostly developed, but there were patches, like Kelly Field where the black kids went to the pool and stuff.  There were lots of trees and woods back there, that we would just go exploring all day.  We didn't need a computer.  We didn't need video games.  We learned the shapes of the leaves and what was edible and what wasn't edible.  And it was just a wonderful childhood that I'm sorry my daughter missed because even in the '70s [1970s], you did not let your children just wander around the city by themselves all day.  So, I don't know if we'll have get back to a kinder, gentler nation.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, do you have grandchildren?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Not yet?
Speaker 1: Not yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: All right, now is there anything we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think we've basically covered the waterfront here.
Speaker 1: All right, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different, ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered in a lot of ways, that I came from a very poor background and was able to make good, to make my mother [Annie Lee Harvey] proud, give her bragging rights, as it were.  I want to be remembered by my family as the auntie that didn't let her lucky break go to her head, that she always tried to help the family.  You can probably tell by my family history that we didn't talk a lot about the past, mainly because we were trying to survive the present.  But for future's sake, I would like to leave a legacy to my parent--to my family that, okay, start here.  Look at this person that came from the same background as your mom and dad did, she was able to push forward.  She had a lot of help, but she was able to do it.  Let that be your role model.  Try to achieve something.  I want one day for the Laster name to be world known, world renowned.  I don't sing.  I don't dance very well.  I think.  And then after I think, I try to do.  And so I want to be remembered as part of my legacy of being a doer and being a facilitator.  You've heard the saying "Those who can't do and those who can't teach."  That's not true, because those who "can" that "do" had to be taught.  So I want to be remembered as a teacher who cared, as a facilitator that tried to bring factions together that have interests that you can see working together to come up with a product.  And after I retire, I'd like to be remembered as an author.  There're several books just sitting inside of me waiting, just fighting to get out.  But right now, I don't have the time, but when I retire, probably back to Florida, I, I'm gonna pen some things just to make the old folks remember and the young folks will say, "Oh, my God."  So--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --that's not asking too much, is it, to be five or six things?
Speaker 1: All right, well, thank you so much.
Speaker 2: All right, well, thank you.
