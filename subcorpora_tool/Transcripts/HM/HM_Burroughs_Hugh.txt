Story_ID: 339872
Speaker 1: All right, now I'm going to ask you a few warm-up questions--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and just bear with us, they're kind of People magazine-ish things.  Okay, could you please tell us your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is paella.
Speaker 1: Oh really?
Speaker 2: It's a Spanish-inspired dish.  It's reminiscent of a dish that we prepared in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] when I was growing up that was called pelau, but it's the same tradition.  It's, it's a rice mixed with a variety of meats and spices and so on.
Speaker 1: It's delicious. Okay, your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year, I would say, since I've been in the states, that my favorite time of the year would have to be the summertime when I can get out and do a lot of summertime activities; I love to play tennis, for example.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you. Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  I'd say in terms of--I'd say overall blue would be my favorite color because it's inspiring and it's positive, and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.  If you had any place in the world, any place in the world to go for a vacation, where would it be?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would think maybe one of the Hawaiian Islands.  I like Hawaii a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: It reminds me of the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: Right.  Your favorite--do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, not particularly.  A number, you know, come to mind.  I like to sum things up by saying that we learn as we grow.  I like to be philosophical and say, give it your best shot and after that, let it be.
Story_ID: 339873
Speaker 1: Now we're going to go back and we're going to talk a little bit about your family background--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --okay?  Could you please tell me about your mother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Evalina Crawford [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington], that was her maiden name, and we grew up in the Caribbean.  She raised myself and three brothers--three half-brothers.  And having raised four sons, she yearned to have a daughter, so she then adopted a girl.  So I have a sister as well now.
Speaker 1: Okay, where did she grow up?  Did she tell you anything about her background?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She grew up in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago].  She was born of an Antiguan mother and a Trinidad father, and grew up in--under quite modest circumstances in Trinidad.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  How would you describe her?
Speaker 2: Well, she--I would describe her as loving, caring, very family oriented, selfless, and for me she was very inspiring and very supportive.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories you'd like to share about her with us?
Speaker 2: Oh well, I, I think that she was always fond of encouraging me to succeed at whatever I wanted to succeed at.
Story_ID: 339874
Speaker 1: We were growing up in a colonial area--era in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago], and that era put boundaries about who you could be and where you could grow--what you can become and so on.  And she [Burroughs' mother, Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington] was one of the earliest influences who kept saying to me that I could be whatever I wanted to be.
Speaker 2: Could you explain a little bit more about what some of those boundaries were?
Speaker 1: Well, without giving you a lecture on colonialism, the colonial structure suggested that the colonies, of which Trinidad was one, and Barbados, and Jamaica, and the others that you know and were a lots of African countries--I'm talking now about the late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s], that we were all meant to be subservient to the British crown.  And anything British and anything white was superior to us, and they set the boundaries about what we could be and what we couldn't be.  In those days, the governor of the, of the islands, Trinidad and the other islands, the governor was always white from England and that meant that we could not be governor, the ministers and so on were, were white from England.  And so, those boundaries were pretty much set, not unlike the boundaries that were set for my American brothers and sisters in the South of the United States.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Same thing.
Story_ID: 339875
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about your father, what was his name?  Where was he born?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Vernon, Vernon Burroughs, and he, too, was born in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago].  He was born of, of a Barbadious--Barbadian father and I believe a Barbadian mother.  I'm not sure whether she was born in Barbados or Trinidad.  My father was the village, or the town cobbler; he was a shoemaker.  And he made new shoes; he made shoes from scratch, he also repaired shoes.  So his being the town cobbler really gave us, and gave the Burroughs' name, a kind of prominence in the, in the, in the community because everybody had to go to the village cobbler.
Speaker 1: Do you have any--did he tell you anything about his growing up--his experiences when he was a child?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  He talked about his own parents; his father and his mother who died when he was quite young, and he thought about how painful it was to miss his mother, and how hard it was to grow up without a biological mother.  He talked more about that than he talked about anything else.
Speaker 1: I see.  Could you describe him for us?
Speaker 2: He, too, was a, very kind, very gregarious, and very proud of me.  I was his only son and he was--he invested a lot psychologically in me.
Story_ID: 339876
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about your ancestors, how far back your family history goes?  Do you have any idea?
Speaker 2: Well, last--in July of 2004, I organized the first family reunion on my mother's [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington] side.  And we met in Antigua, which is where my maternal folks come from--came from I should say, and there we had about 175 family members from Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago], Antigua of course, New York City [New York, New York], Chicago [Illinois], California, and the United Kingdom [UK].  And I brought them all together for the first time.  The background on my mother's side is that my grandmother, Susanna [Susanna Richards], was one of seven children that my great-grandfather [Peter Richards] had.  He had six daughters and one son.  And when my great-grandmother [Maria Spencer Richards] died, three of the daughters and the son migrated to Trinidad to follow their father, and three of the daughters stayed in Antigua.  So the family reunion that we had in July of 2004 was the first time that those two branches of the family were brought together in a systematic way.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's wonderful, that was so wonderful.  You must be so happy, so proud of that fact.
Speaker 2: Well, I was very proud of being able to do that and I felt that--I'm very family oriented and I understand the importance of family and so on, and it was my way of giving back to my family something that--from my own resources.
Speaker 1: Okay, you, you had in passing mentioned your grandparents.  Is there anything more you can tell us about your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: I never knew my maternal grandmother.  I knew my maternal grandfather.
Speaker 1: You know his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Joseph, Joseph Burroughs [ph.].  He was born and grew up in Barbados and he was essentially a farmer, a sugarcane famer, and from what I can gather and reconstruct now, he--and in Barbados, he was essentially a, what you'd call in the U.S., a sharecropper.  I mean, he was a, you know, growing sugar cane for somebody, probably somebody white from England and then at the end of the day, at the end of the week or what have you, he got some pay and then got deducted his living expenses.  It was that kind of arrangement.
Story_ID: 339877
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're gonna talk a little bit more about your personal life.  What--do you have--what's the earliest memory you have of being a child, your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I would say my earliest memories--I grew up in a town in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] called Arouca, which was, I would say by American standards, a rural, kind of undeveloped place. And it was a, a house--my housing was such that--and this was typical of the houses there then, and to some extent some of those qualities carry over today.  It was like what you would call open house every day.  I mean, the day starts and when the day starts people start coming in to visit my mother [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington] and to say hello, and to share stories and so on, and I and the other kids were all just running around these adults.  And there were adults there all the time, mainly women but some men.  And my earliest thoughts then were of my mother sort of shepherding me around, making sure I had enough to eat and drink and so on, and then other boys and girls about my age running in and out of the house and playing outdoors because it was generally summertime all year round, and we didn't have shoes.  And we were just running around having a good time, those were my earliest recollections.
Story_ID: 339878
Speaker 1: How would you describe your family's life in general?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say that we were poor like everybody else around us.  We relied on our own homegrown fruits and vegetables to supplement whatever we could buy in the store.  We did a lot of--I didn't know the term then, but the term would be bartering with other family members so we have something--a lot of something and they don't--so we'd share a lot.  And, I would say the one way in which my family was a little different from the others was that my father [Vernon Burroughs], being the town [Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago] cobbler, would have cash income just about every week because he'd repair shoes and people would pay. So we were able to get cash to go to the store, to buy things.  And a lot of our neighbors could not do that because they were reliant almost entirely on agriculture, and, therefore only during the harvesting season.  So, my boyhood I remember just being with other boys and girls and playing sports, and running around in the sunshine and being unaware of being deprived of anything, like piano lessons or scouting experiences.  I mean that didn't seem to mean much to me, I was having a great time with my, with my friends.
Story_ID: 339879
Speaker 1: You mentioned you have brothers and a sister, could you please tell us your siblings' name and birth or-, the way, hello, your siblings' names and their birth order, and describe, tell us something about them?
Speaker 2: Well, I have three half-brothers, but we all grew up in the same household, and when we were growing up, and even today, we do not make the distinctions between half-brother and half-sister, and so on.  They are my brothers, I have three of them, and I have a sister, and I don't make the distinction that she's adopted.  I say I have three brothers and I have three sisters.  I was born in 1940, as you know.  The brother after me was born in 1944, I believe, and then the other one was '46 [1946] and then the other one was '47 [1947]; they're close together.  Their names are, are Artie A-R-T-I-E Whittington [Artie Whittington], Earl Whittington and Frank Whittington [ph.].  And my sister is Ingrid Graham [ph.].  I didn't live much in the house with my sister because by that time--by the time she came along and was adopted by my mom [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington], I had left home, and I'd gone to the United States.  But I grew up with my three brothers, and they were a very, very important part of my life, in shaping my life.  Artie, Earl and Frank, and even today, we are very, very close.
Speaker 1: So your--did your father [Vernon Burroughs] die and your mother remarried?
Speaker 2: My father and my mother divorced, my father has since died and so has my stepfather [Egbert Whittington (ph.)] as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: I see. You had said that your brothers were a good influence on you.  How did they influence you?
Speaker 2: Well, the interesting--if you ask each of them a, that question what they would say.  Or, if you asked my wife, they'd all get a kick about how I would answer this.  I would say first of all, I was very close to my three brothers, and because I was four years older than they, my mother sort of relied on me to help her with the quote parenting of them, you know, to round them up for the lunch, and to round them up for, for dinner and what have you.  And, as you can well imagine, there are times when they didn't want to be rounded up, particularly by me.  So I had to, you know, grab them and drag them in and they sort of resented this.  But I would say by and large we had a good, positive relationship, and I would say towards the end, the three of them really looked up to me, for example, direction, counsel, confidences and so on.  And I think that's the case even, even today.  We have, we are all very close, as I said.
Story_ID: 339880
Speaker 1: Could you describe the neighborhood, the community you group up in?
Speaker 2: Well that's interesting because the neighborhood I grew up in had a profound influence in my life, even today.  We grew up in, what you would call in America, a mixed neighborhood.  Not in terms of income, we were all poor; we were all agriculturally dependent in terms of sugarcane crop, which is a terrible system almost as bad as cotton.  I can get back to that if I want, if you want me to.  But what was interesting about that mixed neighborhood was that we were about 50 percent Afro-Trinidadians, that is descendants of slaves who had come to Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago], so we were Afro-Trinidadians.  The other 50 percent were Indo-Trinidadians; these were Indians who came to the, to Trinidad following the end of the slave trade as indentured servants, and that indentured system said--it's something like sharecropper.  It said to the Indians in India, we will pay for your passage to the New World, and when you get there and you work, then you can pay us off the cost of the passage.  Needless to say it was a system where they were never really 100 percent paid off because they got into debt.  So the Indians were around us, and, of course, the Indians brought their culture from India.  And one of the dominant things about their culture, which caught my attention, and, and, and instructs me even today, was that while we, the Afro-Trinidadians, who were largely Christians and largely, what you call Episcopalians, but it was also some Roman Catholics, but anyhow, we were Christians and we were--we believed in one god, the concept of one god. We were monotheistic.  The Indians were not Christians; they were Hindus mainly.  There were some Muslims but mainly Hindus, and the Hindus were polytheistic.  So they had gods of love, a god of beauty, a god of this, a--and there you are--there I am as a young person growing up trying to figure out which one is correct, which one makes sense.  And I, I, I stayed with that question for a long, long time.
Story_ID: 339881
Speaker 1: Did you ever answer that question?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  You want to tell us the answer?
Speaker 2: Well, it took me a long time.  It was a long journey, but in the end, I concluded that there was no god.
Speaker 1: Oh, interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I concluded there's no god, so today I am what's described as a humanist.  I believe in the supremacy of the human being.  I do not believe in the concept of god, and I do not believe in the concept of spirits and afterlife, and all that stuff.  I just--I think those are manmade constructs and so on.  The other reason--and that's a topic I can have a long session on, but it's--interesting to note because it influences me and so--a lot of other thinking people.  In the colonial concept, the head of the, of the political hierarchy of course is the queen.  She's the head of state, she's the head of government.  She's also the head of the church, so the church and the political body were really one in the English context.  So you had no choice but to be a Christian and to believe in the supremacy of the church, so it took a long time for me and others to undo this concept that the queen can't be a descendant or a messenger of God and at the same time be head of government and so on.  So it was so bad, and, and, and that colonial, colonial brainwashing, if you want to call that, was so steep.  For example, we sang, we sang the British national anthem ['God Save the Queen'], which said something like, God save our gracious queen, God save our noble queen born to reign over us, God save our queen.  And we waved flags and we sang that as enthusiastically as you want to.  So, if you go through your first 15, 16, 17 years of life with that kind of indoctrination, it's very, very hard to undo it.  And, thankfully, I have.
Story_ID: 339882
Speaker 1: You had mentioned--you--sugarcane, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) could you just briefly describe how that system worked?
Speaker 2: Well, it was not unlike, unlike the cotton plantations.  I submit that growing sugarcane was, indeed, harder than, than growing cotton.  My American friend says, oh no, there's nothing as hard as cotton.  But, essentially, what it was is that there, there were these estates, sugarcane estates, that were owned by companies that were largely British companies and then these sugarcane estates in turn would lease land to, to farmers; both the land on which they lived as well as the land on which they farmed.  And then once a year there would be a harvesting of the sugarcane, the sugarcane would be sold, the estate will tell the farmer, well, you've raised, I don't know, twenty tons and this year it's five dollars a ton so you get a hundred dollars, or whatever the amount was, it was, it was very small.  I don't remember the numbers now, but that was the system.  So, essentially, once a year you got a cash payment.  And then around Christmastime there was something called back pay where they'd say, well, we paid you five dollars a ton and we were able to sell it on the open market so that you should really have been paid six dollars a ton, so we'll give you a back pay around Christmastime, which they did.  And then you'd use that of course for shopping.  It was that kind of system so you never owned the land and you worked it day in, day out, sunshine or rain and you tried to harvest as much sugarcane as you can.  And then it's the same kind of system where you try to get your sons and daughters, nephews and nieces to come and help so you can grow more, and so same thing as, as the cotton plantations in the South.
Story_ID: 339883
Speaker 1: Could you tell us, are there any sights or sounds or smells that when you come into contact with them it immediately takes you back to your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say whenever I'm in a setting where there's a sort of dominant sunshine, where the sun is blazing down and the skies are largely blue with few sk-, clouds and so on, whenever I see that I think back to, to the Caribbean and I think back, you know, it brings back good memories.
Story_ID: 339884
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any other memories you'd like to share with us about growing up [in Trinidad and Tobago]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would say one of the important things for people like me, and maybe my brothers and sisters in the South feel the same way, we were poor but we didn't know it.  We were poor in terms of financial resources, but we were very rich in terms of our culture, in terms of sense of self and so on.  And even though we were oppressed by the British, we didn't feel it.  And so my boyhood was sort a wonderful time of plays and sports and so on and so on.  It was only until I get to, got to my high school years that I began to think about the system that produced me, and think about what the future might hold.
Story_ID: 339885
Speaker 1: Could you tell us a little bit about your elementary school, where did you go to school?  What was your elementary school called?
Speaker 2: Well, my elementary school was part of a system created by, by the English.  They were called English Catholic schools, and so we had a system where we had English Catholic schools, we had Roman Catholic schools and we had government schools, and maybe Seventh-day Adventists had so- maybe one or two schools and some other religions.  But we went to what's called Arouca E.C. School [Arouca Anglican Primary School, Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago], and when I first heard about it and began going there, I didn't know what E.C. stood for.  Interestingly enough, I knew what R.C. stood for.  I knew that R.C. was Roman Catholic because the Roman Catholic church was right there.  It turns out the English church, the Episcopalian church, was also right there, but I didn't make that connection.  So we went to this religious school, so to speak, and it was not a heavy dose of religion.  We did say grace before meal I think, and we had an opening prayer and maybe an evening prayer, but, you know, but it wasn't--but the, the content of the schooling, curriculum did not include religious indoctrination.  And why? Because nearly all of this when we left the school we went to the church to get the indoctrination in order to be baptized and do the catechism. Catechism is what you study and then you got--you became--you were not--I'm sorry, you're baptized when you're born and then you're confirmed at about eleven or twelve or so.  So that's where we got the straight indoctrination into Episcopalianism as you would call it, or Anglicanism as we would call it.
Story_ID: 339886
Speaker 1: Are there any teachers in elementary school [Arouca E.C. School; Arouca Anglican Primary School, Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago] who influenced you?
Speaker 2: Well, that's very interesting.  My last year or two in elementary school, we didn't have what you call middle school in the U.S., but our last, the last year or two we were treated as if we were in a middle school and I think that, that experience my last two years in elementary school really shaped me for the rest of my life.  We--I was put in a class of about twenty, twenty-five, and we were called a special class.  And we tended to be the brightest, the most energetic and so on.  And the teacher who led that class I often think about him because he really inspired us a lot and helped us a lot.  And his name--he was an Indian--an Indo-Trinidadian by the name of Singh, S.B.C. Singh, S.B. Jihadjua Singh [ph.]; stern, tough, fair-minded, inspiring, encouraging, sky is the limit, phrases like there's always room at the top, you can do whatever you want to do.  And I had a, two years of that so in elementary school for example in this special class, I did Latin, I did Spanish, I did French, I did trigonometry, and of course English literature and so on.  When I finished that special class at age twelve, twelve and a half or so, and I went on to high school, I and the others who went through that special class training, we were fully prepared for the first year of high school.  My father [Vernon Burroughs]--in those days when you finished elementary school, most of the kids that was at the--it stopped there and they then went to some trade school to learn to be a mechanic or carpenter, or something like that.  So, I mean, that was one of the options in front of us, and my father insisted, no, this guy is gonna go to high school, and he's gonna go to high school and he's gonna do well.  And my mother [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington] says, well, yeah, that's one option, or he can get a trade and I'm sure he'll do that well, too.  But it was my father who was insistent, so I went to a private high school.
Story_ID: 339887
Speaker 1: When we left you had mentioned that you had finished elementary school [Arouca E.C. School; Arouca Anglican Primary School, Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago] with this wonderful teacher, this special class, and now your family was making the decision about whether you should go on to high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And my father [Vernon Burroughs] was very clear and very adamant that I should go on to high school, and there wasn't much debate about that.  And I did.  It represented a very important turning point because the preparation under Mr. Singh [S.B. Jihadjua Singh (ph.)] in those special classes was really--suited me so well for high school.  And all of us who left that special class and went on to high school did very, very well.  In those days the class--the test results at the end, end of the term you were ranked in class so you could really find out where people did in class, who was first, who was second and so on.  And in my first term in high school, I was first in class.  And that shaped my whole attitude towards high school and college [Columbia University, New York, New York], which said is not that I was more brilliant than anybody else but what it said is that if I worked hard, if I were determined and if I were organized, I can succeed and excel at anything.  It's interesting about those high school years, and my performance there, and I've run into some of the folks who went to high school with me, in the special class and in high school in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago], we were taught you could do anything.  Unlike a current trend here which says, well, you can do quantitative but you can't do qualitative.  We would--I was doing well in qua- quantitative stuff, mathematics, trigonometry, geometry, algebra.  I was doing very, very, equally well in languages; I was doing French, I was doing Latin, I was doing Spanish in high school plus English, and I was doing well in all the subjects and it didn't occur to me that because I was good at math that means I might not have been good at languages, for example.  It's true I didn't do a lot of art and I didn't--we didn't have a lot of science because we didn't have laboratories so I didn't get that experience.  And we didn't do much art, we did a little art.  But those high school years were glorious years and the stage was set by that first semester performance.
Story_ID: 339888
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers in high school who influenced you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there were, there were teachers there and in preparation for this, I went back and recalled some of their names.  There was a Mr. Stuart [ph.] and Mr. Adams [ph.], and Mr. Seeley [ph.], and some others who kept saying to me and the other kids in class, you can do whatever you want to do.  Remember, Loretta [Loretta Henry], that this was important--it was an important message for us because we were under colonialism, which said that you can only be so good and you're really not as good as some English guy who was the inspector of schools or the prime minis- you couldn't--so that message was a very important counter-message to get.  I think it's the same kind of message that my brothers and sisters in the South got after a while, you know.  This Jim Crow stuff that attempts to put boundaries around you--don't, don't be bounded by it.  You can be whatever you want to be, it's a very, very important message.
Story_ID: 339889
Speaker 1: You had mentioned that you, you were first in your class [in high school].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you were a very studious student?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you get into trouble?  You never got sent to the principal's?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I didn't do too much--
Speaker 1: You were good (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) troublemaking, and I was studious but I don't, I don't think I consider myself a bookworm.  Maybe others did, but I took my assignments seriously, and that's a quality that I have taken through, throughout my college and professional life.  When I've got something to do and I've made a commitment to do it, by god, I do it.  I do it to the best of my ability.  Now, if you ask my mother [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington] about it she would say, yeah, that's how, how he is.  And she would say, you know, I don't know where he got that.
Speaker 1: Oh, really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was talking to one of my cousins who visit--when she visited us some years ago, and he knew me from my New York [New York] and California years, and my professional work with foundations and my style and so on.  So he said, "Well, who told him to do--how--?" And she said, "You know, he was always like that.  As a little boy, if I said to him, 'Hugh [HistoryMaker Hugh C. Burroughs], you know, we gotta get such and such in order to put the meal together,' he would be--he would diligently do what he's told to do."  That's what she said.
Story_ID: 339890
Speaker 1: When you were not in school, and you and your friends, what did you guys do (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well (laughter), remember again, we were largely an outdoor thing.  The homes--some of the homes didn't have doors, so, and there weren't--certainly weren't locks on the doors so people were going--you were in and out all the time. And as young boys and girls, we were outside playing a variety of sports, soccer, cricket, not in any manicured fields, but in some open space wherever it is, and hopscotch, and marbles, and all that stuff.  But it was outdoor and whatever was around that we could get, we used it to create a play activity.
Speaker 1: Your school [high school], did they have organized sports or music programs, anything like that?
Speaker 2: Well, the school had music programs and some organized sport.  I wasn't a part of the organized sport, I wasn't very athletic.  Yeah, there, there were, there were some activities like some chess clubs, which I did play and some card clubs and so on.  But, extracurricular life at school was quite limited because the school was a poor school.
Story_ID: 339891
Speaker 1: When you were in school, what were your dreams, your aspirations, what did you want out of life?
Speaker 2: Well, when I entered high school what I wanted to do was to finish with a very academic high school diploma and perhaps end up teaching or being in the civil service and being a government worker.  Those were really the two--those were the two avenues open to those of us who finished high school.
Story_ID: 339892
Speaker 1: You came to the conclusion that there was no god?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But was church important to you when you were growing up in the family?  Was it a--did the family go to church every Sunday, did you go, you know, during the middle of the week?  How, how involved was the family in the, in the church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my mother [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington] went, my father [Vernon Burroughs] didn't neither did my stepfather.  Although, later on my stepfather became involved in a branch, Baptist denomination.
Speaker 1: You didn't tell us his name, I'm sorry, (unclear).
Speaker 2: My stepfather's name was Egbert, Egbert Whittington [ph.].  But your question about whether church was a dominant part of our life, I think the answer is no, except that--except on special occasions, like Easter, and Christmas and so on.  But now that I look back on it, this was a church experience attending church and doing the preparations for confirmation, and so on.  All of that was really a rote kind of stuff where you just said back to the minister without any thought about what it meant or what the references were.  So that's what we did.  Until my high school years, until I got to a point where, you know, I didn't have to go with my mother anymore, so I didn't go.  Most of the time I didn't go unless there was a, an attractive young woman that I wanted to see and I wanted to impress, or something like that.  But the church thing was--became really a--it was a remote kind of stuff for Caribbean life.  We were singing songs--we were singing hymns about snow-capped mountains and that type of thing which just didn't apply, so over time the, the church, the, the dominance of those established religions decreased.
Story_ID: 339893
Speaker 1: So, you finished high school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school, what did you do then?
Speaker 2: Well, after I graduated high school, I finished high school at age sixteen.  I was there for--I think I went in about, see, was I twelve, yeah, yeah, about twelve.  I wasn- I wasn't thirteen.  I was twelve and I was finished at sixteen, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were most of the kids finished at sixteen, too, or you were accelerated?  You were accelerated?
Speaker 2: No, I was, yeah, fast-tracked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was sixteen when I gradu- when I finished with a high school diploma.  And then before my age--before age seventeen I started working in the civil service.  And the reason I did that--because things were financially tight with us.  We were poor.  And a civil service job would provide us with the first regular cash income every month so that we could buy things and my mother [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington] could get things, and so on.  We did get some cash from my father [Vernon Burroughs], remember, 'cause by that time my mother and father had divorced.  And my, my stepfather, Egbert [Egbert Whittington (ph.)], he had irregular jobs like most of the guys there so I took the civil service job like most of the other folks.  You're either civil service or you teach.  And I got a regular income.  I got--it was eighty-five dollars a month, it was eighty dollars a month plus a five dollar travel allowance, it was eighty-five dollars a month (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your, what was your job, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Civil service people (unclear).  My first job was at the government printing office essentially as a correspondence clerk.  The correspondence would come in and you write it in a book, you know.  You'd write out, Henry wrote asking for this, and pass it on.  I worked there for three months and then after that I got transferred to what you would call the DMV [department of motor vehicles]. And I spent five great years there because I was still seventeen, eighteen so the other four years, four years I spent there I got to grow, develop and began to date, and began to dress and meet my peers, and go out and, you know, have dinners and dances and so on. Those were my early years as a civil servant in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] between 1957 and 1962, so it was more than--it was about seven years, yeah.
Story_ID: 339894
Speaker 1: Did you live at home or did you have your own--oh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I lived at home, we all lived at home because there wasn't any housing for young single people, I mean.  Everybody lived at home and in the Indian community, if you married a woman, then she would come and live with you and what they'd do is, if they can, they would add a room.  So then you have an Indian family, the Maraj's [ph.], for example, and it would be like a compound and you'd just add stuff.  So I continued to live at home.  But the big thing was that my mother [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington] was now able to count on some regular income and as I recall during nearly all those years, certainly in the years, I gave her one-half of my monthly salary for--to help out with expenses and so on.  And when they were big expenses like my brothers needed clothes or something like that, then I would give her extra.  So my brothers became well aware that I was a source of support for them, and they became well aware that I was there as a source of support and strength for my mother in terms of her obligations with them and so--so that's where that started.
Story_ID: 339895
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a car?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: You, you said you were--it was an exciting time for you.  Did you have a car; you were going on these dates, or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't have a car but in the later days most of us did not have a car.  In the later days, I would say in the group--well, first of all, transportation was right by what--combined taxis--you know how they work. You, you hire a taxi and then it keeps going and picks up some other people and so, so you can get around the island [Trinidad] very easily like that.  But in the last year or two when I was there some of my friends had cars so I could drive them and I could go with them, and so--but no, we had dates but we took the taxis back and forth.  So that was exciting because that's when I started dating and, you know, feeling really good about myself.
Story_ID: 339896
Speaker 1: So seven years has passed.  Are you like in your early twenties?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what--then what happened, you, you quit your job or you just dec- what happened to make you leave the DMV (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What happened was a defining moment for me was the year 1957, when Kwame Nkrumah led Ghana to independence.
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: And then when that happened--and I have named my son after Kwame Nkrumah, his name is Kwame James Burroughs.  When Kwame Nkrumah led Africa--led the Van--Wes--the then Gold Coast to independence as Ghana, then I began to understand more clearly and it began to--I began to pull it together that there was an alternative to colonialism.  See, before I was thinking, well, maybe Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] can make it within (unclear) context, but what Kwame Nkrumah said was, no, you've got to break out of colonialism and be and independent country.  And that opened up my mind.  The other thing, which I think you'd find very, very interesting as an African American, was that I was accustomed seeing whites of power and influence dressed in Western outfit like the one I have on.  And then on the television, or in photographs in the newspaper, there was Kwame Nkrumah, and he did not have on a Western suit.  He had on an African outfit, and I said, huh, that's interesting, I never thought of that.  You never see Prince Philip [Duke of Edinburgh] in an African outfit or Prince Charles [Prince of Wales].  So that opened up my mind to there're alternatives to colonialism, there're alternatives to Christian- Christianity, there're alternatives to all this stuff, and what you need to do, Hugh [HistoryMaker Hugh C. Burroughs], you need to find out what those are.  And that's what inspired me to come to the United States to go to college [Columbia University, New York, New York].  That was one thing that inspired me, the search for alternatives.  The second thing that inspired me was that because we were a poor colonial country, and we, too, got our independence in 1962, and there were all these poor former colonial countries, in Africa mainly, becoming independent, then I began to ask the question, what can we do to develop ourselves? And that's where my interest in economics came because I thought if I understood economics well, then I could advise the prime minister, or advise the president, or advise the minister of economics or indeed become the minister of economics to show how we can become independent.  So I left Trinidad in 1962, September 9th to come to New York [New York] to study economics, because I wanted to help my country, to help my people develop and because I wanted to find out what the alternatives to colonialism were, alternatives to Christianity, and so on.  So I came with a big burst of intellectual curiosity trying to wrestle those questions and trying to be trained to be helpful.
Story_ID: 339897
Speaker 1: And you went to New York [New York], and what school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]. I went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it a cultural shock getting to New York State (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Huge, huge cultural shock softened by my meeting for the first time an uncle of mine in Brooklyn [New York], Uncle Dave [David Hudson Anthony], and his aunt, Aunt Ada [ph.].  And they were very, very helpful to me.  They were very welcoming.  Dave was my brother's--was my mother's [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington] only brother.  He'd never seen me, he left Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] in 1937, I was born in 1940, and he welcomed me like--as his own and he helped me both psychologically as well as financially to the extent that he can in my early years at Columbia.  And I--later on in my sophomore year I left--I wasn't living in Brooklyn anymore and moved up to the campus, and stayed on there so that's how I was able to get a Columbia education, because of my relatives.  And that's one of the reasons why I organized the reunion in 2004 because an unknown family member had given me so much and had made such big difference in my life.  And he always talked about family, in Trinidad, family in Antigua and so on.  And this is something I did, and I just wished that he were around to see that it was accomplished.  And now the family is planning the second family reunion in July in Trinidad, the younger people are doing that.
Story_ID: 339898
Speaker 1: So you went to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how did you find--did you feel that you were adequately trained to go to school in Columbia?
Speaker 2: I didn't know.
Speaker 1: When you got there did you find you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't know and I got there, and I was--the first semester--I got there September 9th, and classes started September 22nd and I came from Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] to New York [New York], so I was really swept away.  I just, I mean it was just such a huge step and so much culture shock, and so much social shock and so on.  So my first semester I really struggled because I was trying to put all this together, and was living with my relatives and I didn't know them, the food was different, the (unclear) and so on.  So it was a struggle but I, I had a lot of self-confidence and I knew other Trinidad people who were similarly trained and who had done well so I figured it was only a matter of time before I, I, I hit my stride.  And I would say about my sophomore, junior year, I hit my stride and then things went well after that and the financial pressures were less.  The early two years I had great financial pressures because I couldn't get any help from home, there was no help back in Trinidad.  And I couldn't--my [maternal] uncle [David Hudson Anthony] couldn't do much and so I ended up borrowing money and working and so on, and I worked a lot.  As a matter of fact, all through college I worked part-time during the school year and full-time during the, the summer months, and you'd be interested to know and those listening to this would know, that my first job, the first time I was here was as a messenger for Seventeen magazine, and I kept that job through college.  And what that meant was that I was taking packages for the magazine from one place to another so that photographers can photograph the models and so on.  And I'd also--what it also meant was I got to know New York City, because I was taking the packages around and I got to know the subway, got to know the buses and so on.  And so, and then during the school year they were kind enough to be flexible and say, well, you know, you just have to put in twenty hours and, you know, we don't care when you do it.  So I would go in and--early in the morning and do it, and then I'd go to school and so I'd have long days.  And I would start working about 7:30, eight o'clock, and then I'll be up until about twelve [o'clock], one o'clock studying.  And so that's what I did in my early years.  I would say my undergraduate years at Columbia, especially the first two years or so, those were the most difficult years.  That was the most difficult thing I did.  But, as I tell my kids [Kwame James Burroughs and Dawn Burroughs] and others, I said, if you have to be a shaped for life and trained for life, New York City does it better than any place else.  So, having done that New York City undergraduate and graduate work and all the other stuff, my working life over there, once I came to California, I mean everything else just seemed to me a breeze.
Story_ID: 339899
Speaker 1: What kind of classes did you take at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, I did economics my entire four years I was there because that was my subject of interest.  I was very interested in philosophy so I did a lot of philosophy courses. I was very hungry intellectually, so I did sociology, I did anthropology, all the liberal arts stuff that I could do to try to understand this world and how it was put together, and where did the ideas come from, how did it hang together and are there alternatives.  Any subject like that, I would take.
Speaker 1: And you got--your undergraduate degree's in economics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my undergraduate degree in economics and my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that was 1967?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I finished in '66 [1966], but I graduated with the class of '67 [1967].
Story_ID: 339900
Speaker 1: And you stayed to work on your master's [degree]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When I finished, when I finished Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], when I finished my economics seminar in 1966--was it '66 [1966] or '67 [1967]--anyhow, when I finished, there we were doing a seminar, a year-long seminar. There were ten or twelve of us, and I was clearly the best student in, in class and the professor [Alan D. Entine] was also an associate dean in the school, and he said, "What're you gonna do after you finish?"  And, I said, "I don't know," I said, "You know, I been in college now for four, four and a half years and I, I don't have any money.  I just have to get some money and, you know, get some (unclear)."  So he offered me a job.  I was the top student in his class; he offered me a job as an assistant in the dean of students office.  I was assistant dean of students when I finished Columbia and I worked there for three years, and then in '70 [1970] or '71 [1971], yeah--I think I worked from '67 [1967] to about '70 [1970] I think.  I worked in the dean's office at Columbia, so can you imagine the trip from '62 [1962] where I got in uncertain, unsure and by the time I was in my last year, I was the top student in an economics class and got this job in the dean's office.  And I worked there for two or three years and then after that I went to--so I started my foundation career.
Story_ID: 339901
Speaker 1: How did you get involved with work in foundations? I mean it's a--when I was doing this research it's like, I wonder how--what made him go into foundation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.  Well, when I was working at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] in the dean's office one of my responsibilities was to talk to foundation and corporations about giving money to Columbia so I was doing that.  And I, I heard about--it was a fellowship program named after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and the president of the foundation that ran that program, he heard me speak one time at Columbia, and when he wanted to expand staff he thought about hiring me.  The person running the program was an African American brother by the name a Ray Richardson [ph.] from Mississippi.  And so Hans Rosenhaupt, who was the president of the foundation, said, "Well, Ray, since you need more help, why don't you get somebody like Hugh [HistoryMaker Hugh C. Burroughs], who could help you work the program?"  In the meantime, Ray had thought about other people or something, but to make the story succinct here, I was hired as the associate director of this program at the Woodrow Wilson Foundation [Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, Princeton, New Jersey].  Ray Richardson was the director, and the guy who hired us, the president foundation, a German American guy, he proceeded to try to exploit Ray and me.  First of all, when I was hired and Ray knew that I was hired because of the president he was suspicious of me 'cause Ray had his own candidates.  So when I got there, Ray and I had to kind of reconcile each other.  And it wasn't made easy because the president kept telling Ray, "Well, you know, Hugh is from the Caribbean and he knows New York [New York], but he doesn't know the South and he doesn't know (unclear) so you got to help him," or something.  And he told, he told Ray--the, that's what he told Ray.  He told me, he says, "You know, this guy is from the South.  He's not sophisticated, he doesn't know what's going on, he hasn't been at a big university like Columbia."  So it was the old divide and conquer.  And, thankfully, Ray and I saw through that and we never allowed that to get in between us even though, even when he thought it might.  So we had a great partnership.  I learned a lot from him about the South, about the Civil Rights Movement, the marches, and he was busted and all that stuff, and he was a friend of Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] and all those people.  And he gave me all that stuff about the sharecroppers and the, the plantation system and so on.  And I told him about Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago], and we had a great relationship that continued well after he left, yeah. So that started my foundation work. And then in the course of that foundation work, I must have spoken someplace, and the guy who was involved in the Whitney Foundation [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York] invited me to come and join his staff.  So that my grant making foundation really started with the Whitney Foundation.  At the Wilson, I was doing administrative work and doing fundraising work.  But at the Whitney Foundation, I was doing grant making.  And that started my career back in 1971, I believe.
Speaker 1: You stayed there for six years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, for the last thirty-five years that's what I've been doing.
Story_ID: 339902
Speaker 1: You were writing grants, is that what you were doing at the Whitney [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, I was giving grants.
Speaker 1: Oh, giving grants.
Speaker 2: Since 1971, I have been involved in giving grants.  And I'm one of the few foundations--few people, black or white, who has spent their entire professional life giving grants.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  What kind of grants do you give--was the Whitney--what was their focus?
Speaker 2: Well, I was at the Whitney from '71 [1971] until '77 [1977]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and when I left in '77 [1977] I was the executive director of the John Hay Whitney Foundation.  One of a handful of black folks who were in leadership position at the foundation.  Whitney was a very interesting foundation.  It was small but we were making grants nationally.  We were making grants to women who wanted to get into higher education or who were denied bank credit, and who wanted to document that a, that a pattern of denial so that banks can change their behavior.  We made a series of grants, which I handled, having to do with the future of historically black public colleges [HBCUs] in the South because as you know, when desegregation--integration of colleges was proposed what it meant was that places like Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] would go out of business and be absorbed by--and we made a series of grants to people who were in those historically black colleges to protect those--the interests of those colleges as a, as a desegregation efforts go--went forward.  So I handled that.
Story_ID: 339903
Speaker 1: You have started your career. You've been at the Wilson [Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, Princeton, New Jersey] and you're at the Whitney [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so could you tell us a little bit more about your career?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say, I would say the Whitney in 1970 or '71 [1971] I believe, and you can well imagine that was the heights of the Civil Rights Movement.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been assassinated and Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy], and so on.  And I was like everybody else torn about what was happening.  I was dissatisfied with the condition of black folks mainly, and so on.  And I saw the foundation work as a way to be helpful, to provide a resource.  And I'm reminded, Loretta [Loretta Henry], about the helpfulness and the kindness of my mother [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington].  She was always helping somebody else.  We didn't have much, but whatever we had she felt compelled to share and to be helpful, and to listen to others.  So I saw the foundation work as allowing me to be this helping hand, not in a, not in a, a kind of a better-than-you kind of way, but in a we are in this together kind of a way. And my fortune now is such that I can be of help to you and, who knows, another day you might be of help to me.  So that's what's guided my--that's guided my foundation work.
Story_ID: 339904
Speaker 1: And the other thing about the foundation work is that, for me, it was just not a job.  I mean this was a passion, this was a calling, this was a, an opportunity to provide resources to folks who were on the firing line doing something, the folks who were trying to protect the interests of Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] or Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], or Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama] and so on. And I was there with some resources to help them think through what they were gonna do.  So that's what I did at the Whitney Foundation [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York].  I was--I became very actively involved in the foundation world. Both in the, in the white organizations like the (unclear) foundations, but I was also very early involved in the black foundation executives where I met with other black foundation exec- black foundation folks to kind of understand what are we doing, what can we learn from each other, what--how can we build alliances and so on.  And some of those early associations have grown into lifelong friendships like my relationship with Jim Joseph [HistoryMaker James Joseph], who was the ambassador to South Africa and--president of the Council on Foundations, and [HistoryMaker] Adrienne Bailey, and Harriet Michel [HistoryMaker Harriet Michelle Michel], who is now head of the purchasing of--minority small business association [National Minority Supplier Development Council], and, and the list goes on. Ron Gault [HistoryMaker Ronald T. Gault] who is now with, I believe with Citibank or Morgan Stanley [sic. JPMorgan Chase and Co.] in South Africa.  So, the point there is that I recognized very early on that I couldn't do what I was doing at Whitney alone and be satisfied, that I had to have alliances, and mentors, and supporters from other foundation world black folks and some white folks as well, and so that we can keep the movement going so to speak.
Story_ID: 339905
Speaker 1: You mentioned the foundation of black foundation executives [Association of Black Foundation Executives]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What would you say is the percentage of blacks who work in this foundation area?
Speaker 2: Nationally?
Speaker 1: Nationally, is it--in the--if you were--look at foundations overall, what would be the percentage of, of blacks who work in the foundations?
Speaker 2: About one percent.
Speaker 1: One percent, that's what I was wondering.
Speaker 2: Latinos would be less than one percent, Asians would be less than one percent.
Speaker 1: And this, this is because they're just not interested, or training, or because the foundations have not welcomed them in?  Why do, why do you think the number's so low (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's because, this is because the foundation world is part of America.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter).
Speaker 2: So if you ask the question about psychiatrists, or petroleum engineers, or software engineers, or electrical engineers like Frank Greene [HistoryMaker Frank Greene, Jr.], you get the same answer.  And, and the explanation is pretty much the same.
Story_ID: 339906
Speaker 1: You were talking about Mr. Joseph [HistoryMaker James Joseph] that you met in the association of black executives [Association of Black Foundation Executives] and how you all--you help each other, right? So you have this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yes.  We relied on each other and we formed some lifelong friendships there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there--what other--I know you've worked with many, many, or several foundations, could you name some of them and, and tell us some of the work that you're really proud of?
Speaker 2: Of the different foundations I worked at?
Speaker 1: Of the different foundations you were--
Speaker 2: Well, it was in 1977 that I was invited to come to California to be a program officer at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation [Menlo Park, California], which is a family foundation.  They had just named a new president, Roger Heyns [Roger W. Heyns], who was a former chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California], and I was his first professional appointment.  He reached across the country and asked me to come and join his staff and help him to put this foundation together.  So that's what I came to do in 1977 at Hewlett Foundation.  And, just to speed things up, the two things that I did there that I'm most proud of the first is that I made a series of grants over the ten years that I was there to encourage the birth and early development of the City of East Palo Alto [California]. And I led an informal collaborative of other foundations guiding foundation money going into East Palo Alto at the time when Rose Jacobs Gibson was mayor and Sharifa Wilson was mayor to make sure that they stayed on track to become a city.  And they now have become a city, and they're doing very well.  They have tax revenues now that they never had before and--now how they use it, now, that's another question.  But we enabled them, I and other foundation people, enabled them to get the resources to become a city.  So I'm very proud of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 339907
Speaker 1: I'm from California, and I understand, you know, the growth of East Palo Alto [California] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but could you explain a little bit about the history of the area, why that was important for you to give them money (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, East Palo Alto for--up until the, the, the early '80s [1980s] was an unincorporated portion of the county of San Mateo [San Mateo County, California].  What that meant was that it got its services, including law enforcement and fire, and so on, from the county of San Mateo and I think it was indisputable that the county just didn't treat the city of East Pa- the area of East Palo Alto well or equally.  And the people who lived there believed that if they were an independent city, that they could chart their own destiny, make their own mistakes and, and so on.  So we provided, we, meaning the foundations that I was involved with and the collaborative that I led, provided the resources so that the people of East Palo Alto can make that case.  And they became a city I believe in 1983, and now they are thriving.  As a matter of fact, there's a Four Seasons Hotel [Four Seasons Hotel Silicon Valley] in East Palo Alto now, where the nightly rate is about $330 a night.
Speaker 1: Pretty good (laughter).
Speaker 2: And there's an Ikea, there is a Circuit City and a Home Depot and so on.  All of that generating revenue for the city.
Story_ID: 339908
Speaker 1: And then after you left Packard [David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Los Altos, California], you went to Kaiser [Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, Menlo Park, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, after I left Hewlett [William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Menlo Park, California].
Speaker 1: Oh, Hewlett, sorry (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The second thing I did while I was at Hewlett Foundation was that I authored the first program in California, which allowed a private foundation like Hewlett to provide support to a community foundation like Peninsula [Peninsula Community Foundation, San Mateo, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the idea behind that was Peninsula was a small foundation then, and so was East Bay [East Bay Community Foundation, Oakland, California] and Monterey [Monterey Peninsula Foundation, Monterey, California], and Santa Cruz [Community Foundation Santa Cruz County, Aptos, California], and I thought that if a big foundation like Hewlett could help these community foundations to grow, that it would relieve the pressure on Hewlett, number one, and also it would help us to resolve the issue that we had at Hewlett, which was we didn't want to become so staffed up that make these small grants all up and down the counties.  So we would enable the community foundations to staff up to do that.  And I was the author of that program.  So those are two big initiatives that I did at the Hewlett Foundation.
Story_ID: 339909
Speaker 1: There're different kinds of foundations--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, so there are large, kind of corporate-oriented--am I saying this right--big foundations that would be sponsored by businesses then there might be--there're large foundations that are sponsored by family groups?  And then there're community foundations (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you, you've got it roughly right, but let's get it precisely, here.  We have several classes of foundations.  One class is called independent or family foundations.  The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] calls them independent foundations, but we sometimes refer to them as family foundations.  Independent or family foundations would be like the Hewlett Foundation [William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Menlo Park, California], the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], Rockefeller Foundation [New York, New York].  Those are all independent foundations.  When an independent foundation is controlled by a family, we call--we can then refer to it as a family foundation.  So the independent foundations--the largest foundation in the country is an independent foundation, the Gates Foundation [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, Washington].  It's controlled by a family, so you can call it a family foundation, you can call it independent.  So, Hewlett was one of those, so those are foundations--that's the first category.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The second category are community foundations, and community foundations like Peninsula [Peninsula Community Foundation, San Mateo, California] where we are, are foundations made up of a collection of funds individuals can put money or families can put money--small amounts of money and create funds.  And this collection of funds is called a community foundation, and its major characteristic is that its grant making is generally in a particular geographic area, one county or multi-counties.  Whereas, Gates, and Packard [David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Los Altos, California], and Rockefeller are all over the world. Peninsula Community Foundation is only San Mateo County [California], Santa Clara County [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you have one [California Community Foundation] in Los Angeles [California], you have one [San Diego Foundation] in San Diego [California].  Nearly in all the metropolitan--major metropolitan areas of United States there is a community foundation.  So you, if you wanted to have a fund at the community foundation, you can put up a $1000 or $5000 and say I'd like to put up this fund, this money and I want you to take 10 percent of this money each year and support the hospital down the street, or what have you.  That's how it works.  And then the last ca- major category is what's called corporate foundations.  And those are foundations that are supported by a company or by a corporation.  So Levi Strauss [Levi Strauss and Co., San Francisco, California] for example and General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan], and Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan], they all have corporate foundations.
Speaker 1: All right, and the purpose of these foundations is to give money to--?
Speaker 2: Non-profit organizations (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Non-profits, okay.  And everyone has--they each have different focuses, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And each is free to do whatever it wants to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 339910
Speaker 1: So we're at Kaiser [Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, Menlo Park, California] I think, aren't we at Kaiser now? Done Hewlett [William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Menlo Park, California], and now you're Kaiser, I think (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Yeah, we've done, we've done Hewlett, and I am invited to join the Kaiser staff as the vice president.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--the highlights there were that number one, while Kaiser is an independent foundation, there, there are family members on the Kaiser board but its independent, you know, but they're dominant--well, there was--they're not dominant let's say that.  And they, they were, they, there was a time when they tried to be, but--if you want to know what I mean by that, the grandfather, old man Kaiser, Henry Kaiser [Henry J. Kaiser] created the foundation.  And his grandchildren made a move to try to control the foundation.  But the old man who created the foundation explicit, explicitly did not want his grandchildren to control the foundation.  'Cause you don't know what your grandchildren will do, do you, Loretta [Loretta Henry]?
Speaker 1: No, (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay, so at Kaiser--the exciting thing at Kaiser was number one, it was a great board of trustees, including people like Joe Califano [Joseph A. Califano, Jr.] and the interminable Barbara Jordan; and that was just a great experience to see Barbara in action.
Speaker 1: Oh, can you tell us something about her in action (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, Barbara, on the Kaiser board, and in some other settings I have seen her, was the most judicious person I've ever seen in action.  She acted as though she was on the [U.S.] Supreme Court, and she was listening to their arguments, the best arguments from both sides.  And when you didn't make the best arguments, she'd say, now, Loretta, give us some more, tell us what you mean by such and such, tell me what you mean by such and such.  And if you would say, well--and she'd say, I don't want any mumbling, I want to know your free reasons for taking this position.  And you would do your best.  And then she goes on the other side, and then at the end of the day, she would say I have listened to what Loretta has to say and I have listened to what John has to say, and Loretta has merit and John has merit, but it seems to me Loretta's argument lacks coherence and it doesn't fit the moment, doesn't fit the time of day.  It's not--and therefore I propose that we do A, B, C.  When Barbara spoke, the entire board listened, and that's what--how it went.  And as a staff person you knew that that's it.  Don't, don't try to resurrect anything.  So that was, that was just a great moment working with Barbara Jordan, and there was some other really able people on that board as well.
Story_ID: 339911
Speaker 1: My job at the Pack-, at the Kaiser Foundation [Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, Menlo Park, California] was to try to encourage more blacks to get into the health professions.  And we did that, we had a place-based program in Memphis, Tennessee and I went down there several trips trying to encourage that and so on.  And I spent five years there.  And then there was a change in administration and I left at about that time to go to the Packard Foundation [David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Los Altos, California].
Speaker 2: Okay, and Kaiser Foundation, they are in charge of Kaiser Permanente hospitals (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, they--it's an independent operation.  They don't have any relationships with Kaiser Permanente, no.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. All right, thank you.  Okay so Kaiser, and then you go to Packard did you say?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what did you do there?  This is like '93 [1993] you started there?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  At the Packard Foundation I did a variety of things there.  I was called in by the then-executive director and I did several things, one was I handled the grant making to East Palo Alto [California].  I was able to continue to do that, and that was very satisfying.  And that was a time when we really put East Palo Alto on the map, and so on.  That was one thing.  Second was that--I was responsible for the communications department at, at Packard.  I was director of communications, I put together a small staff.  We handled press releases, annual reports, and that type of thing.  I did that at Packard.  Thirdly, the Packard Foundation for a while was the largest foundation in--in certainly in California and for a while, it was the largest foundation in the country.  And with that--this was before Gates [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, Washington]--and with that, there was a lot of responsibility for what--there was a lot responsibility on the foundation to explain what it was doing and to give leadership, and whenever we said something, you know, people were looking.  And it was my job to understand all of that and to explain it to the foundation community.  So I handled the foundation's relationships with other foundations and with government agencies like Sacramento [California], Washington, D.C. and so on.  And people are coming through and so on, so I handled that.  And then lastly, I assisted the president with internal personal stuff at the Packard Foundation.
Story_ID: 339912
Speaker 1: And then in 2000, you moved to another foundation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: To (laughter) [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy--?
Speaker 2: I--yeah, when I was doing the Packard Foundation [David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Los Altos, California] work as you can well imagine, I had a lot of visibility.  People saw me or heard me speak, or checked the Internet and so on.  So, Mr. Gordy was one of those, or it was people on his staff and they said to him, you got to see this guy he's really unbelievable.  So I started talking to him in about 2000 or so, and he's gonna put the foundation together and so on, and I was telling him what to do and suggesting people that he might hire and so on.  And then, he said, you know, and we really want you.  So I went down to Los Angeles [California]--I kept my house here in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], went down to Los Angeles, commuted weekly, and I was president of the Berry Gordy Family Foundation [Los Angeles, California].  And I was helping him to organize the foundation, to take care of family matters and so on, and to structure the foundation so that it would be ready for a large infusion of dollars and would become a national foundation.  And just as we were about to do that, or just as we were doing that the stock market crashed.  And Mr. Gordy lost a lot of money and he wasn't able to put the money in the foundation so we then had to really put the foundation in a dormant state for a while.  And that time, I--he didn't need my services on a full-time basis, I did some consulting work form him and then it petered out.  And then I decided that I had done enough full-time foundation work and I was now gonna make myself available as a part-time foundation consultant.
Story_ID: 339913
Speaker 1: So since 2003, I have been a part-time management consultant to foundations.  As I said, I did some for the Berry Gordy Foundation [Berry Gordy Family Foundation, Los Angeles, California], and since then I have done other clients like The California Endowment down in Los Angeles [California], the Rosenberg Foundation here [San Francisco, California], and one or two other foundations and so on.  So that's what I do now.  I, contented life, I don't make as much money as I used to but I'm not unhappy and I'm not complaining, and I work about 50 percent of my time doing consulting work and keeping up with what's going on in foundation field.  It's very satisfying to get calls asking for advice and so on.  It's very satisfying to talk to the young people and to give them advice and direction.  As a matter of fact, I'll be doing some of that next month.  The foundations have a national meeting and that will take place the first week in May, in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  And they'll have a chance to meet foundation people from all over the world, all over the world or certainly all over the country.  And there we can talk and they can ask me questions and so on.  They give me a chance to speak and so on.  And so that's what I do.  The other 50 percent of my time I do, you know, retirement activities.  I love to play tennis, I love to read, love to go to the theater and now with a new granddaughter then I'll spend some time grand-parenting.
Story_ID: 339914
Speaker 1: I was just wondering, after you graduate from Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], to go back a little bit, did you ever think about going back to Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago]?
Speaker 2: Good question.  I, like so many of us who came here to go to school, and I've tell--I've told people this and certainly the case, it's true in my case.  My college experience really changed me.
Speaker 1: Oh, did it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It just, it just made me a completely different person.  Well, I was no longer a Christian.  You know, I no longer accepted this British supremacy--white supremacy stuff.  Um, I was a deeper thinker.  So my peers whom I left in the civil service, when I went back down there from time to time, we weren't--just not connecting.  I never drank as much as they did, they drank more than I did, you know, in terms of hard liquor and so I'll drink beer or drink wine (unclear).  But the content of the conversation--because they were so brain washed, they were so wrapped up into this stuff that it would take me a lifetime to unwrap them, you know, I just couldn't.  And I was talking a language and describing a scenario that they just didn't get.  And, I, for example, when I was at Columbia one of the things I would do on Saturdays was go to Harlem [New York, New York] at the corner of Lenox [Avenue] and 125th Street to hear Malcolm X.  I mean, that was very profound stuff.  And my folks in Trinidad, my friends down there, they were, you know, drinking and partying and stuff like that.  So, when I--to answer your question when I finished Columbia I knew that I could not readily go back to the Caribbean and work.  And when I finished, as you recall, I was so broke that I needed an American job to just catch up and buy some shoes and just catch my breath financially.  So and then once I did that, then I, I stayed here and got married, and had my, my kid Kwame [Kwame James Burroughs] when it was 1971, '72 [1972] I guess, and that changed my life.  'Cause my kids mean a lot to me, I have two kids (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your life was here then.
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: Your life was here?
Speaker 2: My life was here then, right, yeah.  I love the folks down there, and my mother [Carol Evalina Crawford Whittington], I wrote her all the time.  We still write just about every month, every other month.
Speaker 1: How old is she now?
Speaker 2: She's about eighty-six.
Speaker 1: Oh, bless her heart.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I--so she's planning to come to visit us in, in July.  She's been to California before, but this will be the first time in my house, in San Carlos [California] with this wife.  She saw my previous wife, but she hasn't seen this wife.
Story_ID: 339915
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you went, you went into Harlem [New York, New York] and you heard Malcolm X, how did he affect you, do you remember anything he said (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow, oh yeah.  I tell you the thing about Malcolm, listening to Malcolm in those years--see, I was at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] trying to digest all this stuff 'cause you remember I was searching for alternatives.  But my Columbia professors only took me so far.  Yeah, we're talking economics, we did some history and did some--but they never talked about, well, if you don't have colonialism then, and you're trying to develop an economy, well how do you do it.  Or more importantly, they didn't talk about the, the psychological side about being oppressed for all these years and being made to feel inferior, and what you do to become feeling confident and even feeling superior.  But Malcolm did that.  Malcolm said let me tell you who you are.  You're a black man in America, you're a descendant of slaves.  And that's, that's a reality.  And there are no ifs, ands, and buts, and you don't have to butter anything up on that.  And now you take it from here, you know, you get involved politically, you get your, your kids to perform academically, and so on and so on.  It was that kind of bluntness and a kind of, it's a logic that you couldn't defy, that Malcolm put on the table that I had never been exposed to.  So that's what he did for me.  Funny thing, footnote on that.  When I would go back to Brooklyn [New York] and tell my Brooklyn folks, gee, guess what Malcolm said about why there is high unemployment or why the school performance and all.  My great uncle [Henry James Richards] who was there, alive then--he was the one who sent for my uncle [David Hudson Anthony]--my great uncle would say, you know, I don't want to hear anything from anybody who is not a Christian.  You know he's not a Christian man, and if he hasn't accepted the lord and savior Jesus Christ, then he's not in a position to tell me anything.
Speaker 1: How interesting.
Speaker 2: And there I was in the middle of that, you know.  Malcolm, my conservative black folks in Brooklyn, hardworking, the British crown and all that stuff.  What, what gives here?  So it was part of that questioning, and it's part of that search, and it's part of the revelation about what is.  And Malcolm did that better than anybody else.
Story_ID: 339916
Speaker 1: At the same time were you influenced by Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was also influenced by Dr. King.  I was influenced partly--well in a lot of ways his eloquence and so on, but also his courage and the skill with which he organized (unclear) the brothers and sisters in the South to take on that, that system.  I mean that was, that was just very, very, very admirable.  And I thought the thing about Dr. King was I--he was, he was so much of a visionary.  I mean he had a vision of where he wanted to take us and so on, and many of us didn't understand that, you know, we just, you know, he'd talk about, you know, the promise land and he'd talk about voting rights, and housing, and we, we really didn't get it, you know.  It's too bad that he didn't live to see how that played out.  The thing about Malcolm [Malcolm X] was an immediacy, Malcolm say I want you to go now and stop ranting and start saving money to get your house--your own house.  Now.  So anyhow those were, those were two very powerful influences on my life.
Story_ID: 339917
Speaker 1: Back to the foundations and your career, you've had this wonderful, wonderful life.  How have you seen since--when you started working with foundations, how have they changed or has your focus changed, has the way they've done business changed? Are they more diverse?  Are there--when you started were they more oriented to helping white groups or, you know, just how, how in general foundations changed over the years, the twenty years you've been with them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I have been in the grant making world for about thirty-five years now, counting from '71 [1971], and I would say the foundation world has changed tremendously.  There are now more people of color in the foundation world than there was before.  All be it, if you put the Asians, Latinos and Black folks together, I think we're still talking less than 3 percent or something like that.  But there is diversity there that there wasn't before.  There's also diversity on the boards of the foundation which there was not before.  I think most of the quote self-respecting foundations today would wanta have at least one person of color on their board.  And that's a big change from when I started.  Thirdly, I would say that, in terms of foundation programs, that the self-respecting foundations all want to be counted as foundations that are doing something that's responsive to poor people or marginalized people, and so on.  Now, how they do it and, you know, how much of it they do that's another matter.  But the sentiment of the majority of foundations is that we want to do the right thing.  I just want to be clear about that.  It doesn't mean empowering Latinos in East L.A [East Los Angeles, California] to do whatever they want to do, it doesn't mean that.  It means a very controlled, kind of gift of resources in, in a very controlled set of circumstances.  So that, for example, if you have, if you got black folks who are concerned about discrimination and housing for example, or employment, the foundations are very comfortable with funding a study to document whether this is or is not the case, and to what extent it is or is not the case.  But beyond that in terms of the action following that, that's where the foundations get nervous.  I mean, they do not want to support the Brotherhood Crusade in Los Angeles [California] to document housing discrimination and then to take it to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, that's where the foundations get nervous.
Story_ID: 339918
Speaker 1: You had been mentioning before we broke that foundations like to give money to finance a study, but they really are not a-, involved in action--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --financing action.  Could you explain that a little bit more?
Speaker 2: They, they are reluctant because by law foundations are prohibited from taking part in any partisan activity.  So if a group of residents in the barrios are from East, East Los Angeles [California] would, would march into the HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] office in, in California in Los Angeles [California] then there'll be this, you know, the Democratic-oriented folks trying to take on the Republican folks.  However, having said that, I got to say on the positive side you take a foundation like the, the Gates Foundation [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, Washington], which says--is it Gates--yeah, Gates says that, you know, every young child, every infant in the world should have a vaccination and we're gonna provide the money to make that happen.  Or the Carter foundation [The Carter Center, Atlanta, Georgia] that says, you know, it's time to get rid of Guinea worm disease.  It's just no reason why in the 21st century we should have Guinea worm, so it does that.  I think there is another foundation that is attacking tuberculosis, I don't know whether that's Carter's [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] or Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] or something like that.  But so, you have these larges foundations now, or new large and new foundations that are really taking on some of these problems in a frontal kind of a way.  Whereas, for a long-time foundations would sort of go around it.  But Gates is really setting the standard for how you do foundation work.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Just brilliant.
Story_ID: 339919
Speaker 1: You had mentioned a while back some people that influenced you like James A. Joseph [HistoryMaker James Joseph].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were there--could you tell us a little bit more about how he influenced you, and maybe some other people who have influenced you in your career, or helped you in your career?
Speaker 2: Well, James Joseph certainly did because he was a brother who had done well and who had succeeded, but always remembered the brothers and sisters left behind.  And in his work he was always reminding us that our grant making should take into account the brothers and sisters who are less fortunate.  And he had a boldness about him in the way in which he interacted with the power structure or the white establishment people that I thought was very admirable.  He was very articulate, he's very direct, very much on target.  So he was a big influence in my life, he still is.
Story_ID: 339920
Speaker 1: Are there any other people in--that you've met along the way that have been big influences on your life?
Speaker 2: You mean my professional life?
Speaker 1: Your professional life?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say--I would add Frank Thomas [Franklin A. Thomas] to that list, the former president of the Ford Foundation [New York, New York].  Now, Frank had a, a, quiet confidence about him.  He had a competence about him that in my mind was just unbounded.  He was one of the most brilliant persons I have met intellectually and as a tactician.  He wasn't a bold, out-front person like others, but I think in terms of understanding the system and understanding where the weak points are and when you could apply resources to make a difference and so on.  I thought Frank had those qualities better than anybody else.  On the other side of the ledger was somebody like Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], whom I thought also understood the system, was bolder, was more outspoken and again cared for his brothers and sisters who left, who were left behind in a fundamental, in fundamental ways.  And what I, what I meant by he cared for them in fundamental ways, I mean he recognized when the system was not fair to our people, and he was willing to put himself profession on the line to do something about that.  So, he was a big influence.  And then there were some whites who also inspired me and were mentors to me, and where I learned certain, certain skills of this craft.  The first was the dean who hired me, Alan Entine [Alan D. Entine], who hired me and, and mentored me at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and looked out for me, and so on.  And that was really--I didn't even know what he was looking out for because this was a new setting for me, but he did that.  Again, quiet influence and I felt comfortably enough to call on him on anything, for anything.  Then the guy who hired me at, at, Whitney Foundation [John Hay Whitney Foundation, New York, New York] was also a mentor and an influence in terms of political savvy.  He was very astute, he was a, so-called Rockefeller Republican, liberal Republican.  He was always pointing out to me the differences in then movements and so on.  And then there was Roger Heyns [Roger W. Heyns] at the Hewlett Foundation [William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Menlo Park, California], perhaps the, the smartest guy I ever worked for.  He was, he was just in a class by himself but was not--he didn't--by the time I met him, he didn't have the energy or interest, or the inclination to lead.  He was not gonna charge out there with anything, but if you had an idea or proposal and you put in front of him, he can analyze it and help you improve it and so on, in a way in which nobody has since done.  So, I'm grateful to him.  The Kaiser [Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, Menlo Park, California] thing, I don't think I had any--the, the president there was, was really good.  We became friends, we played tennis and so on, but we weren't there long enough to get something going.  Now, Packard [David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Los Altos, California], a good relationship, too, but I don't think it was a mentoring and the stan- on the style--on the level of Roger Heyns or Vernon Jordon, Frank Thomas and Jim Joseph [HistoryMaker James Joseph].  Those were people who really set the standard for me.
Story_ID: 339921
Speaker 1: You have been in this career over thirty-five years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about any--doing any other kind of work?
Speaker 2: From time to time I've thought about other work, and from time to time, you know, people have approached me about what about this, what about that.  But as I got into this work I really concluded that I want to help people.  So I could, you know, for example I was, was under consideration for a position at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] where I would be working with the--in the president's office and sort of helping students to navigate the Harvard political side.  Now that had some appeal because I was helping students, but it was so bureaucratic that I felt that, you know, I just--it didn't, it didn't have enough appeal.  So it would have to be a helping profession.  If you push me and say, well, suppose you got an offer at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] so that they can--you can improve their relationships with ethnic communities, I couldn't do that.  I just, it just wouldn't--it would be against my, my grain.  My values, if you press me about it, have to do with being helpful.  My values are shaped by my concern for my people, and I want to do something there rather than someplace else.  My values dictate that I be a free and independent thinker not encumbered by religious and political orthodoxy, and my values dictate that I, I give prime attention to my immediate family and my family broadly defined, including my brothers and sisters.  That's essentially what I'm about.
Story_ID: 339922
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?  Is there something in your life you wish you had done or you would like--still like to, well, wish you had done, we'll do it that way and then we'll do--because the future is something else, but in the past is there something, oh, I wish I'd done that or I wish I'd--oh, I should have stopped and, oh--
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) sure there are regrets. This is not a--this is not a perfect life but one has to recognize that, that this is a life that has been characterized by limited resources and limited time, and I have my son [Kwame James Burroughs] and my daughter [Dawn Burroughs (ph.)], and my family and so on that take precedence over things.  But if I had one thing that I would have liked to have done--or might still do it--I would like to spend an extended period of time in a country that's not shaped by Western civilization.
Speaker 1: Interesting.  Why?
Speaker 2: Because I believe we are all creatures of our time and our place.  See, you and I think about a seven day week, we think about working five, resting two, having a Sabbath, we think about this.  And there're other places in the world where people don't think about a seven day week, they might have a ten day week.  They might have a Sabbath on Friday or--and I think I'd like to experience that because I think we are prisoners of this culture and this civilization.  I'd like to get out of this prison for an extended period of time to see--maybe to see what another prison looks--looks like.  But once you see--once one--once myself if I experience another prison, there would make it forcefully clear to me that my views and my outlook, and my patterns are all shaped by this culture that I happen to be a part of.  If I were born and bred in Tibet, I'd have a very, very different outlook on the world.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: If you stay in this culture alone, you begin to think this is the one.  And then you begin to think, well, this is the culture, this is the process, this is the political apparatus.  We'd like to have other people in Iraq and Vietnam adopt because ours is clearly better.  And so that's my one regret, that I haven't had a chance to do that but I might still do it.

Speaker 1: Your accomplishments, what are you proudest of in your life?
Speaker 2: I'm proud of my college and graduate degrees [from Columbia University, New York, New York].  I don't think in the scheme of things coming from Arouca, Trinidad [Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago] that that was in the cards given the resources we had.  I beat the odds on that.  I am very proud of my two kids [Kwame James Burroughs and Dawn Burroughs], I think they are just, you know, they are--and apart from their degrees and all that stuff, they're just wonderful human beings.  My son is a member of the Baha'i faith, and he's very clean living and he fasts and he does this and he does that.  My, my daughter is, I would say, my daughter is a free thinker like I am, very independent minded, and she's--now, neither of them is caught up in the normal, normal American culture things.  Although she likes to shop a lot. So I'm very proud of my two kids, I'm very proud of my present arrangement with my, my wife and relationship with the kids, and I'm very proud of, I'm very proud--I want to be careful how I say this.  I'm very proud of the esteem in which I think most of my family members hold me.  And I saw that at the reunion in 2004.  They really thought that I was just special, they all, you know, they tell me about it.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  How would you like your grandchildren to know about you?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought about that.  First of all, I'd like my children [Kwame James Burroughs and Dawn Burroughs] and my grandchildren, my immediate family to know that I was a member of this family lived between 1940 and 2000 something, and that I was a member of this family who really, really loved this family.  And who did whatever I could to improve the condition of this family, because I was shaped by how poor we were, how poor we still are.  And I try to do what I can and to get my younger family members, you know, to get education, to get training not everybody goes to college but just to uplift themselves.  That's one thing I'd like people to know.  My family must say, well, there was a family member who really cared.  I think we say that about my Uncle Dave [David Hudson Anthony] who lived in Brooklyn [New York], who helped me and who died.  He helped family members he didn't know.  So I want em to do that, number one.  Number two, I want my family members and others to, to recognize that there was a, a independent thinker--free thinker.  He was not bound by the traditions and expectations, and so on, shaped by either American culture, British culture, Christianity, I mean, he just was a free thinker, and, and that I was ethical.  I try to do the right thing and so on and so on.  So that's the second thing I'd like them to, to remember me by.  And if I get those two, I think I'll be, I'll be very, very happy.
Speaker 1: How would you like your professional colleagues to remember you?
Speaker 2: Good question.  I think if you ask my professional colleagues now, I think most of them would say--I'm sure there would be a minority, but I think most of them would say, well, there was a brother who was always looking out for folks, and there was a brother who always tried to help.  I think that would be the sentiment, that I've been a helpful resource.  I think there'll be some sentiment that says I didn't do enough, that I wasn't--I didn't push as hard as I could have or--so the way I reconcile that, and I guess we all have to fig--I say, you know, it's about leadership.  And what I tell people, when you ask about phrases and stuff like that, one of them is that you've got to choose which battles you're going to fight.  You cannot fight every battle that comes along.  And there are some battles that I chose not to fight, an observer would say, well, why didn't you take on such and such.  Well, they didn't know that I was involved in something else or I was tired, I just didn't feel like fighting this battle the particular one.  So, yesterday there was an issue that came down on the foundation field and it was a battle I felt like taking on so I fired off an e-mail to six people saying this is really outrageous, we got to do something about this, because I was ready to do the battle.  So I think my colleagues, you know, I think I would get mixed reviews but I think they would be largely positive, I think.  One of the admirable things about my standing in the foundation world, I was one of the first or second--I was one of the early directors of the women in philanthropy group [Women and Philanthropy], which is a group that's concerned about women in foundation world.  I was the first non-Hispanic on the board of Hispanics in Philanthropy, and I was also an advisor to the Asian group.  When I was doing that the black foundation [Association of Black Foundation Executives] people were saying, why are you involved with the Hispanic group, why are you doing that because we need you over here.  I say, well, I'm over here, too.  But I recognized that these were all groups that were excluded and marginalized, and they felt that they could be--that they could use some of my talents, and I made myself available to them.  So I think the foundation field would say, now, there was a brother who figured that out and did something about it.  When I did it then I told my black foundation folks, this is something that I feel is the right thing for me to do and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it now.
