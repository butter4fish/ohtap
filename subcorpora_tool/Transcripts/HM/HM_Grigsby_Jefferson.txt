Story_ID: 532420
Speaker 1: All right.  We're gonna get started.  I wanna ask you a few questions and the first question I like to ask is, could you tell me about your mother?  What was her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Purry Leone Dixon [Purry Dixon Grigsby], P-U-R-R-Y.  Never heard anyone else with that name.  She's unique and a very unique person.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in North Carolina.  I think it was Kings Mountain [North Carolina], some place in that area.
Speaker 1: And where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Kings Mountain.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her background as a child, her growing up as a child?
Speaker 2: I know very little about her growing up other than it was a--it was not a wealth--it, it was a common family.  Her parents [Alice Wellmon Dixon and William Dixon] were farmers.
Speaker 1: And how would you best describe your mother as a person?
Speaker 2: Very soft, very dedicated, very conscientious person who loved everybody, whose home was opened home to everybody and she just was a--she was a likeable person.  Everybody liked her and she loved everybody.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories or memories that she had as a child with you when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember at--off the top of my head.
Story_ID: 532421
Speaker 1: And your father, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr., um-hm.
Speaker 1: And where was he born, sir?
Speaker 2: He was born in Chapin, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: And where did he grow up?
Speaker 2: I think he grew up in South Carolina around that little neighborhood of Chapin, Newberry [South Carolina], in that area.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about his upbringing, his growth, growing up, his background?
Speaker 2: Very little other than the fact that his father [Fred Grigsby], who had little to no education, insisted that they have education, and one of the uncles told me that the father swapped milk and a cow for--at one of the schools for him to have education.  And they would take the cow to the school so they could milk it for a semester, whatnot.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: He was very dedicated, very stern person who knew what he wanted and he had his humorous side, but he didn't take any--he was a very strict person.
Speaker 1: Was he a disciplinarian?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  He was a high school principal and he took a high school [Second Ward High School, Charlotte, North Carolina] from a--what might have been concerned as a rundown school of heavy dropouts, people smoking on the campus and that type of thing.  And after four years, what had been a heavy dropout, most of the students were graduating with good, good records, and he was known for that type of improvement.  On the other hand, he had his sense of humor.  We had a cow and he brought some kids home who had never seen a cow before, so he was telling them about the milk and he looked at the tits and he said, "This titty's for chocolate milk and this one's buttermilk."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But he had that kind of humor.  But my dad also was a--was a businessman.  He started a credit union [School Workers Federal Credit Union; First Legacy Community Credit Union] for teachers which is still going.
Speaker 1: Is this credit union in South Carolina, or?
Speaker 2: In Charlotte, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: It's in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And did he share any stories with you about his childhood?
Speaker 2: A few.  But other, other than the thing like the school, his father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And both his mother [Kitty Pitts Grigsby], and father--well, his father was a farmer.
Story_ID: 532422
Speaker 1: How far back can you go into your ancestry, your great-grandparents or before that?  How far do you know that you could go and take us back?
Speaker 2: With my maternal family, I hear the stories all the time and that goes back to the seven sisters, one came from Africa and then those seven sisters had families of their own right up--right up to the present day.  But I think the original one came from Guinea.
Speaker 1: How far back can you go with your actual interaction with, with, with some of the grandparents or great-grandparents?  How far back can you take us?
Speaker 2: I can go back to my grandparents but not my great.
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's talk about your grandparents on your mother's [Purry Dixon Grigsby] side.  Can you tell me about them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandmother, who we call Mama Dixon, was a very favorite person.  Everybody loved her.
Speaker 1: What was her actual full name?
Speaker 2: Alice, Alice Dixon.  Alice Wellmon Dixon.
Speaker 1: Tell us more about her.
Speaker 2: She raised a large family, all of whom--I think most of them were farmers, the men were.  The women all became either teachers or educators or successful professional people.  But I think it was likely due to my grandmother.  My grandfather, her husband, died at an early age.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: William Dixon, Bill Dixon.  And I remember he played the guitar, but I was quite, quite young when he died.
Speaker 1: Did either one of them have any stories for you or, especially your grandmother.  Did she have any stories about her life?
Speaker 2: Not really, not that I remember even if she had those.  My memory's not that--not that great.
Story_ID: 532423
Speaker 1: Well, speaking of memories, let's try this way.  What was your--what is your earliest memory of growing up as a child, the earliest thing that you can remember?
Speaker 2: I don't think I can repeat it.  But anyway, I--my earliest remembrance was living in Lynchburg, Virginia, and going to the store, getting some buttermilk, and dropping the buttermilk, and the buttermilk broke.
Speaker 1: And what age was that when you were in Lynchburg?
Speaker 2: I first remember I was four years old.
Speaker 1: And had the family moved from--moved from Carolina to Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes, they had but I don't know what the sequence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And from what part of Carolina, I think they may have moved around.  I was born in Greensboro [North Carolina] in 1918 at the end of World War I [WWI].  My father [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] was a lieutenant and he was in charge of a battalion--a sub-army unit there.  But anyway, they had--they were in charge of rifles, so the story goes.  And there was a riot and the people rioting wanted to get in to get the rifles and he wouldn't let them have them.  That's the earliest I--the story that I heard about that.  But then, we went to Lynchburg.  My dad was a teacher in a high school.  When--as he grew up, his father [Fred Grigsby]--once he left this private school, Braden [ph.] I believe it was in South Carolina, he went to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina], which had a high school section.  And after the war, he came back to Johnson C. Smith and graduated with a bachelor's [degree].  Then, the family moved to Virginia where he had a job.  He was mainly a math teacher.  But I have a picture someplace of he with a basketball and he was a basket- coach at basketball.  I never knew my dad to be that athlete, athletic, but he was a coach of basketball at this high school in Virginia in Lynchburg.
Speaker 1: So, your earliest memory is in Lynchburg, Virginia, around four years old.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I also, part memory and part being told, I had chicken pox and my mother's [Purry Dixon Grigsby] dear friend had a sister visiting, and her sister turned out to be Marian Anderson, and she babysat me for--I--Marian Anderson came to Phoenix [Arizona], when we were at Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona], and I mentioned that to her and she said she just didn't--she didn't recall anything over thirty years, but that had been many, many years before.
Speaker 1: And this is the great opera singer, Marian Anderson.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Story_ID: 532424
Speaker 1: Now, could you give me the names of your siblings in their birth order and please include yourself?
Speaker 2: My first--I'm the first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My sister, Miriam [Miriam Grigsby Bates], came eight, eight years after me in Prairie View, Texas, when we lived in Prairie View.  The next one was Donald [Donald Grigsby], who was two years younger than Miriam.  He was born in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] and died yesterday.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: He was seventy-eight.  And then the fourth one of our--was Marvin, Marvin Orlando [Marvin Grigsby], born in Winston-Salem, and he was two years younger than Donald, so he was--he is seventy-six.
Story_ID: 532425
Speaker 1: Tell me this.  What were memories like growing up in your household with all those--with those children in your family?
Speaker 2: Gosh, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Holidays, special events, just basic home life.
Speaker 2: We had a very pleasant, very happy home life.  As I said, my dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] required us to do certain things.  My mother [Purry Dixon Grigsby] always came to our defense when, when we displeased dad.  But as I grew up, both in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] and in Charlotte [North Carolina], I had a paper route.  Let me go back to, when we left Lynchburg [Virginia], we went to Columbus, Ohio.  My daddy enrolled at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], but he had to retake classes he had at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] because Ohio State didn't recognize classes from this black school.  When he finished, well, I was too young to go to, to inter school in Lynchburg, so I was able to enter first grade at Ohio State in the laboratory school [Ohio State Laboratory School, Columbus, Ohio] because dad was a student.
Speaker 1: We're gonna revisit that momentarily.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What street did you grow up--grow up on in Lynchburg?  Do you recall that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you describe the first street that you do remember living on?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The street in Lynchburg was on a hill.  I remember the circus, circus came to town and the, the elephants messed on the tracks and the streetcar couldn't get traction (laughter).  That became a big thing to remember.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the neighborhood, the community that was around?  Was it a very close knit--
Speaker 2: In Lynchburg?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: No, I can't.  No, I don't remember any of that.
Speaker 1: Outside of the elephants, can you remember any of the other sights and sounds and smells of that time?
Speaker 2: In--of Lynchburg?  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we can go forward a bit to the next place that you do remember living.  What is the actual place where you can actually recall the street name?  Which city would that have been in?
Speaker 2: I guess that would be--that would be Winston-Salem 'cause I don't remember the street name in Columbus where we lived after we left Lynchburg.
Story_ID: 532426
Speaker 1: So, approximately how old were you when you went to Columbus [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Six years old.
Speaker 1: Six years old?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you enter kindergarten at that time?
Speaker 2: Entered first grade.
Speaker 1: First grade.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I never did--never had a chance to go to kindergarten.
Speaker 1: And what, what was the name of that school?
Speaker 2: That I went to?  Ohio State Laboratory School [Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Can you explain what that was for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was an experimental school for would be teachers, people preparing to teach.  And--
Speaker 1: And this was on the campus of Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: A year.
Speaker 1: And after you left there, where did you all go?
Speaker 2: We went to Prairie View, Prairie View, Texas.  My dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] got a job teaching at Prairie View State University [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas].  And I was enrolled in the second grade, but I'd had everything in the--at Ohio State that they had in the second grade that--so they skipped me to the third grade.
Speaker 1: So you enter at Prairie View.  Do you know the name of that school?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  It was an elementary school in town.
Speaker 1: And were there any particular teachers there at that school 'cause you're about seven years old, I would say, right, about seven now 'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that influenced you that you can recall?
Speaker 2: No, not then.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I think I was very curious.  I was curious because my mother [Purry Dixon Grigsby] had taught me to read long before I started school, so I think I had read some twenty books when I started school.
Speaker 1: And what kind of child as far as behavior were you?
Speaker 2: Very obedient.  No, I didn't--in Prairie View, my mother wanted me to take piano lessons, so we had a piano, but all the kids were playing baseball and I wanted to--I took the piano lessons, but I wasn't that serious about them 'cause as soon as I could get out and play baseball I would.
Speaker 1: Now, how long did you stay in the school in Prairie View?
Speaker 2: I must've been there two or three years 'cause we left Prairie View and went to Winston-Salem [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: What year would this have been when you left Prairie View?
Speaker 2: Must've been about 1928.
Speaker 1: And you would've been--approximately how old were you?
Speaker 2: Maybe eight or ten.
Story_ID: 532427
Speaker 1: How was life in Prairie View [Texas]?  What was it like growing up in that environment?
Speaker 2: I had playmates, and I didn't have any problems at home.  Well, my dad started raising chickens.  We had a garden, we had chickens.  And every time we'd get a shipment of baby chicks, I'd name them.  They become--they become my pets.  And every time somebody wanted to kill a chicken, I'd have a fit.  In fact, I wouldn't eat chicken for years until I got married.  But, anyway, the friends I had, I don't--well, I do remember some of them. Next door, there was a family of three, and we were very close.  Melba [Melba McMillan] was the oldest one, and Marian Claire [Marian McMillan] was the daughter, and Arthur [Arthur McMillan] was the boy.  The name was McMillan.  I'm just, just pulling that out.  Actually, I ran into Marian Clare when I was in the [U.S.] Army and she was in the WAC [Women's Army Corps].  That was years, years later.
Speaker 1: Now, what were things like racially in Prairie View at this time, if you can recall?
Speaker 2: I had no occasion to have any encounter racially because all of my activities were between my home and the school, and the university [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas].  All the events--well, it was like a black town.  And on weekends sometimes we would go to Houston [Texas] to a movie.  The parents [Purry Dixon Grigsby and Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] would put us in the movie while they went shopping.  And I remember there was a town, used to think of the name of it, but Prairie View is on a ranch and there was a small town between the college and the railroad station, and this is where we would go to shop sometimes.  And I remember vividly, my dad had an argument with a merchant.  Merchant refused to call him mister, and he said--I forget how it went now, but my dad said, no, I--he called him doctor.  He said, "No, I'm not a doctor."  He called him reverend.  He said, "I'm not a reverend."  He called him anything but mister, and my dad wouldn't buy it, so there was that friction.
Speaker 1: Did you hear any other comments or, or complaints or stories from your parents about maybe racial life outside of Prairie View, maybe in Houston or other cities?  Did you hear them talking about race in your household?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, at least I don't remember, but I'm sure they did.  But in Prairie View, we were insulated because we were on the campus and going off the campus, this little town was the only place where we had that kind of friction.  Because in Houston, we'd go to a black theater and into a black section of town where we didn't have that.  At least, I didn't encounter that kind of racism, although I knew it existed.
Story_ID: 532428
Speaker 1: Okay, so you stayed at Prairie View [Texas] until possibly, what the fourth grade?  Fifth grade?
Speaker 2: Yes, about that, fifth, fourth, fifth--fourth, fifth, and sixth grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: And pretty soon you'll be moving into--you'll be going to the next phase.  Was junior high the next phase?
Speaker 2: I don't think they broke it down at that--like that, in that way.  The next phase I think was about sixth, sixth grade, which would've been junior high.  And we went to Winston-Salem [North Carolina], where my dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] got a job teaching at Winston-Salem State Teachers College [Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: So, so you left Prairie View and you went to Winston-Salem?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, during this time period, you're in a few different schools.  Did you have any dreams or aspirations for anything in particular at this point?  Did you have any idea about what you wanted to be in life or what you were gonna do?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I remember in Prairie View, I wanted to be a carpenter.  And as we went on in Winston-Salem, I had a chance to, to be in a play for the first time and, and I got interested in acting.  And there was--there was a neighbor who was interested in art and he would gather the kids together and have us drawing on weekends.
Speaker 1: Do you recall this neighbor's name?
Speaker 2: James Diggs, James T. Diggs.  T. Diggs years later became head of the art department at Winston-Salem, and the gallery there is named for him.
Speaker 1: So, now you're in Winston-Salem and your father is working at the school there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What classes is he teaching?  What is he teaching there?
Speaker 2: I think he's teaching psychology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where were you living at that time?
Speaker 2: On Bruce Street, 615 East Bruce Street.
Speaker 1: Tell me about Bruce Street.
Speaker 2: An interesting street.  We were at the top of the street.  It was like--almost like a ninety degree steep hill.  Just below us was Columbia Heights elementary school [Columbia Heights High School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], and on the other side of the elementary school was the Diggs family.  T. Diggs grew up as an artist.  His younger sister, Hannah [Hannah Diggs Atkins], grew up, moved to Oklahoma, married, and became the first black legislator in Oklahoma.  Brilliant family.  As I said, T. would take us out, have us drawing.  But, I made--I had an uncle who lived with us, and I made a go kart, and we'd have races up and down the street.
Story_ID: 532429
Speaker 1: You're on Bruce Street, 615 Bruce Street, correct?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell us more about that home, that particular house.
Speaker 2: As I told you, Bruce Street dropped down, and the house was built so that three--two, two stories on the front, three stories on the back because it dropped way back and it had a big basement, which covered where we were allowed--the kids would play down there a lot.
Speaker 1: Now, was this house an existing house when you all moved to Winston-Salem [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No, he--dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] had it built.
Speaker 1: So, you're there with your mother [Purry Dixon Grigsby], your father, and your siblings, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, my two brothers [Donald Grigsby and Marvin Grigsby] were born there.
Speaker 1: And was there anybody else in the house, in the home with you?
Speaker 2: My dad's younger uncle, not his youngest, but one of the younger uncles lived with us.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's that memory.  There were two of them.  I'm not sure that both of them lived with us at the same time, I don't think so.  One was Howard [Howard Grigsby] and one was Rufus [Rufus Grigsby].  Now, Rufus was close to my age.  Howard lived with us for a while until he finished high--he finished high school in Winston-Salem, then went off to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] to college.
Speaker 1: So what stands out special about the--about your uncles in the home with you?  Anything special that influenced you about--with, with them?  I'd like to hear that, please.
Speaker 2: Story that they tell on us, Howard and I were sharing the same bed, and I don't know whether it was Rufus or somebody said Howard yelled out, "Catch that horse--hold that horse," and I said, "Catch it" (laughter).  He was talking in his sleep.  But anyway, Howard had this--delivered pa- his paper route.  And when he--I helped him, but when he went off to Fisk, I took over the paper route.  That's when Rufus came to live with us, and Rufus helped me.  But then, I told you about this go kart.  We were racing once down this steep hill, Rufus was sitting on the back--on the front, and car comes around the corner.  We know it's a bootlegger, and we're trying to get out of the way, so he pulls over and it hits a car that's parked on the sidewalk, takes a chunk out of my knee and knocks his car up on the sidewalk.  But other than that (laughter)--then, there--across the street from where we lived near the corner, there was a family, had a grocery store, and they had two daughters, Thelma [Louise Morgan] and Blanche Morgan.  They--we all--we would all gather down at the school, the Columbia Heights elementary school [Columbia Heights High School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] down below, and then we would--we would play down there.
Speaker 1: Now, did you attend Columbia Heights at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What grades were you there?
Speaker 2: Must've been about four and five, four, five, maybe six.
Story_ID: 532430
Speaker 1: You mentioned a bit earlier about a paper route.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did anything special happen with this paper route as you started to do this route?  You, you inherited this route from your [paternal] uncle [Howard Grigsby], correct?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, now it's your paper route.
Speaker 2: It's my paper route.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that paper route.
Speaker 2: Oh, at that time, paper boys were businessmen.  They had to get to customers and they had to collect for them and they had to pay.  I did a fairly good job at doing that.  And there was one man on my route who was a musician.  He played the violin all the time.  And I said, well my mother [Purry Dixon Grigsby] wanted me to learn--she loved the violin.  She wanted me to learn the piano, which I didn't do very well with.  So I made a pact with this guy, if he gave me violin lessons, I wouldn't charge him for the paper (laughter), so that went on for a while.  But anyway, that was one of the things I remember about the paper route in Winston-Salem [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Was it--were there any other artistic people on your paper route or anything that--else was there?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know of any.  I'm not familiar with that.
Speaker 1: So, you stayed there--how long did you stay in Winston-Salem?
Speaker 2: Until 1930, which was, what, maybe about five years.
Speaker 1: So, you're about, about twelve or thirteen years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what--at this point in your life, how is art introduced to you in a--in a larger way to you?
Speaker 2: At this point, I started to attend, it was Columbia Heights High School [Winston-Salem, North Carolina], and I think it may have started about the eighth grade, in seventh, eighth grade.  And I was invited to and I took part in, in a play, don't remember the title of it.  But they always kidded me.  I'm trying to think of the name of the--there, there goes my memory.  Anyway, the way I was pronouncing a particular thing.  But anyway, that gave me some background of interest, which I continued through, through much of my life.
Speaker 1: Was there much art or music and visual art in your home?  Was there a lot of--
Speaker 2: No, not really, no.  In fact, we--after we left Prairie View [Texas], we didn't have a piano in the house.
Speaker 1: So, you're twelve, thirteen years old, correct?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And at this school, you were you said possibly in the eighth grade you said?
Speaker 2: Seventh or eighth grade, yes.
Story_ID: 532431
Speaker 1: When we came to Charlotte [North Carolina], I think I came in the eighth grade.
Speaker 2: In reading some of your history, I came across a name, Walker Foster.  Does that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Could you tell us about Walker Foster?
Speaker 1: Well, when we moved to Charlotte, I immediately got me a paper route and I was--it was during the Depression [Great Depression].  At that time, I was buying all my clothes and pretty much taking care of myself financially other than food and what we had at home.  So, in the paper route, the people I could count on and the people who I had problems in collecting from, seemed like the teachers and the preachers were the ones I had the hardest time collecting from.  Well, at that time, teachers weren't being paid and such, but prostitutes and pimps then were the ones I could--had no problems collecting from bootleggers.  So, so--but Walker Foster was a, a class of his own.  He was a stone mason, and he hadn't paid me in a month or more, but I knew he would pay if I could catch him.  So, one morning about four o'clock as I was delivering his papers, I saw lights on at the house and I knocked on the door.  When he opened the door, there was a lot of lights and paintings were all around the room.  And I said, "Where did you get these paintings?"  He said he painted them.  I laughed.  I laughed in his face because he didn't fit my preconception of what an artist should look like.  Here, this guy was quite black and kind of dumpy.  He, he had really dull hands from laying bricks and all.  When I--my impression of a--of an artist was blonde and blue eyes and such.  So he saw I didn't believe him.  He said, "If you don't believe me, would you like to come and watch?"  Of course.  I went down and watched, and after watching him a few weeks, he asked me if I wanted to try, put a brush in my hand and that was it.
Speaker 2: What facilitated the move to Charlotte?  Why did you all go there?
Speaker 1: My dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] got a job as principal of the high school [Second Ward High School, Charlotte, North Carolina].  He--it was a challenge for him because he, he had worked in a high school in Lynchburg [Virginia], but not since then.  So he packed up the family and moved in several different times.  He bought a--bought an old car.  We didn't have a car before that, name was Essex.  And one--and driving, I went with him once from Winston-Salem [North Carolina] to Charlotte and he asked me if I wanted to drive, so I did.  So I was twelve years old then.  So I was driving and a policeman stopped.  And when he, he came up and said--he asked me, "How old are you boy?"  I said, "I'm fourteen."  Well, you had to be sixteen.  And after, he said--told dad, "You drive this car."  And when he started driving, dad said, "Why didn't you tell him you were sixteen?"  I said, "I didn't wanna tell that big a lie," (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, you're, you're in Charlotte.  Let's--and you found this--you found mister--Mr. Foster Walker.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, what was your feeling aside from the fact that you saw the paintings and didn't believe that he had done them?  What was your feeling about art and paintings when you saw those paintings?
Speaker 1: I thought they were real nice.  I didn't have any, anything beyond that I don't think at that time.  I didn't have a desire to paint.  It was only after Walker Foster had me trying or doing some paintings, some of which I still have that I got interested in art.
Speaker 2: What was the feeling when you first took that first brush and started to paint and touch it to that canvas?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It's weird.  It's unexpected, really, as to what might happen.
Speaker 2: And what was his reaction when he saw you doing this?
Speaker 1: I think he was pleased.  I think he was pleased that he had--in fact, I know, after a while he used to take pride in introducing me.
Speaker 2: So, at this stage, you're--approximately how old are you now, would you say you are now?
Speaker 1: Between twelve and thirteen, yeah.
Story_ID: 532432
Speaker 1: Now, how long did you all stay in Charlotte [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, the family's still there.  I finished high school in 1934.
Speaker 1: What, what was the name of that school that you finished in?
Speaker 2: Second Ward High School [Charlotte, North Carolina].  My dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] was principal and he told all the teachers if, if I made a grade better than C, he--they had to justify it (laughter).  So--
Speaker 1: How was it going to school--to the school with your father being the principal?
Speaker 2: Well, that's it.  He, he was strict on teachers and on me, so he wanted to be sure that if I got a good grade I deserved it.
Speaker 1: Now, as you were in school doing your schoolwork, what were your other extracurricular activities along with the schoolwork?
Speaker 2: We started a little theater and we would paint scenery and do other things connected with the--with the--with the club.  It was a little--it was a theatrical club.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other people in this club with you?
Speaker 2: Gosh, don't remember any of those right now.
Speaker 1: So, so you finish up in high school, you're on your way.  Are you still making trips to Mr. Foster's [Walker Foster] house?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, I'm going to Foster's all the time.  And some--well, I got a job waiting tables at one of the posh cafes in Charlotte and I'm trying to get these sequences in, in order.  But anyway, I got this job and black busboys and white, white waitresses.  And the guys started teasing me.
Story_ID: 532433
Speaker 1: Let me back up a little bit.
Speaker 2: Feel free, please.
Speaker 1: After I finished high school [Second Ward High School, Charlotte, North Carolina], I enrolled at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] because it was only a mile away.  This is where my daddy [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] had gone to college.  I wasn't particular about going to school at home, but we didn't have any money, not even--we didn't have any idea of going someplace else.  So, that was a rough year for me maybe because I wasn't that interested.  And I would spend my time visiting some of the people who lived on campus because many of them came from Winston-Salem [North Carolina], and I was at home, as much at home on campus at Johnson C. Smith when I was in high school as I was when I was in college.  And I remember in the dormitory drawing pictures of Rudy Vallee and movie stars in pencil all over the walls.  I had a friend who was from Winston-Salem who, who was a musician and we would hang out together.  Oh, I know why I brought him up.  And my dad was a good mathematician but I cared less about mathematics.  And there was a strict--I had to take math, freshman math.  And my knowledge of math was zero.  This guy from Winston-Salem was a tennis player.  He was a champion tennis player and everybody knew him.  So, there had been a collision between this guy and another member of the class.
Speaker 2: Do you recall their names by chance?
Speaker 1: I was--I was trying to pull it out.  I thought about it the other day.  Maybe before I stop I can recall the name.  But anyway, the guy in--who was in the class started coughing and he went to the window to spit and he came back.  Later on, Frank [ph.]--first name was Frank, and said, telegram for Mr. Fish [ph.].  His name was Fish.  Oh, he was the one in the class that dropped it, he went to the window to spit, and then somebody came, said, "Telegram for Mr. Fish," so he went up to get this telegram.  When he came back, all the answers to the--to the quiz were, were passed around, and so how I managed to pass my math (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, the answers went around when he--while he read his telegram, everybody worked it out for you, huh?
Speaker 1: Well, what happened was, when he went to the window to spit, he dropped the questions out to a math major, his friend who came around who worked out the problems and came back, saying, "Telegram for Mr. Fish," and he came and got it.  So--and that--when he got his, he passed it around.  But anyway--
Speaker 2: Now, during this time period, that was the year you said it was really rough on you.  Were you doing any art at that time or releasing anything or doing anything at that time?
Speaker 1: Not--oh, and I was still working with Foster [Walker Foster] at that time.  And, but I also--a couple other things happened then.  I started a little theater group then and I went out for track.  I went for the mile race.  I got halfway around the track and fell out, turned--I woke up in the hospital with appendicitis, so I didn't try any track anymore.  But these are some of the things that happened when I first went to Smith.  And that's when I got a job waiting tables at this restaurant.
Story_ID: 532434
Speaker 1: In the meantime, I had met a girl--woman in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: Gladys, Gladys, what's--anyway, Gladys was going to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and we began to writing each other.  So we set up a correspondence.  And--Gladys Shirley [ph.].  At this restaurant, the--several of the black busboys had begun talking to the white waitresses and I'm--all this time, I think I'm, I'm still about twelve, thirteen years old, fourteen at the most, and guys kept telling me that this girl likes you, see?  Why don't you talk to her?  So, I got up nerve and said something to her once.  She--it amused her.  I don't know, I may have asked her to go out.  So, she told the cook and the cook called me, you god damn black nigger, and he had a, a--one of these big old chopping--
Speaker 2: A cleaver?
Speaker 1: A cleaver.  And he hit at me with his cleaver and I ran.  I ran out, right out through the main dining room, my coat was just up by him, and I didn't stop 'til I called dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.].  And I think it was this time that I went on a visit to Atlanta (laughter) and stayed with my aunts.  That--I think that may have been during the summer 'cause it was after school was out at, at Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina].  And I went to visit Gladys and Gladys took me to a--an exhibit and--at Spelman, Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And while there, this tall man came in and she introduced me to Hale Woodruff who was there, a teacher, and I told him that I had been working with this man [Walker Foster] in Charlotte [North Carolina], and I was going to Smith but Smith didn't offer any art at all, so he said, "You can transfer to Morehouse and take art."  So I was excited and I wrote home, called home telling them I wanted to transfer, and dad said, "Come home immediately."  See, I was sixteen years old, and, and before I got a chance to get packed up and go back, he said, "Stay there until you hear from me," and I know my mother [Purry Dixon Grigsby] must've had a hand in, in calming him down.  But he came to Atlanta and brought my clothes because I had gone down with a briefcase, and I stayed there for three years, working with Hale Woodruff.
Story_ID: 532435
Speaker 1: Was anybody else at that point that you can recall?  Who was the president of the school?  Do you remember who the president was at that time?
Speaker 2: At Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Morehouse?  (Pause) Give me a minute because he was a--he was a very likeable--everybody loved this man.  Dr.--what, what was his name?
Speaker 1: Well, we have some presidents here.  Was it Archer [Samuel Howard Archer]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was--Samuel Archer.  And he could tell the tall tales (laughter) and have everybody, everybody would go to assembly and listen to him talk, though there were some people, you go to--you know you're gonna go to sleep.  W.E.B. Du Bois would always put you to sleep because his was over our head every night.
Speaker 1: So, W.E.B. Du Bois was there on faculty at Morehouse at that time.
Speaker 2: He, he was at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they would do lectures on different things?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They, they would have assembly, which was required.
Speaker 1: And was anybody else, any people of note that influenced you, anybody else besides Dr. Archer and Hale Woodruff?  Was there anybody else that--
Speaker 2: There was a man named John Macklin [ph.] Ross, Mack Ross [John M. Ross], who taught stagecraft or something about theater and he could cuss so profoundly.  I'd make him mad just listen to him cuss.  Then there was Anne Cook, who also was from Yale [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut], who was in theater.  Nancy Prophet [Nancy Elizabeth Prophet] taught sculpture.  I'll never forget, she was--I was doing the head and she was criticizing my head, and she was--she came down hard on me.  She said, "Mr. Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby], you don't know what a woman's lips, lips look like?  Have you ever kissed a woman?"  She made me so mad, I wanted to go in and tear up the place, but I couldn't get in.  But anyway, and I just got a book to review on Hale Woodruff and Nancy Prophet.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Hale Woodruff a bit.  He was your main art teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were--what were your impressions of him when you first saw him and as the years developed?
Speaker 2: Oh, as the years developed, my impression of Hale Woodruff was like he was my big brother.  He was a person who would always help me out if I needed help either financially or morally or spiritually, any other way, I'd go to Hale.  Hale could tell some of the damnedest tales, too.  One story Hale told was that--of an artist who incorporated himself and sold shares, doing what he wanted to do.  When I finished high--when I finished college, I incorporated myself and sold shares to go to art school with shares that would be paid off in paintings and prints.  I left Atlanta [Georgia] with $125 to go to New York [New York] to spend a year.
Speaker 1: You self-finance--you financed yourself, so to speak?
Speaker 2: So to speak.  Not realistically, but, but at least I got started and I--and I went there.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about Mr. Woodruff's art, Hale Woodruff's art?
Speaker 2: I felt that Hale was among the top artists of the country.  He--and he proved that in many ways.  The thing about his teaching, as I describe to somebody, it wasn't that he--his lessons weren't talked, they were caught.  He, he emulated everything he--one of the--some of the things I didn't agree with that he did but most of the things I realized how much he had given us.  When we left Morehouse, we not only knew techniques in painting, but we also knew art history, knew ancient history.  We knew contemporary history.
Story_ID: 532436
Speaker 1: Other classmates that were in class with you in Hale Woodruff's class.
Speaker 2: William Hayden from Detroit [Michigan].  You may have known him.
Speaker 1: And are there any others?
Speaker 2: William Hayden was in art and--
Speaker 1: In one of Mr. Woodruff's writings, he mentions Wilmer Jennings.  Do you--
Speaker 2: Wilmer was there before me, the year before, yeah--he, he was one of Hale's favorite students and I finally met Wilmer years later in Rhode Island where Wilmer had gone to Rhode Island School of Design [Providence, Rhode Island].  He'd also become a professor there, and his daughter [Corrine Jennings] has a gallery [Kenkeleba House] in New York [New York] now.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that he had lessons.  The lessons were in art but also they were in history at the same time.
Speaker 2: He--
Speaker 1: Had he world--had he traveled quite a bit and, and try to impart many things to you all?
Speaker 2: Yes, he had--see, Hale Woodruff first got started with an award he won where he was able to go to France, to Paris [France] and study.  Dr. Hope [John Hope] found Woodruff in Paris and talked him into coming to Atlanta [Georgia] to teach, and Woodruff tried to refuse, saying he was an artist but he was not a teacher.  And we used to tease Woodruff about being a Ph.D., that is, a Pearl High daddy from Tennessee because at that time, he had no other degrees, but he was a top artist and top teacher.  But he had encountered many of the artists of the modern movement in France and he was aware of what was going on with Picasso [Pablo Picasso] and Matisse [Henri Matisse] and all that group, which he imparted to us as well as the classical artists of Rome and France and other, other parts of Europe.  Most importantly, he introduced us to African art.  See, at that time, no one considered works coming from Africa as art, but Hale did.  And Hale introduced us to the--many of the styles and many of the artists from Africa.  So that was a big beginning and a strong influence on me.  In fact, that was when I--when I left New York and went to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], I had to select a subject for a, a thesis and I chose African art.  At that time, very few people thought that--considered works from Africa as art.  But--and, and further in the face I said, my thesis was the influence of African art on modern art, showing that modern art's basis came from African art and Hale was responsible for that.
Speaker 1: How did you feel?  How was it received by your other classmates when he saw you explaining African art the way he did?  What was your feeling at that--at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, it was one of, of acceptance, something that we had never, never considered.  We had not been brainwashed beforehand so we didn't have to unlearn something.  This was a new concept, which we accepted even though it wasn't generally accepted at that time in the art world.
Speaker 1: So, you graduated from Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were there three years?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At what age did you leave, in what, what year?
Speaker 2: I left in 1938.  I was nineteen years old.
Story_ID: 532437
Speaker 1: And where'd you go?
Speaker 2: I went to art school.  I went to New York [New York].  I took my little $125 and on my way to New York, I stopped in Charlotte [North Carolina], and the director of the museum had followed me, knew what my interests were, but knew how unrealistic.  But she a friend, a close relative visiting that she wanted me to meet and talk to who was from New York, and it turned out to be Robert Gwathmey, who was a major American artist.  So, Bob Gwathmey came to our home in Charlotte.  It was raining and, and instead of--in order not to track his muddy shoes in the house, he took his shoes off, and this was something that was almost unheard of like in '38 [1938], a white man in the South taking his shoes off so he wouldn't, wouldn't muddy up.  So anyway, Bob gave me some good advice to go to the American Artists School [New York, New York] instead of the Art Students League [Art Students League of New York, New York, New York] because it would be half the price and the instruction would be as good.  So, I went on to New York, took a bus, got to the Harlem YMCA annex [New York, New York] because I couldn't afford the main Y [Young Men's Christian Association].  And as I sat my bags down 'cause I'm talking all the time about me going to art school, and the clerk said, "There's an exhibit across the street you might like to see."  And I went over, I was looking around, there was one other person in the room.  I finally got up nerve and said, "I'm Eugene Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby] from Charlotte."  And he said, "I'm Jacob Lawrence from New York."  He said, "There are a lot of other people here from Charlotte.  There's Charles Alston and Romare Bearden."  He said, "I want you to meet them, so come on over."  He took me up 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard].  Everybody had warned me about these New Yorkers; you have to be careful of them.  I didn't know this guy from Adam, but he's taking me up this street.  We get up to 141st Street, we went up to number 306 and it was a little stairway, had been a little (unclear) and it was dark.  And I had some doubts about who I was with and where I was.  So, we went on up and met some of the people on that first floor and then on up on the second floor.  But that's my introduction to New York and to the artists.
Speaker 1: Who was in this building?  Who were some of the people?
Speaker 2: Charles Alston.  I can't think of the guy, had the big studio on the first floor who was a sculptor.  A novelist was sharing the apartment with Alston, Bill Attaway [William Attaway], whose first book was 'Let Me Breathe Thunder.'  In subsequent years, the people changed, and the man who was sharing the apartment with Alston was a dancer in 'Androcles and the Lion' [George Bernard Shaw].
Speaker 1: Mr. Grigsby, this is a few years after the so-called Harlem Renaissance.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, are these people more established now in their fields as major artists or are they still kind of, still rising?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure how to answer that.  They, they are established because they are working artists.  And the reason why when most of these are--they're all on WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration], all except Romare Bearden.  And Romare's mother, Bessye Bearden [Bessye J. Bearden], was a politician, and she had some role in the state assembly I think where she got him a job, a regular job, whereas the rest of them were on WPA.
Story_ID: 532438
Speaker 1: Could you please explain that to us, that acronym (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Works Progress Administration [Work Projects Administration].  The art section that Franklin Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] had set up in which it paid artists to paint pictures and murals.  It paid artists to create music, to develop theater.  These people who would've been unemployed but who had training and were able to produce under these situations.  The pay wasn't that much, but it was better than nothing and it provided not only skilled opportunity, but to develop further your skills.
Speaker 1: How did one be--how could one apply?  Was it just a, a general application?  What did you have to do?
Speaker 2: Well, you had to apply for--you had to show background and you had to be twenty-one years of age, and I was not twenty-one.  So I couldn't get on the--I couldn't get on WPA.  So--
Speaker 1: Approximately if you can tell us in today's terms, how much would it have been, been monthly or weekly?  How was it paid?
Speaker 2: You were paid until you got your pink slip.  I think it was paid weekly.  How much it was, I don't know.  At that time, I think it may have been about twenty-one dollars a week, but twenty-one dollars in 19--what, '38 [1938]--
Speaker 1: Thirty-eight [1938], '40 [1940], somewhere around there?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty [1940] it was, yeah.  Oh, no, it was '39 [1939] 'cause I finished [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] in '38 [1938] and went to New York [New York] in '38 [1938] and that was at '38 [1938] and '39 [1939].  And so since it was in the middle of the Depression [Great Depression], my parents [Purry Dixon Grigsby and Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] weren't getting paid all that often, so I had to find other means of support, which turned out to be mopping floors and doing all kind of other things.  I delivered books for a well known bookstore downtown and I did some cooking.  I was in a barbecue place at--or hamburger place I think that became a national, but anyway, somebody came in one night, he wanted a hamburger that was burnt on the outside and dripping blood on the inside.  I said you come around here and cook that yourself.  Then, one night, guys came in and gave me an order for about a dozen hamburgers to be delivered and I delivered those hamburgers.  I walked in this house on 5th Avenue at some place in there and as I walked in, they closed the door and there were several men standing around and they had guns.  And I was kind of upset.  I finally found out that Franklin Roosevelt was staying there that night, and this was [U.S.] Secret Service.
Story_ID: 532439
Speaker 1: You have a chance to have--you're in New York [New York] now and you're seeing people like Jacob Lawrence and the great Bearden [Romare Bearden] and people like this now.  What are your thoughts at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, they weren't great, see.  These are just another artist, another friend of mine from, from New York.  Jake Lawrence--I would go--Jake and I worked out of the same, same gallery there.  He was--when he was doing some of his series of things.  And Gwen [Gwendolyn Knight], who I really thought they were married at the time, but they weren't, but Gwen was doing equally as well.  Then, we had mentioned him earlier, the musician.  Well, I was working for Gotham Book Mart [New York, New York], which had some of the major writers in New York in their farm, it seems.  And a woman had taking a liking to me.  In fact, one morning, I got called--the place wasn't open, I got the key and a major artist was supposed to be there.  I got fired that day.  But, that delivering books took me all over Brooklyn [New York] and all over New York where I wouldn't have gotten to otherwise.
Speaker 1: So, how are your studies at this point?
Speaker 2: That was the beauty of this school, the American Artists School [New York, New York].  If I'm working on a job, I could go to school at night and if I'm working at night, I go to school in the day, so it just--and then when it came to the second semester, I told the dean that I was going to have to drop out because my dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] couldn't afford it and I'm--still can't keep up financially, so he said, "Well, I'm gonna give you a work scholarship so you continue studies for the semester without worrying about paying for anything."
Speaker 1: Do you recall what his name was, the dean at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're there and how do you view yourself now as an artist, your skill and your level of what you been--you been doing this for a minute now, so how do you feel about where you're going with this?
Speaker 2: I'm still struggling.  I don't really see myself too much because I'm, I'm splitting myself.  When I get to New York as--in, in addition to going to art school, I get hooked up in a little theater group, Dick Campbell's Rose McClendon Players.  And I'm working on scenery and acting in some of the plays.  And then the guy who is the scenic--head of the scenic designing applies to be the scenic designer for a Broadway production, 'Mamba's Daughters' [Dorothy Heyward and DuBose Heyward], never had a black doing this before, so nobody thinks he's gonna get the job.  Unfortunately or fortunately, he gets the job, and then that cuts him loose from the Rose McClendon Players, who we are putting on plays in little--in schoolhouses along--in New York to this Broadway production, so he asked me to be his assistant without pay.  So he makes the drawings and I make up the models and he takes these and he--damn, what's his name?  Anyway, he's the first black scenic designer.
Speaker 1: And his name again was what now?
Speaker 2: That's what I'm trying to pull out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is on Broadway?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Mamba's Daughters.'
Speaker 1: 'Mamba's Daughters.'
Speaker 2: Was the--and I ran into a program from that, going through a lot of stuff.  Perry Watkins.
Speaker 1: Perry Watkins.
Speaker 2: Perry Watkins, yeah.  Perry was a graduate of Yale, Yale School of Drama [New Haven, Connecticut].  Perry had about eight or nine kids, and he lived in Brooklyn.  And he'd come in and work at night on these--he'd make his drawings and I'd make the models.
Speaker 1: Would it be safe to say he was the first black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would think so.
Speaker 1: --Broadway scenic designer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Perry Watkins.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, you're there, and the dean has given you a scholarship and you're also working several, several jobs it seems like, different things (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Story_ID: 532440
Speaker 1: And it's going on into 1940.  What happens around that time period?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty [1940]?  Well, as a tail end thing on the little theater group, Langston Hughes--Suitcase Theatre [Harlem Suitcase Theatre] gets started in the basement of the library there, and I began working with him, kind of--I don't wanna say advisor, but helping with some of the--some of the actors in their roles and such.  Now, I don't get as deeply involved with Langston Hughes as I did with Rose McClendon [Rose McClendon Players].  I lost the thought.  You asked me--
Speaker 1: We're, we're on the way to 1940, but let's go back a bit with the Langston Hughes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any--was there anything profound that stood out that he ever said or anything that was told to you by him?  Or what was he like, being around Langston?
Speaker 2: Langston was very, very quiet, very unassuming person and I would go visit Langston every summer when--during the years after, I went back to New York [New York] to go to school.  And to give you inside on Langston is his humor.  He--there's somebody who was doing a doctorate at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] or Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] who wanted to borrow his tape machine, and Langston checked the machine.  He looked at the--he listened to the tape.  He thought it was all clear, nothing was on it.  But in order to get some of his material, Langston would go to bars and so he'd--also in the apartment that he lived at on--down on 27th Street.  And there was a lot of loud arguments and cussing sometimes, so Langston would stick his mic out to pick some of this up.  So when he checked and the tape seemed to be clear, but when the guy got to class, turned it on, he got this, "You motherfuckers!" (Laughter) He got--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Langston got a big kick out of that.
Speaker 1: So he had a humorous side to him.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Langston was great.
Story_ID: 532441
Speaker 1: In addition to Langston Hughes, how was black New York [New York] at that time, and the arts scene?  What was going on?  What was the tone of the neighbor- how was Harlem [New York, New York] at that point?
Speaker 2: Interesting.  Interesting and busy and--
Speaker 1: Take us there for a moment if you can.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to separate Harlem at that time.  And, you see, when I did my doctorate, I did it in New York over about eight or ten years, and I went back in the summers.  And these summers also became a part of my Harlem memory.
Speaker 1: So, in the '30s [1930s], late '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Harlem.
Speaker 2: I lived in the YMCA [Harlem YMCA, New York, New York], and I had a roommate from Atlanta [Georgia] and, and this guy was--we were all smoking.  Everybody smoked.  But he smoked these little cigarettes and doused them, cut them out and put them in a little box and stank up the room.  I had no idea this was marijuana he was smoking.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Then there was a little, little nightclub near there that we would--we would go to, but I never--we didn't have the money.  So what we could do, we'd order a drink and sit there for a couple hours nursing the drink.  And I remember once, a group of dancers came in, beautiful, and a guy who was my buddy who was with me, guy said something about the--he said they're all men (laughter).  I had no idea.  But then there were several major clubs around, one of which name I can't call right now was owned by a guy from Charlotte [North Carolina].  And we, we had entry.  But anyway, we did have some kind of entertainment and nightclub type thing.
Speaker 1: Now, at this time with the art scene, was there a, a marriage of the different arts?  For instance, the, the--all the visual artists, but you also had at that time in the '40s [1940s] in Harlem, you had a jazz movement started, a bebop movement was beginning to begin.  Was any of those--were those things drawn together for you?  Were you part of that?
Speaker 2: Well, in Charles Alston's apartment, you had every musician, every writer, every politician, every artist of any note who would come through.  There was--and, and on that studio below him, I can't think of the guy's name now.  There was a poker game every Saturday night.  He--everybody on the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration], musicians, writers, artists, and all would--stood in on this poker game.  And at one time, I think (unclear) had me to cut the game.  That's when I realized it was the person who had the poker game who ended up with all the money.
Speaker 1: So, so there was a lot going on in Harlem at that time.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: So, 1940s coming up on us now.
Speaker 2: Nineteen forties [1940s], yes.  Oliver, Sy Oliver is the name I was trying to pull up.
Speaker 1: The great jazz musician?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And Sy's wife, Lillian [Lillian Clark Oliver], was one of the artists in the group there at--who would work on this.  And Sy would come in talking about some of the places he had been and things he had done and how he had created this particular music.
Story_ID: 532442
Speaker 1: So you're there '39 [1939], we're going into '40 [1940], you decide to leave.  What happen--what happens at that point?
Speaker 2: That was an opportunity in one way and not one in another.  Hale Woodruff came through going to New Haven [Connecticut] to get the approval for his Amistad mural and invited me to go with him if I paid my way to go up to New Haven.  And he got his mural approved.  I met a couple of artists who I read about, I heard about later whose names I can't pull out right now.  But anyway, when Hale came back, he offered me the opportunity to be his assistant in painting the Amistad mural.  I said it was a collusion because at that time, my dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] called and said that the State of North Carolina would pay my way to go to graduate school any place but North Carolina because they didn't want no blacks going to graduate school there.  So I had to make a--I had--I had decided Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] because dad had gone to Ohio State.  I had been there before.  I had to make a choice between going to Ohio State with the State of North Carolina paying for it or going with Hale Woodruff as his assistant without knowing what kind of funding he had for that, realizing it would be a great experience but not knowing what's gonna happen after whereas going to Ohio State, getting a master's degree might be more meaningful in terms of my, my future there.  So I had to give up on going to Atlanta [Georgia] with Hale to go to Ohio--to Columbus [Ohio].
Speaker 1: So, you went to Ohio State University and what did you do there?  What did you get there?
Speaker 2: I got a master's degree on the thesis that I wrote, which was the influence of African art on modern art.  But when I got there, I found out that there were some black drama majors who could not participate in the main theater programs because they didn't let blacks participate.  So I said why in the hell don't we start our own?  So, we started a group called Ohio State Playmakers, and I wrote to Langston [Langston Hughes], and he sent us a play which we produced there.  And when our group produced the play there, then they--the theater people in the department saw that these people could act, so they invited them to be a part of it and I think they've been a part of it ever since.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the play that, that Langston Hughes sent you?  Do you recall that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't even though I have a copy of the program somewhere.
Speaker 1: So, you--that--so that influenced them to open up and start segregating the--
Speaker 2: At least the, the play, yeah.  The act, those people who were acting.  But, Ohio State was--Columbus was a very segregated city.  I remember one day there was a popular movie in the theater right off campus and there was a long line to get in and I saved enough money to go.  And by the time I got to the ticket window, the person--the cashier looked up at me and closed the window and she would not start selling tickets again until I leave--until I left.
Speaker 1: Now, this is new to you I would imagine because you grew up--as we said earlier, you were isolated and insulated from that kind of situation.  How did you feel now years later, you're working on your master's degree, you've lived in New York City [New York, New York], now you're in Ohio--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Columbus, dealing with this.  How did you feel?
Speaker 2: Horrible.
Story_ID: 532443
Speaker 1: So, you're at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] now and you're witnessing some things that are kind of segregated going on as far--even on the hallowed campus, campuses, there's still segregation going on, even--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the--in the arts.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you start a theater group.  Tell me more about that.
Speaker 2: This little theater group of--these black students were majoring in theater, but they couldn't participate in the major dramatic programs, so we start this group to give opportunity for--and we called it the Ohio State Playmakers.  I think the first one was--first play we had I think is one that Langston Hughes sent to us so we didn't have to pay for, the usual payments you make for theater for plays.
Speaker 1: Now, you did a thesis also, the influence of African American--of African art on modern art.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How was that received by your professors at school?
Speaker 2: My--I had one professor who was brave enough to work with me on that and he, he seemed to accept it.
Speaker 1: What was his name, do you recall?
Speaker 2: I did and now it's gone.
Story_ID: 532444
Speaker 1: So you're in 1940, you get your master's degree, and it's going on to '41 [1941] now and you have another opportunity that arises further down south.  Could you tell us about that, please?
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean with Woodruff [Hale Woodruff]?  And the Amistad?
Speaker 1: Possibly with that one, yes, or also in nine--in '41 [1941], you went somewhere else in the--in the country.  Where else did you go?  You left Ohio?
Speaker 2: In '41 [1941]?
Speaker 1: I'd done some research and it said that Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida]--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, that was--that was later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, in 1940--how long did you stay at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I stayed there a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, in addition to the thesis and the little theater, I got me a, a job, a student job, and first semester, I was developing film.  I had not been in the film studio before, but I learned how to, to develop and crop film.  The second semester, I had a job working in a community center and it was on the other side of Columbus [Ohio].  It took me about a hour to get there.  But it gave me a opportunity to study on my way out, on the way back.  And one day, the director said that her niece was coming into town and she wanted me to meet her niece.  And turns out when she--when I met her niece, I had already met her the year before in Charlotte [North Carolina] and turns out, she's my wife.
Speaker 1: And what was her name then at that point?
Speaker 2: Her name was Thomasena Marshall [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby].
Speaker 1: And this is 1940?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty [1940], um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you met her and you all started dating at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes, in a way, we did, um-hm.
Story_ID: 532445
Speaker 1: You're in Ohio, continue, please.  Tell me what happens with you later in Ohio then?
Speaker 2: Well, after I left Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], I came back to Charlotte [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: And what year would that have been?
Speaker 2: Forty-one [1941].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--and I was visiting Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina].  The dean saw me and he said, "Do you want a job," and I said, "Of course, what is it?"  Artist in residence.  So I took a job as artist in residence at Johnson C. Smith for fifty dollars a month.  It was--(laughter) I made that much or more at Ohio State on a student job whereas in Charlotte I was living at home and didn't have to pay rent and such.
Speaker 1: Now, were you releasing any work at that point, any paintings or anything?  Were you releasing those at that--
Speaker 2: No.  No.  What happened, Bob Gwathmey [Robert Gwathmey] whom I had met going to art school [American Artists School, New York, New York] had got involved with Technicolor silkscreen printing.  And when I came back to Charlotte, Bob sent me materials and equipment to do silkscreen printing, and I set up doing posters for a little theater, not a little theater, movie house there in Charlotte using my parents' [Purry Dixon Grigsby and Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] side porch and where I got paint all over everything.  But anyway, I got involved with, with that, with silkscreen printing.
Speaker 1: And that was a new technique then at that point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, how long did you stay in Charlotte when you went back?
Speaker 2: A year.  I was at Johnson C. Smith for a year.
Speaker 1: And where was Thomasena [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] at this point?
Speaker 2: Thomasena, we hadn't gotten together.
Speaker 1: Was she living in Charlotte or was she living in Ohio still?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't live in Ohio.  She may have still been living--been in Chicago [Illinois].  See, she grew up in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Oh, she grew up in Chicago.
Speaker 2: But she had aunts in North Carolina.  Her family was one of the--one of the elite families of North Carolina.  Her uncle was the first black professor at Johnson C. Smith and she had an aunt or a cousin who was the first black woman to head a primary--as principal of the elementary school, and a number of other people.  Many of her relatives were in education.  But--and I'm trying to think of other things I did there in Charlotte at that time.  But--
Speaker 1: So, you stayed in Charlotte for one year, you're the artist in residence, then what happens?
Speaker 2: Summer, I go down--I teach summer school at Elizabeth City [North Carolina] and then I apply for a job, a little more substantial than the one I had at Smith.
Story_ID: 532446
Speaker 1: I got a job at, at Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] working with Mrs. Bethune.
Speaker 2: Now, is that Mary McLeod Bethune?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Could you explain working with her and how she was?  That's a great experience for us to hear.
Speaker 1: It was, yeah.  Mary Bethune was often off campus.  She was very involved in politics with Mrs. Roosevelt [Eleanor Roosevelt].  She also had--was in charge of one of the social programs.  But when she was on campus, she was quite demanding of her teachers and what they did.  She'd get up in faculty meetings, see one of them teachers going down to that Black Tiger [ph.], which is a little club off campus there.  She had wanted me to do a mural but I never could get around to get all the materials and things for it.
Speaker 2: What was her personality like as a person?  You had one on one conversations with her?  What was her--
Speaker 1: She was--I started to say abrupt, but she wasn't abrupt.  She wasn't around that much, but she was pleasant to talk to.  I had one kind of a--started to say a run-in with her.  There were no fraternities on Bethune-Cookman.  There were clubs.  And teachers were asked to sponsor these different clubs, and I sponsored one of them.  It makes you--reminds me of another thing that happened when I was at, at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina].  My dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] knew of my interest in the theater, so they--there was a practice in North Carolina, a competition between theater groups, so I agreed to, to coach a young girl for a competition.  And we chose a one act play, one person, and she won first place in that play, very attractive young girl.  Even though she was attractive and she was a high school student, I never thought about her sexually until years later.  But anyway, I didn't know any women at--in Florida, so I invited Helen Wise [ph.] to come down as my guest.  This was easy because Mrs. Bethune's assistant was from Charlotte [North Carolina] and was traveling down and she could bring Helen down, so she did, and Helen stayed with her while she was there.  But at the line of introductions when you, you were introducing all the people, your guests and so forth, as we got to Mrs. Bethune, Mrs. Bethune beamed and said, "Oh, young lady, what college do you go to?"  She said, "I'm in high school."  (Laughter) So, that kind of put me in the doghouse.
Speaker 2: And, and did Mrs. Bethune say anything to you about it?
Speaker 1: No, no.  I didn't--I didn't have any--anything after that.
Story_ID: 532447
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're at Johnson Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] for a year and then you went down to Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].  Then what happens?
Speaker 2: Well, the [U.S.] Army had been after me, and I had had three deferments.  So my dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] called and said that the mayor, former mayor of Charlotte [North Carolina] was putting together a company to remain at Monroe, North Carolina, which is only thirty miles from Charlotte for the six months, for the duration of the war plus six months, but you had to volunteer to get in.  So, I left Bethune-Cookman and went to Charlotte, volunteered to get in the Army.
Speaker 1: And this company was going to be stationed there.  They weren't going to go to any combat.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That was the--that was the assurance.  So, then I come back--well, anyway, I had to--I just--my year at Bethune-Cookman wasn't that great.  They didn't have enough students for an art class to be able--so the dean said you have to teach something, another class.  Well, theater was my minor, but on the transcript it was English, so he said you have to teach English.  I didn't know how to teach English, and the head of the English department, who was going to help me, said something about diagramming and making a sentence.  I never heard of diagramming (laughter).  So, she had to come in before class and help me to teach the class and then I would try to follow her afterwards.  So that was a disaster.  A few other things around there that--I didn't have too many art students.  And the dean--oh, what's the name of the head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] now?  [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond.  His uncle was the dean and he said that according to your record, I don't think we can hire you again.  I said, that's all right, I'm already--I'm in the Army (laughter).  So, when I got to the camp, first camp, the first person I met was a guy from Omaha, Nebraska, who was assured that if he joined the Army, he'd be overseas in six weeks because he would be able to get after--get away from the women that were after him.
Speaker 1: The recruiters tell him that?
Speaker 2: And another one said that he would be digging a pipeline from Alabama to North Carolina, but then there were about a dozen guys who volunteered so they could get out of jail.
Speaker 1: Now, was this a technique that the--that all recruiters used to get people to join?  Were these things they would tell you?
Speaker 2: I think recruiters use anything that they possibly can to get people to join.  The kids joining now, they go over there and get killed.
Speaker 1: Now, who was the general under your battalion?  Who was over your group at that time?
Speaker 2: At that time, I don't know who was over at that time.
Speaker 1: That was World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But after we got--after we got overseas, General Patton [George S. Patton] was the--
Speaker 1: So, where did you go overseas?  Because now you thought you were gonna stay in Charlotte.  What--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, first thing they did was to bring in a lot of recruits and I'm the first one there.  So he put me in charge and we were--we, we were in tents.  I didn't know Army had barracks.  We were all in tents.  And one guy came up, said he was a first sergeant from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] I'll say.  I said, I don't know what the hell that is, but go ahead and put up those tents and I was sitting in the major--in the main tent with the major who was in charge of the--I said, "Major, what the hell is a first sergeant?"  And from then on, I was second in command (laughter).
Story_ID: 532448
Speaker 1: This company, everybody had told them they had different reasons for being in there and then you get--now, I want to ask you another question (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --before I go forward too fast.  Was the [U.S.] Army still segregated at this point?  Was it still--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --a segregated army?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  We had white officers, black recruits, black enlisted men.  So we, we got this company going and they decided--they decided they were gonna elect officers, and I had learned something about the levels and what they were required, and they elected me first sergeant.  I didn't want to be first sergeant.  I wanted to be tech sergeant.  So--but anyway, they brought in a new captain who was a pretty nice, very nice guy from Georgia, Milton Z. Miltide [ph.], he's from Valdosta, Georgia.  I would go inspecting with him.  He'd give the officers hell but not the enlisted men.  And one day, at morning report, there was a report that Captain Miltide has been transferred or demoted and Master Sergeant Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby] has been demoted to private (laughter). When I got paid, I'd been private all the while, just--and then they sent me off to an ammunition school in Savanna, Illinois.  And that's where I went from private to tech sergeant.  And we stayed there for about three months learning the various levels of ammunition, what to do with them, so forth.  Then, they sent us to Fort Sill [Oklahoma].  And a month after I got there, I got my--advanced to major sergeant--master sergeant.  So--
Speaker 1: And then where did you go after that?
Speaker 2: Well, we were in Fort Sill for a while.
Story_ID: 532449
Speaker 1: A lot of interesting things happened there, you know.
Speaker 2: Tell us about some of them, please.
Speaker 1: One day we were in, in the, where there was an entertainment tent or barracks and there was a guy playing the piano, taking requests.  And the same guy was Frank Fields that I had known in New York [New York].  He was one of the guys that came in and out of Alston's [Charles Alston] studio.  I knew Frank had written this--I forget what you call it now, but one section of it was called 'To a Brown Girl' [ph.].  And I stood up behind the post to request it, let the musician play that section, 'To a Brown Girl.'  Of course it hadn't been published.  He almost fell off the seat seeing who it was.  Then, the guys needed some kind of activity, so we got a little group together and started singing.  And we had several radio programs that we broadcast over.  And then I found out they had some instruments there, so we got together, put together a band in which we, we--I think we marched once.  I missed telling you back in--I guess I was in high school [Second Ward High School].  It was in Charlotte [North Carolina] that one of our neighbors had put together a band and he got me in it playing a trombone.  So, my three musical experiences, with the piano in Texas, with the violin in Winston-Salem [North Carolina], with the trombone in Charlotte, gave me chutzpah put together a little band in which we--let me fast forward on that, too, while I'm thinking about it.  When we got on board, we went overseas on the Queen Elizabeth [RMS Queen Elizabeth] and when we got on board, these guys came up to me and said are there any, any instruments on board?  So, I asked the special service officer, you got instruments?  There are whole room full of all kinds of instruments, so we brought those out, gave them to the guys, and they started jamming.  Then--
Speaker 2: Could you play one also at that point?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I wasn't playing.  I was just--I was directing.  So, the special service officer said, "Would you like--you guys like to put on a show of your own so the band--we've got a show that's being put on and would you like to join the show or do one of your own?"  I said, "Well, we want to get in and make you as a good one instead of doing a separate one."  So, he said, "Well what can you do?"  I said, "We got everything.  We got dancers, musicians."  I didn't know what was on board, so I went around buttonholing everybody, said, "What can you do?  Can you play an instrument?  Can you dance?  Can you sing?"  We ended up--Joe Louis was onboard.  We had him doing a skit.  And the guy who was a director, can't think of his name right now, was the director of 'Star Trek.'  And I had done some drawings on board, and when I came--when we came in, and 'Star Trek' was first started, I sent him a note saying that I had a drawing of him and we'd like to bring it over.  So, he invited us and we sat through a taping of one.  And someplace I still have that thing from the, the theater.
Speaker 2: Now, back up for a moment, Joe Louis, the Brown Bomber, the boxer was on the boat.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you ever have any one on one conversations with him or any--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: What were some of the things he said about life?
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't--we, we didn't talk about life.  You know, just, just basic conversation of the group in and out.  His group did a little skit, he and two or three others who were with his group.  But then, years later when Joe and the other original group were trying to get into the PGA [Professional Golfers' Association], they came out here, and my wife [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] was a stringer for the Defender [Chicago Defender] at that time, and she got a telegram to interview Joe Louis, and Joe remembered the incident on the Queen Elizabeth.
Story_ID: 532450
Speaker 1: You're on the boat [RMS Queen Elizabeth] and you're going--where are you all on your way to?
Speaker 2: France.  And we get to Saint-Lo [France], we get to France, and--actually, no, we were on our way to England.  We were England first.  And we stayed in England about three months before the invasion.  And we were on Omaha Beach when it--when we landed.
Speaker 1: So, you're there and you're over actually in combat now.  Who, who is--who is the general?
Speaker 2: George Patton [George S. Patton].
Speaker 1: Did, did you ever see Patton, actually see Patton?
Speaker 2: I saw Patton twice.  Saw him once in England in a huge field where he had all the troops talking about the invasion.  And the thing that struck me, Patton had a soprano voice, and he had this high voice and--the second time I saw him, he was in his jeep going through our--where our company was.
Speaker 1: Did you see any actual combat?  Did you have to be involved in any of that?
Speaker 2: No, not--well, our company was stationed behind the infantry and in front of the artillery.  Artillery is shooting over us and, and one time, we got too far ahead and we came--we--our trucks and jeeps were rolled up and a Frenchman came out and said, "They went that way, they went that way."  We--they were talking about the Germans.  We didn't know we were that close.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your job?  What was your particular job there?  You said you--
Speaker 2: I was a master sergeant, and my job was like company clerk, to keep up with all the ammunition, to keep it stored properly so we could pick it up.  And Patton moved so fast there, by the time we got ammunition on the ground, we were picking it back up again, putting it on the truck.  So, I devised a means, instead of taking it off the trucks, just bring the trucks up and leave the ammunition on it and transfer it from the trucks to the--an infantry artillery company who was coming to get it, which made it a whole lot faster.
Speaker 1: So, now you stayed in the [U.S.] Army.  The war [World War II, WWII] ended and you stayed in the Army for how much longer?
Speaker 2: The war ended and we were in France.  We had--we'd been up into Germany, in Belgium, Battle of the Bulge and all of that.  My first sergeant, Bob Gregory from Fort Worth [Texas], was an avid reader of the daily record and he said that if a soldier had left his girlfriend pregnant that he should be allowed to go home to marry.  So, we had one case like that, our staff sergeant from New Jersey.  So, Bob requisitioned for him to go back and they--the company turned it down, but you had to go to the next higher level, so the battalion turned it down, and it all went to Army.  Army approved it and this guy went back home and got married.  He died a couple of years ago, but I--we kept in touch and his widow sent me a card not too long ago.  But anyway, that was one of the things that--the men were--after the war was over, we were in an ordnance outfit and it was a black ordnance that took care of ammunition and the white ordnance took care of repair of the vehicles.  Now, the white ordnance could go to a dump and get their brandy and bring it back and sell it to the black ordnance, and they'd sell us maybe ten, twelve dollars a bottle.  So, I found out where they were getting it and I tried to get a, a truck for us to get it, and I found out that we could get it for a dollar or two dollars where we'd been paying ten dollars.  So, I made a collection from the guys this time and the one's that been getting two or three bottles got ten.  We spent the rest, most of the rest of the time just--
Speaker 1: Were there any artistic endeavors during that time period that you did in the Army?
Speaker 2: My special service officer had read my 201 file and he came back and said, "You can do so damn much," that he'd seen the thing about the theater in New York [New York] and the other things, he said, "We'll put on a show for the men."
Story_ID: 532451
Speaker 1: So, you're sergeant.  After the war [World War II, WWII] is over--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you've been doing different things and the--he reads your file.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what does he discover?
Speaker 2: He sees I've been active in a lot of things, and in theater in particular.  He said to put on a show for the men.  Well, one of the big things at that time was fraternizing with the Germans.  That was forbidden.  And you lose--you get--you gain points for being good and doing things and you lose points, too.  After you got so many points, you'd be--you could get out of the [U.S.] Army.  And--but if you fraternize with the Germans, you lose points.  So, I used that as the theme and developed a production called 'Two Points Shy' [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby].  One of our characters who was a dancer, he was a jitterbug as such, and the story is that he was caught--he had enough points to get out of the Army, but he was caught fraternizing with the Germans and lost his points.  So we called it 'Two Points Shy.'  And we had--we had a number of, of musicians.  The main one who would take ideas and put it into a song and such, a guy named Sonny White who had done the early, the piano background for Billie Holiday.  And then we had a couple of guys from St. Louis [Missouri] who taught music there, and I built it around these guys and a sad sack who had lost his two points, and we put on a show.  We made the scenery out of parachutes and other kind of fabric that we had and it went over big.  And then we were asked to put it on with another company and we were in Furth, Germany, and it looked like the people are hanging off the rafters.  They were--and after we got back, I got--I showed Mark [ph.] a letter that I had got inviting us to do a five week run in another Army post which we already left, left by that time.
Speaker 1: So, the play is very successful at this point.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: And, and did you receive extra points because of your work with the play?
Speaker 2: I got some letters of commendation, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And were there any other awards or medals that you got in the Army?
Speaker 2: I was recommended for a Bronze Star [Bronze Star Medal] but never got it and--but that's--that was from an accident we had, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's 1942, somewhere around that time period?
Speaker 2: That's when I went in, '42 [1942], came out in '45 [1945].
Story_ID: 532452
Speaker 1: While you were in the [U.S.] Army, you got married?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you married Miss Rosalyn Thomasena Marshall [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what was she doing at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, she had been teaching chemistry at Barber-Scotia [Barber-Scotia Junior College; Barber-Scotia College, Concord, North Carolina].  And I had talked her into coming down to visit me here at Camp Rucker [Fort Rucker, Alabama].  She said she thought I told her her name wouldn't be the same if she came back, couldn't remember that part.  But then when she got tired and ready to go, I was afraid for her to leave.  I was afraid I'd lose her and I wasn't ready to get married, so I've got a wedding--I got a marriage certificate and I suspect every--all the information is wrong because--and then I talked to the chaplain on the post and set it up and I had my buddy, Bob Gregory and his wife, they knew about it.  But it was supposed to be a surprise for Tommy.  She wasn't supposed to know she was getting married.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, she comes on--so, she comes to the base just to see you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--well, she had been there for a week.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She's there and she has no clue of what's going on.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't think she did, but then I found out that she--while I was asleep, she had seen all of that in a folder that I had on the--so, she was aware, but I wasn't aware that she was aware 'cause I told her we were going to the show, and when we got to the sidewalk where walk--crossed, one going to the chapel and one going to the show.  She and her friend took the path to the chapel.  That's when I knew that she knew she was going to get married (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you got married in 1943.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you stayed in the Army a few more years, 'til '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: 'Til '45 [1945], yeah.
Speaker 1: And then, the family expanded?  Or what happened in '45 [1945]?
Speaker 2: In '45 [1945], well, when I went overseas, Tommy was pregnant for our first child in '43 [1943].  Eugene [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby III] was born in '43 [1943].  And then when I came back in '45 [1945], I had a job briefly at the Barber-Scotia but the teacher was on leave and wanted to come back.  I got some other jobs.  I was waiting tables at the Boar's Head.  I was working with the silkscreens, post shop, and I was doing a lot of other things to make it.  And, and then I got--I applied to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] and Alabama State [State Teachers College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], and I could've taken a job at either one for $1400, and W.A. Robinson, who had been the principal of Lab High School [Atlanta University Laboratory High School] in Atlanta [Georgia] when I taught Hale Woodruff's classes, had come to Phoenix [Arizona] at Carver High School [George Washington Carver High School].  And he kept writing me to come to Phoenix, and I didn't know where Phoenix was and I didn't wanna go.  But when he sent me a contract for $2800, twice what they offered me in the other, we packed up and came to Phoenix.
Speaker 1: And what was your job gonna be in Phoenix?  Where would you be working?
Speaker 2: At Carver High School, teaching at Carver High School.  And our youngest son had just been born, so--
Speaker 1: And his name--his name is?
Speaker 2: Marshall [HistoryMaker Marshall Grigsby].
Story_ID: 532453
Speaker 1: So, it's about '45 [1945], '46 [1946] now, you're on your way to Phoenix [Arizona].
Speaker 2: Right, 1946.
Speaker 1: And you're gonna be an art teacher.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that experience.  You come to school, you come to Phoenix, you have a new job.  How was it being in Phoenix at that time?
Speaker 2: Hot.  I didn't realize what kind of temperature there was in Phoenix and when--and the plane we left Charlotte [North Carolina] on transferred in Memphis [Tennessee], landed in Tucson [Arizona] but the airport here wasn't big enough to take that big plane, so we had to come in on a little plane.  So--and when I got--when I met Robinson [W.A. Robinson] there, I got off the plane, I thought I was in hell.  The--because that was in August.
Speaker 1: So, how was Phoenix's racial climate?  Was it still segregated at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, you had a black high school, the only place that black students like [HistoryMaker] Coy Payne could go to, so--
Speaker 1: Who else was on that faculty at that point?
Speaker 2: Arlena Seneca, who was a biologist and who was a fantastic person, who was working on her doctorate.  And Joe Flipper [Joseph Simeon Flipper II] who was a math teacher who had come here from Winston-Salem [North Carolina], and who was a basketball coach.  And then we had a number of--came after, Betty Fairfax who was just honored for giving--well, Betty Fairfax is still teaching.
Speaker 1: And for the sake of our viewers, who was the principal again?
Speaker 2: W.A. Robinson who was the man that came here.  Carver High School [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona] was similar to Second Ward High School [Charlotte, North Carolina] when dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] took it over.  Carver High School, even though it had some of this luminaries around but still accepted secondhand uniforms for football from sec- from Phoenix Union [Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona] except the secondhand books, but Robinson wouldn't have that.  He had to have first, firsthand everything.  In fact, Carver was the first school in the state where all the teachers had their master's [degrees] mainly because W.A. Robinson went out and brought them in like he brought me in.
Speaker 1: Now, was there an art department at the school when you got there?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So you started the art department?
Speaker 2: Had to start it, yes.
Speaker 1: And how was that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, there weren't many students taking art and Mr. Robinson said if you don't have enough--more students, you'll have to teach another class like English.  And I thought (laughter)--I thought about--and I said, "No," and the next person that came by, I said, "Don't you wanna take art?"  He said, "No."  And I said, "You got to take art."  I finally conned him into taking a class in art.  I figured if he--if I got him in there, then I'd have enough to keep the class.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And--but, after the guy, I said, I promised he could drop out if he didn't like it.  So, second week came around and he wanted to drop and I said, "No, you try--you said you would try something."  So, the first day in the class, he came up and threw a drawing on my desk and said, "I still don't like it," and the next day he did the same, "I don't like it."  He did that every day 'til Friday.  Then he saw me pouring plaster into a milk container and he said, "What are you gonna do with it?"  And I said, "We carve it."  I wrote a story saying that this kid loved to carve on desks and fellow classmates, so he wanted to take it home.  He took it home, he came back Monday with a figure that he had carved.  Never asked to get out of class anymore.  In fact, over the years, he--well, he joined the [U.S.] Army, dropped out of school, joined the Army, and came back only in about less than a year, and he had sergeant stripes.  I said, "How'd you get advanced so fast?"  He said, well, he worked with the major and he did ice sculpture.  He did ice sculpture.  And then when he got out of the Army, he was doing ice sculpture for hotels where he could say--he could make a thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Edward Judy [ph.].
Story_ID: 532454
Speaker 1: Were there any more students that stand out in your mind there that--who went on to be great artists?
Speaker 2: One that I'm work- I'm doing an article for the International Review for African American Art on now is Rip Woods [Roosevelt "Rip" Woods].
Speaker 1: Tell us about him.
Speaker 2: Rip was in that first class, in the--and he was a student who was very creative, and I said--and he could do more in a week than the rest of the class could do in two or three weeks.  And he spent time in creative confusion while he's waiting on the rest of them to catch up.  And so I saw he needed to have something to challenge him.  So I had him to do a mural on George Washington Carver.  And we had moved in another building and he was able to do a mural that was ten foot long and eight feet high on the life of George Washington Carver, and which he found out things on the search from Carver that I had never known before.  So--but anyway, and to fast forward, Rip came out of Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona] and he went to college and got his master's [at Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona].  He had worked as a custodian for the district, but then when he got his master's [degree], he put the broom down and started teaching and became one of the major teachers.  Then, he went to the college as a professor even before I did and talked me into accepting the--a role at Arizona State.
Speaker 1: Rip Woods.  Now, were there any other artists in the area that, that you used to inspire the students, black or white?  Was anybody else--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, there were--there were quite a few.
Speaker 1: Any names of note that you could share with us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and one is Frank Lloyd Wright.  He came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The art--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came over and talked to the students.  Then, there were other artists, local artists who participated, John Waddell [John Henry Waddell].
Speaker 1: Now, this is 1949 or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Had Frank Lloyd Wright reached his pinnacle?  Had he done a lot of his buildings yet or was he just now starting to get--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, he was at his pinnacle, yeah.  The--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How was his reception from your students when they saw him in their classroom?
Speaker 2: Great, yeah.
Story_ID: 532455
Speaker 1: At this point, you're an art teacher.  How's your personal art life going?  Are you doing work and releasing?  Are you having shows?
Speaker 2: Gradually, I'm having a few, yeah, um-hm.  I'm doing some painting.
Speaker 1: Are you selling any pieces now or?
Speaker 2: Very little.  And I--most of my energy has been going into teaching and I haven't depended on art sales for a living or even to augment myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you're--are you joining any organizations?  Are you starting on becoming a part of any national things, national groups or anything?
Speaker 2: As a part of my teaching, I got involved with the National Art Education Association and was very active locally and nationally.  In fact, I spoke at the second conference, national conference, and later on, that led to me being elected.  It was--my first election was as president of Pacific Arts Association, which is a part of the national, but then they consolidated and made the regional presidents, vice president of the national, so I became vice president of the National Art Education Association.
Speaker 1: So, how long did you stay at Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona]?
Speaker 2: Until they closed in 1954.
Speaker 1: Okay, '54 [1954], they closed the school.  What was the reason for the school closing?
Speaker 2: The scuttlebutt was Car- Robinson [W.A. Robinson] made Carver too expensive for--because he didn't accept any--well, he left it to us, really.  Since I was the first art teacher, I had the best of equipment.  I had the first high fire gas kiln, the first high fire electric kiln in the state.  I had a press camera.  I had the first 35mm see through camera in the high school.  And we did silkscreen and I had weaving and painting, naturally.  Then, I had jewelry, all of it being taught in this one room, really.  And the same thing is true with the other areas.  Biology teacher had all kind of equipment so that--the math teacher, the--when we first came, athletes, basketball, football could only compete with the Indian [Native American] school or YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] team.  But Carver--Mr. Robinson wouldn't take that kind of relationship, so he managed to, to get the athletic teams in the major conference.  And when Carver closed, Carver football team was tops in the state, basketball team was tops in the state, and each of the activities, athletic activities were tops.  So, Carver High School was an embarrassment to some of the others because of what was being produced.  But, there was a group of black and white who instituted a lawsuit to desegregate the schools, and this came about before the Brown decision did.
Speaker 1: In '54 [1954], was the Brown--
Speaker 2: In '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.  But that was--that was the story of Carver.
Speaker 1: So, it just closed and, and what did you do?  What was your next--your next position?
Speaker 2: Well, Robinson insisted on teachers--the teachers at Carver being spread around to other high schools so that this--if they all went to one school, there would be a stigma, so they were scattered to all of the existing schools.
Story_ID: 532456
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to Phoenix Union High School [Phoenix, Arizona].  Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona] had a, a student body of about four hundred, and I had classes of eight, ten and twelve, and some were double periods.  Phoenix Union had six thousand students, and I had classes of thirty-six and forty, and a matter of having to adjust and be able to operate with that size class.
Speaker 1: So, how long did you stay at Phoenix Union?
Speaker 2: I stayed there until 1988--no, 1966.  From '54 [1954] to '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: And, and were you in charge of the art department there also?
Speaker 2: At Phoenix Union?  Yes, and when they closed.  When I first went over there, the principal identified a colleague as the chairman of the department, but there was an assistant principal here from Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] who said that's not right.  I had a master's [degree] and I had all this background, more so than the other person.  So, I wasn't trying to head the department because that's more work, but he asked me if I would take it.  And I said, "I'm not pushing for it," but he said, "Will you take it if you--if it's made--if it's given to you?"  I said, "I'll take it."  So, the principal had to change the man he had selected as chairman of the department and make me chairman, so you can see--
Speaker 1: Now, during this time when that's going on, there's a lot of racial things that are changing in Phoenix [Arizona] around that time, '54 [1954], '55 [1955].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Things are changing up, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, '54 [1954], '55 [1955], you're making decent money now I would imagine.  Are you--your salary is pretty stable now?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you and Thomasena [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] have been married now for about, what?  How many years were you married at this point?
Speaker 2: At that time?  See, we were married in '43 [1943], '43 [1943] to '53 [1953] would be ten years.
Speaker 1: So, so about twelve years.  And, and, and did you all--did you all--where were you all living at this point?  So, you were living in Phoenix, but where were you living?
Speaker 2: In 1953, I think we were living on 12th Street, 9 North 12th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: Until they tore the house down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we moved over here until 1956.  We moved in this place in '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: And what--in that time period, did--in Phoenix, was house purchasing for African Americans an easy proposition?  Was it easy for you to buy a house in those times?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  In fact, we were the first family to move north of Van Buren Street, first black family.  And this house had been sold to a dog, had been left to a dog.  And--
Speaker 1: The house was left to a dog, Mr. Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This house had been left to a dog.  And the man in charge was in California, but there was a blind lawyer here who was in charge and once we had come to look at it, he said, "Now don't go back looking around until you decide--until it's yours because if the neighbors see you, they might try to buy it out from under you."  This house had to be sold for the appraised value, which I think was, was six thousand dollars.  And, so--
Speaker 1: So, so you seem to always be multitasking.  Did you have any other jobs in the--in the mid to late '50s [1950s] in art besides Phoenix?  Were you doing anything else?  Did you teach anywhere else at that time?
Speaker 2: I waited tables downtown for--bartended one time during that--during those rough days.  No, I don't think--right now, I can't remember.
Story_ID: 532457
Speaker 1: Your name is circulating now and people know that you're this--you're an art teacher, you've been at Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona], you're now at Phoenix Union [Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona], did you have any aspirations of traveling abroad or going further with your art and getting your personal art more well known or your teaching more well known?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing which I'm proud of, when I became president or vice president of the National Art Education Association, at that time, the regional met alternate years and the national met on alternate years, and the job of the regional president was to put on a conference.  Well, the person who was in charge before me had already identified the conference as being in Hawaii.  And when I was--came on board, I had to put this conference on in, in Hawaii.  I didn't think anybody would come, but it turned out to be one of the top conferences that we had.  And I basically called it a celebration of peoples, and we brought in people from very different ethnic backgrounds and so forth.
Speaker 1: Approximately what year was that?
Speaker 2: I wanna say--I wanna say '58 [1958].  I've got a program.
Speaker 1: Okay, '58 [1958], around that time.  You're in your late thirties going to forties, somewhere around that time period.  Did you do any other travel abroad?  Did you go anywhere else besides Hawaii?
Speaker 2: Not then.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, it wasn't in '58 [1958].  That was before '58 [1958].  In 1958, I had been active with the committee on education, whose director was the educational director of the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York].  Hale Woodruff was very active with that group.  In the--in the meantime, Hale Woodruff had gone to New York, New York University [New York, New York] from Atlanta [Georgia], and I started on my doctorate--doctoral program.  So, Victor D'Amico, who was educational director at Museum of Modern Art had invited Hale to teach in the Brussels World's Fair [Expo 58, Brussels, Belgium], which the Museum of Modern Art had a class.  Hale couldn't go, so he asked me to go.
Speaker 1: To Brussels [Belgium]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I went to Brussels, and that was in 1958.  I taught at the World's Fair.  I taught for three months.
Speaker 1: Were there any, any notable people there while you were there teaching?  Was anybody notable of--
Speaker 2: We--a whole lot of people came through.  The area had little round portholes for parents to look through, but adults--only VIPs could come in, and--Princess Grace [Grace Kelly] and--
Speaker 1: Princess Grace of Monaco?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and her husband [Rainier III] came through, but she didn't bring the kids, so there was an article in Paris [France]--one of the French news magazines, showing me shaking a finger in her face to make something to take care--take to the kids.
Story_ID: 532458
Speaker 1: Then, we were being shipped back home where we--to the--to Marseille [France] for--to get on the ship.  And we were sitting there waiting and I found out there was an art school.
Speaker 2: What was the name of that school?
Speaker 1: Ecole des Beaux Arts [L'Ecole Superieure des Beaux Arts] in Marseille.  So I went and applied.  So, I was accepted and there were two or three other G.I.s, but I was the only one that spoke French, so I was the interpreter.  But, one reason I wanted to go to this art school because I figured they had some pretty mommas, these French mommas.  Turned out, the first week we had an old man who was the model and the next week we had the same old man (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And the next week (laughter).  So--but anyway, I did do some drawing, do some work there at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.
Speaker 2: Where did you learn French?
Speaker 1: My French was in high--first French was in high school [Second Ward High School, Charlotte, North Carolina].  Then, I almost had a minor in French at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  In fact, I may have had a French class.  I--oh, I did at, at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina].  I took French first semester and the French teacher, Jean-Jacques Adame [ph.], was from one of the islands.  He had a Legion of Honour ribbon.  And I learned his French 'cause I could hardly understand his English.  Did very well that semester.  Next semester, I enrolled in French and English under the same person, and Forest Wiggins had a wreck in which he broke his leg in several places, his wife broke her neck.  He was my French teacher and my English teacher.  I practically threw away my English book, I didn't think I needed it 'cause we lived a block away and my, my cousin who lived with us, did all the cooking.  I ran errands and took care of them and I thought that would take the place of a grade (laughter).  But, I think I flunked the English (laughter) and I barely made it--but the French, our French text was Descartes [Rene Descartes], so--which was philosophy instead of the usual beginning second semester of French.
Speaker 2: You all used Descartes as your text?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  (Speaking French) Je pense, donc je suis (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oui.
Speaker 1: So, I had that background and then when I got into France, I made friends with a lot of French males and females, mostly females, and I improved my French there.
Speaker 2: Now, you're in France at this point and you've been in the [U.S.] Army and you've seen some, the Battle of the Bulge, you've been under General Patton [George S. Patton], and you've, you've done this great play, 'Two Points Shy' [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby], and now you're in Marseille and you're in art school.  What was their reaction when you walked in the door and said that you wanted to be in their French art school?
Speaker 1: You know, I don't know--don't remember any kind of reaction there because it was more like I'm one of the soldiers who wants to take a class, and there were three or four other soldiers and I don't think they distinguished me from the white soldiers.  So--but I think the distinguishing part was my being able to tell the white soldiers what the teacher was talking about, and that kind of interpretation.
Speaker 2: Where were you in your mind in your artistic development at that point in your art?  What was--what medium were you most comfortable with at that point and what were you trying to learn there actually?
Speaker 1: Going into art school, learning whatever--what is--whatever is available, mainly techniques in drawing and painting.  I never got into any painting there, but I did get into drawing.
Speaker 2: And at that point, was drawing your main focus, and not doing any sculptures, or is drawing just--
Speaker 1: Yeah, just drawing and painting, no, no sculpture.
Speaker 2: Now, how long did you stay there at that school?
Speaker 1: Oh, we were there about six weeks I think, maybe a couple of months.
Speaker 2: And was there anything there that truly influenced you in a big way you think that helped you later in your life, anything that you learned?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Do you recall any of the teachers' names that were there?
Speaker 1: No.  Only the old man who was the model (laughter).
Story_ID: 532459
Speaker 1: So after you left there, was it time to come back to the states, or where did you go?
Speaker 2: We left there and boarded a ship called the Jolly Walter Ranger [Walter E. Ranger].  When we went overseas, we went over on the Queen Elizabeth [RMS Queen Elizabeth].  We came back on the Jolly Walter Ranger.  There were ten thousand on board Queen Elizabeth, and I guess there were three hundred on the Walter Ranger coming back.  But I was made assistant entertainment officer, whatever it was called, and got a commendation for that.  We--and we put on some shows to keep the men involved because we went over in four days and I think it may have been taking four weeks to get back on this little ship.
Speaker 1: So, now you're on your way back and you're thinking--well, you're also married at this time and your wife's [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] in Charlotte [North Carolina] and you're on your way back.  Did you have plans or--any plans for the next step of your life now?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: And what, what might that have been?  What year was this by chance?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-five [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had it all drawn out.  When I got back, I was gonna have a group and I was gonna open a nightclub in New Jersey with a band and a (laughter)-- those were pipe dreams.  So when I get back home, I find my eighteen month old son [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby III] who is learning me.  I find I don't have a job, anything, and finally, I got a job where my wife had been teaching at Barber-Scotia [Barber-Scotia Junior College; Barber-Scotia College, Concord, North Carolina].  The art teacher's on leave, but then she decides to come back.  So I don't have a job anymore.  I've had maybe a semester and then I look around at other jobs.  I worked at a silkscreen shop printing posters, learning how we could do it fast.  Then, I started doing some printing myself for a movie house.  But, I got a job waiting tables at the Boar's Head and made more there.  I signed on as art editor for a newspaper, black newspaper that was being formed and someplace in there I think I have one of my drawings hanging on the wall from that newspaper.
Speaker 1: Do you recall the name of the newspaper, the black paper that you drew for?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  All I know is Trezzvant Anderson was the editor and publisher.
Speaker 1: At this point, is art a ways for you to make money or is art just your passion at this point?  How are you viewing art, your art?
Speaker 2: My art is doing whatever I can with it.  I'm not making money.  I'm not producing anything, really.
Speaker 1: So, this is about '47 [1947]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  No, that's--this is '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 2: Forty-six [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your next move, Mr. Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby]?
Speaker 2: My next move was to come to Phoenix [Arizona].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I didn't have a job, and I had taught at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] before going in the [U.S.] Army.  I applied and was offered a job making $1400 a year.  Then, in my senior year at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], I had taught two of Hale Woodruff's classes and the principal at the school [Atlanta University Laboratory High School, Atlanta, Georgia] was W.A. Robinson.  Robinson had gone to Phoenix [Arizona] to head a school called Carver High School [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona], and he wrote, invited me to come, but--and I didn't know where Phoenix was.  In fact, I had heard of Phoenix one time.  There was a riot.  One of my high school classmates, they were rioting in Phoenix.  That's all I knew about it.  I didn't wanna go.  And--but when I did not respond to Robinson, he sent a contract and the contract was $2800, twice what Smith had offered.  So, we packed up and came to Phoenix.  That was in 1946.  When I came out of the Army, our youngest son [HistoryMaker Marshall Grigsby] was born nine months after I came out of the Army.  My wife had a absc- a breast abscess and could not travel when I left, so I left Charlotte and changed planes in Memphis [Tennessee] on a (unclear) plane.  And we--from Memphis, we went to Tucson [Arizona] because that plane couldn't land in Phoenix because it--the airport wasn't big enough, so, Robinson met me at the airport in August and I thought I was in hell when I got out.
Story_ID: 532460
Speaker 1: That's why I came to Phoenix [Arizona] and started.  That was--and my family came two months later, November.
Speaker 2: I've heard a lot about Mr. Robinson [W.A. Robinson].  I've seen his pictures, he's like a very stern man.  And, and how was the school experience with him at Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona]?
Speaker 1: I think I may have told you that Robinson brought teachers in from across the country, all of whom had at least their master's [degree], first high school in the state where all the teachers had their master's.  Robinson was the essential educator.  He was a strict educator.  In fact, many of the teachers would get upset with Robinson because he didn't hesitate to come into your classroom and tell you how to teach.  He had faculty meetings, but now they have faculty meetings during school time.  Robinson had his faculty meetings after school, so it was after four o'clock, and it may last two or three hours.  I gave a student punishment for something.  I had her to clean a sink as punishment.  Robinson called me in and gave me hell.  He said, "What kind of attitude would the kid develop about cleanup if she related it to punishment?"  So, he was that kind of person.
Speaker 2: How did you feel about that comment?  Did you agree with him or did you think about it and say, well maybe he's right?
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought he was right, yeah, yeah.  In fact, I--later on at Phoenix Union [Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona], I was--developed an attitude among students to the point where they would come and ask me for material to clean the sink.
Speaker 2: So, is--you stayed--you, you got there and arrived in when, about 1950?  What year was that when you got to Carver?
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-six [1946].
Speaker 2: Forty-six [1946] at Carver.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946] to '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: To '54 [1954].  And the school closed in 1954, correct?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, during that time period, we mentioned previously that you had some students like Rip Woods [Roosevelt "Rip" Woods].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And some students that have gone on to do great things in the art world.  But you yourself also over the years up to that point had met many great artists yourself who are very prominent now like Bearden [Romare Bearden].  You also had Frank Lloyd Wright come speak to your classes that you told us previously.  What is all this doing for you now as an artist?  With all these different influences that you're coming in.  Now you're seeing students.  You're teaching now and now you're in the position that Mr. Hale Woodruff was in.  You're kind of like a protege of his now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: How are you feeling now?
Speaker 1: You know, at that time, you don't think, you don't feel in those context.  When you reflect back over the years, you feel that you were gradually growing and maybe making some contribution, maybe not only as artists but as an art educator, and I think my main contributions at that time and in later were as an art educator more so than as an artist.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you've had a dichotomy.  You have been a commercial artist also but yet and still education has been your--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Would you call education, art education your passion?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I've never been a commercial artist.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When I say commercial, I mean to--having pieces that are available for purchase.
Speaker 1: Right, well that, we call that fine artists (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fine artists.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Whereas the commercial artists, the person who is selling is working magazines and promoting in that sense.
Story_ID: 532461
Speaker 1: So '54 [1954], Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona] closes, and then what happens at that point for you?
Speaker 2: I go to Phoenix Union [Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Carver was at four hundred students; Phoenix Union was six thousand.  And where I had twelve and eighteen students in a class, I got thirty-five and forty, so I've got to reorganize my thinking, my way of working so that I can reach them.  And my philosophy as I look back over the way I taught is that each student is equal to a class, so at Carver, in one--I would have say twelve students, like twelve--class, because they're different people.  And in art, to be unique and different instead of to be mass is the important thing.  So, I worked out, and I can show you some of the things that I've kept.  But I worked out a means in which each student would develop his plan of work, what that individual is going to do and how they were going to do it, materials they're gonna use, and the reasons were why they're doing it.  And each day, they make a list of what they did to accomplish what they plan to do.  Now, my job is to, to kind--to direct, to assist and to see that they are doing what they said they were gonna do.  So, which meant that I had to see what they planned to do and that was their assignment over the weekend, to come in with their plan.  My job was to look at what they planned to do, make suggestions, corrections, and then each day--first of all, to see that they had materials to work with and then each day to see that they had done something in terms of what they plan to do.
Speaker 1: So, you would call your curriculum student based and individual based.  You would look at each person and allow them to be themselves.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Instead of forcing one opinion.  Is that what you're saying, Mr. Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby]?
Speaker 2: Exactly, um-hm.  And, see, Rip Woods [Roosevelt "Rip" Woods] taught me that--at Carver, Rip could make, would do more in a week than the rest of the class could do in two or three weeks.  That's when I had everybody working on the same thing, so some people would finish early and some would finish late.  Rip would go around needling people, creating all kind of funny things and in order to get him off of that, I had to get him something specific to do, so I gave him his assignment to do a mural on the life of George Washington Carver.  He worked with the English teacher and other than he did research.  He found out that Carver wanted to take art when he went to University of Illinois--Iowa [Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm; Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa], but they wouldn't let him in art.  They sent him to agriculture.  So as a result, he became a great agriculturist.  He would've become a great artist.  In fact, they let him take an art class in his senior year and he submitted three paintings to the World's Fair [World's Columbian Exposition] in Chicago [Illinois] in 1870 [sic. 1893] I believe and got honorable mention.  But then when he went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], his work primarily was in agriculture, but he made paints from peanuts and his other research.  But anyway, that's where I first really got off having everybody working on the same thing, have each student develop something of their own.  It was a job--it required a lot more energy as a teacher when I got thirty people to do that, thirty in a class and five classes, so that's 150 people a day.  So, which means that on the spare time, free periods, I'm looking through the student folders.  After school, when I come home, after dinner, I go back to school and go through folders.  On Saturdays and Sundays, I'm down there going through, following each one of these kids.
Story_ID: 532462
Speaker 1: Now, what is Mrs. Grigsby [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] saying about all of this at that time?
Speaker 2: She's not really complaining about it 'cause she's doing the same thing with her classes.
Speaker 1: And she was teaching at what school?
Speaker 2: She was--she was teaching at Carl Hayden [Carl Hayden Community High School, Phoenix, Arizona].  Then, when I went to ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona], she taught at Phoenix Union [Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona].  We did an article together for one of the art magazines on combining art and biology, and how the two could work together in terms of teaching.
Speaker 1: So, there were two teachers in one household, both doing their own thing.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And how many children were present now at this time?
Speaker 2: Two [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby III and HistoryMaker Marshall Grigsby].
Speaker 1: And you all managed to work that out.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, two boys.
Speaker 1: And, so now it's fifty--year--it's about '55 [1955], now you're at Phoenix Union and you were there, there at Phoenix Union for how long?
Speaker 2: From '54 [1954] to '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954] to '66 [1966].
Story_ID: 532463
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-nine [1949], '50 [1950].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had--you don't mind if I back up a little bit?
Speaker 2: Sure, go right ahead.
Speaker 1: When we first came out here, the first summer, I had to take some classes for--to get a cert- teaching certificate because when I finished college, I refused student teaching because I didn't wanna teach.  I only took a class, an education class at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  So when I got here, I was still deficient so far as the state certification so I had to take a class.  But that second summer, I went back to Charlotte [North Carolina] and taught at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina].  And George Brooks [George Benjamin Brooks, Sr.], who was minister at Southminster Presbyterian Church [Phoenix, Arizona], was in my class at--he was a student at Johnson C. Smith at the time and I think you--Campbell [HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Donald Campbell] possibly took you to his church this morning.  But anyway, in the meantime, I had done other jobs around time, waited tables and so forth, bartended.  But, somebody told me I could make a thousand dollars pitching watermelons in Blythe, California.  So, the third summer, I went to Blythe to pitch watermelon.  Travis Williams, who you may or may not have met here, who was a city administrator, was there with me, so that's how conversations were when we meet.  They told us you could make a thousand dollars, but the persons making a thousand dollars had a special job of stacking watermelons, and if this load shifted and the watermelons broke, you had--you were required to pay the thousand dollars, so I didn't wanna take that chance.  So, I got on the stacking the--at the passing line.  We made twenty-five cents a ton.  I made fourteen dollars and something one day, so you can imagine how many tons of watermelon I pitched.  So after--at the end of that summer, I told my wife [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] I don't wanna do that anymore.  And the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] was announced, so to take advantage of the G.I. Bill, I was gonna go back to school, but I had to have a higher degree.  And I had a master's [degree].  Well, ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona] didn't offer any more than a master's and no other place in the West.  So as I looked across the country to see where I could spend the government's money on a--on a Ph.D., Columbia University [New York, New York] and New York University [New York, New York] were the two most prominent schools.  Both my mother [Purry Dixon Grigsby] and dad [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] had gone to Columbia, so I said I'd go to Columbia.  So, the first summer, I went to Columbia.  Second summer, I continued.  I could--Columbia required you to take a year in residence.  Family was here.  I couldn't afford to take a year.  Hale Woodruff, in the meantime, had become a professor at New York University.  I get permission one summer to take a class at--mural painting at NYU while I'm still at Columbia under Hale Woodruff.  So, at the end of that summer, I switched from Columbia to NYU.  And--but all, all because I didn't wanna pitch watermelons anymore.  That lasted until '63 [1963].  But anyway--
Speaker 2: So the--so the decision to get your Ph.D. actually came out of watermelons.
Speaker 1: That's right (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tell us--go ahead.
Speaker 1: Then in '66 [1966], oh, working on my Ph.D., I had chosen something about African art as Hale Woodruff had gotten us involved in and I--going through the literature, there's a man named Ian Benson [ph.] at Philadelphia College of Art [The University of the Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] who had done a lot of writing.  And as I traveled, as--when I come back through Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I go by and visit Mr. Benson and tell him what I was doing and probe his understanding of African art and the things that he had written.  Summer of '65 [1965] I think or '64 [1964], Benson was in Phoenix [Arizona] for some reason, and he came by and visited my classroom [at Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona], and he saw what we were doing and how we were working with these individual students and asked if would be willing to come to Philadelphia and talk to his graduate students who were planning to teach about teaching art.
Story_ID: 532464
Speaker 1: We're gonna go back through the '50s [1950s], the end of the '50s [1950s], and were there any, any particular events in the '50s [1950s], late '50s [1950s], that are important that, that we talk about today?  For instance, we do know that you did some World's Fair [Expo 58, Brussels, Belgium] things.
Speaker 2: That was in '58 [1958] and I think we--didn't we talk about the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's go over it again just for a moment.  You, you went to--where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to Brussels [Belgium], and we went there and it was cold.  The fair had just opened.  And Victor D'Amico who was the educational director of the Museum of Modern Art and who had invited me came along in the beginning.  There were three of us.  I was the only one who was not on the regular staff of the Museum of Modern Art in New York [New York].  The--D'Amico had designed two rooms, one in which we brought children in and they had toys that stimulated creativity.  In the next room, they had easels for painting and a big table with all kind of objects on it for construction.  Well, when we got there, there were very few kids around.  So I saw a teacher with about twelve kids walking through, with the boys about ten, twelve years old.  So, I ran out and grabbed them and said, "Come on over here.  Here's something you might be interested in."  So, they came in and it was cold.  They took off their coats and hung them up.  And these were Flemish kids, and they ran around and they were very aggressive.  I thought at once they might tear up some of the toys they had there.  We had one toy that was like a piano but it--as you press the key, you got a color on a screen and you could mix colors with--and they were rambunctious with these.  Finally, went into the second room and sit down to paint.  And they sat down and when they sat down, they pulled the cigarettes out and started--and I said, "Well, no smoking."  At that time, we were smoking and I felt like a hypocrite.
Speaker 1: How old were these children?
Speaker 2: Ten, eleven, twelve years old (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: They were Flemish kids.  And when they left, one of them said to me and I--as he was putting his coat on, he said, (speaking French), "Embrassez-moi."  And I said, what did you say?  And he turned around and demonstrated kiss my ass (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: We had--there were three of us from the United States.  There was a maid to help clean up afterwards, there was a person who went to the various schools to bring in the students, and there was a couple of other people.  There was about five of us in there.  And we had a number of languages covered.  The--so when the kids would enter, we learned to speak to them in their language and we'd determine that by the way they dressed and the conversations they were having.  So, it's, sprichst du Deutsch, it's, parlez-vous francais?  Or somebody in Spanish would speak.  One kid came in and sat down, I said, "You speak English?"  He said, "No."  "Parlez-vous francais?"  "No."  Sprichst du Deutsch?"  "No."  And I called somebody else over to ask him and I was frustrated.  I said, "What in the hell do you speak?"  He said, "I speak American."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And we went to England after that and listened to some of these cockneys, and you couldn't understand what they were saying.  They were speaking English.  So, all those little things really helped me understand.
Story_ID: 532465
Speaker 1: Let me ask you something.  In 1958 when you're at the World's Fair [Expo 58, Brussels, Belgium], back in the states, that's a volatile period.  There's so much stuff going on racially in America.  And it seems as if your life is not insulated but your life is very different at this point.  You're being diverse and--
Speaker 2: Oh, it is.
Speaker 1: --and your things are different and your family is just not in the same paradigm.  What were people saying about you in this neighborhood or in the African American community?
Speaker 2: I don't have the slightest idea.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about yourself at this point?  Did you feel like my life is on a different track?  Or how did you feel?
Speaker 2: I felt it was fascinating and interesting in where I was.  I had a classmate at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Leroy Haynes, we called Roughhouse Haynes, who had been--who had mustered out in the [U.S.] Army, he'd been in the tank corps, but when he--he decided to go to the University of Paris [Paris, France] when he came out, and he met somebody there whose parents owned a restaurant, and the word got around that Roughhouse's family was from Chicago [Illinois], was wealthy.  Actually, they came out of the ghetto.  But, they talked Roughhouse into buying into the restaurant on time.  He bought this restaurant and paid for it within a year and it became a hangout in France, in Paris.  So, when we first went there, Roughhouse would pick us up from the airport and he always had something.  But then, he came to Brussels [Belgium] to visit with me and he brought a friend along whose name I keep forgetting.  He played quartet and modern jazz--played drums in Modern Jazz Quartet.
Speaker 1: He named Connie Kay?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Played drums?
Speaker 2: Played drums.
Speaker 1: It would've been after Connie Kay 'cause you had John Lewis, piano, you had the--you had Percy Heath on bass, Milt Jackson, Tootie Heath [Albert "Tootie" Heath]?  Was it--was it Jame- was it one of those?
Speaker 2: No.  Ah, dammit.
Speaker 1: Was it James Heath [HistoryMaker Jimmy Heath]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And it wasn't Connie Kay?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When he played in the MJQ?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I heard it not too long ago.  Klook?  Was that a--
Speaker 1: Kenny Clarke.
Speaker 2: Kenny Clarke.  Yeah, that's who it was.
Speaker 1: That's absolutely right.  So, he was a friend of Roughhouse's?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Roughhouse brought him to Brussels and stayed a while, and Roughhouse left, he had to stay there, and he went--would go to nightclubs.  And when he was there, we'd go to a nightclub, and everyone knew him and everything was free, and everybody loved him and so forth.  When he left, I'd go to the nightclub, they'd treat me the same way (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, Eugene Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby] hung out with Klook--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and became a star, too.  He didn't play any instruments, but he still was a--was famous on the Parisian scene.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's--yeah, we were--now, this was in Brussels.
Speaker 1: So how long--how long was the fair?  How long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: Three months.
Story_ID: 532466
Speaker 1: So, when it was over, what happened?
Speaker 2: When it was over, my family came over and spent the last few weeks with me there.  Then we decided to travel Europe.  We rented a Volkswagen and went to Amsterdam [the Netherlands], got into one of these, oh I forget what you call these kind of, not homestead, but places, cheap.
Speaker 1: Like a hostel?
Speaker 2: Hostel.  And it was like a second or third story, had steps going straight up.  Unfortunately, I got sick.  I got hepatitis.  They called in a American doctor and said take him home right away.  So, we went back to Brussels [Belgium] where the, the kids [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby III and HistoryMaker Marshall Grigsby] stayed with a Flemish family, went back and stayed with them for a while.  Then, we left there and went to France.
Speaker 1: Now, was this Mrs. Grigsby's [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] first trip abroad?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how--what was her reaction to seeing all of this?
Speaker 2: Well, she just saw where we were more or less and I know in the hotel where I stayed, she tried to--tried her French and the woman told her, said, "Speak English better," and she didn't try French anymore.
Speaker 1: So, that was '58 [1958].  So fifty--'58 [1958], '59 [1959], you kind of traveled around Europe a little bit, huh?
Speaker 2: No, this was just '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause it was just that three months.  We didn't travel around Europe because I had to come back.  I had hepatitis.
Speaker 1: You went back to Brussels.
Speaker 2: Went to Brussels and then went to France.  And Roughhouse [Leroy Haynes] who had had the hepatitis and knew the, the diet, kept us fared with that.  Then, we went to--went to London [England].  I didn't mention it earlier.  There was at Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona] an Englishman who was in education, was traveling to the United States observing teachers who had come from England in exchange.  And somebody told him to come to Carver.  Well, when he said he wanted to go to Carver, the administrator said, "You don't wanna go down there."  It's--but he insisted.  And he came to Carver, and he looked around and, well, it was bedlam.  You know, I had people doing all kind of things in different ways.  He said, "It's the most exciting school I've been into since I've been in America."  His name was Francis Cameron.  I said, "Don't tell me, tell my principal."  So he told Mr. Robinson [W.A. Robinson] and Mr. Robinson said, "Don't tell him, tell the superintendent."  But anyway, we stopped with Cameron in London.  He was heading a--basically a private high school.  I can't think of the name of the, the name of the school.  But they took us in and there was a Henry Moore sculpture in the--in the yard of this high school, but he'd--he had had the hepatitis and knew the diet, so they took care of us.
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you, you have a network of friends actually in Europe already.  You had Roughhouse and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you had this gentleman, so you had people to actually kind of associate with--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when you went to these places.  So, how long did you stay in London?
Speaker 2: About a week.
Speaker 1: And then what happened?
Speaker 2: And then we came home.
Story_ID: 532467
Speaker 1: So it's about 1959, you came back home.  Is it '59 [1959] yet?
Speaker 2: No, it's not.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's still '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Still '58 [1958] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You come back home, and you're recuperating from the illness [hepatitis].
Speaker 2: Right, and my wife [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] doesn't want me to go to Charlotte [North Carolina] 'cause she didn't want my mother [Purry Dixon Grigsby] to see how emaciated I was.  So we stopped in New Haven [Connecticut] with my sister [Miriam Grigsby Bates] and then come on back--come back to Phoenix [Arizona].  We stopped with Elton Thacksetter [sic. Elton Clay Fax], do you know that name?
Speaker 1: No, sir.
Speaker 2: He's a major illustrator.  And we go to the airport, American Airlines, and put our bags in the, the little cubicle so--we were leaving the next morning for a flight, the bags would be right there, we could get on the plane.  So when we, we go to American Airlines that morning for the flight, present our tickets at LaGuardia [LaGuardia Airport, New York, New York].  And the clerk said, "I'm sorry, that flight goes out of JFK [Idlewild Airport; John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York]," so we had to pick up our bags and rush to a taxi, threw the bags in and we said, "JFK."  The taxi said I don't know where that is (laughter).  So we get another, we get to JFK, and they say, well, that plane is already taxiing out on the runway.  They stopped the plane, they threw the bags.  My wife was--packed in fourteen little bags so we could carry them instead of big bags.  They threw all these bags in there, they didn't charge us for (laughter) baggage and that's how we came back to Phoenix.
Speaker 1: So you fly out of JFK.  Now this illustrator you mentioned, you, you spent some time with him while you were--
Speaker 2: Spent the night.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had been--he had been an advisor, a good friend when I was in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Now, at this point--you're a known educator at this point.  People know you from Car- especially in the Phoenix area 'cause you worked with a lot of students.  Is your name spreading now as far as educator and artist across country and across national lines?
Speaker 2: This is 1958, I guess you might say that.  I'm trying to think.  No, it's later when I become vice president of NAEA [National Art Education Association].  I was involved with national art education and also with the committee on art education which was out of Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York].  And I'm known by a number of people who were educators, yeah.
Story_ID: 532468
Speaker 1: So, we're going through '59 [1959].  What happened in 1959 for you?
Speaker 2: I don't remember any specific thing in '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we're going up into the '60s [1960s] and this is when I was--Cameron [Francis Cameron] had gone then.  But I was telling you about the African man who was the scholar in African art.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Came to visit Phoenix Union [Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona] and he saw--he wanted me to come to Philadelphia College of Art [The University of the Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and talk to his teachers.  When I got the letter to invite me, he said he had recommended to his board that I be given an honorary doctorate of fine arts at the Philadelphia College of Art.  So, that happened in 1966.
Speaker 1: So between '60 [1960] and '66 [1966], you were still teaching at Phoenix Union.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But what, what else was going on with you artistically during that time period?
Speaker 2: I was submitting work to various exhibits, but nothing spectacular.
Speaker 1: Is anybody asking you now, are you being solicited for your work at all at this time also?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.
Speaker 1: So between '60 [1960] and sixty--so a big--we'll call it a big opportunity arose in '66 [1966] to go speak to the students at Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Well, no I didn't go speak to the students.  I became one of three people receiving an honorary doctorate of fine arts.  Edward Hopper was another one.  Now, Edward Hopper was perhaps top rated artist of the country, a primarily watercolorist, has works in all the major museums.  And I'm receiving this as an art educator and he's receiving this as an artist.  And one other thing happened I'm not sure which is in '66 [1966], too.  The National Gallery of Art [Washington, D.C.] celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary by giving twenty-five awards to artists, art educators, art historians.  And I'm included in one of those and these were--these were given at the White House [Washington, D.C.].  That's where the picture with Lady Bird Johnson came in.  There were twenty-five of us, and I gather you got a list of all the others.
Speaker 1: Now, now was this an award and a monetary award also?  Did all of you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think we got five hundred dollars along with--a major sculpture had done the--sculptor had done the award which is up in the other room.
Speaker 1: So, now you're here in Phoenix [Arizona] and you're getting some national notoriety at this point.  You're getting--you're getting all kind of awards.  As this gentleman came to the school, so you think he saw, he was so impressed that he said this man has to have a Ph.D. from this school?  Is that what you think happened to get you to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that.
Speaker 1: But now, when this was happening, did you think that what you were doing was really novel or was it--
Speaker 2: No, I just thought I was--I thought I was doing my job, doing what I felt was necessary.  And my philosophy was that where, where there's no learning, there's no teaching, so--
Speaker 1: Now, in '66 [1966], these awards are coming in and you--at this point--do you leave Phoenix Union at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, you see, I kept on working on my doctorate at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] and finally got that in '63 [1963].  Now, I'm still at Phoenix Union in '64 [1964], '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: And now you're Dr. Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby].
Speaker 2: Yeah at Phoenix Union.  I'm associating with the people at Arizona State [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona] but there's, there's only one person over there that has a doctorate.
Story_ID: 532469
Speaker 1: At Phoenix Union [Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona] at this point, were you the only doctorate faculty member there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how were the other teachers with that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't get any--I didn't have any problem with the other teachers, but John Waddell [John Henry Waddell], the one who did the sculptures there and Harry Wood who was head of the art department, came to Phoenix Union to convince me to go to ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona].  I had been an associate adjunct faculty oh, since I was at Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona], but that was teaching an evening class or--which was not a part of the main faculty.  But one of the main reasons I, I didn't go was the salary.  I got better salary in high school than they paid in the--in the college.  So, John Waddell and Harry Wood came over and convinced me to go to ASU and that my, my salary would be matched.  I also in 1960, 1963, '63 [1963], four, five--'64 [1964]--yeah, '63 [1963], four, five, John Waddell, John Biggers [John T. Biggers] had talked me into--talked me into coming to Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] working with him.  Are you familiar with that name?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: John Biggers.  Well, John Biggers is a cousin and I delighted in going to Texas Southern working with John.  That's where I did some of my early prints.  In fact, I talked John into doing some printmaking.
Speaker 1: So, now was this in the summer?  Well, 'cause you were still at the school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the summers, uh-huh.  And John had taken me to meet the publisher of his book, 'Ananse' ['Ananse: The Web of Life in Africa,' John Biggers] up in--what's the capital city of Texas?  I can't--
Speaker 1: San Antonio [sic. Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, you said the capital city of Texas?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Can't think of it right now.  But anyway, we had gone to this publisher and I was supposed to do a book, but I hadn't been able with my schedule at Phoenix Union.  I didn't have time to work on this book on masks at--my subject for my dissertation.  So, they told me I'd be able to work on a book because I'd only be teaching one class and all of this, so I decided to resign from high school and go to college until middle of that summer I decided, decided to change my mind and told them I wasn't coming.  But then the dean invited me over and talked to me and convinced me to make--to make the change.  And Rip [Roosevelt "Rip" Woods], who was already on the faculty, talked me into coming.
Speaker 1: So, your student came and got you, basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 532470
Speaker 1: Some of the other names, could you discuss with us your relationship with [HistoryMaker] Samella Lewis?
Speaker 2: I knew Samella early on, and in her book, 'Black Artists on Art' [Samella Lewis and Ruth Waddy] she had me--she interviewed me for that.  But then in the publication that she started, black--which was originally black art, I was invited to do a section on art education and I did a major paper for that on art education.  And then when, when COBA [Consortium of Black Organizations and Others for the Arts] had [HistoryMaker] Elizabeth Catlett to come here for our fundraiser, I had Samella to come over to introduce Betty Catlett.
Speaker 1: So, now you've been in the company of a lot of people now up to this point, up through the '60s [1960s].  You've met Langston Hughes, you've met Romare Bearden, you've met famous jazz musicians, Jacob Lawrence, I mean, and as far as art is concerned.  You've been around the world so to speak in order to view--
Speaker 2: No, sir.  I've only been in Brussels [Belgium].
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, the--Brussels.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you've, you've been abroad.  We'll put it like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You've been abroad.  And now you're in--now you're getting ready to go into teaching at the university level.  Did you see it as a big switch or is as a big difference or was your style going to remain the same as far as you know?
Speaker 2: Basically, the--actually, it was--it was a bit diff- quite a bit different.  In fact, when I was to go that first level, Francis Cameron had gone to Ghana and he set up a--he was at a college there and he wrote me and asked me if I would come and set up an art department at the University of Ghana [University College of the Gold Coast; University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana], and--but I'd already accepted the job at ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona].  They had me teaching one class and a class--well, our class had met once a week.  And when I look at what was supposed to be done, I said it's impossible.  So I made arrangements to increase that to twice a week.  So--and then when I started giving assignments, like I had them in high school, students started complaining there's too much work, there's too much--in fact, they went to the president to complain about my--I was too hard.  I had to--get too much work.
Speaker 1: 'Cause these are now college students with a full load in other areas also.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, were--now, were you teaching all art majors or was this some people just taking art?
Speaker 2: These were all--these were art education majors.
Speaker 1: Majors.
Speaker 2: People who were planning to teach art.  The class was art in the high school.
Speaker 1: So they had other education classes also.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: But, but, however, it was--it was a bit much for them they said.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what did you--what did you tell, tell the president?
Speaker 2: He didn't--president never said anything to me.
Speaker 1: So, so you--
Speaker 2: But I got word back that they had gone to complain.  In fact, one--I tried teaching a couple of summer schools, and I tried to do as much in the summer as I had in the winter.  And I let the students--well, the last--at the last meeting, I let them complain, get it all off their chest that they--and I got some of the damnedest--one got up and said, "You haven't taught us anything.  This has been nothing but busy work," and she ranted and raved.  When school was out, she got a job in--some place in either Colorado or New Mexico.  I got a telephone call from her saying, "I'm so glad you made us do this.  I'm so glad you helped me to do this 'cause now I see the value of it."
Speaker 1: So you think some students a lot of times in the midst of it don't understand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no they don't.
Speaker 1: --what it's all about.  So it's '66 [1966] and you're into--at the university now.  How long do you stay there?
Speaker 2: 'Til '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: 'Til '88 [1988].  So let's go--is there--are there any more really pressing things that you can talk about in the '60s [1960s] as we go toward the end of the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were just fresh at the--at the university.  Well, outside of schooling, was there anything else happening with your art during this time period in the late '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure it's the '60s [1960s] or the '70s [1970s].  I'm trying to remember when I became vice president of the national--
Speaker 1: That was in '70 [1970], around--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Then, we, we need to move into that.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll go into the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you say--we'll say that the '60s [1960s] basically was your career on the--started your career on the university level, started in the '60s [1960s], mid-'60s [1960s], '66 [1966] or so.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Well, actually started at Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona], but as far as the--
Speaker 2: Well, actually, my university level started at Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina]--
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: --and Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].
Story_ID: 532471
Speaker 1: So we're in the '60s [1960s], you've gone to ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona], you're there teaching now and we go into the '70s [1970s].  Now, we're going into the '70s [1970s].  What are the early '70s [1970s] like for Eugene Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby]?
Speaker 2: Early '70s [1970s], when I got my first sabbatical which was to interview black artists and bring back that information.  That was a semester.
Speaker 1: For those who don't understand the term sabbatical and don't understand, what does that mean, Mr. Grigsby?
Speaker 2: Seven years after you've been working seven years, you have a year off.
Speaker 1: Is it an actual year off?  Or is it a year, is it--are you sponsored?  Are you still paid to go do these things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's sabbatical.  You--it is with pay, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, your first one was to go interview African artists.
Speaker 2: African American artists, right.  And there again, this--I interviewed Samella [HistoryMaker Samella Lewis], I interviewed those that I knew, Jacob Lawrence.  And I was able to get a grant to do some traveling, so I traveled all over the country interviewing these artists.
Speaker 1: Now, it's in the '70s [1970s] and, and the racial thing has kind of lifted, so--and now Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] has been assassinated--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there's been a lot of things that are happening.  There's a lot of changes.  So, now you're traveling the country, interviewing artists.  And are you noticing things being different now when you go into these--into these different cities as opposed to maybe thirty years ago prior to that?
Speaker 2: I guess I--it's difficult for me to answer that because I didn't focus on that kind of thing.  As I went into cities--well, in those early days, we could not stay in hotels because of segregation, so we had to stay with friends or relatives.  And in staying with friends and relatives, we didn't run into any racial problems.
Speaker 1: So now it's the '70s [1970s], you can go into any hotel you want to now, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.
Speaker 1: So in 1970, there was still problems.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, see.
Speaker 1: You still stayed with friends.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Partly because there were problems because, because it was financially feasible.
Speaker 1: So, now what occurred on this trip?  What did you discover and who were some of the people?  Besides Samella, who else did you meet on, on, on your sabbatical as you interviewed people?
Speaker 2: God, it's--right now, it's--[HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam was one, I met for the first time, and he was in Washington [D.C.], Bob Blackburn [Robert Blackburn] in New York [New York].  God, I--right now, I can't recall.
Speaker 1: That's fine.  But you met several, several artists.  And what was the common tone with them or the common conversation that they were having when they met you?  Was there a particular thing they were dealing with as far as their art is concerned or where they all had different opinions about the art world?  What did you--basically, sir, I'm asking you, what did you discover from doing these interviews?
Speaker 2: I discovered ways that different people worked and what they--the kind of things they were doing.  Some of them were working on, on murals.  Some of these people I had known and knew what to expect like Hale Woodruff and well even Rip Woods [Roosevelt "Rip" Woods] was one of those.  But it wasn't anything that new to me other than probing some of their techniques of things they were doing and what they felt about their own work.
Speaker 1: At this point, what were you doing artistically yourself?
Speaker 2: I was trying to dig back into some historical things and things like the--I guess my 'No Vacancy' [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby] came about in this time.  Some of the--let's see, 'The Bridge,' no--the 'African Journey'--'The Bridge' ['African Journey, The Bridge,' Jefferson Eugene Grigsby] came after that, as a part of my studies as such.
Story_ID: 532472
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you went on sabbatical in '73 [1973], but at the same token, '72 [1972], you became the, the vice president of what organization?
Speaker 2: The National Art Education Association.
Speaker 1: And, and tell us more about this association.
Speaker 2: Well, it was an organization of art teachers across the country.  And when I first became president, there were four regional areas.  Pacific Arts [Pacific Arts Association] was a western--was in the West.  The western region was in the middle of the country and the eastern region, Northeast was--and the southern region.  Shortly after I became president, they reorganized it to make everybody vice president of national.  And my first job was to conduct a conference which had been set for Hawaii.  But I designed it as celebrating people, trying to tie this into subject of my--the textbook that I wrote, 'Art and Ethics' ['Art and Ethics: Background for Teaching Youth in a Pluralistic Society,' Jefferson Eugene Grigsby].  And we involved people in the west regions.  In fact, we had a Chinese artist to come.  We had Filipinos.  We had artists from across the country.  And it turned out to be an excellent conference.
Speaker 1: So, you had a diversity seminar so to speak before it was even popular.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah, yes.  Finally, that's basically when my book came out.
Speaker 1: In seventy--
Speaker 2: Having to--having to do with diversity.
Speaker 1: So, so you had the conference in '72 [1972], you went on sabbatical in '73 [1973] for a year, and then in '74 [1974], do you return back to school [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona]?
Speaker 2: No, my sabbatical was for a semester.
Speaker 1: For a semester only?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and let's see.  I can't keep these years straight, but--
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: My last sabbatical which was, was in the '70s [1970s], I guess.  My wife [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] had applied for a year, I applied for a year.  She had been ill and had been off for a semester, but they gave her a year.  And I--and they gave me a semester.  But we--that was when we did sabbatical at--we were--she was studying the teaching of, of biology in schools and Africa and Brazil, and I was studying and interviewing artists, and got tied in with the USIA.  And got assignments to lecture in schools and colleges and centers.
Speaker 1: What--pardon, I don't mean to cut you off, but what does USIA stand for?
Speaker 2: United States Information Agency.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had a sabbatical for whenever we--whenever I gave a lecture.  And this was in--we started out in Ghana and went to thirteen countries in Africa and then over into Brazil and up into the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: And this is in the mid to late '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 532473
Speaker 1: Now, you finally have reached the shores of Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Hale Woodruff had introduced you to African art.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now you're here actually in the land to see the native creations, to see the actual intrinsic art that's going on there.  What did you see and how did you feel?
Speaker 2: I met a lot of interesting African artists, Bruce Onobrakpeya here for one--and we later had invited here for a conference and a number of other artists.  But, it was interesting that some of the lectures I gave were on African art, which many of the Africans were not aware of.  I gave a lecture at the University of Ibadan [Ibadan, Nigeria] and it was in a--an arts center or African--it was an illustrated lecture.  The lights went out and they were out for an hour.  And so my--the director suggested I start talking and I did.  I talked for an hour and they asked questions for another hour, all of it in the dark.
Speaker 1: An actual dark lecture.
Speaker 2: Then, the next day, the director was going to Osogbo [Nigeria] and invited us to go along.  And so we went, and we met some of the artists and some--saw an area which I had heard about and we met the Obatala of the (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now, you're in Africa in these different regions, and are you having memories of what Hale, Hale Woodruff taught you at some point?  Is it coming back to you as you go around in these places?
Speaker 2: No, no it, it didn't--it didn't mix like that.  Because Hale had never been to Africa before then.
Speaker 1: Was there any technique or any one particular African artist that really influenced you?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  The style, the Kuba style had strong influence on me.  In much of my masks and my paintings, I used some of the design from the Kuba style and also from other areas.  But it's kind of like a general thing, no one specific one.
Speaker 1: So, so the Kuba people were--that, that was where the king was Shamba, correct?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, could you give us a little background on what you learned about Shamba?
Speaker 2: Shamba Bolongongo, the ninety-third king of the Kuba, had been positioned to become the king when his uncle died because succession was from uncle to nephew rather than father to son.  He told his mother he wanted to travel, his mother said, "No, you're crazy," said, "you go outside of our country and people might kill you."  And Shamba said, "That's what it might be, I'd have to take my chances, but if I stay here, I won't learn anything.  If I go abroad, I'll learn things from my neighbors and my enemies, learn what to do, what not to do, learn things to avoid."  So, he went and came back and brought the skill of weaving, what they call the Kasai velvet, and he brought a number of other things, some games to substitute for gambling.  And then when Shamba became king, he put three artists in his cabinet.  He put a sculptor and a weaver and another one in as a part of his cabinet.  His--he outlawed war.  And when neighboring tribes learned that he had outlawed war, they started making incursions as though they were gonna take over since he had outlawed war.  Shamba said, "Who do they think we are, old women who won't fight?"  He said, "Go to combat but kill neither woman--man, woman or child.  Take them as slaves."  Interestingly enough, Shamba's bodyguard was made up of slaves, so all kind of discretions or things that are quite the opposite you wouldn't consider.  Then, he told his sculptors to carve a figure to represent him so his people could see how beautiful he was, and I said, "That's the beginning of black is beautiful, 1600."
Speaker 1: So, it had a big influence on you and, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and the art to come.
Story_ID: 532474
Speaker 1: So now this is the mid-'70s [1970s] or late '70s [1970s] now and you--when you came back from Africa, did you see a change in your own personal artistic work?  Did you see something else happening to you at that point from being there and seeing that work?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think I just continued in the vein that I had been working on.  I may have done it a little more studiously, a little harder.  But my wi- my life has been fractured so I got into so many different things.  There was a--when I was president of the Arizona Art Education Association at one time and we had a, a conference, the Four Corners, Corners Art Education Conference [Four Corners Art Education Conference] of art teachers from Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona.  And I suggested to one of the members of the committee that they go ask the director of the Heard Museum [Phoenix, Arizona] if they would have a reception for these visiting teachers.  She came back and said that Mike Fox, who was the director, said he was--he'd have a reception, but it would have to--we'd have to pay for it, it would cost and we couldn't--the cost was--we couldn't afford.  So, I had known Mike Fox, so I said, "Mike, why don't you do this for the goodwill of the community and the--of the Heard Museum entertaining art teachers from around?"  So, Mike finally said, "I'll do that if you do an exhibit of African art."  I had done an exhibit of African art previously, but what he wanted was a major exhibit, which I agreed to do.  I said, "I'll do that if we can involve the black community."  So, he had a budget that he thought, so I spent maybe the next year going to places I'd knew they had collections of African art.  I went to the Metropolitan Museum [Metropolitan Museum of Art] in New York [New York], I went to the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York], I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and other places like that, identifying specific pieces that we might use in this exhibit.
Speaker 1: So, so you were the curator so to speak.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 532475
Speaker 1: Now what year was this (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And when I came back, there was no money.  They--the person that Mike [Mike Fox] thought was going to underwrite the whole thing changed his mind.  We were stuck.  We had planned this exhibit and there were a couple of collectors locally who said they would loan works from their collection and we had planned to use works from the Heard [Heard Museum, Phoenix, Arizona] collection, people from--had visited Africa and they'd come back and donated pieces to the Heard.  Well, after we found out we could not bring in things from across the country like we planned, the two collectors here, one had been a--well, he had not only collected but he sold African art mainly out of London [England], and the other was Don Fax [ph.] who had a--his family had an art store, a series of art stores, one in Chicago [Illinois].  And they saw the work that the Heard Museum was gonna include in the exhibit and they said they wouldn't put their work, they wouldn't exhibit with that.  Because what the Heard had was people who'd come and pick up airport art in Africa, come and give it to the Heard and take a big tax deduction.  So, for a while we thought we were weren't gonna be able to have the exhibit.  They finally said they would bring in an assessor from Indiana, Roy Sieber, who was major a African artist, who came in to look at the Heard's collection.  And he made three piles.  The biggest pile he said burn it, don't even show it so far as African art.  The next pile, use it for teaching style.  It represents the various styles but not art quality, and the small pile of quality art.  Then these guys, these other collectors said they would show with that, turned out to be one of the major exhibits at the Heard Museum.  I think we got a catalog over here and that catalog won a prize from the museum.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?  Do you recall what year that may have been?  'Cause it was--'cause it was the first African American art exhibit at that museum, right?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't African American, it was African.
Speaker 1: I mean African art.  It was the first African art--
Speaker 2: Not really because I had done one.  I had done an African art exhibit there before, but it, it was--it wasn't as extensive as, as this one.
Speaker 1: That was about '79 [1979], somewhere around there?  That's okay.  I think that was--
Speaker 2: I got the catalog here someplace.
Speaker 1: --pretty close to that.
Story_ID: 532476
Speaker 1: Let's go on and move to the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well anyway, that exhibit--because I said we needed--I wanted to be sure we involved the black community.  I invited about thirty organizations to participate in the--in fact, what we planned to do was to have individuals in Phoenix [Arizona] making banners which would be hung at the opening of the exhibit.
Speaker 1: Who were some of these organizations that you invited?
Speaker 2: Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], the--all the fraternities and sororities and two or three other, other groups, and they made banners.  In fact, there were some families, individuals that made banners.  And when the exhibit opened--there's that.  When the--when the exhibit opened, they hung these banners.  But we also got elementary school kids making banners and it became a learning experience throughout the valley.
Speaker 1: What, what did the people at the museum think about you now doing this, Mike Fox?  What, what do they think about, about, about you putting this exhibit together and the grand style you had done it in?  How did they feel about it?  Because they had no money at first you said.
Speaker 2: They--well, they had no money, but what they were able to do was to renovate a room at the Heard [Heard Museum, Phoenix, Arizona], which was designed by one of my former students from ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona] who was then working for the Heard as a designer.  But they were all very proud because it was a lot of favorable publicity in the newspapers and on the radio, and we were featured on a couple of radio--TV programs.
Speaker 1: So, now you are one of the most prolific educators in this region and you're world known at this point not only in Europe, but people know you in Africa now.
Speaker 2: You go--you give me too much credit.
Speaker 1: You're in Europe, you're in Africa, you're known on all coasts and you're known as an educator.  You're the president, at this time vice president of, of several organizations.  You sat on many different boards.
Story_ID: 532477
Speaker 1: We're going through the '80s [1980s] now.  At what year did you leave ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 1: Prior to you leaving in '88 [1988], were there any major events that you think we could talk about for a moment?
Speaker 2: In 1980, I was named the art educator of the year, national art educator of the year.  Nineteen eighty-eight [1988], I was named the national retired art educator of the year.
Speaker 1: So, so you stayed--you stayed at the forefront.  One way or the other, working or retiring, you stayed at the forefront.
Speaker 2: Well, let me go back to this organization that, that--I, I invited people to participate in this banner making.  At the same time, ASU was having its centennial and they were looking for programs.  So we talked them into having a symposium on African art, which was a part of the museum exhibit [at the Heard Museum, Phoenix, Arizona].  And for the symposium on African art, we brought scholars from Africa and artists to perform and to, to talk scholarly, present papers about African art at the museum and--at the university and also at the museum.  In fact, Samella [HistoryMaker Samella Lewis] was one of the people we had to come over here in a--as a panel discussion on African art.  We brought Onobrakpeya [Bruce Onobrakpeya] from Africa and we brought a number of people in.  This became the basis of the Consortium of Black Organizations and Others for the Arts, which now--which still exists.  It's a support group and the first person--well, they featured me in the beginning as a--in the opening of this.  We had a big dinner in which the costume was African--the dress was African art, African costume.  Then, two years later, we brought [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham here as a speaker for that.  On that first year, the speakers had been people who were involved mainly from the camp--from, from ASU who were involved.  In addition to bringing in a speaker, we set up a youth art exhibit, which we called the Inner-City Multicultural Invitational Youth Art Exhibit.  That actually had developed earlier.  Union Oil [Union Oil Company of California] had come over here.  They were interested in doing--in a competition.  And I rejected a competition because I said, "You have to be on equal planes."  Automobiles who were revved up in the same way can compete with one another.  But if you take an auto--a souped-up automobile and a go kart, there's no competition.  And you don't--when you got kids who are competing with one another, it's a false assumption.
Story_ID: 532478
Speaker 1: You mentioned competitions--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and how that wasn't your cup of tea normally to involve children in that.  But you were telling us about a young man in the scholastic competition.
Speaker 2: Right, who had won a prize.  And he didn't do any work for a while, and I said one day, "Why don't you do something?"  Why don't you--he said, "I won a prize.  I won a first place, so I'm not gonna do it."  Basically, he quit because he was first place.  It reminded me, when I was at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], we used to play bridge, every night sit up and play bridge.  One night, I bid five diamonds and made it.  I haven't played bridge since.
Speaker 1: So, so, so do you think that competitions, once you win, you find it's a reason--a reason not to go any further?
Speaker 2: Sometimes, some people.  It depends on the attitude of the individual.
Speaker 1: Do, do you think there could be a fearfulness maybe or apprehension to have to uphold what you--
Speaker 2: Right.  Basically, that--I think that's it, that you can't do that again.
Speaker 1: So you had this competition.
Story_ID: 532479
Speaker 1: So you had a symposium going on at the school at the same time you had the exhibit at the Heard [Heard Museum, Phoenix, Arizona].  You had two things 'cause it was a hundred--it was the centennial of ASU [Arizona State University, Phoenix, Arizona].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you had your symposium and you had your art exhibit going simultaneously.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At the same time.
Speaker 2: That's all dealing with African art.  And symposium on African art and exhibit of African art, which was well taken.  Now, we had the organization that the local people participated in the exhibit and in the ex- the symposium.  So, we wanted to continue that pattern of having an exhibit and having a symposium.  So--and we wanted to introduce major black artists to the Phoenix [Arizona] community, so we started with dance with [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham, and she came from Haiti.  And not only did she talk to the--to the audience, it was a fundraiser, we didn't get a whole lot of people there that we thought we might get, but it just happened that one of the members of our group had danced with her in Chicago [Illinois] and was living in Phoenix.
Speaker 1: This organization was the COBA?
Speaker 2: COBA, Consortium of Black Organizations and Others [Consortium of Black Organizations and Others for the Arts], one of our members added the And Others, so we were not just open to blacks, but to everybody.  For the Arts is a symposium, is a support group.  We added this youth art exhibit, which you continued and finally named it after one of the members who helped get it started, Madeline Hardy, who died last year at 103 [sic. 101].  But she was one of the teachers, so we called it the Madeline Hardy Inner-City Multicultural Youth Art Exhibit invitational because it's not open to everybody 'cause you don't want a whole lot of things coming in, and you got to reject--the idea is not to reject anybody.  So we have the schools--we identify the schools which have been--schools known for the art and we asked them to identify and send so many students' work, maybe ten students per teacher, whatever.  So, we send--we exhibit those works from these students and we raise money and give them cash awards.  We've given--in addition to the cash awards, they--in--we have paintings, sculptures, drawing, printmaking, photography, and five categories in each.  For high school students, first place was a hundred dollars, second seventy-five, third is fifty.  In junior high so that we try to get them coming along, we'd drop it twenty-five for junior high.  First place is seventy-five, second fifty, third twenty-five, and so forth.  And we have--then, we bring in a speaker or have a luncheon in which we give the awards and we bring a speaker in.  Several years ago, we brought in Robert Colescott, black artist from Tucson [Arizona] who is internationally known.  A couple of years ago, Robert--the guy is known for his paintings of outer space who lives in Phoenix.  Oh, can't think of his name right now.  And but then we brought in people like that.  One year, we brought in a former graduate student who was living in Chicago, and painting, a former--a student who graduated from South Mountain High School [Phoenix, Arizona] who went to Chicago Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] on a scholarship and lives in Chicago now.  We brought him in as the artist and we brought in the governor of Arizona as the speaker along with him, Janet Napolitano.  And each year we've done this and one year, [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou was our keynote speaker.  And one year, Betty Catlett [HistoryMaker Elizabeth Catlett] was the keynote.  When Maya Angelou came, we got--we brought John Biggers [John T. Biggers] in to introduce her.
Story_ID: 532480
Speaker 1: Now, Mr. Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby], you seem to have con- gone through the '80s [1980s] with a lot of work, doing a lot of different things.  In '88 [1988], you retired from ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona].  Was it just your time to retire?  You want to do other things?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I was seventy years old and they said you had to find--they, they--I was fired because at that time, it's no longer true, that when you reach seventy, you had to retire.  So, I didn't want to go.  I went kicking and screaming just like I did from Phoenix Union [Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona].  I didn't want to leave Phoenix Union.
Speaker 1: So you left, though, you left.  And what did you do as you went--as the '90s [1990s] start coming in?  What did you focus your attention on at that point?
Speaker 2: Basically on COBA [Consortium of Black Organizations and Others for the Arts].  I was also on the board of Garfield Organization [Phoenix, Arizona], a neighborhood organization.  I was on the board of the National Housing Association [ph.], which started building low rent houses in this neighborhood and other neighborhoods around.
Speaker 1: Did you start doing more artwork?
Speaker 2: I did but not that much more.  I kept involved and I wrote several articles for the National Review of African American Art [sic. International Review of African American Art].
Speaker 1: So, you stayed pretty busy as a writer and an educator but not necessarily in the structured system.  You were outside the system so to speak somewhat?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always been outside the system (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I kept--I've kept busy and active in different organizations.  I've been involved with OIC, Opportunities Industrialization Centers that Reverend Sullivan [Leon Sullivan] started since its inception here.  And one of the things I've tried and I've convinced them that the arts are to be considered in job development as well as other areas, that there's a whole--in the art world as such, there are a lot of jobs and a lot of opportunities.  And OIC has taken that on.  In fact, Reverend Sullivan was interested in that, too, before he died.  Are you familiar with the national, OIC, Opportunities Industrialization Centers?
Speaker 1: Not at the top of my head, no.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, they've got a number of centers in this country and in Africa and in England.  The thrust is job developing, training people who are the dropouts, the hardcore dropouts, is where I first came in, to getting them prepared to make a living.
Speaker 1: So you've been active still--that's still educational even outside--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of the school system.
Story_ID: 532481
Speaker 1: But I'd like to ask you some questions and I know many people listening to you are gonna want to know regarding art and your art in particular now as we continue.  You've been an artist for many years.  Is there a particular medium or style that you prefer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I prefer acrylic.  I used to work in oils but because of the volatile--because of the ease of fire and so forth in the small space, acrylic doesn't--prevents those hazards, and it dries fast and looks like oil.  So I use oil and I use a lot of drawing, and printmaking.  I used to do what was called a Christmas card at one time, but then Christmastime came around and I didn't really have time for--time--school was out, so I moved it to a New Year's card.  And a New Year's card, you may have seen one, I consider any time the half, first half of the year is New Year's, and we usually--and, and that's--that was done with a silkscreen that I could make these serigraph prints and do a variety.  And Rip Woods [Roosevelt "Rip" Woods] got involved mainly with serigraph.
Speaker 1: So, that would be your main style?  Is there any one artist--we know that you helped--
Speaker 2: Oh, wait, wait.  One, one--I've gotten into lithography as well.  I first did--I did my own lithographs but--using stone, but then I did several with Bob Blackburn [Robert Blackburn] in New York [New York] at the Bob Blackburn Printmaking Workshop [Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop].  And recently, I've done several in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] with the Brandywine printmaking workshop [Brandywine Workshop and Archives, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  My--and the last few I've done has been done there in lithographs because of the, the means of printing is done by a technician, somebody else and I made--provide the images.
Speaker 1: So that would be your favorite, favorite thing right now?
Speaker 2: Well, right now, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is lithograph.  Is there one artist--we know that Hale Woodruff was very influential in your development.  Is there anybody else that, that you wanna say really influenced you artistically?
Speaker 2: Rip Woods.
Speaker 1: So actually, your own student.
Speaker 2: Right.  Rip Woods, Bob Gwathmey [Robert Gwathmey] was a strong influence, and Charles Alston.
Speaker 1: As we sit in your beautiful gallery here, I look around and I see different things.  I see things and I see--I see very much a continuum.  Was there one period of your life where it flowed more naturally than other periods of your life?
Speaker 2: No, it's always been hard.  My method of working is--differs from many artists.  Instead of deciding on the theme and making a lot of drawings to do that, I often for my paintings, if I take a blank sheet of paper or a blank canvas, I may start scribbling color on it and then I look to see what's in there and then bring out some ideas that may have developed themselves, so it's not a preconceived thing.  It's something that's developed along the way.
Speaker 1: Would you compare that to like a jazz musician that starts improvising?
Speaker 2: Could be.  Could be.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you have a love of jazz music also (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Story_ID: 532482
Speaker 1: Are there some artists now, today, that you think are very promising and you really like their work?  Any young artists that you think are emerging?
Speaker 2: Oh, we have a group, and this is also supported by COBA [Consortium of Black Organizations and Others for the Arts] called Artists of the Black Community/Arizona.  Rip [Roosevelt "Rip" Woods] and I started that about twenty-five, twenty-eight years ago.  But there, there are a number of younger artists who come in and who are working, doing things that are quite exciting.  And we have an exhibit at the West Valley Art Museum [Peoria, Arizona], and we've agreed that this would be a--an annual thing.  And we do an exhibit at Carver High School [George Washington Carver Museum and Cultural Center, Phoenix, Arizona] and we try to bring in--in fact, we had a young fellow to come couple of weeks ago.  I thought he was young until he told me he was in his forties, but he--he's hip hop.  He's full of tattoos and he's full of everything.  But he had some good drawings, some good paintings.
Speaker 1: As you go forward and you look at the--look at what's going on in society today, could you talk about the importance of art, be it fine art, be it music, training, drama training, dance?  Do you think that these are avenues that might help African Americans focus more in our society today?
Speaker 2: Oh, I--definitely.  I think it can provide avenues of development, could be a focal point.  And in any of the arts, one must come and consider self.  Self is the important part that you, you develop from yourself.  And it's a development of that individual's sense of being and his, his sense of being in my mind has to do with how much you're able to support, influence, and help other beings.  Your community emanates from yourself.  You can't be just selfish and really be considered a whole human being.  That the artist's sensitivity in terms of shapes and colors, lines and textures, sounds and, and all of the other things that that artist is concerned with.  I mean, in, in writing and--one of the things we--COBA is instituting in their annual youth art exhibit is a--is a writing project in which students research artists who are like themselves and, and do reports.  One of the things that I found most successful with my students at Phoenix Union [Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona] and at ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona], I had them to do--research artists like themselves and to do a self-portrait in the style of that artist.  And I knew that they understood the artist when their self-portrait was in the style of the artist because they had to learn the style of the artist.  They had to learn his background, his history or her history, whatever.
Speaker 1: So, it's kind of like having that artist do a portrait of them.
Speaker 2: Right, that's it.
Speaker 1: Through the eyes of that artist.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And you get to understand the problems and the things that the artist has gone through.
Speaker 1: It's kind of like when a musician wants to transcribe a solo of another great artist and try to play it like that artist--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --through his own horn.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 532483
Speaker 1: In generations that have followed you, there have been--there's been a drive for success, and that success meaning money and dollar values.  So many people who are artistic or have the talent and the abilities and want to do things get hung up because you'll hear the term I can't make a living doing that, so I got to go do something that's more stable.  And they--you hear this a lot of times and you see people that are saying, well, why don't you draw?  Why don't you sing?  You're good at that.  And these people nowadays have a tendency not to pursue that.  Could you speak on that a little bit, please?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that's more true a few years ago than now.  There are more opportunities now that a person has to make money.  Most of us as I came along had a problem.  In fact, they didn't care that much about money and one of--one of the complaints my wife [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] had in our early years, you don't care about money.  But there is--there are opportunities now in which these young kids in the visual arts in particular see works that are being sold at high prices.  And the problem is, they wanna come and imitate, but in order to do that, you have to develop your own sense of self and project that kind of image rather than imitate.  You can't--in fact, I was reading something that Rip [Roosevelt "Rip" Woods] wrote when he would--he did the Neiman Marcus thing, that he could not imitate because it would not be him.  And I think when we have people develop as individuals who are concerned with their own growth and with the development of those in the community, we improve the quality of life around us.
Story_ID: 532484
Speaker 1: Is there an aspiration or a hope that you have for the African American community as a whole in the future?
Speaker 2: It's a big order.  I would say that I would hope that the--I would have to kind of limit it to, to young people, could think in terms of the quality of life that they might live and share with others around, and that we as a group can contribute to the, the quality of life and the understanding of the arts and not only the arts but the sciences, too.  Because it's through that and I always had my students who could move into the sciences and the literature through the visual arts in terms of improving their quality, understanding of education.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that there's a connection to all those?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  In fact, I had my students, I'd tell them, they could improve the, the grade mark at any of the class if they involved the arts in that.
Speaker 1: I once had a teacher that had me who was a music teacher told us instead of practicing, go to the art museum and look at the paintings.  You'll be a better musician.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Would you agree with that statement?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would.
Speaker 1: And why would that be?
Speaker 2: Because you get into colors and textures and tones, which can be translated.  And when you improve your sensitivity, it's the sensitivity that's to be improved.
Story_ID: 532485
Speaker 1: As we go forward and you see things you--'cause you've been doing this quite a while now, how do you actually want Eugene Grigsby [HistoryMaker Jefferson Eugene Grigsby] to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a concerned person about self and other people, about concern about the values and the quality of life of those--of all people.
Story_ID: 532486
Speaker 1: And right now, there's a need for teaching.  Teachers are they say underpaid and there's a need.  They're offering all kind of incentives for people to become teachers now.  Can you speak on what you think the importance of teaching is and also in the African American community of teachers or people becoming teachers?
Speaker 2: That teaching is one of the finest ways of making a living in terms of what you get back.  You may not get a whole lot in money but you get a lot in satisfaction.  The--you get more than you give if you're giving fully, fully.  And most people who teach, who really enjoy teaching wouldn't do anything else.  There are a lot of people who come to teaching just to--because they can't make money any other way, but many of these stay as teachers.  But many of them fail as teachers because they're not--don't really wanna teach, don't really get involved.  But I think we need teachers.  I know we need teachers who are sensitive to individual development.
Speaker 1: Could you also speak on the importance of diversity in one's life of not--of, of, of different diversity of culture of understandings?
Speaker 2: I think it's important for a community to be respectful of the various segments of the community and I think our problems today in the world, especially America because we don't respect other people and learning how to respect other cultures of the religions, of the--of the people at different levels of life I think is important for the community and for the individual.
Speaker 1: Well, you've been called an artistic voice for the African American and one that has a great feel for African--for African American religion and spirituality.  Could you speak on that part for a moment?
Speaker 2: The African American spirituality I think comes forward through song, the music, and I mean, the years I was in New York [New York], I didn't go to church, but I listened to Wings Over Jordan [Wings Over Jordan Choir].  The music fulfilled me and I think it gives a sense of wellbeing.  I can't think of anything that stretches, reaches across better than the music no matter what stage or what level and it helps in terms of the spirituality.
Speaker 1: Would you consider yourself a musician with a paintbrush?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's a good question.  I would like to think of myself like that.  In fact, I have tried to, to relate just that type of thing, um-hm, music when you're--when you're working, when you're painting, and things of textures in particular.  It's so easy to think in textures of sound and textures of paint.
Speaker 1: You were telling me--are you aware of the musicians that were painters like Miles Davis and Tony Bennett?  They were all artists.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Had you ever seen any of Miles Davis' work?
Speaker 2: No, I haven't.
Story_ID: 532487
Speaker 1: We've covered a lot of ground regarding your history and there's been so many different things you've done and you seem to have had a great life in music and you're still--I mean with art and you're still having a great life with music also, all those things.  Now, I'd like, like you to tell this audience, if there was one major message that you'd like to give, could you please do that for us?
Speaker 2: I guess in any kind of message, I'd have to reflect on my own life and development in terms of support that I got in my early life from my family, my mother [Purry Dixon Grigsby] and father [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] and my siblings, but also, things that have happened to me in, in recent years because of my, my wife and my, my two sons.  I could never have done the things that I've done had it not been for Tommy, Thomasena Grigsby [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby], and the support that I've had from my sons [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby III and HistoryMaker Marshall Grigsby].  And I feel that if in any way I could pass this on to other people to support and respect and to have family developments in the sense that I have felt, that you get a close knit family and this is basically an African feel, too.  And that's where the spirituality comes in.  The--life is lived to its fullest when you live it with respect for those around you and those closest to you, members of your own family.  My wife is precious even though she has Alzheimer's and hasn't been able to speak for the last ten, fifteen years, but she still feels and she emotes.  And then there are other people around I feel who are in better shape physically or mentally but who have no more than, than she has to give.  I rejoice in the development of our two sons and sometimes I get mad at them, but I--they have their own families to develop and they have nurtured and developed.  Speaking of diversity, our oldest son's wife [Sharon Grigsby] is Caucasian, and her father didn't speak to her for seven years until the son, grandson [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby IV] was born.  Then, he opened up and saw how lack of sensitivity and diversity can harm.  In fact, shortly after he accepted his grandson, he had a heart attack and died.  And again, they were risen of a Catholic family, but they couldn't find a priest to preach his sermon.  It just happened that my youngest son was in town, and he had been ordained at our Unitarian church, which is just yards away from the Catholic.  But he was called on to preach the sermon.  So, all of those mixtures in there give a background as a drop of sand or whatever for my own sensitivity and development in terms of thinking and working with other people.

Speaker 2: Approximately what year is this?
Speaker 1: Let's see, we left Winston-Salem [North Carolina] 19--maybe about 1930?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Twenty-eight [1928], '30 [1930].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's--my brothers and sister came here when COBA [Consortium of Black Organizations and Others for the Arts] featured me as a speaker at the dinner that preceded my exhibit at the museum, Phoenix Art Museum [Phoenix, Arizona].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In 19--2001.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Good, thanks.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm in the lower right--lower left part of the picture.  My baby brother, Marvin, is right over me.  My brother, Donald, is sitting on my dad's lap.  My dad's got on overalls.  I was surprised.  And my mother is in the--in the larger part of the picture, and my sister is in front of my mother, my sister, Miriam.  My mother's name is Purry [Purry Dixon Grigsby].  And my dad--I'm a junior, my dad is Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.
Speaker 1: Do you have an idea what year that may have been?
Speaker 2: Must've been about the same.  I think we're still in Winston-Salem there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, how about this one?
Speaker 1: Self-portrait in acrylic, and year must've been about 1970.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Very good.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of Tommy [Thomasena Marshall Grigsby] and me.  I don't have any idea what year that is.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Very good.
Speaker 1: Let me see that one a little closer.  Oh, this is at one of the student exhibits, youth art exhibit.  And I was trying to see if that's one of the students or one of the teachers.  I think that was one of the teachers.
Speaker 2: Okay.  When was that picture, that last photo, when was that taken?  Rough guess.
Speaker 1: Rough guess, 2001.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, and then with this one?
Speaker 2: That was when I got the award in--the Bennie award at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], that (unclear).  That's my brother--my son, Marshall [HistoryMaker Marshall Grigsby], on my right and my wife, Thomasena on my--or, or Marshall on the left and Tommy on the right.  And we--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what have we got here?
Speaker 2: This is Margaret--I've forgotten her name already.
Speaker 1: Burroughs?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs who is the--developed the DuSable Museum [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Margaret Burroughs of DuSable Museum and she was here.  I think that was taken at Carver High School [George Washington Carver High School, Phoenix, Arizona].  I had Margaret to--at the conference in Hawaii.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: I think that's at the second or third Grigsby family reunion, and the man seated is Howard Grigsby, my dad's--not--the younger one of his brothers who was the oldest one at that time.

Speaker 1: Elizabeth Dorcas Clark Wellmon, who was my great-grandmother, my mother's grandmother, who was also a Cherokee Indian [Native American].
Speaker 2: Interesting, okay.
Speaker 1: This was from the National Gallery of Art [Washington D.C.].  It's down--right up against the wall.
Speaker 2: I see it.  And who's that you're standing with there?
Speaker 1: Lady Bird Johnson.  There should be a better picture in there.  That, that--it was just a full page.
Speaker 2: Okay, I didn't see it.  I'll look.  Okay, we got it.
Speaker 1: Got it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And she was presenting the National Gallery.
Speaker 2: This was giving a lecture at Keuka College in Keuka, New York [sic. Keuka Park, New York].  I did a two week workshop there.
Speaker 1: When did that take place?
Speaker 2: Keuka College.
Speaker 1: Looks like it might be the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: I think it was.  I think it was.  Sometimes in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was also at Keuka College.
Speaker 1: What's that mask there?
Speaker 2: That's an African mask from the collection there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Keuka.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Very good.  Next.  You want me to try the book for my--well, I'll give you this.  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is the program cover of the exhibit, 'Celebration of Peoples,' in Honolulu [Hawaii], 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, then tell us about this one, then.
Speaker 2: That's my grandmother, Alice Dixon [Alice Wellmon Dixon].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother's mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, how about this?  Well, tell us about this.
Speaker 2: This is the cover of my catalog of my retrospective exhibit at the Phoenix Art Museum [Phoenix, Arizona].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two thousand one [2001].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Now, this book is--
Speaker 1: Oh, 'Art and Ethics' ['Art and Ethics: Background for Teaching Youth in a Pluralistic Society,' Jefferson Eugene Grigsby]?  Took me five years to write.  I didn't mention the FESTAC, Second World Festival of Black and African Art [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria].
Speaker 2: You did not, that's right.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson, Howard University [Washington, D.C.], was the chairman of that--the North American side, and I was on the board in which we were developing--we had planned to send about eight hundred artists to Africa, but we only ended up sending maybe, maybe about one hundred or less.  And I was able to get Rip Woods [Roosevelt "Rip" Woods] and Mark Herrin and Grace Hampton, who was a black woman who did her doctorate with me at ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona], and another black artist who had been one of John Biggers' [John T. Biggers] students, to get them as part of the festival in Lagos [Nigeria].  And I was supposed to be on the plane going back, but the day the plane was to leave, the file of proof of my book came and I had to choose between anything, the book or going to Lagos.  And we had been to Lagos the year before and place was so crowded, I said, I'd be better to edit the book.
Speaker 2: So, this is your textbook?
Speaker 1: Yes.  'Background for Teaching Youth in a Pluralistic Society--Art and Ethics.'  The year after it was published, a couple of years, they took it out of print because it wasn't selling.  So, I went back and bought the remainder copies, which was about 2500, and stored them in Rip Woods' studio, and then gradually sold them.  And then about five years ago, the director of the National Art Education Association talked me into giving him all of the rights, and they reprinted it.
Speaker 2: So, these are available now.
Speaker 1: So, that's a reprint, yeah.

Speaker 1: Did you get to say everything you wanted to about FESTAC [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria], and your impressions of that and what that meant to you to be there and what it meant to the art community?
Speaker 2: I didn't get to FESTAC.
Speaker 1: We're still rolling if you wanna add any comments.
Speaker 2: But we had a woman who came, who was seeking a place to do her doctorate.  She was from Illinois, done her master's [degree] there, and talked to her into coming to ASU [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona] to do her doctorate, and she can work in a housing project.  My second sabbatical was going around the country looking at community art programs, and I saw community art programs in Wisconsin and New York and all over the country.  And so we helped to set up our community program.  And I had Grace Hampton to do her study at the Hayden Project [Carl Hayden Projects, Tempe, Arizona], which was done by the Urban League.  I was on the board of the Urban League when they built that.  And I suggested that they needed an art teacher in residence and no one realized what that was, but they agreed, but there wasn't any money for it.  We went to a, a party with--that the board was invited to and one member of the board, when I told them what this was all about, he asked me to come to his office the next day.  I didn't realize he was one of the big donors.  So, I went to his office and I had talked about this art teacher in residence, and he wanted to know how much it would cost, and I said five thousand dollars, so he wrote me a check.  I could've said fifty thousand dollars, but my sense of money at that time was nickel and dime.  But anyway, Grace Hampton came and then did her doctorate at ASU.  And she did a report that showed how much money was saved with the activities that she did as against the refurbishing that most of these housing units had to do.  It cost them ten thousand dollars just to refurbish a housing project on the other side of town whereas at--the people practically refused to leave this place.  Turnover was very low.  There was practically, practically no vandalism.  And because Grace Hampton had the tenants doing all kind of things, and one of the assignments that I had in my classes, was to go and do--make things at this housing project.  And they did beads and paintings and decorations during--in holidays.  But it was a--it was a great time.  And Grace left there and had a couple of good jobs.  She was head of the art department at Mississippi [Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi].  This year, went to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] as the provost.  She's still at Penn State in one of their programs there.
