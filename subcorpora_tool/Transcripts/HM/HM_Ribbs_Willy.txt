Speaker 1: I'd like to start out by asking you about your mother and her name and what you know about her background and her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mom's name is Geraldine Ribbs, Geraldine H. Ribbs.  She grew up--
Speaker 1: Her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Henderson.  My mom's maiden name was Henderson.  Her parents came out from Chicago [Illinois] before she was born, and they moved to L.A.  And she was born in Los Angeles [California], and then she went to high school in L.A., went to University of California, Berkeley, and graduated from Berkeley in 19--right after, right after the war, right after World War II.  And, and she became a social worker--actually, she became a social worker after she met my father [William T. Ribbs, Sr.].  And she did very well.  And after--then she, she actually quit her job as a social worker and worked in the family business [Ribbs Plumbing], and family plumbing business with my dad and my uncle [Felix Ribbs] and all the rest of the, you know, heavy breathers in the family.
Speaker 1: Now, you know, you can't--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, I won't move, all right.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did she share with you any stories about growing up?  Are you dying in your hat?
Speaker 2: No, I'm, I actually am all, (unclear) once that air starts blowing in here.  Did she what, now?
Speaker 1: Did she share with you any stories about you growing up--about her growing up, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: No, she, you know, my--her father and mother, my, my grandparents, Joe [Joseph] and Betsy Henderson, you know, my grandfather worked on the railroad.  He worked on, on my father's, or my mother's father worked on the railroad.  And pretty normal life, nothing, no drama.  And then right through college and, you know, she happened to meet my father up here in San Jose [California].  A friend of--well, actually, my father's cousin was her best friend.  And so she came down for a family dinner one time, and--but as far as her, her growing up, I mean there was, was nothing unordinary.
Story_ID: 19290
Speaker 1: Give your father's name and what you know about his background.  And I'd like you to also talk about your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Well, my dad is William Theo [Theodore] Ribbs, Senior.  I'm Junior, I'm Willy T. Ribbs, Junior.  He is William T. Ribbs, Senior.  And my dad was born and raised in San Jose, California.  He grew up here.  He was born here in 1925.  And my grandfather [Henry Ribbs] actually started his plumbing company [Ribbs Plumbing] in 1927, and my dad--when my dad was two years old.  So dad, now it was a strict upbringing for my dad and my uncle [Felix Ribbs].  I mean it was, my grandfather was a very tough guy.  He was only about five foot two, maybe a hundred and forty pounds, but he was a no-nonsense businessman.  And he expected of his boys, I mean there was--they were sent off to World War II when he was, well, my uncle was--my dad was eighteen and my uncle was about twenty-three, but my uncle ended up in the Philippines in World War II.  And when they came back from the war, my grandfather's business really took off. Ribbs Plumbing took off big time cause all the G.I.'s [military personnel] were coming back from overseas.  And the building boom really took off in California.  And so my grandfather really did well.  I mean he ended up building and owning apartment complexes.  He ended up owning a lot of real estate in San Jose.  And, but the whole theory was, is that he worked the hell out of you.  I mean, work was the best answer to any problems for him. Hard work.  And you, you--that's how a man was measured.  And that's what I grew up with.  I mean you were measured by how hard you could work and how successful you could be, and to the point where they--my parents sent me up to the ranch [Santa Clara, California].  I mean my grandfather's [Henry Ribbs] got a 300-acre ranch [Santa Clara, California].  And they [William T. Ribbs, Sr. and Geraldine Ribbs] sent me up there right out of junior high school.  And they, they weren't worried about me getting into trouble, I don't think.  They just wanted--they knew that I had a, a sort of a penchant for jumping into cars and going for a ride, long before my sixteenth birthday.  And so they said, "Okay, well, if you're gonna take the, the cars out"--my dad had a lot of cars and he had race cars.  And the, you know, we, San Jose [California] had a lot of room, but they thought it would be a little bit better if I was up on the ranch with my grandfather.  And he, he was, you know he, he gave me freedom, but only to the point where, you know, you, you had to stay on the ranch.  You didn't run the streets.  And, you know, you could, if you were on the ranch, you could--I, all I wanted to do is drive something.  So I got to drive the tractors and I drove his dump trucks and all the vehicles he had.  So I, it was fun for me to be up there, and then I was hunting all the time.  And I was raising show hogs and show steers.  I mean it was--I had a great, great childhood.  I mean awesome because my dad was up in San Jose, and he was racing.  So all, there was always something for me to do.  I would either go up--I'd leave the ranch and go to him, go with him to the races, when he was racing.  And then, and then I was back up on the ranch.  And so the whole point was, is you were going to be busy.  You're gonna learn how to work.  You're gonna learn discipline, and if there's anybody in my life, my grandfather was my absolute idol.  I mean I had heroes.  I had--Muhammad Ali was my hero and Jim Brown and, and Mario Andretti.  I had my heroes, but my idol was my grandfather because he kicked my butt, I mean literally.  I mean if he, if he didn't think you were working hard enough, he'd come kick you in the butt.
Story_ID: 19291
Speaker 1: Now, how did your father get interested in racing?  Do you know that story?
Speaker 2: My dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.], growing up here in San Jose [California], one of his best friends was a--when he was growing up, was a gentleman named Joe Leonard.  And Joe Leonard was, Joe was racing motorcycles at that time.  And Joe was one of the best motorcycle racers this country had ever seen.  He was eight-time champion.  My dad was racing motorcycles too.  This is before I was born.  And, so Joe and dad were big buddies.  So when Joe got out of motorcycling--he was too old to ride one--so he went on to race cars, and he was two-time Indy [Indianapolis 500] car champion.  He nearly won Indy in 1968.  Nine laps from the end, the car broke down.  Joe Leonard was a family friend, and so that sort of, you know, my dad, because of his relationship with Joe at an early age, they were both racing.  So dad, that's how he got into racing.  And my grandfather's company [Ribbs Plumbing] had the money to support my dad's racing hobby.  So that's how, you know, dad got into it.  And, and, of course, I grew up in it, and dad, you know, as kids we had everything we wanted.  We had eight motorcycles and five go-carts.  And we had pretty much everything we wanted.  But I didn't want to work in the business.  I mean my grandfather [Henry Ribbs] was really bent out of shape about that.  He was pissed (laughter).  Oh, he didn't like that at all.  He, he was--as far as he was concerned, "I founded the business in 1927 when black men, they didn't let you, you know, do anything hardly but shine shoes in 1927."  And his theory was, "Look, I worked; I started a company.  I built this company up, and I want you to be, to take over, you know, be in line to take over the company."  And I, I didn't--that was not the direction I wanted to go in.
Story_ID: 19292
Speaker 1: Now, how many--do you have brothers or sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you--where do you fit within the--?
Speaker 2: I'm number two, I'm the--
Speaker 1: Number two, so can you go through the siblings in order?
Speaker 2: Well, my older brother, Phil, Phil [Philip] Ribbs, is, he's quite a bit older than me, seven years, and he's--he stayed, he sort of, he was sort of indoctrinated in the family business [Ribbs Plumbing].  But then they--he couldn't work with my dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.] so he ended up becoming Chief Plumbing Inspector for the City of San Jose [California].  And then myself, I went off to become a race driver.  My younger brother is next.  He runs Ribbs Plumbing now.  And then my two sisters and one of my sisters was killed a few years ago in a car accident.
Speaker 1: Can you give their names in order?  I know you gave Phil, so--?
Speaker 2: Phil, Phil, Steve, my sister Alma, my sister Vicky.
Speaker 1: Now, why were you as Junior, why was not Phil you and you, you Phil in terms of--?
Speaker 2: Because my mother [Geraldine Ribbs] was married once before she met my father.
Story_ID: 19293
Speaker 1: Now, can you talk about your first memory of growing, you know, of growing up?  An early memory.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, you know, I, I grew up in, in a, in San Jose [California], which pretty much at that time was a country town.  It was a city, but there was a lot of orchards and dairy farms here, and then, you know, I, all I can remember growing up is those cars around, there was race cars and my dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.].  And there was always motor vehicles.  And, you know, I went through school, I didn't--I wasn't an academics wizard.  My, my main concern was read and write and add and subtract and know that if you do well, you need to know two things, how to add your money and how to subtract it.  And that was it.  My, my grandfather [Henry Ribbs] wasn't big on academics.  He was big on hard work.  And although he was very good, you know, at, at math, and that was--I don't know.  I, I, I suppose if I was to do it again, maybe I would do it a little bit different, given what the, what the parameters are now to, to be a success in this country.
Speaker 1: What were you, well, tell me what you were like as a young--a little person?
Speaker 2: Wild.
Speaker 1: Wild at times (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: At least as, yeah, I was, I was scarred up, banged up, you know, and burnt up.  I was always into things.  And there was always a lot to do.  And, you know--although my dad, always, when, during the summer as a five, six year old boy, he took us out on the truck with him, on the plumbing truck.  We'd work with him during the summer in the fam--in the family business [Ribbs Plumbing].  And they had us out in the yard stacking pipe at six, seven years old.  We were stacking pipe.  And we didn't play much.  We didn't get to play much.  And when we did play, it was when everyone was, you know, work was over.
Speaker 1: And so can you just share some of the memories?  You had started earlier with some of your memories growing up, and I--what year were you when, I mean what age were you when you went to live on the farm with your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I was thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, can we have some memories from that pre-thirteen period?
Speaker 2: Well, during the school year, I was, I was out here in San Jose.  And then before I went to the ranch [Santa Clara, California], every summer we ended up having to go up to the ranch every summer anyway.  I mean Friday night, school was out.  Saturday morning we were heading to the ranch with our bags packed.  So my cousins and I, we'd go up to the ranch and work on the ranch all summer.  This was before I lived up there.  We were nine, ten, eleven years old.  If I wasn't doing that, then I was with my dad, you know, working doing plumbing jobs with him and the, and his employees.  But we, I didn't have, you know, we had the motorcycles, and we had, you know, we'd go out, you know, on weekends, dad would take us out racing motorcycles and, and, yeah, it was a fun childhood.  We'd go down to Mexico for a vacation every Christmas.  Dad would take us down to Puerto Vallarta.  In fact, he's got a home down there, in Puerto Vallarta that he's had for twenty-five years.  But when we were young, we used to go to Mexico every Christmas.  And, yeah, I--it was, I, I, I cannot--there was nothing wrong with my childhood.  I think it was absolutely perfect.
Speaker 1: No, I'm not looking for something wrong, just trying to have you recount it.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, but I mean, yeah, I mean it just very--
Speaker 1: You were just very happy?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was awesome.
Speaker 1: But when you think about your childhood, what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up, if you like closed your eyes and thought about it?
Speaker 2: I, probably the smell of gunpowder in the fall, hunting out with my grandpa, and, and racing engines, the smell of racing engines in the summer.
Speaker 1: And so, when you went up at age twelve, thirteen with your grandfather, what was that--was that--you had been going up and back so that the farm was not--
Speaker 2: It was nothing new.
Speaker 1: It was nothing new.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 19294
Speaker 1: So what do you think, how did you develop during that time period [childhood]?  And when did you first start driving--first of all, when did you start driving your first (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I first started driving when I was nine years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what were you driving?
Speaker 2: My dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.] had a sports car that--made in England.  It's called a Morris Minor 1000.  And that was my first car.  And it was--he had it, he didn't race it.  It was, had big tires on it and a pretty nice engine and big carburetors and had a four-speed gear box.  Well, I, you know, after being, after--that's all I did was spend time with my dad and uncle, you know, and my grandpa [Henry Ribbs].  I was with them all the time.  I didn't really have any friends.  I didn't, I--and certainly was not allowed to run the streets at all.  I didn't go to my first dance until I was seventeen years old, first dance.  I was almost eighteen before I went to my first dance.  And then I went hog wild after that, but growing up with them, you know, was, it was, it was a great experience.  And it was--
Speaker 1: So at nine, how did you learn to drive in this, what was it, the Minor (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, they didn't--my mom [Geraldine Ribbs] and dad were out at some function, you know.  And I got in from school.  And I think I was in fourth grade.  I remember it was, I'm in the fourth grade.  And my younger brother, Steve, he was like six years old.  And so the, the car didn't have a key switch.  It had a, a, a toggle switch, flip it up and push the button.  So we used to get in the car and put--I'd get it in neutral.  And I, you know, I knew how to shift cause I had watched dad shift, and I knew--and I was already racing go-carts.  I knew how to drive a go-cart.  I was pretty fast.  And so I knew about driving.  So, you know, me and Stevie get in the car.  And I put it in neutral, and I pushed the button, and (racing car staring sound) (wham), we'd fire it up and just run the engine, (car engine sound), run the engine.  And then my sisters [Alma Ribbs and Vicky Ribbs] were looking out the window at us, you know, they're just watching.  And my youngest sister, Alma, she was pretty wild--adventurous.  So she'd be out there with us.  So then I'd switch it off, and then after about two or three days of starting it, I said, nah, this is, this is not enough for me.  I want more, a little more action here.  And so we fired it up, and then, you know, Stevie, with, my little brother's in the car, and he's sitting next to me.  And these are bucket seats, right?  So I just push the clutch in, and stuck it in first gear, and sort of rolled off, and then rolled down the street.  And the street we lived on was my, was owned by my grandfather.  It was private property, private street.  So we, we, I drove down the street, which was about, it was about 450 foot and turn around and come back.  And then up and down, and so after about three or four runs up and down, the--you know, we started picking up the speed a little bit here, you know, and got out of first gear, into second, then into third.  And so, you know, the little--the kids were, my brothers and sisters were sworn to silence.  "You, you don't talk, right, loose lips sink ships.  Now, if you kids want to go for a ride with me, with your, with your older brother, then you can't tell mom or dad."  So they didn't talk.  So every day we were--and finally we got caught.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you got caught?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, my mom caught us.  She came driving down the street as we were coming at her head-on, about sixty miles per hour cause I was--by then, we were, you know, I was into fourth gear already (making swift moving car sound).  We were smoking down there, (another fast moving car sound).  And I could barely, I couldn't see over the steering wheel, so I was looking in between the spokes, the spokes, you know, how the spokes and sort of--so I was, I was looking up and I was going, and Stevie was like, my little brother was holding on.  And so my mother turned onto the street, as we were coming at her real fast.  And God, she was not, she wasn't impressed with that.  So--
Speaker 1: What happened to you then?
Speaker 2: She made me turn around.  She was bent, and so she made me turn around and park it.  And she had dad unwire it, take the, take the switch out and made sure we couldn't fire it up again.  And that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was it.
Story_ID: 19295
Speaker 1: You liked the feeling of driving?
Speaker 2: There was a--it was a freedom. Driving fast is freedom.  It's, you become--at an early age, you don't sense that, that once you become a racing driver and become an adult, when you're out, when you roll out onto that race track, you're in a whole world by yourself.  You're in another world, and no one can impede it.  You have--you're free to go as hard and fast as you want.  And I always felt that--I didn't know it when I was a young child cause, you know, we had motorcycles and go-carts, and, you know, I just wanted to, to, to, to go, to learn how to slide it at high speed.  I wanted to be able to slide a car at a hundred miles per hour and control it, you know what I mean?  And I was doing that by the time I was about, oh, sixteen, I could do that.  I could drive sideways at a hundred miles per hour.  And I thought, "This is what life's all about."  And, plus, I wanted girls to see me because I didn't play football or baseball.  I mean the only thing I--and all the guys were getting the girls playing football.  So the only thing I could do, and I could, well, maybe I just take them for a ride in my car and go real fast.  And that's how I did it.
Story_ID: 19296
Speaker 1: Now, when you, you said that you got--that you weren't bad, you know, you weren't really getting in trouble, but they [your parents], you know, they sent you up to live with your grandparents [Henry and Nora Ribbs] on the farm [Santa Clara, California]. But that you already driving pretty much then.  But what was the--they just didn't want you to--?
Speaker 2: They were gonna preempt anything that could go wrong.  They, they weren't taking any chances.
Speaker 1: Had you done anything at all that you'd gotten in trouble with?
Speaker 2: I went out on the street one time when I was twelve years old.  And I would, sort of went out, and came back.  Well, one of the local cops got me and they didn't do anything.  They sort of, you know, "All right, Ribbs, you know, we know you and we know your family.  Now, you--don't go off that street that, you know, your grandfather owns."  And so my parents [William T. and Geraldine Ribbs] decided, "Okay, we're gonna give him a lot of property to drive on.  And it's gonna be up at the ranch."  And, you know, part of being up there was my grandfather, he didn't mind you driving his vehicles.  It was amazing.  He was, my parents were much more strict when it came to driving, even though my dad was a racing driver.  I couldn't figure that out. But my grandfather--as long as you, when you were driving those vehicles, you were working, you know, he'd let you drive them.  And you couldn't just joy-ride them.  But, you know, he'd have you on one side of the ranch, and that ranch was so big, I mean you could--on the other side, you, he couldn't even hear you.  And so we'd, I'd, I'd put the throttle down, and I'd, you know, we'd run that thing pretty, pretty hard.
Speaker 1: And was there anyone else your age up there or you were just--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had my, my cousins came up.
Speaker 1: Hold one second for this plane here.
Speaker 2: It's the flight path here.
Speaker 1: I was asking if there were other, you know, kids at the ranch?
Speaker 2: Well, when I, yeah, my cousins would come up during the summer.  But then I had friends, other, other buddies of mine who I became friends with that I lived with--that were, you know, down the road.  And I got them racing with me.  We had, we had a pretty, pretty aggressive group of drivers up there.  Yeah, one guy damn near got killed, a buddy of mine.
Speaker 1: How?  Describe that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I never will forget.  His name is Len Jones.  He was, we were coming home from high school, and it had been raining.  And, you know, one of the prerequisites of being a great driver is you got to be good in the rain too.  And, you know, usually the surface is a lot less grip.  So he was, he was running about 90 miles per hour, flew off the road and went in some almond trees (laughter).  Yeah, he went into them almond trees.  It was classic.  I mean, boy, he, he, he looked like a billiard ball.  He went bang, bang, and he was gone off those trees, got thrown out of the car, you know.  They had to patch him up.  He was in the hospital for about a couple of weeks.  They thought he wasn't gonna make it.  That was classic.  We laugh about that all the time, damn near killed himself.  But, that was just it, when you're young like that, you don't think about getting hurt or killed.  I mean, you know, and, you know, the object was to, to go as fast as you could no matter what the conditions were, whether it was rain or snow, ice.  I mean you want to go through that ice, you know, if that thing, you know, gets a little loose on you, so what?
Story_ID: 19297
Speaker 1: When you would race like that, would there be other thoughts going through your head at all or just--you said you didn't know until later that that whole sense of freedom, but would there be other thoughts that you would just be like--?
Speaker 2: No, not as far as getting hurt or anything.
Speaker 1: No, not getting hurt, just any thoughts, no?
Speaker 2: No, just, just being the fastest, being fast, being really fast and really precise with my car control, really--I mean just hitting the corners just right, because driving, anybody can drive a straight line.  It's corners that make you the race driver.  It's corners that make you the driver.  When you start smoking through corners at high speed, and driving it down in the corner, and driving it off the corner, right to the edge, right to the absolute edge, that's what, that's what gives you the, the confidence as a human being.  And, yeah, it just gives you a lot of motivation about what your prowess is, you know.
Story_ID: 19298
Speaker 1: Now, you were talking about the corners, that that's really determines, you know, it's being able to do those corners.  So what would you do with your friends?  You would just practice going and racing corners to the--
Speaker 2: Up at the ranch [Santa Clara, California]?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, most of the racing we did was on the dirt.  So we had made up our own tracks.  We had the, you know, we'd, you know, just dirt track and slide.  And then we'd get out onto the country roads and run.  We ran both, dirt and pavement.  And, you know, there were some great country roads up there.  And there were some corners that were pretty fast.  I'm talking about one hundred mile per hour corners in a street car.  So we would, you know--and there's only two lanes.  It's not like we're on a major four-lane highway.  There's two lanes, one going one way and one going the other.  So that--and the roads, you know, country roads are not wide.  They're narrow.  Country roads are narrow, and so that was part of the, the attraction, to drive a hundred miles per hour plus on those narrow roads and not crash.  That was what it was all about, not crashing-- because, you know, when you crash, you can get hurt.  You might die.
Story_ID: 19299
Speaker 1: Now, were you watching races on, on T.V. during your--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: And I was going to the races with my dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.] cause he was racing.  And his--friends of his were racing, and so I was going to racing, plus, I watched races on T.V.  So I knew, you know, I mean, that was what my career path was.  That's what I wanted.  That was what I lived for.  And so my watching Dan Gurney and Mario Andretti and A. J. Foyt, those guys and Jimmy Clark.  And I knew them all, I mean studied it.  It was, it was an art that I wanted to study from a very early age, and I did.
Speaker 1: And what did you like about each one of those, whether it was, you know, Mario Andretti or, you know, what did--did you have any preference, one over the other, or did you--?
Speaker 2: I, I liked, you know, Mario.  I just thought he was an unreal driver.  I mean Dan Gurney was a great driver, but Mario was, Mario was probably one of the best, if not the best of them all in the history of the sport.  I mean I, I, I know the Great Fangio [Juan Manuel Fangio] and [Tazio] Nuvolari and, and, and Ayrton Senna, one of the youngest--I mean Ayrton was killed not too long ago.  But you put all those guys together, and Jimmy Clark and, you know, Mario was probably, I mean Mario made it through.  I mean he retired at fifty-five years old.  And the kind of career he had, a lot of guys don't make to that age in, in, in my profession.
Story_ID: 19300
Speaker 1: Can you just review with me the history of the profession in the United States?  Do you know much about how it got started and, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, racing actually started in Europe, all right.  Auto racing started in Europe, and then it sort of got over here.  I, I know the history of Indy [Indianapolis 500], you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, why don't you talk about Indy?
Speaker 2: You know, I mean Indy, the first race in Indy was, I think 1911. 1911 was the first Indy 500.  And it was either 1911 or 1917, one or the other, but it was very early on.  And it, it wasn't a big event in the beginning, the Indianapolis 500.  And it sort of, actually, it sort of, during World War II, things got real bad.  I mean the economy was not able to, you know, have drivers racing on Memorial Day when we needed them overseas.  After the war, Tony Hulman bought Indianapolis Motor Speedway [Indiana] and sort of built it to what it is today.  But it's been on a long time.  Now, my first year at Indy was 1991.  And that was the seventy-fifth running of Indy 500.  Prior to that, there had been no black race drivers in history to race in the Indy 500.  So the--it was the seventy-fifth annual, seventy-fifth running, and being the first was--it was, it was special for me from the standpoint, one that, all my career, all my life, you dream about racing the Indy 500.  That's the biggest race in the world.  There's nothing close to it when it comes to its prestige and magnitude.
Story_ID: 19301
Speaker 1: And growing up, you, you know, all my dad's, a few of my dad's friends raced in the Indy 500 [Indianapolis 500].  Dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.] never did it, but I, I, I felt that that was something that I wanted in my career.  And then I had worked my way up and won a lot of races and put myself in position to be in the Indy 500.  But Corporate America was not interested in me being in the Indy 500.  The corporate sponsors, the consumer goods companies that we all spend billions of dollars on.  Despite my success as a driver in working my way up the ranks, I wasn't picked to race for the big teams because the big corporate sponsors, such as Philip Morris and Marlboro and, and Texaco and all these other companies, they weren't interested in seeing me race.  And that's when I got the phone call from [Bill] Cosby.  And I was stunned to get that phone call.
Speaker 2: Can you talk about that?  We're getting ahead of ourselves, but can you talk about that, and then I want to go back.
Speaker 1: Sure.  I was winning a lot of races in Trans-Am [Road Racing Series] and other championships.  And the same guys that I was racing against, and that I was beating, were getting the phone call to go to the, to the mountaintop, which is Indy car racing and the Indy 500.  And I won a race one day in June, June of 1989, I think, eighty-eight [1988] or eighty-nine [1989].  I think it was eighty-eight [1988], and the phone rang, and my dad called me.  And he said, "Bill Cosby wants to talk to you."  I said, "Is someone playing a joke?"  He says, "I don't think so.  There's a guy who's calling for him.  He wants you to call him back.  He's up in San Francisco [California], and he wants you to call at six o'clock."  So I called, and, you know, a gentleman answered the phone by the name of Cam Cooper, Bill's valet.  And he says, "Here's the boss."  Well, he handed Cosby the phone and Bill says to me, "Can we make any money?"  I said, "Pardon me, sir?"  Well, "Can we make any money?  How much money can we make if I get a race car for you?"  I said, "None."  I said, "You'll, you're probably going to lose money."  "Well, I know Paul Newman, and I know Newman doesn't spend a--he, he's doing it.  And he, he's so cheap, he doesn't even buy coffee.  So, how's he racing?"  I said, "Well, he's got sponsors that are putting up the money, and, you know, they're spending--they're underwriting it, which"--"Well, okay.  I'm gonna be in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] in two days, and I want you to call my secretary, Ms. Kielhan, and she's gonna tell you where you're going to fly to, and I'm gonna have a car pick you up and bring you to the hotel.  And you're going to tell me how we can do this."  And that's how it happened.  It was--and so I flew down there in two days.  And I told him that there were a lot of, you know, I didn't know how many sponsors were jump out of the trees with money.  "Well, you let me handle that."  Well, anyway, as it turned out, no sponsors came forward.  No corporate sponsors came forward when Bill Cosby announced that he was going to support me in Indy Car racing. None.  They all sat, sat in the trees like a bunch of vultures and just sat there.  And so Cosby decided, "Well, that's okay.  I have the money myself, and I'm gonna spend my money for you to go to Indy.  Now, I don't know what Camille [Cosby] is gonna say about it, but I'm gonna spend it anyway."  Anyway, as it turned out, Camille loved the idea, and we did it.  And in 1991, we went into the history books, and I say "we" because without Cosby, it would have never happened.  Bill was the man.  I mean I, I love that man because, I mean not only did he have the vision, but he had the balls.  I mean he, you know, and, a lot of people are--and he is very smart.  I mean his, I mean he understands, he--when I sat down with him, and he says, "What's, why does it cost this?  Why does it cost this?  What are we buying, what am I buying in?"  And I said, "This is what you're buying, and if you were, if you owned a major corporation, and you wanted to have your advertising and marketing department underwrite this, this is what you're buying."  And he says, "Understood."  And it took him about ten minutes to figure out how it all worked and where the money was spent.
Speaker 2: How much was the cost?
Speaker 1: Four hundred thousand [dollars], to do Indy only, four hundred thousand cash, and he wrote it all in one check.  And, and what I love--what was amazing about Mr. Cosby is that he didn't have any agents, any lawyers involved, none of that.  He looked at me, and he says, "I'm going to do this."  He said, "I don't like racing.  I don't like it, I don't love it, I don't watch it.  I love--" (airplane noise)
Speaker 2: Sorry.
Speaker 1: No problem.  (Pause.)  And he said to me, he says, "But I like what you've done in your career.  I like what you represent.  I like where you come from.  And that's why I'm doing it, and I feel that you're qualified to be in the biggest race in the world, but maybe you're not gonna be able to get there without a little, a little support from somebody that knows the business, somebody that knows how, how the game's played in America, especially with you being a pioneer and a first."  And, yeah, it was--he was very, I mean he was no-nonsense.  And he said to me, he says, "I'm going to do this, but promise me one thing."  I said, "What's that?"  And he said, "Don't damage me."  That, that I understood one--I mean I thought I was up at the ranch [Santa Clara, California] with my grandpa [Henry Ribbs] again.  "Don't damage me."  In other words, "I'm doing this, but represent"--you know, I understood clearly, I'm--"yes, sir."  And I--that's all anyone can ask.  He didn't want anything from it.  He just said, "Go out there, do it, but be a professional."
Story_ID: 19302
Speaker 1: Willy, how had he [Bill Cosby] heard about you?
Speaker 2: Read.
Speaker 1: Read, he was following you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and read, and saw maybe different interviews, I think.
Speaker 1: Did he know at all the problems you were having with sponsorship?
Speaker 2: Sure, he did.  He knew.  He knew.  There was a lot of articles.  There had been many stories written about "How come Willy T. Ribbs is not racing for Roger Penske?"  "How come Willy T. Ribbs is not racing for Jim Hall or Newman-Haas or some of the big teams?  How come the other drivers were getting the phone calls and Willy T. Ribbs wasn't?"  And he knew it, and Cosby, I mean he, he was a pioneer in his own right.  He understood.
Speaker 1: So how did this whole thing make you feel?  I mean this is sort of out of the blue for you.
Speaker 2: I felt, I mean I felt honored.  I mean, I, it was, it--you get a lot of different emotions when, when you get, when you get the call that you don't expect or something.  You--it was, it overwhelming at first.  And I was proud.  I mean I was, I was proud of that.  I said, "Wow, everything that my grandfather [Henry Ribbs] taught me as a kid, that the harder you work, the luckier you get, paid off."  I mean it all came, it all came around.  I thought, "Wow."  My grandpa said "Never quit; never turn the other cheek."  He said, "If you turn the other cheek, you're gonna be, your neck is gonna be turning back and forth so much, you won't be able to see forward."  He said, "But you be tough, and you be honest at the same time, but you don't take any crap."  And that's how I conducted my whole life and my whole career.  And, and, and I, and, and by all means, by--without--you never give in.  I mean he was really hard on that.  You just don't--there's no way, no, wasn't--there was--there's no such thing as "I can't make something happen."  You figure it out.  That's your job as a man.  You figure it out, how to make it happen, come hell or high water.
Story_ID: 19303
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that race, since we're there now.  I want go back there, but can you talk about that race?
Speaker 2: When I got, when it was announced that Bill [Cosby] and I were gonna do the Indy 500 [the Indianapolis 500], the media, I mean worldwide media, were there.  And when I--you know, Indy is not a three-day event.  Indy is a month-long event.  And, you know, every other race, every race except for Indy is, you arrive on Friday, you practice and qualify.  And you practice and qualify on Saturday and you race on Sunday.  And Sunday night you're on a, on the first thing smoking out of town, heading home.  Well, when you get to Indy, you get there the first part of May, first week of May, and you don't leave until the end.  And every day, you're practicing, and practice--then you qualify.  You practice a solid week.  So every day you wake up in the morning, you're running 220 miles per hour, every day.  And you're watching drivers crash and they're all practicing to qualify because, out of seventy cars, they only take thirty-three.  So there's a lot--there's guys that are not gonna make the race, so everybody's hanging it out.  And it was--Cosby, when, when I went there, he says--he didn't say anything.  It was amazing.  He said, "Okay, go have fun."  No pressure, no nothing, no--"Call me every day.  Don't, don't crash that car though and cost me more money." (laughter)  It was, he was--and so every day, I'd call him, and he'd say, "Did you get a flat tire?  How much is that?  What, how many tires did you use?  Do I got--do I need to buy more fuel?"  It was, it was funny.  He kept it very light and very easy.  But every day I walked out to the track, there was a hundred photographers.  There was media everywhere, documenting the whole--every day.  And what, when I was there, I, I felt that the media, there were, there were many, there was a lot of supporters.  The support from the fans was overwhelming.  But you could tell there was an element there that was looking for a crack.  "Here he's coming here, the first guy in seventy-five years to do this, with a, with a, with, with all the pressure and all these--and the greatest drivers in the world."  Mario Andretti, I'm on the same race track, and I'm racing on the same track as Mario Andretti and A. J. Foyt and all of the legends.  And I'm in that crowd.  I'm in the, I'm at the mountaintop.  And, but every day you, you put on your helmet, you take off your helmet, the cameras were there.  And they were just, they were zooming in.  You could see that lens go right up into your face.  And they were, you could tell they were looking, is, "Is he, is, is he getting weak."  And it was--that part I noticed.  But as the weeks went on, the days went on, it got easy, I just went in and just drove.  And I had a good guy.  I had one of the best engineers in the sport working with me.  And that made it easy cause no matter how great a driver you are, you've got to have a great engineer, and--
Speaker 1: Who was your engineer?
Speaker 2: Tim Wardrop, Tim Wardrop from England.  And he was--he sort of looked like Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr.  I mean he had the hair; he was very eccentric, but a very brilliant guy.  I mean he was very smart.
Speaker 1: How did he come on your team?
Speaker 2: When, when Cosby put up the money, I went and, and we hired a guy named Derrick Walker.  And Derrick Walker was, he was, he used to work for Roger Penske.  He was Roger Penske's team manager.  And Derrick Walker had a reputation for winning races.  And he won a lot of races with Penske, and they won the Indy 500.  Well, Walker went out on his own.  He broke from Penske and started his own team.  And I told Bill about it.  I said, Derrick Walker's available.  We can get him with the money we have.  So we hired Derrick Walker to do it, and he put the team together, and the crew.  And he bought the car with Cosby's money, and Walker really was shocked about Cosby because when I told Derrick Walker about this, he says, "Is he serious?".  I said, "Yes.  And he's so serious, he wants you to come to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] and meet with him, Derrick."  Well, Derrick flew to Vegas, and I met Derrick in Vegas.  We're all there, and Cosby's got a show at the Vegas Hilton.  And after the show is over, we all met in the dressing room, at--about midnight.  We were in the dressing room till 4:00 in the morning.  And the deal was done.  And Cosby and Walker shook hands, and in two days, Derrick Walker had the check.  He called me; he was shocked.  He says, "I've got the money."  I said, "You sound surprised."  He says, "Nobody does a deal like that in auto racing where you get the money in two days."  And I said, "You're dealing with Mr. Cosby.  You're dealing with a Clydesdale.  We're not talking Shetland Pony or some shyster or some"--the auto racing industry is full of people like that.  Even the corporate sponsors.  You do a deal with them, you shake hands with them, and you don't, you know, they hold the money up or they, or they, or they chop it down or they--real sleaze buckets.  I mean, I really have no respect for Corporate America, none.  They're all a bunch of hyenas.  They're hyenas.  They have no integrity.  They're dogs, and Enron and all these other companies are a classic example, Arthur Andersen, you know, you just go down the list, and, you know, and, and exist in the sport of auto racing.  And that's what I think shocked Derrick.  Here was a guy that shook hands, didn't sign a contract even.  The money was there in two days.  I said, "Well, what'd you think?  That's Bill Cosby."
Story_ID: 19304
Speaker 1: What do you think the industry thought of Bill Cosby?  I mean he's not a racer.  He wasn't a racing fan.  I mean what do you think people thought?
Speaker 2: Well, Cosby, they, the industry knew that Cosby was a big guy, okay.  Whatever obstacles that were out there, you know, that were in front of me, there weren't, they didn't--there was no red tape when Bill announced that he was coming in, although there was no corporate, you know, sponsors that were running at, you know, Cosby.  And Bill was offering them a great deal.  Bill said to them, "Look, you sponsor my driver in this team, and not only will you get the team, but I'm gonna give you a commercial on top of it."  So he, he--the industry definitely respected him, you know.  Indy [Indianapolis 500] car racing wanted him in there, the, the sanctioning body wanted him.  Indy car racing definitely liked that Cosby was involved, and that I was there.  But the corporate sponsors there, they had that, you know how ostriches put their head in the sand.  "We know you're there, and there's a ton of publicity, but we, we, we're, we're not quite sure," you know.  That was the, that was always the--"We, we don't--it's not in the budget," which we all know is a bunch of crap.  They, they knew where their money was.  They knew what they could do.  Bill and I both knew that.  But that wasn't gonna stop Cosby.  But when we got to Indy, I mean when I got there, the red carpet was out, I'm telling you that.  There was not a lot of--I mean, the owner of the [Indianapolis Motor] Speedway [Indiana], Mary Hulman, she, she was, you know, I was on every party invite list for the month of May.  Any party that was put on by the Speedway, they had me there, and it was great, and, you know, the Hulman family is a great family.  I mean they--it was very memorable.  But, but the industry, you know, and, and there were a lot of drivers that went out of their way to help me, Mario, Michael Andretti, Mario Andretti, Rick Mears.  They--it was, from that standpoint, it was very positive.
Story_ID: 19305
Speaker 1: And can you talk about the race [the Indianapolis 500]?  You talked about the, you know, now, you said for a whole month, that--
Speaker 2: For a whole month.
Speaker 1: Now, but, when you get towards the end, that's when you qualify, of sorts--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: You qualify. Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, like a week before or?
Speaker 2: It was a week before the race when I qualified.  And it was a final day of qualifying.  You get four days to qualify.  You get two days in the first weekend, two days in the second weekend.  And by then, they're starting to weed out--you know, the slower guys are getting tossed out cause they're not making the show.  And on the last day of qualifying, with a half an hour left to go, I qualified.
Speaker 1: You were--oh, that's tight.
Speaker 2: Half an hour, because we had had some engine failures all month long.  We had a lot of engine failures which set, you know, each time you have an engine failure, you got to change it and it takes half a day to do it, and you know, but we had a lot of setbacks, but when it came down to being in the--to making it happen, I mean with a half an hour left, I went out, and to qualify at Indy, you race, you have to do four laps.  And they take your average speed for four laps.  And on every race, they take your fastest lap--every other race, they take--you do one or two laps, and they take your fastest lap.  At Indy, you have to do four laps which is ten miles, which is really grueling, ten mile run.  And I think my qualifying speed was two hundred and--I averaged 217 miles per hour, 217 mile--and a half miles per hour, average, top speed of about 231.  We were pulling 231 down the straight.  And when I went out to qualify, I, I--it was amazing; I wasn't nervous.  I had a, I knew Tim Wardrup had a great handling car for me cause at Indy it's all handling, no matter how great a driver you are.  That place is so difficult and so dangerous.  Remember it was a track that was built in 1911 when the cars were only going seventy miles per hour.  The track hadn't widened at all, and the cars were doing 230 miles per hour.  So it was very narrow, very fast, the, there--the conditions changed all the time.  It would be hot--you'd be cool in the morning, hot in the afternoon, windy.  The wind changed the handling of the car.  There was just--it was, it--and, and Indy is a mental thing.  I mean it's, because of the prestige and the intensity and the pressure to go fast.  And then you had all these outside elements, the changing of the weather, which changed the handling of the car.  You know, when you jump in your street car, no matter what kind of conditions there are, it handles pretty much the same.  Well, on an Indy car, things change.  I mean ten degree weather change will make the car lose five, six, eight miles per hour, just doesn't go around the corners fast.  The air is not--the air is thinner.  And with thinner air, you have less down force.  Cool air gives the car a lot of grip.  Engine likes it, the car likes it.  It goes around the corner better.  So, you know, when it gets hotter, you got to start readjusting the wings and changing the, the shock angles and, and tire pressures.  Everything changes, so it's always--it's like playing chess with the car all the time.  But then you have the other element, the, the emotional side.  So all this was happening, but we got to the last day of qualifying, and when I rolled out--it's a big ceremony.  As the cars roll down through tech inspection to, to go out to qualify, you go down, it's media following you, you go down and you meet with the chief steward.  And Tom Binford was the silver-haired man, sort of looked like, he looked sort of like, and sounded like Robert Mitchum, with silver hair.  And I could (tape cut off)--
Story_ID: 19306
Speaker 1: On that Sunday, in fact, it was May nineteenth, Sunday, May nineteenth, 1991, and I knew that May nineteenth was Malcolm X's birthday.  And not--I, I didn't think about it until afterwards, after I qualified.  And Malcolm X was a hero of mine.  And I remember when, when we got in and Tom Binford, the chief steward, gave me my instructions.  He says, "Look, you've got to do four laps, right.  If anything happens during your run, you can pull off.  As long as you don't take that fourth lap, you can pull off in the third lap and redo it, if you're not happy with your speed."  He says, he looked at his watch, he says, "I'll get you back in.  If you don't like your first run," he says, "I'll bring you back to the front of the line."  I mean he, he was bound and determined to make sure I was gonna be in that race.  "But," he said, "But, you know, it looks like you're gonna be fine."  So I put on my helmet, slid down in the car.  And I, I remember I was always looking down; I wasn't nervous.  I was really--I had never, I felt so calm because my practice run before that went so well.  So I knew what was gonna happen pretty much, and the practice run I made was on old tires, and the car went pretty fast.  And Tim Wardrop, you know, was very, he's very English, very cool and doesn't get rattled about anything.  He says, "All right, William, go out and give it a run."  That was his, that's, that was his final words: "Go out and give it a run".  And, you know, they--and as I was doing this, all these bulbs, these lights were flashing from cameras, click, click, click, click.  They were going, "This is the final moment."  This was it.  And so my, Derrick Walker, the team owner gave the signal to start the engine.  So he started it.  As I was going--as you go out of the, of the chief steward area onto to the pit lane, it's a formality at Indy that all the officials stand in rows.  And they stand in a row of about, oh, it's got to be 200 yards long, all the officials on each side, and you go in between them.  And they have their shirts on, and they're all giving you the thumbs up as you roll down in between them.  And I'm going, I was actually going pretty fast, you know, about eighty miles per hour down the pit lane.  And the one black official at the [Indianapolis 500] Speedway [Indiana], I'll never forget this.  He was towards the end of the parade of officials, and he looked at me, and I could see the look in his eyes as I--and I got my, my helmet visor down, and I'm, I'm like this right (looking straight ahead)?  And I caught the look as I was rolling out, and, and I looked up like this, and I, as I went by him, he was like (stretched eyes), he was like, he had a look like, he was like go--and I could tell what that meant to him, the look on his face.  He almost had tears in his eyes.  I could see tears in his eyes.  And I thought, I say, "Okay, Ribbs.  Don't get emotional now."  So I, you know, roll down onto the track, and put the, put the stick down, and, you know, I had a good run.  We ran almost 218 miles per hour. And I was in the race [the Indianapolis 500]. But what was amazing, to do ten miles at Indy at that speed is two minutes and forty seconds, ten miles in two minutes and forty seconds.  And they give you--after four laps, you come in, and I knew I was in the race, and as I was going around the track to cool, cool down to come in cause two and half miles around the suites, around the outside, the pit--the, the hospitality suites, people were, I--that's when it hit home that I was actually in the Indy 500 because every level of the pit suites along the track, people were waving their arms.  They were waving and they were pumping their fists.  Then you can't hear it, you can't hear cheers at that speed.  All you can do is see it.  And as I came around, everyone on the race track, everyone in the pits, all the competitors and other team members all came out to stop me on the--I couldn't even get to the, to the station where they take pictures.  And, and they stopped me.  So I just went around it, and I got down there, and Mary Hulman, the owner of the track [Indianapolis Motor Speedway] was there, and the media, and it was pandemonium.  It was, it was almost like a dream.  It was like a dream.  And the one official was there, and as we were being taken to the press room, I saw him; he was crying.  And, and it almost--and you have to have a, sort of a hard--during that month of May, you have to harden yourself.  You can't, you almost have to let your emotions, you, stay in the hotel room.  You leave them at home.  You don't bring them to Indianapolis [Indiana].  You leave your emotions at home.  And when I saw him, he came up to me, and he gave me a hug, and I could see tears in his eyes.  It almost made me cry.  I said, "Damn, I can't cry. I can't go to the press room with tears in my eyes.  I got to go in there like [Bill] Cosby would expect me to."  We did it.  And, but that really hit home, when I saw him, cause he was about sixty-five, seventy years old.  He had been at that track for forty years, and he witnessed--I mean it was--it, it's things like that, that make you understand about struggle and history and purpose and character and, you know, and success.  All those, you--all in a split second.
Story_ID: 19307
Speaker 1: So I was asking about [Bill] Cosby?
Speaker 2: He--my older brother, Phil [Philip Ribbs], was there in the team uniform.  And he had a cell phone.  And, and right there, when I was pulling down the pit lane, when I was coming in, and through, you know, to get the--Phil was already on the phone with my mom [Geraldine Ribbs] first.  My mom was on the phone, and, you know, she was very, very pleased.  She was ecstatic.  And then the phone beeped, and it was Cosby.  And my brother Phil, said, "Oop, sorry, mom, the boss is on the phone.  We'll call you back."  So Bill came on and said, "What--tell your brother, could he have gone faster?"  And my brother says, "Well, yeah, he did, he went pretty fast."  "How much did that cost me?  How much did that run?  What did that cost?  Do you need more money?"  (Laughter)  Oh, Bill was so funny.  He, he made, he made everything easy, you know.  He would not let--he would not put the hammer on my head, you know.  He knew that it was tough enough, and he just kept it, kept it very, very funny.  Then he said, "Tell, you tell the team, and tell Derrick [Walker] that dinner is on me tonight, but don't spend any more than two hundred dollars" (laughter).  Ah, it was funny.  He was the greatest.  That, that month of May was, it was a storybook.
Story_ID: 19308
Speaker 1: So you qualified, but then after the qualification, qualify--?
Speaker 2: After the qualifying is over, you're--it, it's, it's almost anticlimactic because the toughest thing about Indy [the Indianapolis 500] is being in the race.  That's the hardest thing, because there's seventy-five guys that are hurting themselves, that are borderline killing themselves.  And drivers, many drivers have gotten killed trying just to be in the race.  Forget about the race.  They got killed in practice or they got killed in qualifying for, you're there a month.  And everyday you wake up, you go to sleep, and when you wake up in the morning, you know you've got to run 200 and plus miles per hour, 220, every day for a month.  See, it's easy to do that for three days, go out there, you know, not a whole lot of risk, just don't do any--but for a month?  Something is bound to happen, whether it's a driver error or mechanical failure, something's bound to happen.  And that wall is just waiting.  That wall just sits there patiently.  And the wall's never lost a battle, never.  And it was very intense from that standpoint.  You had to--and, and you had to sleep.  You couldn't go home after, you know, you--cause it was a routine.  You're at the track all day practicing, qualify, prac--I mean practice, practice, practice.  Then you'd go out to dinner with sponsors or you'd go out to dinner with media or whomever, right.  And then you go back to your condo and go to sleep, and you wake up.  And you're on the track from eleven a.m. to six every day.  But you know when you go to sleep, you got to go fast the next day.  Now, you're thinking to yourself, well, nothing happened today.  What's tomorrow gonna bring?  Are the dis--the, what it did--when Indy was over, when that month of May in 1991 was over, the race was anticlimactic.  I mean when you qualify on Sunday, you're off all week cause it's all media.  It's like the Super Bowl, all media and all interviews and then they get ready.  You don't drive any more until that next weekend, when the race starts.  And when I left Indy when the race was over, I had a mechanical failure so I didn't finish the race, which was sort of a letdown, but that happens to a lot of driver--and the best of them all have mechanical failures.  When it was over, it was almost sad.  It was, it was almost depressing because you were in such, you were in such an intense environment and so, everything was so huge.  And when the race was over after a month, I mean I, I mean almost wanted to cry, like, "Damn, it's over."  It's--I'm leaving Indianapolis [Indiana]. I mean, it was like going to war.  It's like, you're--I've been asked many times, "What's it like to go to Indianapolis and be there and be in the biggest race on the planet?"  It's like going to war.  It's the best I could describe it.  And either--you know, when you go to war, you can either come back injured or dead or come back alive.  And that was the feeling.

Speaker 1: I had wanted to ask you about the game, and, you know, and you attending races with your father [William T. Ribbs, Sr.], and how many blacks were ever at any of these races?  And I also wanted to know if you raced go car--go--?  Go--?
Speaker 2: Go-carts?
Speaker 1: --as a young person?
Speaker 2: I, my--when I was growing up, dad never raced, so I never raced go-carts.  No, I went to the tracks that had the races, and I raced on those tracks privately, but I never actually raced in go-cart competition.  I did race motorcycles in competition, but not go-carts.  But I mean we had a lot of go-carts, but dad never put me in go-cart races.  And as far as my growing up at the tracks with my dad, that was, he was the only one.
Speaker 1: And you came away always feeling you were accepted there?
Speaker 2: When I was young, and I was with my dad, I didn't, you don't understand whether you were accepted or not.  You don't comprehend that.  I felt that my whole career, when I went to Europe to race--my parents sent me to Europe, when I got to Europe, it was no problem.  I mean they--I was accepted right away.  I was, I was winning races, and, and I was going fast, and that's all that mattered in Europe.  When I came back here, I raced--ninety percent, it was ninety percent acceptance.  There was all, there was always that element there that said, hey, look, you know, and it, and you could tell how they were raised, you know, and it's sort of, it all starts from when the egg, egg cracks that, that they just had a hard time, many had a hard time with it because they were taught from the beginning to think of themselves one way and me another.  And I faced off with them.  And I think they had a problem with that I would not--you know, I was pretty, pretty aggressive with my driving and pretty aggressive with my, you know, your--I'm not going to--you're, there's not going to be any double standards.  I made that clear, you know, and there's not gonna be a rule for you and a rule for me.  I think the only place that had the toughest time with me was NASCAR [National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing].  NASCAR did not, they didn't love me at all, at all. They weren't--they did--NASCAR made it clear, "We don't want you here."  That's why I didn't take [Bill] Cosby's money and go to NASCAR.  I went to Indy Car [the Indianapolis 500] cause I knew there was, you know, that the drivers--Indy Car racing is very refined, and they pride themselves on their refinement.  Now, you know, you can be a racist and live in upstate New York, you know.  You don't have to--not all racists live in Alabama and Mississippi.  I mean you, you can be a racist anywhere in America.  But Indy Car racing was, was a little different.  And then they, and when I came in with Cosby, it was--Corporate America wasn't the greatest, and, you know, they made it clear, their position.  But many members of the Indy Car fraternity were very good people.  I mean, very good.
Story_ID: 19310
Speaker 1: Now, you were going to these races with your father [William T. Ribbs], and your, but you--did you live with your grandfather [Henry Ribbs] the whole time you were in, you know, in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was up on the ranch [Santa Clara, California] my whole high school years.
Speaker 1: And your grandfather, you said, education wasn't really that--I mean school was not that important in the whole scheme of things?
Speaker 2: It was, you know, he, he got up to eighth grade, and then, you know, his father, my great-grandfather, Felix Beck, had him, you know--my great-grandfather owned a lot of timberland down in Louisiana, I mean a ton of timberland, which he sold to the railroad companies for railroad ties.  So my grandfather worked for his father and ended up coming out to, you know, from Louisiana to California at an early age.  He got kicked out of Southern University [Scotlandville, Louisiana] and a couple of universities he was going to attend, he got kicked out for fighting.  My grandfather was very, he was a very tough man.  He didn't, and he was a little--he wasn't very big.  He was only five-two, five-three, but he was a fierce man, and a very good looking man.  He was very stunningly, a very nice looking man.  And he--but he was also, you know, he, he'd whack you as soon as look at you, especially, his grand kids or his kids.  Oh man, he, he'd put the belt on you.  I mean that was his style.  But it was all for a reason.  It wasn't because he was mean.  He was a very intelligent man, but he wanted to set, set the stage for you for life.  This is the way it's gonna be.
Story_ID: 19311
Speaker 1: Shaquille O'Neal talks a lot.  He's one of the young athletes today I really respect cause I mean his father [Philip O'Neal] was very disciplined.  And he raised him, you know, the right way.  And Shaquille's a tough guy.  He doesn't take any nonsense.  He's very intelligent.  I, I respect how he, he was brought up, and I respect how he--his whole way of dealing with people and life and success, and everything, very structured, very tough.  And I, I, I think that's important.
Story_ID: 19312
Speaker 1: It came time for you to graduate; what did you want to do?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was, no question, it was racing.
Speaker 1: It was racing.
Speaker 2: It was, it was racing from the time I was nine years old.  There was no doubt what I was going to do.
Speaker 1: So what did your, what did your--your grandfather [Henry Ribbs] didn't want that?
Speaker 2: No, he, he didn't want to even hear about it.
Speaker 1: And then your father?
Speaker 2: My dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.] didn't have a problem with it.  I think my father was--when I got out of high school, my parents sent me to Europe, to England to race cause I wanted to be a Formula One Grand Prix driver.  So that's why they sent me to England.  And I knew a lot of great drivers, in their amateur part of their career, went to England to race.  That's what I wanted to do, and they sent me over there.  And I think my dad wasn't quite sure how committed I was.  He wasn't sure whether I was going over there to party or go over there to race.  And when I won my first race which was my second race, my first race, I finished third.  My second race I won.  He thought, "Okay."  And when I called home, and I said, "Well, I won."  "How'd you do?"  "I won."  And they were like, "You won?"  "Yes, I won."  And then, my next race I won, and then they were like, "Well, okay."  And then my grandfather was paying attention then.
Story_ID: 19313
Speaker 1: When did you say you were being chased out of town, you know, that the police were--was that before that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was, no, it was before I went.
Speaker 1: It was before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, before I went to England.  And as a matter of fact, what had happened was my, my dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.] was on the Grand Jury in San Jose [California] about that time of my wild days and when I was going to high school.  And I, you know, I was up at the ranch [Santa Clara, California], but I'd still come home to San Jose on different times.  Well, I got a, a speeding ticket--
Speaker 1: Hold on, sorry (airplane).  Let's give it a try.
Speaker 2: So, where were we?
Speaker 1: You were at your (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, speeding.  I was, I had had a, you know, a pretty great record of going fast around town.  I don't know if it was, you know, it was good for me, but it wasn't, didn't look good for my driving record.  Well, after about my nineteenth ticket, and this was--this particular ticket, I had gotten on the motorcycle, I was before the judge.  And the judge name was Brown, I'll never forget.  And he knew my father and my whole family.  And he says, "Young Ribbs, your father races cars doesn't he?"  And I says, "Yes, he does".  He says, "I think that you would probably make more money on the race track than you will here in the courtroom because it's gonna cost you in here.  So, I suggest you take up the racing career, and, and do all your speeding on the race track."  And that was sort of the end of my ticket days, around then.  I mean I still got speeding tickets, but not two or three a week like I was getting.
Speaker 1: So you were (laughter) you went off to England--so but what did you say, your father was on the Grand Jury--you said something--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was on the Grand Jury, and it was one of these Grand Juries where you're on it for like a month or a year.  Well, he was on it for a long time.
Speaker 1: So you getting driving tickets wasn't very good is what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Well, no, dad didn't, dad didn't care about that.  It's just that he knew some of the judges down there, and, and, you know, the, the D.A. [District Attorney] was a great friend of the family's.  And so it was, you know, it was just--dad didn't, wasn't upset about it.  It was, he would just say, "They're gonna yank your license (laughter), you know, if you don't cool it."  So, you know, that was it.
Story_ID: 19314
Speaker 1: Now, when you went to England, how was that experience?  Where did you go in England?  Where's the Grand--is it in London?  No?
Speaker 2: No, it was in London.
Speaker 1: London.
Speaker 2: I lived about seventeen miles outside of London.
Speaker 1: So how did you enjoy that whole experience?  You hadn't been away from (simultaneous)--?  No, I hadn't been out of--well, I had been--I hadn't been out of the United States.  I'd been all around the United States with my dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.], but I hadn't been out of the United States.  When I got over there, they--I dressed in jeans and cowboy boots like I was on the ranch.  And they, they sort of--I was--amazing, I was a Yank.  I wasn't African American, I was a Yank when I was there.  And I, I think they were sort of--well, I was pretty, you know, I was very extroverted.  And I liked to have fun, and, you know, in between races, I was at the pub.  And one thing I noticed about England is there was a lot of fighting.  Oh, they get drunk, those English and Irish, and they'd get all together in the same pub and start drinking.  And there's a fistfight every time.  I thought that was great.  I mean, I said, "Wow, these guys actually fistfight each other," right?  And so I thought this was the greatest thing in the world.  I was stuck in the corner.  I was--because what was happening was, they were like--cause there was West Indians, too, from Trinidad and Jamaica, and everybody would be in a bar and start drinking.  And the next thing you know a fight would break out.  Well, I'm in the corner, and they'd sort of like look in my direction like a, you know, "You in this?"  "No.  I'm, I'm from America, babe, we--you know, you guys go ahead and have fun."  I was telling them I was from South Central [Los Angeles, California].  I did, said, "I'm from South Central, L.A."  And I'd show them my scar, and I'd pull up my, my sleeves and say, see that?  I'd show it to them.  I'd say, "That's a bullet wound."  I said, "So you know, where I come from it's real serious."  This, and this was a burn I got when I was when I was kid, but I'd tell them it was a bullet wound.  And, and they'd say (imitating Cockney accent), "Come on, mate, God, it, you all, you all are pretty, pretty rough over there in the, in the States, huh?"  And I said, "You bet."  I said, "Now, you guys go ahead and fight each other."  And it was wild.  And I liked the girls too.  There--it was, I was young, and I was just getting out of the house.  And I had this very structured childhood, right, where there was no running the streets and there was no partying.  And, you know, I mean this was, I mean my, when I--not only did I get out, I left the whole country when I got out, so I was, I was making up for a lot of--plus, I was racing over there.  And that was, everything was, if the word "youthful indiscretion" came up, my face would be next to it (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's cute.  So what, how long were you in England?
Speaker 1: I was there two years.
Speaker 2: Two years.  So did you come back with an English accent?
Speaker 1: No, but I knew, I could understand the, the, you know, I knew what, you know, blymie meant, and that quid, quid, quid was a--you know, they say pounds over there.  And when you say pounds or--it means dollars here.  Well, I was, quid is another way of saying bucks, a hundred bucks or a hundred quid.  And so I was fortnight, two weeks, and, you know, yeah, I, I learned the slangs pretty well.  But I didn't have the accent, and I didn't want to lose my, my accent.  And my accent got me a long ways over there.
Speaker 2: So what year did you come back?
Speaker 1: I came back in seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine, okay.  And you had own how many races there?
Speaker 1: I'd won, the--my first year when I won the Dunlop Championship, which was six out of eleven races.  And then in seventy-nine [1979], I, I was without a sponsor and I ended up only racing a couple of times, and then I came home.
Story_ID: 19315
Speaker 1: You know, there is a lot of irony in life, and there's a lot of irony in auto racing.  I mean some, you know, you--some of the greatest drivers in the history have, you know, would--they were almost, they were almost mistake-proof.  They very seldom made mistakes, if any.  And it was always something that killed them, maybe it was mechanical failure or someone else causing a crash.  I mean Jimmy Clark, mechanical failure.  Ayrton Senna, mechanical failure, Dale Earnhart, somebody hit him and turned him sideways, and he went into the wall head-on.  A lot--a few people, not a lot of people, during my career have asked me, "Has anyone ever tried to kill you?"  And I said, "Sure, I believe it."  I believe that there was--in a couple of incidents, I believe there were--not necessarily the drivers, but I, things that had happened during my career that I felt shouldn't have happened.  And maybe killing someone is a bit extreme, but I don't think, I don't think there would have been, there would have been a few people that wouldn't have been too sad if I would have gotten hurt real bad.  They--the Willy T. Ribbs was really not the guy they wanted in auto racing.  He was--the talent issue, me being able to win was a threat.  But me not, me being eyeball-to-eyeball, that was, that was too much, the not taking any shit from anybody.  I mean I, I've looked at, I mean that was my environment.  I came from a, a grandfather [Henry Ribbs] and a group of people that just didn't do that.  Now we're not gonna make any problems for you, but you're gonna make any problems for me either.  I mean that's how I was raised.  I mean I admire that in Jim Brown.  I admire that--I mean Muhammad Ali, it wasn't Ali's boxing ability that, that I was impressed with the most.  I--he was a great fighter, but what I was totally hooked on was his character, his courage, you know, the, the, "What are you gonna do?" attitude.  "What are you gonna do to me?," and that's, I mean a lot--you'd be surprised the, the drivers, black drivers that wanted to get into, up and coming, that said to me, and asked me, "How did you do it?  How did you deal with the elements, the social elements, the, the," and, you know, because people will try to intimidate you.  I mean you can move into a different, a, a neighborhood in Chicago [Illinois], and they might not want you there.  All right, so they want to intimidate you before you even get there or, or something.  It's all about intimidation to prevent you from going forward or doing what is your right to do.  I wasn't gonna be intimidated.  Are you kidding?  My grandfather would kick my butt.  He wouldn't, he--no way.  So I knew there was a risk that, you know, something might, could happen to me.  Somebody might do something to me, and how do you prove that, once it's, when it's over, when you're dead, how do you prove it?  Huh?  That it wasn't just an accident.  But I was willing to accept that risk.
Story_ID: 19316
Speaker 1: Now, when you came back from England, what were your thoughts then, what was the track that people, you know, you have to go.  And then I was, I--one other question.  Is there anything about what car you drive cause in England, you had driven Formula (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Formula Ford cars, right.
Speaker 1: --cars, and then you drove Formula?
Speaker 2: Atlantic--
Speaker 1: Atlantic.
Speaker 2: Which is bigger, more powerful.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2: When I came back to America, I just stepped right up to Formula Atlantic, and that was one step away from doing Indy [Indianapolis 500] cars.  And when you do Formula Atlantic, you're one step away from going straight to Indy car racing.
Speaker 1: Can you just explain that a little bit for people who have no idea?
Speaker 2: It would be like going from a Volkswagen Jetta to a, oh, God, I would say a--what would be the next step up?  Maybe a Camaro, you know.  And then when you go to Indy Car, it's like going from a Camaro to a jet fighter.  I mean when--Indy cars are jet fighters.  All the rest are, you know, less powerful, not as big, not as heavy.  And so the, as you, when you start racing, you start smaller divisions to build, you know, get experience.  And then you stepped up--as you get experience and success, up to more powerful cars and faster cars and bigger events.  The races become bigger and more prestigious.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, with the races that you did, how often are they held, you know (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: All year, fifteen, twenty races a year.
Story_ID: 19317
Speaker 1: Who's sponsoring you at this point to be able to do it professionally?  You don't--I mean, who's underwriting this effort?
Speaker 2: At this year, none .
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, I'm talking about when you even came back from Europe.
Speaker 2: When I came back from Europe, I came home with a trophy.  And I, I really didn't expect the phones to ring because nothing really happened.  I was at a race one day, and I met a, a guy by the name of Jim Trueman.  And Jim Trueman was the owner of a hotel chain.  I think the chain was Red Roof Inns.  He was the owner and founder.  And he was into racing.  He was sort of a philanthropist.  And I, he asked me what I was doing, and I said I wasn't doing anything.  I had no, no support to, to move, move on.  So he said to me, he says, he said, well, he says, "Didn't you win a championship in England?"  I said, "Yeah."  He says, "Well," he said, "I'm gonna be back in Ohio, and call me next week, and maybe we can do something."  And he did.  He did.  He, he backed me in Formula Atlantic, and he put up, you know, quite a bit of money.  And it graduated me right into Trans-Am [Road Racing Series].  In fact, I--the particular team owner in Trans-Am, and I went from Formula cars to stock car-type cars, production, race cars and I started winning right away in Trans-Am.  But, and then the first year I was in Trans-Am, I raced for this team that had General Motors products.  And I was beating Ford so bad that Edsel Ford met with me personally and said, "I'd like you to race for me."  He came up to me and said, "I'd like you to race my cars."  And that was really when everything really took off.  And Edsel Ford, I've always been and always will be critical of the manufacturing industry in this country.  I mean you got General Motors, you got Daimler-Chrysler, you've got, of course, Ford, you got the Big Three.  And of all the corporate people in the automotive industry that I've dealt with, Edsel Ford was the best.  He was just, Henry Ford's grandson, just a awesome, doesn't--didn't take his name too serious, just a awesome man.  Edsel was the best, and he was the most honest.  He was the honest.  He was very supportive, and what he said, he did.  And all the rest of those sapsuckers, you know--and I hate to be, to use that language, but they're really people of low integrity.  I was, I was amazed as I got into it and became a, a paid driver, a pro driver of, of the people that wore a suit and ties and how they got their job and, and just the mannerisms that they had, it was--I really lost--it, that was an eye opener.
Story_ID: 19318
Speaker 1: Just so people will understand the nature of this sport, when you get in and you're doing it professionally like you were, and you're starting to get sponsors, are people supporting you the whole year round so you can practice or do you have to also do other things to, you know, to exist?
Speaker 2: Well, what you do is you race for a team, and it's like a football player, you know, like Ronnie Lott or, you know, Jerry Rice playing for the [San Francisco] Forty-Niners and the [Oakland] Raiders, you are, one, hired by a team owner who has the sponsors.  Sponsors give the team owner the money, and the team owner hires the driver.  And you're paid a salary, and you're paid perks and prize money and appearances and all that.  That's how you--and the money is very good in auto racing.  The problem is, there might be someone in, that's, that, that's behind the scenes that might not want you to do well.  They, they might not want you to do well, and that's, that's always been the dilemma.  That's always been a big obstacle.
Story_ID: 19319
Speaker 1: Now, who did you find was really helping and watching out for you during your career though, cause, you know, you said, you know, I was young, I was brash, you know, I wouldn't step back, you know, I wouldn't--but I mean--?
Speaker 2: Coming up the ladder?
Speaker 1: Yeah, coming up the ladder.
Speaker 2: Paul Newman, very supportive.  Paul Newman, I would say was responsible for me getting my first pro deal.  When I went to Trans-Am [Road Racing Series] from Formula Atlantic, from Formula cars into being a pro, Newman was responsible for that.
Speaker 1: Can you explain?
Speaker 2: I knew Paul actually before I started racing cause when my dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.] was racing, and Newman was an amateur race driver.  So was my dad.  And I, I'd seen Newman occasionally at races, and just, "Hi," and all that, not a whole lot, talk a little bit.  When this, when this deal came along, the underwriter was Anheuser-Busch, Budweiser brand.  They were the underwriters.  Well, Newman had a relationship with them.  And it was around 1982, 1982. Reverend Jesse Jackson was upset with Anheuser-Busch, and he was getting ready to have a boycott, announce a boycott against Anheuser-Busch, as I was told, and based on their lack of African American distributors in the country, etc., etc.  Anheuser-Busch had its, a team, based in Portland [Oregon] that they sponsored.  And they asked the team owner to call me to see if I was available to race with him, right at the beginning of 1983.  What a coincidence, right?  And I knew this was happening, but I wasn't sure I had the deal.  So I called up Newman, and he called me right back.  And he said, "I have a relationship with them.  I know them, I know who the chief guy is in marketing.  I'm going to give him a call."  I got a call back three hours later from that guy at Anheuser-Busch.  And he says, "You've got the deal."  He said, "A silver-haired actor called me and recommended you," and that was that.  I was a pro.  I was a full-fledged, paid driver in 1983.
Story_ID: 19320
Speaker 1: So you're part of the team, but you have your sponsor as part of that or that's--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well,--
Speaker 1: --or that's a different thing.  It's different, you had moved past that?
Speaker 2: That, I, well, I had--I was not looking for sponsors anymore.  Now, I was racing for a team that had a sponsor, and, which is the easiest way to do it.  That's the best.  And I came into Trans-Am [Road Racing Series], and I was winning and winning and winning, and that's when [Bill] Cosby was watching me.  And the media was following this because they had never had a black driver that was winning like I was winning, ever, in pro racing.  And so I was winning, winning, winning, and that's when I got the call from Cosby in the late eighties [1980s].
Speaker 1: And that period from like 1983 to the late eighties [1980s], what else would you consider significant about that or, you know, events?  You, I know you received Pro Rookie of the Year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Pro Rookie of the Year.  I also was Driver of the Year in eighty-seven [1987] and eighty-eight [1988] and then in the International Motor Sports Association.  I, I, I guess everything was, was fine from eighty-three [1983] to the late eighties [1980s].  Everything was great.  I was one of the--what was missing was the phone call.  That's what was missing.  I mean I, I wasn't getting a phone--my other peers were getting phone calls from the big Indy car teams and stock car teams and, but I wasn't.  And then the phone rang, and it was Cosby one day.  I didn't know it until he told me later why he called.  He said, "Hey, I know what you're dealing with.  I know who you are, what you've done, and I know what you're up against."  And that was sort of the, it was, that was the last hurdle.
Story_ID: 19321
Speaker 1: Do you think that, that they believed that you weren't really--you know, sponsors look at demographics, and the demographic for a race car is white?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Do you think that was what their whole (unclear) thing was?
Speaker 2: Sure that's, that's an easy way out, isn't it?  They always fall back on that.  The, the theory was well, "Black people don't follow auto racing.  Why should, why should we have a black driver?"  No, wait just a minute.  I thought you were looking for a driver that could win races.  Oh, do we live in two separate countries here?  I thought you were looking for someone that could win.  Well, really, really, it wasn't about winning, was it?  It wasn't about winning.  And I found that out later because when you're young, you don't, you, you don't think about that.  All you think about is winning, and if you win, you should be able to, to progress and go forward and go to the top.  Well, I didn't find out until later that it, that was the theory, well, the, demographic.  Well hell, Tiger Woods just blew that into the weeds, didn't he?  And, and, and what these corporate executives who, who make these decisions don't realize that, in this country, all people follow winners, white, black, Asian, Hispanic, no matter who you are.  If you're a winner, people are going to follow you.  Michael Jordan proved that with all the endorsements, all the endorsements that he does, and, I mean he was one of the first major endorser to cross it over.  And, you know, it, the--it was almost, it was almost the excuse.  People can find any reason not to do something, you know.  The, the real, the real thinkers and the real, the, the real people, the real smart ones always figure out a way to do it.  And, I mean that, that--if anyone was ever to ask me, "What was your biggest obstacle as a racing driver?"  It wasn't the drivers.  It wasn't the competitors and the mechanics who wore Confederate flags on their, on their shirt.  It wasn't the rednecks and the hillbillies that I had to deal with, and in NASCAR [National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing], it was the corporate sponsors.  It was the Corporate America.  That was number one, and it's always been that way.  And what, what a lot of people were trying to make a point is, is how many billions of dollars that African Americans contribute to Corporate America, I mean billion--almost a trillion, right.  Well, no one is gonna do anything until they're, until it's put in front of their, put on their lap.  This is what we're spending, and this is what we're doing for you, and this is what you're not doing.  And I had no one to put, put that in front, put that on the table.  But with all that aside, I could win races, and I won races, and that didn't seem to matter.  It didn't matter.
Speaker 1: So Willy, how did that make you feel then?
Speaker 2: Oh, I just bucked up, even got more determined.  I just fought, I, I--there's just certain things in life that turn me on.  And if something's too easy, I get bored.  If it's too easy, I'm bored with it.  The tougher it is, the better I like it.  I mean I don't know (laughter), my grandfather [Henry Ribbs] used to say, "God damn it, you always do things the hard way."  And I don't know if taking this career path (laughter) was doing it the hard way to make a living, but I'll tell ya, it, I'd, I would do it all over again a million times.  I love the challenge of--and proving people wrong, proving them wrong.  That's what it's all about.

Speaker 1: Is it Dan Gurney?
Speaker 2: The greatest.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about him and the role that he's had to play?
Speaker 2: Dan Gurney I've known since I was a kid.  He, I, picture with him when I was a little kid on the wall, when my dad [William T. Ribbs, Sr.] was racing.  And I ended up racing for him when I became an adult.  I mean what a relationship to have, to know someone when you're a kid, and end up racing for them later on.  Dan, of all the team owners I've ever raced for, was the one I respected the most, that I admired the most, that was totally, it would--Dan, and Dan's a former legend, driver himself.  Dan understood what it, what a driver thinks.  And with Dan, it was about being a driver, not an African American driver.  With Dan, it was about being a racing driver.  That's all--and, and that's how he dealt with me.  He gave me the best at all times.  And even with his other drivers on the same team, it was no, there was nothing that I didn't get that I couldn't win with.  And I, and, and we were friends off the track too.  I mean we just had this bond.  And it was similar to the relationship I had with [Bill] Cosby, very similar.  And, and Dan told me, he told me once, once I started racing for him, he told me that many of his old racing friends called him up and asked him, "What the hell are you doing?  Why you hiring that nigger?"  His own sponsor, the sponsor that he had for his team, Dan told me, after we had won the championship that first year I raced for him, he told me during dinner, he says, "I was told that they weren't particularly in favor of having you as my driver."  That's what his own sponsors told him.  They were not--they weren't particularly overjoyed to have me.  However, if something goes wrong, they told him, "It's gonna be your responsibility."  So they told Dan, they threatened him.  They threatened him.  So, and, and what could go wrong, you know what I mean?  What really could go wrong?  I had no, I was not in trouble with the law.  I hadn't gotten--I'd never been in trouble with the, at all in my life, a speeding ticket.  What could go wrong?  And, yeah, Dan was to tell me later.  His friends called him up and his sponsor, the primary sponsor of that team threatened him.  "If anything happened, you lose your program."
Story_ID: 19323
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever say, maybe you didn't want to be the first, or were you surprised (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: No, I said that, I was asked, "Is it important for you"--the question was to me "Is it important for you, Willy T. Ribbs, to be the first black man ever to race in the Indy [Indianapolis] 500?"  I said, "No, what's important is that I race Indy 500, whether I'm the first or the last, it's important for me to be in this race."  That's what's number one, me as a competitor, first or last, me, I have to--because when you slide down into that cockpit, that race car doesn't really care (laughter).  You're the, you know, you've got to get the job done with it.  And it there's no--it has no preference to who's sitting behind the wheel.  So, yeah, I said that.  I wanted to be in that race, first or last, I got to be in this race.
Story_ID: 19324
Speaker 1: What do you still want to accomplish with things, and what is the sort of natural pattern of things for you now?
Speaker 2: I'm--you know, you, you see so many athletes, whether they're fighters or football players, they go on and on and on because it's not the money.  It's the feeling you get, it's that freedom.  I mean ["Sugar Ray"] Ray Leonard fought for a long time.  Muhammed Ali fought.  They all were just, this is--that's your life.  And to move on into another career after, from the time you were old enough to speak and spell and count, you've had this whole career.  This is all it's been.  To, to change horses and go down another path is, I can tell you, it's got to be very hard.  But you got to also be intelligent as well and know that, you know, you can't, you know, you can't run forever.  You know, when they--it's like a race horse, put that saddle on, you know, you, you know you're not gonna be running with those young horses any more after a while.  So I would say natural--the natural path is becoming a team owner.  But I will not become a team owner, just to be a team owner.  I will not put my name on the side of a sixteen-wheeler transporter just to be there.  It's gonna be done and it will be done right or it won't be done.  I will not be a team owner unless, unless there was some major aber--what is it called, aberration from Corporate America, which will never happen.  That I guarantee you.  They, they will not come to me like they've come to other guys, other drivers or former drivers and say, "Hey, we want--we know you're stepping out, and we want you to be--we want you, since you're gonna be a team owner, we would like to be the underwriter of your team."  Now, they've done it with lots of drivers, you know, former great drivers.  "You're not driving anymore, beautiful.  We want to still be involved with you, and we want you to sit and, with the microphone and the headset on and be a team owner.  And we want to underwrite your team because we know you're great and you're very smart technically.  And we know that you know how to put a team together and, and a, and an organization that can win races."  Willy T. Ribbs will never get that, ever.  So I'm not going to leverage everything that I've worked for, to just say I'm a team owner.  It will be done, and it will be done right, or it won't be done at all, because auto racing is not like--
Story_ID: 19325
Speaker 1: I don't have to be a team owner, but I know this sport as well as anybody.  I know it as well as [William] France and NASCAR [National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing].  I know it as well as, as Roger Penske.  I know it as well as all, everybody in that sport.  I know the politics of it, inside and out.  I know the technical side, and I know the political side.  And if I have to be a, a, a voice of change, well, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be right there.  I want, I will ride you like Buck Rogers rode Silver King.  You're not gonna get, you're not going to--you, you're gonna do it right.  You're going to represent what you say you are, cause NASCAR and Daytona 500, they call themselves "The Great American Race," don't they?  That's their title.  Indianapolis 500, they are "The Great Spectacle in Racing," that's their title, "The Greatest Spectacle in Racing," "The Biggest Race on Earth."  The Daytona 500, which is NASCAR, claims to be "The Great American Race."  Now, how do you define America, NASCAR, when all your drivers are all white, every one of them and have been that way from inception, with the exception of one guy.  And, and he was railroaded.  So, I'm going to make you, and you might think that that's a--that's not a threat, that's a promise.  You--as long as I'm living, will, you will stand by what you say you are. "The Great American Race", well, that's, is that what you call yourself?  Is all Americans represented in that race, to, were all the corporate sponsors in that race, that support that event, is that what you, you all, you corporate sponsors claims?  That this is "The Great American Race," your products are on it, but who's represented in it?  Who's represented?  And when we add it all up, who are all the Americans paying the bills for this Great American Race?  They are gonna hear from me as long as I'm living.

Speaker 1: You say, you know, my goal is really to have ownership, is there anything else that you have a goal of?
Speaker 2: Being a great father.
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about that because you have two lovely kids [Sasha and Theo Ribbs], and you're not worried about going to a race, and they're not worried about you going to a race and --
Speaker 2: And their father not coming home?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I always, to this, to this moment, I've always felt that there was a destiny for me from the time I was a young, young boy.  I felt that racing was my destiny, based on everything that happened, my growing up, where I grew up, my father [William T. Ribbs, Sr.] and how he grew up, and his friends.  Everything pointed me to where I am today, where it all--how it all happened.  And, you know, I have two children.  I have a daughter [Sasha Ribbs] and a son [Theo Ribbs], and they're fifteen and ten.  And I've been racing before they were born, right up to this day.  And I'm a single father, and I, my, I've been, my--when I became a single, a single parent, my daughter was four years old and my son was nine months old in diapers when they were put into my arms.  And I thought "Well, this is, this is good.  I'm a dad, I got two great kids.  I'm gonna do just what my grandpa [Henry Ribbs] would expect me to do and my whole family."  You got a responsibility, you honor it, and you make the best, you know, and--all you can reflect on is how you were raised.  You had all this support, and you had your uncles and your dad and grandfather, and you had all these people around you in your family that you, that were successful.  And they're expecting you to be successful.  Well, you expect that out of your own kids, and you buck up and you do it.  And I, I tell you what, that's been probably the greatest--no matter what happens in my life, and how people remember me or what they think or what they say, as long as my kids, when they put me in the ground, say, "Daddy, you were, you were, you were a great man for us," that's all that matters in the end.  No matter how many races you win, no matter how many barriers or whatever accomplishments professionally or socially, what matters is what you bring into the world and what you leave.  And so I never, when I got, when I left to go race, I never thought about not coming home to my kids, never.  I always felt that the Creator was gonna bring me back to them.

Speaker 1: Are there other blacks now on your trails in the industry?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so it's a different climate than when you started out?  I mean I'm just trying to get perspective.
Speaker 2: Not really.  Not, not--it's, it's--the, the shock, there's no more shock value, if that's the right word.  I was there, I went up the trail.  There's a couple of young guys out there now that are, one in NASCAR [National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing] and one in Indy [Indianapolis 500] car racing that, that are working and, and going up that trial now.  That's, it's their turn.
Speaker 1: Do you see yourself in them?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.  I, I think I was always--some people will not, will walk softly and carry a big stick.  I carried a big stick and didn't walk softly.  I mean I, I didn't, I didn't fly in with a Stealth fighter jet.  I came in with a 747 (chuckle).  You could see me coming for ten miles away, big wings out there, big smoke trail behind me.  They knew I was coming.
Story_ID: 19328
Speaker 1: You had mentioned earlier about what makes a good driver, and I'm wondering if you could just talk about that?
Speaker 2: There are, there was some drivers, the, the real great drivers, you--they, they just--it, it, they had a feel for, for what a car did.  And they had this feeling in their hands and arms, and when they--that trans--I mean the feel that they got from the road, transferred right from their butt, cause your butt's the lowest, it's the lowest thing to the ground, when you talk about center of gravity, when you're riding in that car, your behind is the lowest--your head's up here, your arms are up here; your butt's right, closest to the ground.  Well, any movement in that car, your butt feels it first cause it's the lowest point--it's closest to the ground.  And the great drivers could transform that feeling that they got right into their, into their hands, into the steering wheel.  And they would just, they had a feel.  They had a concentration level, I mean to drive at Indy [Indianapolis 500] for example, and there were--and I, and I use Indy because Indy is a 500 mile race that you're gonna run--you're gonna do in almost, less than three hours.  To race 500 miles in less than three hours is an incredibly intense, and you're running over 200 miles per hour, two, you can average 210, 215, sometimes in the 220's for three hours.  To do that, you have to have fierce concentration.  I mean your concentration--after a race like that, it takes two days to come down from it.  You're still, after the race is over, you're eating dinner, you're on an airplane, and you're still in that race.  It's an unbelievable feeling, but the concentration it takes--people would ask, "Do you blink when you drive?"  Well, if you blink, you don't know that, you really don't know because you're so focused, because you're going so fast, and the corners are coming at you so fast, I mean everything's going by like this, like this (hand movement demonstration).  And you're just, you don't see this outside.  It's going by you and you're focused on that corner.  And you're looking at that corner like you're looking down a gun barrel.  The way you look down a gun barrel is the way you look at that corner.  You're just dead focused on it because you're entering it so fast, that if you don't turn at the precise moment, you'll crash.  You will crash.  You will be, be up wide into the gray, into the loose stuff (pow).  And if you crash at Indy [Indianapolis 500] or Michigan [Michigan International Speedway, Brooklyn, Michigan] or some of the high speed ovals, it's gonna be bad.  It's gonna be a big crash.  So, you, you, the great drivers had an ability to do that speed, lap after lap after lap, the same speed, always--and hit the right spot.  I mean they could drive into a corner at that speed and be right, that far from the line every time, come off the corner and be that close to the wall, come exiting the corner, 200 and something miles per hour, that close, every lap, every lap.  Those were the guys, and they don't make a mistake.  And then at the same time, had a feel for, for the car where they could articulate to the engineer, maybe because being a great driver is one thing, but being able to understand what the car is doing at that speed is another.  And you've got to, you know, have a, a feeling and a, and a, and a knowledge where what you feel, you can feed it back to the engineer.  And the engineer will say, okay, we'll make this change, and make it better.  It's all about being better and faster and making the car work for you.  You've got to make the car work for you.
Speaker 1: Now, have you ever had a bum car?
Speaker 2: A what?
Speaker 1: A bum car?
Speaker 2: A bad car, oh--
Speaker 1: Bad car, sorry, bad, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, many of them, many times.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you just trade them out, no, you get a new engineer?
Speaker 2: No, well, you, the team you're racing for, you don't race for them anymore.
Story_ID: 19329
Speaker 1: You also talked about what a driver thinks, and I was wondering, what are you think--you know, you've talked a lot about things going by and all that, but you haven't mentioned, you know, about what--are there, are you thinking anything?  Or if you're not thinking, do you have a ritual before that you go through, before a race?
Speaker 2: You--before a race, you don't, you--what you want to do before a race is you want to be rested.  You want to, you want--there's a lot of drivers that have developed a way where they can, they, they sleep before a race.  You just switch it off.  The night before a race, you don't think about winning.  You don't think about crashing.  You don't think about--you don't even think about the competition.  I found that when you just shut it off, like coming home from work, turn it off.  You must be rested because if you're not rested, and you--your concentration level is not the same.  And so you don't think--I, I, you don't really think about anything the night before.  The race day, then you get there, and you go over your so-called strategy, you go over with your crew chief and your engineer what you're gonna do, you know, as far as pit stops are concerned and, and if--what happens during a race if one, if the car starts changing its handling characteristics, you start thinking about what you're gonna do and what they're gonna do.
Speaker 1: It's just hard for me to imagine even going that fast, you know, but you feel, you just feel--it's a, things are blurring, how--you said, you feel a sense of freedom.
Speaker 2: Well when you're racing with people, you, you know, everyone's going the same speed, but you know that on the outside, you know, you're in between those walls, you're going very, very fast.
Story_ID: 19330
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense at all of who you're ahead and who's behind you?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know everything.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you know all of that?  By the colors of the car (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, because the team, the team manager is talking to you.  You have, inside your helmet, you have a radio and you have a microphone inside your helmet.  So they can talk to you, and you can talk to them.  And on the steering wheel is a button, and so you want to key the mic up, and then you can talk to them.  They're gonna tell you, they're gonna tell you exactly how--you know everything.  You know how fast you're going.  You know what your lap speeds are.  You know who's leading.  You know how far you--how far the guy is ahead of you.  And you know how far you're ahead of the next guy.  They tell you, every lap, every lap.  And you also have on, inside the steering wheel in Indy [Indianapolis 500] cars, you have a, a computerized dash, digital, that tells you your speed, your cornering speed.  It, your oil temperatures, your, your, your fuel pressures.  You know everything that's going on.  And if that went out, you, they'll talk to you from the pits.
Story_ID: 19331
Speaker 1: Now, why do you think it's such a great sport?
Speaker 2: What it, what it demands of you.  I mean it demands, it demands commitment.  It demands talent, and it demands courage, I mean all the elements that I was taught that make up a man.  That's what makes up a man, and I'm not being gender-biased when I make that statement.  I mean the way, you must be courageous as a man.  You must be talented and smart, and, and deal with obstacles.  And when it's all over, you can look back and say to yourself, "I did that.  I did it."  And I'll never forget, after my first year in Indy [the Indianapolis 500] in 1991, when that race, when it was over, and after I qualified, I thought to myself, "You know what, you can handle anything after that.  You can handle a major catastrophe, a earthquake, Internal Revenue [Service], I mean any, any major obstacle, you can handle."  And that's what I felt about myself when I left Indy and when I packed up to go home [San Jose, California], I thought, "Man.  Yeah, I dealt with this for a month.  I can handle anything, any adversity, I can deal with it.  Everything's a piece of cake."

Speaker 1: If I was to do seminars, I would love to do seminars with young athletes today.  I'd like to get them all in a room-- I wouldn't get them out in a room.  I'd take them out on the ranch with me.  I'd take all these basketball players and football players and all these young guys, and I'd say, "Hey, come out on the ranch, get into some boots and jeans.  Let's go bail some hay so we can talk in the hot sun," and just let, and just remind them of your duty as a man, your duty, your duty as a, yeah, as a human being.  I mean it's old school, but that's the greatest school of them all.  I mean that, I was, I'm so happy that I came out of that environment cause my grandpa [Henry Ribbs] worked the hell out of us.  I mean there was, you know, it was something that was--and I would like to get these young guys and say, "Hey, look, this is what it's all about."  It's about commitment.  It's about honor, it's about, it's about success.  It's about duty, not necessarily duty to your country.  I mean that's great for the Armed Forces.  I'm talking about duty to your family and yourself and whatever offsprings you might have, and all the ones who were before you that didn't have it as easy.  We know about Jackie Robinson, right?  We know about Althea Gibson, all right.  We know about Lee Elder, right, and Wendell Scott, right?  And, and I mean the list goes on and on, I mean just in, in that arena, not to mention the political arena of Thurgood Marshall and Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and Malcolm X and all those.  I am a firm believer in history.  I love history, I love history and I respect it because you've got to know.  You--some of the young guys today don't know who was there before them, who really busted their ass and put their, their neck on the line.  And that would be all part of my, my, my proposal to all the young guys out there.

Speaker 2: Okay, I, I--Jim Brown, I mean when I was a kid, I mean, I mean other than, all I knew was racing, but there was people who I'd heard about as a kid, Cassius Clay [Muhammad Ali], Jim Brown.  And I always--I admired Jim because he was old school tough.  I always admired him.  I mean he was, he was the greatest football player that ever set foot on a football field, in any position.  When you think, when you talk football player, it's Jim Brown.  It's no one else, in any position.  He was the man, and he's regarded by, by that by many.  There're some that don't like Jim Brown because he's a tough guy that, you know, that would kick your ass if you disrespected him.  He was just a tough guy.  And he didn't take any nonsense.  What I liked and what I respected is that he wouldn't, he wouldn't sell out.  He wouldn't turn the other cheek, and he did it his way, and you have to admire that because he could have took the millions of dollars.  And he could have said, "Hey, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm on the, I'm on the corporate market, I'm on the advertising market, you know, I'm gonna smile and say the right things."  But Jim told it like it, like it is, like it was, and you have to admire that, and the same with Mohammad Ali, he did the same thing.

Speaker 2: He, he refused to go to any of my--he never went to any of my dad's [William T. Ribbs, Sr.] races.  I mean he wouldn't, he wouldn't--my dad never even asked him.  But once I became a pro, and I was winning races, I asked him to come to a race, and he did.  And the race that he came to, I had won that day.  And he was very, he was very business-like cause he came to the track, and he, he was dressed, you know, very, very well.  And he always, very professional.  And a lot of the, many of the media people were waiting to talk with him when he got to the track so they could hear some of the old stories on the ranch.  And when I won the race, he--after I came out of the press room, I came back to the team, where the team was, and he was there.  And he said to me, he says, "You did a good job.
