Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Roshell, R-O-S-H-E-L-L, Anderson, A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N [HistoryMaker Roshell "Mike" Anderson].  I'm also known as Mike Anderson, my professional name in broadcasting and news.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can, we pause just a second?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We have speed.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, there's a story behind how you got the name Mike.  So, could you tell us that story?
Speaker 2: Well, I applied for a job at WLWI Radio, a country and western station in Montgomery, Alabama.  This is in 1978.  And, it was a news job.  And, which I had found through the Alabama Broadcasters Association, that they had an opening there.  It was a new station.  And, so, I applied for their news department.  And, they--I did an audition for 'em.  Showed 'em my resume and they liked it.  They liked me.  They liked the way I read the news.  They liked my delivery.  The only thing they did not like was my name.  My real name, Roshell; didn't think that that was newsy enough.  So, there was a deejay in Valdosta, Georgia who I remembered and liked by the name of Mike Lane [ph.].  And, I always like the way he said, "Mike Lane."  So, I thought to this general manager that I'm speaking to at WLWI, "How about Mike?"  And, he says to me, he had a really deep broadcast voice, he says to me--his name was Don Markwell, and he says to me, "Mike Anderson, sounds like a news man."  And, so, that's how I became Mike.  And, then I thought about it later, Mike was just a good old American name and for a country western station, it worked out perfect, because when I went on the air, even though I'm from New Orleans [Louisiana], I didn't--I never had a New Orleans accent.  I didn't have that really southern accent, I just had a straight kind of delivery.  So, when I was on the air nobody knew I was black (laughter).  Although our audience being a country audience in Montgomery was primarily white.  So, it worked out perfect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, we've already, oh, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Nine, sixteen, fifty-two [September 16, 1952], Bogalusa, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: And, how do you spell Bogalusa?  That's--
Speaker 2: B-O-G-A-L-U-S-A, Bogalusa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565021
Speaker 1: And your occupation is?
Speaker 2: Anchor, reporter, here at WISN-TV in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: All right.  And, you are, you're also--you're also a singer too.  You've had a career as a singer as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I was working for a radio station in Montgomery, Alabama [WLWI Radio], was my second station W- WGOV [WGOV Radio], Valdosta, Georgia, as a deejay, and as a production guy doing commercials and things like that.  And, I had a, I think I worked all the shifts of the jock shows that we had.  I worked morning.  I worked late nights, afternoon.  But, anyway, we had this record producer by the name of Jesse Boone.  Jesse Boone and the Astros was his band.  He had a recording studio in Albany, Georgia.  And, he would go around and, you know, to various stations trying to get his artists played on the radio.  He came by our station one day and he was promoting, I don't remember who the artist was, or maybe one or two.  And, played their records for us and then he told us, he say, "Well," what he said to me, "I'm always looking for new talent so any time that you can recommend somebody to us send them over, we'd be happy to take a listen to 'em."  When he left, I wrote a song myself.  I never recorded before, but I had--was in a quartet in church [Algiers Church of God in Christ, New Orleans, Louisiana] growing up in New Orleans [Louisiana].  But, I thought, well, why not?  I wrote a song, I took it over there to his studio.  He says, "Well, I tell you what I'll do--," he never heard me sing before, he says, "if you pay for the production, then I'll pay for the pressing," to get the record done.  And, right away, I understood that this is business so (laughter), and that's what, what most artists never learn until later on.  But, anyway, we recorded the song.  And, sure enough I paid for the production.  He paid for the pressing.  He put it out on his small label called, Soul-Po-Tion [Soul-Po-Tion Records, Albany, Georgia].  We had a deejay by the name of Deuce [Rudy "The Deuce" Rutherford] I believe his name was, out of Manchester, Georgia, started playing the record at night.  It was called the the 'Snake out of Green Grass,' which I wrote.  And, he started getting calls.  People were requesting it.  Next thing you know it spread.  Of course, I was playing it on our station at WVO--WGOV in Valdosta.  Some of my other deejay friends there were playing it; those who weren't jealous (laughter), would give me a little play.  Next thing you know, the record took off.  We got a call from Nashboro Records out of Nashville, Tennessee.  They picked it up, put it on their label, and then it spread around and, and we got some notoriety.
Speaker 1: So, so, what year was that?
Speaker 2: This is back in 1972, or '73 [1973], I think it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanted to establish the fact that you're a singer.  But, that's--I didn't wanna stop you from telling the story once you started it.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: But, we'll, we're just trying follow our chronology.  So, I'll try to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'll try to keep--bring you back to where back to where we are at this time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is November 27, 2007.
Speaker 1: And, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at WISN Television [WISN-TV], 759 North 19th Street in Milwaukee, we're right on the campus of Marquette University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565022
Speaker 1: Before we get into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as warm up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, they only require a short answer.  First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I have--yes, I do have a favorite froo- food.  I like collard greens and neckbones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, together.  That's the way I cook 'em.  Collard greens and neckbones together with a li- with some okra after they get done; throw a little boiled okra in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, smothered pork chops, and rice and gravy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue is my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which I'm not wearing blue today, but (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, the shirt there, your shirt is--
Speaker 2: It's kind of an aqua.
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: But, my favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year, I would say autumn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, one of the things I like about living in Wisconsin is that you get the four seasons.  Autumn is beautiful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The fall.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I necessarily have a favorite des- vacation destination 'cause my vacations mostly over the years has been going home to New Orleans [Louisiana] to see my folks [Mellenese Magee Anderson and Robert Anderson, Jr.] in--to Shreveport [Louisiana] to take my kids to see their grandparents.  So, I don't, I haven't established a favorite vacation place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, the last questions is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Good Lord willing.  People ask me all the time, "Are you coming here?  Are you gonna do that?"  I always say, "The good Lord willing."  I think that comes from the South.  I heard that somewhere.  My grandparents saying it.  Actually, I have two favorite phrases.  That one and then the other one is: never count the chickens before they hatch.
Story_ID: 565023
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Robert Anderson, Jr.] side.  But, we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name is Mellenese, M-E-L-L-E-N-E-S-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anderson.  Her maiden name is Magee, M-A-G-E-E [Mellenese Magee Anderson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  M-A-G--
Speaker 2: E-E.
Speaker 1: --E-E, okay.  All right.  And, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She's eighty-two now.  She's born March, I believe 21, 1926.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, where was she born?
Speaker 2: Franklinton, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Franklinton.  Okay.
Speaker 2: As far as I know.  I think that's where she was born, Franklinton.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace that side of the family?
Speaker 2: I don't know a whole lot about my family history from that perspective.  I know that Franklinton is where my grandparents, her parents lived.  And, that is where my mom was living, I believe at the time when I was born.  And, the nearest hospital was Bogalusa [Louisiana].  That's where I was born, in Bogalusa.  So, anybody who had to go to the hospital, they take you to Bogalusa, from what I understand.  And, so, which is not far from Franklinton.  But, my grandfather, my mom's dad, was a farmer and he had as I recall, one cow, one mule, some chickens, a garden, and corn farm, and raised some other things I think.  And, my mother, my grandmother's name--my grandfather was David Magee, D-A-V-I-D, M-A-G-E-E in Franklinton.  And, his wife was Luberta, L-U-B-E-R-T-A, Magee, M-A-G-E-E [Luberta Magee], in Franklinton.  And, so, we had that one hou- that house, smoke house, where they smoke the meat.
Speaker 1: So, they had their own land, or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They had their own land.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather had his own land there.  I don't remember how many acres it was.  But, I do remember that we always had enough to eat.  We weren't rich by any stretch of the imagination.  But, we always had enough to eat.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I always loved my grandfather for that, and admired and respected him.  I don't know how he did it, but, but he did.
Speaker 1: So, were you basically raised at your grandfather's place?
Speaker 2: When I was little.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was little I grew up with my--.  My mom moved away to New Orleans [Louisiana] to get a job.  And, so, my grandmother kind of babysat me while my mom was working in New Orleans.  When I was, I would say between the ages of one and eight or nine--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking.
Story_ID: 565024
Speaker 1: Did your [maternal] grandfather [David Magee] or grandmother [Luberta Magee] ever talk about their gran- their parents or grandparents?  Or, about how they acquired the land [in Franklinton, Louisiana]?  Or, did they have any stories that come from slavery or any of that?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, I would hear him and his friends talking about slavery days, or there might've been post-slavery days but they were days certainly when there was very trying times for them.  And, being a little kids listening to my grandfather and his buddies who were about the same age, talk about those kinds of days, what it was like.  And, I don't know if this was, they were sharecroppers or if they bought land from, you know, the white guys or whatever, but they had some stories that they would tell.  And, one of 'em I remember vividly.  There was this white guy who they used to call, you know, Big Nigger.
Speaker 1: That was a white guy's name?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, they all, I used to hear 'em say, they would laugh and joke about him.  And, I don't, and I don't know if this was someone from their time in slavery, or their fathers' time in slavery (unclear) that whenever he came around, if he was smiling, you had nothing to worry about.  If he had a big laugh on this face, you had nothing to worry about.  But, if he came around and he was frowning, look out.  That meant trouble.  'Cause he was, you know, he, he, he was either mad with you or he was mad with somebody else.  And, then, he would, they would beat 'em, you know.  But, if, but, if he was smiling, everything was fine.  So, and they would laugh about those kinds of things.  And, I still remember them talking about that.  You know, it's like buddies talking about, sharing war stories or something.  And, it didn't mean a whole lot to me at that time, but now that I think about it, you know, it's amazing to me how they could laugh about that, and joke about that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Well, it was prob- you know, it sounds to me like maybe the name, Big Nigger, was a, a misdirection.  So that they could talk about him without him knowing they were talking about him.
Speaker 2: That could be.  That could be.  And, like I said, I don't know if it was their time in slavery or if it was their fathers relating that story down to them.  But, I just, you know, how when you're a little kid you're running around and they talk grownup stuff and you just kind of overhear 'em.  I'd, I'd hear a lot of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, the bottom line is they were subject to the moods of this person--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --who was--and they had to be aware of what he--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: What kind of disposition he was in.
Speaker 2: But, it's amazing how they figured that out and how they understood that, you know, in order to survive and get along, you know.  You had to read that personality and adjust to it all the time.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story.
Story_ID: 565025
Speaker 1: Any other stories about, about that time period?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my [maternal] grandfather, David [David Magee], had a brother name Bennie Magee, B-E-N-N-I-E.  And, he lived, I guess about a mile away from us.  He too had a farm.  His wife was named Beulah, B-E-U-L-A-H, Magee [Beulah Magee].  Now, my Aunt Beulah was half white.  Nobody ever said that.  Nobody ever--it just never came up.  But, you know, it's one of things that you just kind of figure out (laughter).  And, she was my grandmother's sister.  But, now I know that they were half-sisters.  Nobody ever told us that.  It was never discussed.  But, you know, you kind of grow into understanding.  And, we believe, us, the kids among us, that her relatives on, on that side were the Brumfields, who lived not far from, from us.  Because they would always take care of Aunt Beulah.  They were always bringing her food stuff, and they owned a grocery store.  She had to, you know, she could come and go to the grocery store as she pleased.  None of the rest of us, my grandmother [Luberta Magee] couldn't do that.  But, she could.  So, we felt, you know, that they were part of her relatives somehow 'cause they always took care of her.  And, I remember that.  I remember we had a dog by the name of Sport.  Or they had a dog, my Uncle Bennie and Aunt Beulah.  That was the dog in the family.  That dog was, you know, for, for my grandparents' family and (laughter) my Aunt Beulah and Uncle Bennie.  That was--all us kids would go down and play with old Sport, you know.  And, they raised vegetables.  And the Brumfields, the white family, had a pond where we could go to.  And, my uncle had unlimited access to for fishing.  And, I remember that well.  By the way, all of that land that they owned, that they had at that time, is now gone.  When Uncle Bennie died, my Grandfather David died, my grandmother and my aunt, we believed--others in family--that they were conned out of that land by some of the other white businessmen in Louisiana.  And, I'm not really sure how that happened.  But, all I know is like, they sold off the land.  That's what my mother [Mellenese Magee Anderson] and them tell us, "They sold the land."  And, probably for a little of nothing after my, my grandfather and my great uncle passed away.  So, none of that land is in the family now, which is a travesty, it's sad.
Story_ID: 565026
Speaker 1: Now did you mother [Mellenese Magee Anderson] have any stories of growing up that she told you?
Speaker 2: No.  My, my mother, my mother's story is that she worked in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Because New Orleans was a place to get to if you wanna get a good job, as they say, back--during that time.  And, so, there're not many stories from my mother about living in Franklinton [Louisiana], or in the country where I grew up.  Not, grew up, but lived in my early childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did she had a--did she go to school in Franklinton, or New Orleans?
Speaker 2: My mom, I think my mom only went to about the seventh or the eighth grade in Franklinton.  And, she left and, like I said, went to New Orleans and worked.  My, her sister, my aunt kind of raised us during that, that time, my Aunt Beulah, Beulah Mae [Beulah Mae Magee].  She did the washing.  I remember that.  Did the ironing for us.  We had one of those ringer washers back in those days.  And, we would help her in hanging the clothes out on the clotheslines and things like that.  Those were the old days; days of purity, as I call them.  When you, we, I would watch her kill a hog and string 'em up, you know, shave all the hair off, all that stuff during those days.  Make the cracklings from the skin off the hog.  The big iron, black pots that they would cook in.  Make soap.  All those kinds of things back in those days, kill goats, chickens.  During those day, you'd walk out in the yard and I see my, my Aunt Beulah may walk out in the yard, grab a chicken.  Maybe one of the chickens--we used to cry, 'cause it's one of the chickens we been playing with on Tuesday.  On Wednesday it might be on the dinner table.  'Cause they go--she'd go out, she grab one up and just (gesture) wring that neck, throw him off in the chicken until he's done.  Next thing you know, stick him in some hot water, pulling those feathers off, chicken dumplings.  And, so, those day I, I still remember today.  And, and, I think about it sometime and you know, we talk about how kids have impressionable minds and what happens to you as a kid follows you a lot of times throughout the rest of your life.  I still think about those, those days, and I remember those days.  I remember my, my uncle, my mom's brother, who had long moved away before I grew up and lived in Gary, Indiana, worked in the factories.  Anyway, back in Louisiana as a little kid, I remember him telling me, "Never come between a man and his wife who are in an argument.  Never do that.  Stay out of it.  No matter how much they try to come and get you to broker some--stay out of it, because they're gonna always get back together and then you'll be left out in the cold."  I don't know why he told me that.  We were sitting out by the crib, they called 'em the crib back in those days, where they would store the corn and the stuff like that to feed the animals.  Just sitting out there talking, and he told me that (unclear).  And, I remember that today and that's grown, I've grown to realize that because I've had situations in my own family where, you know, I'm trying to be a go between, between (unclear), and they, they end up back all lovey dovey and then me and the other person ain't speaking or something, you know, so.  That was good advice from him.  I don't know why he told me that then but he did.  I remember that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from back in those days.
Story_ID: 565027
Speaker 1: Your mother [Mellenese Magee Anderson] left when she was a teenager to--
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure she was a teenager.
Speaker 1: For New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she have relatives in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, my family is kind of, they're kind of scattered about.  I'm just now finding out family that I didn't even know that I, that I had.  And, there is a lot of things that I guess in my family history that I didn't know about.  I ju- my mom just told me, just confirmed for me just within a couple of weeks ago, sisters and brothers or something that I didn't even know about, you know.  So, there is a lot of, there's some family that I have on her side and I'm sure on my dad's [Robert Anderson, Jr.] side too, that I don't really, don't really know about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, I'm just kind of learning bits and pieces as--you know.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what did your mother do in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: My mother was--
Speaker 1: Where did she work?
Speaker 2: My mother was--she's had many jobs.  And, I remember her always working two jobs.  Her primary, she was a chef, a cook for the Court of Two Sisters [Court of the Two Sisters] in the French Quarter [New Orleans, Louisiana] for a long time.
Speaker 1: Now, the Court of Two Sisters is a restaurant?
Speaker 2: Court of Two Sisters is a restaurant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, she cooked there.  She also--she had several jobs, different jobs like that, working in restaurants.  And, her most recent job where she retired was, she was a custodian at McMain Junior High School [Eleanor McMain Junior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  She was custodian there for many years.  And, she retired there in like, must've been '85 [1985]-ish or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, she did--worked in--she was cook, restaurants and janitorial kind of things, yeah.
Story_ID: 565028
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father now.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Robert, R-O-B-E-R-T, Anderson, A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what's his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I'm not, his--it's July 15th and he is right now I believe (background noise) seventy--
Speaker 1: Sorry.  I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, my dad is, his birthday is July 15th and I believe he is seventy-seven.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I'm not sure what date, what year that would make him, but he's--
Speaker 2: Oh, seventy?
Speaker 1: Seventy--seventy-seven.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, he's five years younger than my mom [Mellenese Magee Anderson], so, yeah.  And, he is from Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, he is a junior.  So, he would--he's Robert Anderson, Jr.
Speaker 2: So, he was born in 1930, I guess then?  I would think, yeah.
Speaker 1: My, I don't, I don't--my math is not that quick.
Speaker 2: So, it's 2007, yeah, 1930 I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1930.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay, Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on his side?  What?
Speaker 1: I don't know a whole lot about my father's side of the family.  I know he has a brother by the name of Johnnie Anderson [ph.], and then he has some half-brothers, I think three half-brothers that I know of.  But, I don't know much about my father's family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Other than the fact that they're from Hattiesburg.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, did he grow up in Hattiesburg?
Speaker 1: He grew up in Hattiesburg.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, then he to, he--I'm not even sure how he and my mother met.  They met in New Orleans [Louisiana].  I'm not sure how he ended up in New Orleans.  But, I know he was in Korean--the Korean conflict.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, he--I'm not sure if I was born when he, when he was in there or after he got out or, but I do know that there was some connection there.  How him and my mom met, I'm not really sure.  But, they did meet in New Orleans.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, okay, so, it was after, yeah, about, was it right after the Korean War, or?
Speaker 1: He, I think he was in there.  I think he, I think he was in the--no, he, they--no, no, no, no, no, no, they met before he, while he, before he was discharged.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because I know he was there, and I might've been born before he went over there or while he was there or something, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you were born about the time the war was wrapping up, I believe.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The Korean War was like 1950 to '52 [1952], is it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was born in '52 [1952].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think--you know, the U.S. still has a military presence there but the actual--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --war was I think was, was '49 [1949]--
Speaker 1: Was pretty much over, yeah.
Speaker 2: --fifty [1950], something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, I know he played football for the [U.S.] Army, I think it was.  He--I see him in his--seen pictures of him in his uniform.  And, I'm not sure if that was when he was active duty or if he, you know, where he, what kind of team they had or something, but he always brags about it, you know, but.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did he have a chance to go to high school and finish, or college or?
Speaker 1: You know what, I don't know.  I don't know how far my dad went to school.  He just never talked about it that much.  So, I'm not really sure where he went to school or how far he went to school.
Speaker 2: So, he didn't have much to say about growing up or--in Hattiesburg or?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Why he came to New Orleans, or?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I understand a lot of people in those days didn't talk about, you know, things but--
Speaker 1: And, you know I didn't, we just never had those conversations like that.  He never--and then, and I don't know if that's because I wasn't really close to his side of the family or, or what, I don't know.
Speaker 2: So, did you get the impression that he really did not care to discuss where he grew up or did not like Hattiesburg--
Speaker 1: Well, the only thing he talked about for the most part was the [U.S.] military.  He came back with a lot of--he was a sergeant in the, in the Ar- in the Army.  And, you know, he, he'd talk about stories about the military.  And, you know, he, he had a lot of that mentality in him.  He, you know, we had to have our shoes shined.  You know, he was really a stickler for, you know, shining your shoes and time, I guess, you know, breakfast at this time and, you know, that kind of stuff.  He had a lot of military, you know, types in him.  And, so, we, we'd--and then he worked too.  He worked a lot when I was growing up, when I did move to New Orleans to live with them, he worked a lot.  So, we, we didn't really have a lot of time to, we didn't spend a lot of time.  I spent a lot of time in church [Algiers Church of God in Christ, New Orleans, Louisiana], where my mom took me.  And, that was mostly my, outside of school, my adolescent, you know, years, preteen years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.

Speaker 1: When you think about, well, you know, the talents and dispositions of your parents, their personalities, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mom [Mellenese Magee Anderson], and my grandfather [David Magee].  And, there's not a whole lot--my mom tells me that about the only thing I got from my dad [Robert Anderson, Jr.] is my voice (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, and she says, "That's good," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Hold on right there, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what she said.
Story_ID: 565030
Speaker 1: I was asking you about the personalities of your parents and who you thought you took after (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  My mom [Mellenese Magee Anderson] says that the only thing I got from my dad [Robert Anderson, Jr.] is, is my voice.  My dad does have a nice deep baritone voice.  He, he told me when I was a kid that he was a professional singer, and he and his brothers had recorded a record.  I found out later that wasn't true. But, he would walk around the house singing a lot of times.  And, but, my mother is, my mother is a very sweet, kind, beautiful hearted person.  She's always thinking about others, other than herself.  And, I've kind of been that way.  I was that way with my family, raising my kids, people around me.  And, even people I work with, I always, some--seem to naturally take their considerations a lot of times ahead of mine.  And, that's the way my mom is.  So, that's pretty much how I am.  I take more after her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, my earliest childhood memories are kind of as I said, growing up in the country at my [maternal] grandparents' [Luberta Magee and David Magee] house.  It was me, my two cousins, my mother's, my mother's sister's two children, two girls, Linda [ph.] and Mary [ph.].  And, they were, they were like my two sisters because my other brothers and sisters wasn't born yet.  I had an older sister, but she was ahead of me and doing her own thing.  So, we were all in the same age group.
Speaker 1: So, how do you--well, describe the siblings and where do you fall in the order, I guess, in terms of--?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Mellenese Magee Anderson] and my dad [Robert Anderson, Jr.] have--well, there were five of us, five of us.  I have an older sister, name is Joann [ph.] and, who's actually my half-sister and--on my mother's side.  And, then I have, and then there's me.  And, then there's my brother Bennie [ph.], and then there's my sister--no, I'm sorry there's me and then another sister, Delores [ph.].  And, then there's another brother after her, Bennie.  And, then a brother after Bennie.  His name is David--Fardrell David [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, there's five of us.

Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you live in in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: In New Orleans?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The 3rd Ward.  Well, I lived in 7th Ward, where I went to school at--high school, J.S. Clark [Joseph S. Clark High School; Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] where I graduated.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm a get to that high school in a little bit.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: But, you all, so you started off--
Speaker 2: 7th, 7th Ward (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the 7th Ward?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Then moved to the 3rd Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then the 3rd Ward.  Okay.  Okay, so, that was basically the name of the neighborhood was the ward--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --not--okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, well, you know, what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up, or in New Orleans?
Speaker 1: Of growing up.
Speaker 2: Of growing up.  Sights and sounds and smells of growing up.  Well, the first sights and sounds of growing up would be in the country where my [maternal] grandparents [Luberta Magee and David Magee] lived.  The fresh air.  The lightning bugs at night.  The dirt roads.  The cars with the dust flying--before, this was before blacktop.  We're excited when we were kids to get on the black top road because you could go really smooth.  To throwing rocks, hopscotch in the dirt where you'd make your, you'd draw the lines in the dirt and the sand.  Watching the old Westerns on TV: 'Gunsmoke,' 'Have Gun - Will Travel,' 'The Tall Men,' 'The Dakotas,' all those old Westerns.  And, to getting my first cap gun and holster out in the country.  That part of my life was the country life.  And, then, moving to the city, seeing New Orleans, which was totally different than what Franklinton [Louisiana] was.  And, and in the part of Franklinton--we lived in the country part of Franklinton.  So, to see the big city lights, the dialect was different.  People spoke differently in New Orleans than they did in the country.  Which in my introduction to that was, I remember when I was in grade school [McDonogh No. 32; McDonogh No. 32 Literacy Charter School, New Orleans, Louisiana], I can't remember what grade it was but I do remember in the class I was still saying (pronunciation) tomatoes and taters for tomatoes and potatoes.  And, the kids were laughing at me at that point 'cause I was speaking the country.  But, it didn't take me long to lose that country and then pick up the kind of New Orleans thing.  And, of course, I later grew out of both of them.  But, that was some of the sounds of listening to the New Orleans dialect, you know, so, "So, what's happening bro?  So a brother (unclear)."  You know, that kind of stuff was in New Orleans.  And, so, I learned to listen and pick up on that right away.  So, just tal- I could talk like them by imitating 'em.  And, so, that got 'em off my back, you know, 'cause I could speak like them.  So, that's some of the sounds.  Of course, the sights, the lights and, and--was different.  But, it was a, it was a whole different world in the big city than it was in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, you were in the country most summers, right, you're saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in the country, I wouldn't say most summers, I would say up until--I was in the country, period, as I recall up until, I don't know, between seven and nine.  Then I'd go to New Orleans, then I'd go back to the country.  I'd to New Orleans, I go back to the country.  So, I shuttled back and forward until about the age of eleven or twelve.  And, then I was in New Orleans from then on 'til I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --'til I left home in--at seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565033
Speaker 1: What was your neighborhood like in New Orleans [Louisiana]?  I mean, what was--
Speaker 2: In New Orleans?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Neighborhood was a good neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Well, 7th Ward first, I guess, we'll do the 3rd Ward, I guess, right?  That's the order that you--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: 7th Ward first and then the 3rd Ward (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 7th Ward?  Yes.  7th Ward we lived on Columbus Street in the 7th Ward in New Orleans.  And, I had, I made friends real easily.  Neighborhood friends we'd be shooting marbles, and playing football.  Throwing the football out in the middle of the street.  And, the kids were mostly Catholic.  And, I was in the Church of God in Christ [Algiers Church of God in Christ, New Orleans, Louisiana], Pentecostal.  And, they would be going to catechism.  And, I didn't know what catechism was.  All I knew was that, that's what the kids did.  And, they didn't eat meat on Friday.  They wanted to eat cheese sandwiches or something else, and I'd wanna do that too just to be like them.  So, I remember that kind of flavor.  It was a neighborhood where everybody did kind of know each other on the block.  The grownups worked for the most part.  And, the kids I recall, you know, we, we didn't have issues like we have today.  We're all kind of family and, you know, we'd go out and play and at night we go home and, you know.  But, it was, it was a good time.  It was more purity I would say, you know, up--the innocence of growing up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, you didn't have a lot of crime at that time, of note.  I mean, you'd leave your doors open and, you know, people walk in your house, and--.  It was somewhat of a country feel in that respect during that time.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have houses or were there row--
Speaker 2: Houses was--
Speaker 1: --houses or apartments that were--?
Speaker 2: Not row houses--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just houses.
Speaker 1: Were they, were they close together?
Speaker 2: Very close together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Much yard space or anything?
Speaker 2: Not much yard space at all.  And, places where we were shooting marbles was like maybe five by six little area, if that.
Speaker 1: The old part of the city?
Speaker 2: Old part of the city, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Frame houses mainly?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some even what they call shotgun houses.  You know, where you straight through to the--front to the back.  And, the houses, you know, there wasn't like you--a normal ranch style house that we might know of today where you have a bedroom here, a bedroom here, kitchen here, dining room, living room.  You might have three rooms.  You walk in, the front room might be a living room.  The next room is a bedroom.  The next room is bathroom.  The next room is a bedroom.  The next room is a kitchen.  All straight back.  And, so, so--and then you might walk into one house, the bedroom is the first house you walk into.  And, then the next room is a bedroom.  Then, you might have a dining room, maybe.  But, there was a lot of combination room types in those houses.  And, being a little kid they seemed real big at the time.  But, after growing, you grow older and you see, wow, this is pretty small, you know.  And, but that's the way people, people lived.  Those houses are s- were still there before the Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], you know, by those same type, type of houses, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now, where did you start, did you start school in the country?
Speaker 2: I started school in the country.  I remember going to elementary school in the country from the first through the sixth grade.  Yeah, that's--yeah, um-hm.  Now, in between that, like maybe about the fourth or fifth, I had gone to New Orleans [Louisiana] to go to school for maybe like a semester.  And, then for some reason I went back to the country and finished up.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school out in Franklinton [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I believe it was Franklin--yes, Franklin school, yeah.  The high school and the elementary school were like on the same campus.
Speaker 1: Now, did they have like a sub name, like colored school or something like that?  Or, did they--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Were they, was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Washington Parish.  I think it was Washington Parish--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Elementary [Washington Parish Elementary School, Franklinton, Louisiana] and Washington Parish High School [Franklinton, Louisiana].  If I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's what, what they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Washington (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And, I went there I remember the first grade through, I would say, about the sixth grade, I was in, I was in--went to school in Franklinton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, then in New Orleans where did you go?
Speaker 2: Seventh grade at McDonogh--McDonogh 32 [McDonogh No. 32; McDonogh No. 32 Literacy Charter School, New Orleans, Louisiana] was the grade school that I went to.  And, I think that was in the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, in the eighth grade, I went to Bell Junior High School [Andrew J. Bell Junior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then from there, I went to high school at J.S. Clark [Joseph S. Clark High School; Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School].  It's on North Derbigny Street in the 7th Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565035
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Not really a favorite subject, but I would say English probably was, was my better subject.  You know, and I think about it now, how--when I was in high school, French, I took a French class.  And, that was supposed to be my blow off class, you know, that I didn't think I needed, didn't care for.  But, I had a French teacher who was very stickler for really trying to, trying to drum it into you.  And, I didn't realize at the time that I was going into the field of communications and that would be one of the best things for me.  So, I learned a little bit, but I hated it at the time.  I just, I hated studying it, you know.  And, if I knew--it's one of those things where you know, if you knew then what you know now, you would've done a lot better in it.  But, I would say English was my best.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now were you--
Speaker 2: My favorite.
Speaker 1: --a pretty good student in school, or?
Speaker 2: I would say that I was, I wasn't a very studious student, not as much as I should have been.  Or, as much as I could've been.  Or, as much as I want- my mom [Mellenese Magee Anderson] wanted me to be.  I did enough to get by.  And, so, I could've been a much better student.  But, I, I was, I would say I was average, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any special teachers or mentors in school that you remember?
Speaker 2: I always got along well with all of my teachers.  One that I do remember was my geometry teacher.  I was never very good at math.  I was terrible at math.  And, you know, for some reason I can't think of his name now.  In about the tenth grade, I think, and he, they used to call me Cool Breeze when I was in, in school.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you earn that, that nickname?
Speaker 2: Well, for being calm, I think.  And, being not--never being upset, being--never letting things really get to me.  And, for example, we were in class one day and the teacher asked me, he put the problem up on the board and asked me if I had the answer.  And, I was sitting there and then I said, "No.  Not at this time."  The kids (laughter)--and they, the kids just cracked up, they all--and, he cracked up, you know.  And, so, instead of saying, "No, I don't know."  I said, "No.  Not at this time," (laughter).  So, they thought that was the coolest thing.  And, the girls (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, that's a common, now, that's a common nickname in the black community, Cool Breeze.
Speaker 2: Cool Breeze, yeah.
Speaker 1: I know two of 'em myself.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, now you make three.  And, I've heard--
Speaker 2: It kind of, it kind of, I think it kind of went with the time if you have a guy who was, you know, was kind of smooth and not loud.  And, I remember the girls at lunchtime at Clark school [Joseph S. Clark High School; Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], they used to like to hear me talk.  And, the guys couldn't understand that, you know.  They'd being going after, you know, trying to attract attention and all that stuff from the girls.  I just walk out there and stand on the playground.  Put my foot against the fence, and I used to wear this cap, they used to call the cool caps during that time.  You could wear those on the yard.  I'd have my books like this, just put my foot on it, and just lean against the fence, and they'd come around.  And, they'd ask me questions, and I just answer and I just talk to 'em.  And, they couldn't figure out, they couldn't figure out, say, "What in the world is up with this dude, you know?  Why they over--?"  You know and, but they, but that's, that's just the way I was.  So, that's why they call me, I think, Cool Breeze.  And, I was always, they liked me--the reason, I guess, that I spoke with, you know.  And, I was never loud, you know.  I was always just kind of laid back, calm.
Story_ID: 565036
Speaker 1: Now, did you have the same--now you speak pretty much like, you speak like newscaster ease now.  I mean, in a sense, I mean, you don't have an accent, you don't seem to have any accent.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you have one at that time in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I suspected I, that I could, what I could do is, I could turn it on and turn it off.  I could speak, you know, like I saying earlier, you like that, "So little partner, what's up?  What's happening?"  You know.  "Yeah, what's going down?"  Yeah, you know.  "Say, look here," that's the way they talk.  And, I could do that when I, when I wanted to.  And, then when I didn't, I didn't.  And, so, and I don't how; it wasn't anything that I trained or practiced at or anything like that.  I just, I could, I could pick up dialects and turn them off, on and on, like that.  And, even after I moved away from New Orleans when I go back, if I'm looking for direction or something like that I'm asking, I speak there, you know, if I spoke, you know, like I'm doing now, they wouldn't understand what I'm talking 'bout.  But, now, I say, "Well, look here, I wanna get over here, I wanna go by, by So and So's house," at whatever, you know, then they, they got me right away.  So, I could turn that on and turn it off.  And, I taught my kids growing up, I says, you know, as long as you're in the house, you can talk slang, you can do, you know, and then we can talk like, you know, the hood, whatever, how we wanna do, but you gotta be versatile, you know.  You gotta be able to--and then when you get out, when you get around some of your partners, you buddies, if they're talking that way, then you talk that way 'cause you, you know, you fit in.  But, then when you go out and--looking for a job and all that, you can't (laughter), you can't do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you think--now, that's a wisdom that I heard when I was in school.  That, you know, 'cause I tended to stray towards the other way, to be more nerdy.  My brother would say, "Hey, you gotta be able to live in both worlds," and talk in both--.  But, do you think that's something that's being lost today?
Speaker 2: That's totally being lost today.  And, it's, and it's really sad and it's unfortunate because, you know, our kids, black kids, for some reason think that they're not cool, that they're not down, that they're not who they are unless they're talking slang and just totally mutilating the English language.  And, I don't know how we got to that point.  But, but for some reason the average kid you talk to now, black kid, in the, in the inner, central cities, they don't wanna speak correct English.  They, they somehow think that it's not black to speak correct English.  And, and then when they go out to try to find a job, or get a job, that severely limits you because you can't speak.  And, then to tell them or to try to teach them anything different, they don't wanna hear it.  And, so, that's really, that's really, that's really sad.  I think, I think to, to, now when we get behind closed doors, like I say, a lot of black folks, we talk, we don't speak the same.  We speak, you know, you know, we fall back into the way we talk normally.  And, when I say normally, I mean, when we're just kind of kidding around and joking with each other, it's a different language.  And, sometimes if you try to explain that to someone white, they don't get it, you know.  But, I think all ethnic groups, they have their own little idiosyncrasies and then--in their dialect and the way that they talk, that only in the mother tongue do you speak to the, to each other that way.
Story_ID: 565037
Speaker 1: Which brings me to, to the other thing about, about the N word.  Now, my mom [Mellenese Magee Anderson] grew up, you know, in their day they used the N word in an affectionate way.  I, I remember even on the block, some parents would come to the door, they say, "I want all my little Ns in here right now," to the kids to come here.  Now, that's not in a derogatory way and how they--I think too, and we were talking earlier about how I overheard my [maternal] grandfather [David Magee] and his buddies talk about how they used to call this white guy, Big N.  And, I think that was way of, you know, when you--then when we, I used to hear in New Orleans [Louisiana] all the time, you know, when you refer to somebody as your, your buddy or your friend or your pal, you know, your tight homie, then you would just say, "My N."  You know, "You're my N," you know.  That meant an affectionate thing.  And, now, kids, I think--but, that was all done within, you know, in the house, in the home so to speak.  Now, what's happening is, is kids are using it in a different way, I think out in the open.  And, people are saying, well, you know, look at Snoop Dogg, look at all these other people, they're using the N word, why is it, why is it not acceptable throughout our society that way?  Well, I think, you know, when you speak to each other that, you know--a lot of people don't understand, when it's used between, you know, each other as black people then it's, it is more acceptable.  And, I didn't write the rules or the language that way, that's just kind of the way it is.  We can speak to each other in that way and it's not offensive.  But, to other people whom they speaking to it that way--.  And here's the other thing about that, we're talking about dialects and speaking a different way.  There's a difference between saying nigger and nigga.  If you notice black people never say each other, never call each other nigger, they call each other nigga, "My nigga."  There's a difference in the sound.  Do you hear that?  My nigga.  My nigger.  You see the difference in that?  Nigger that's, that's--oh, man, you just, you just offended me.  And, if you notice black people never say, nigger.  They say nigga.  But, then, then the offense comes in when you say nigger.  That's like, that's a put down.  That's coming from the old school when white folks say it.  They pronounce it correctly.  When you pronounce it correctly, that's where the offense comes in.  And, if you listen to the rappers they never say that -er.  It's always -a.  And, even with the gangster; it's gangsta, not gangster.  And, there was difference in those.  But, but, you know, I mean, it's subtle, but it's there.  And, it's, and it's, and yet it seems so little, but yet it's so big.  And, I think, if people would take a note of that, you know, they would see a difference in the use of that words right now.  But, my original point is that, our kids don't understand the negative aspect of that today in the way that they're using the word out in the music and where--around other people.  If it's done in the home, fine.  But, when you take it out, then that creates problems.  And, I think, that's where the debate is on that issue.  You know, if people could hone in what's really offensive about it and what isn't, then I think we'd get to the point of, of some kind of reconciliation on when and where it should be used.
Story_ID: 565038
Speaker 1: Oh, I was asking you if you had any favorite teachers or mentors in school.  Were there?
Speaker 2: My geometry teacher [at Joseph S. Clark High School; Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] was, was my favorite I would say.  Because he, even though I wasn't the best in math or geometry, just the fact that I answered him in the way that I did when I said, "Not at this time," he respected that.  And, he saw something in me to be able to answer that way, even he knew I didn't know the answer.  But, it was an acceptable answer.  And, it was acceptable because of the way that I said it.  If I said, "No, I don't know that.  I--," you know, if I blew it off like that, then we'd had a problem.  But, because I said, "Not at this time," I left the door open to come back once somebody else, you know, gave the answer, or I figured it out.
Speaker 1: It was the civility of it, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, and he liked that, and he respected that.  And, what, and reason why, the other thing is why I would say he's one of my favorites is because he said to me, he says, you know, "A lot of people think I'm mean, but I'm not.  I'm gonna tell you the kind of person I am and I want you to think of three Fs when you think of me: fair, friendly, but firm."  And, those three words have stayed with me ever since then, from the tenth grade on to now.  And, that's how I kind of see myself.  I'm fair, I'm friendly, but firm.  You can get by in business.  You can get by in personal relations.  You can get by in just about anything if you're fair, if you're friendly and you're firm.  Now, those three words in that, the way that he said it to me, gave me a lot to go through life with, you know.  Not necessarily in book smarts but in development smarts, in maturity.  Those--that stuck with me all this time.  And, that was one of the best lessons that I could've gotten out of his class, you know.  Was I gonna be able to master geometry?  No.  But, I mastered a good life experience just from those three words from him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was his name?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I ca- you know, I can't remember.  I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's all right.

Speaker 1: Were there other people, were they--now, did you have a boys club or a recreation center--
Speaker 2: Church.
Speaker 1: --or anything like that?  The church was the--
Speaker 2: Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Church.
Speaker 1: And, you were the Church of God in Christ, right?
Speaker 2: Church of God in Christ.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Algiers Church of God in Christ in Algiers, Louisiana [Algiers, New Orleans, Louisiana].  That's across the river.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What we call across the river in New Orleans [Louisiana].  The pastor there was Elder Percy Caseberry [ph.], passed away about ten years ago, I think.  Good man.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Ca- C-A-S (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) C-A-S-E-B-E-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Percy.  He was another inspiration in my life.  He parked cars by day right on Canal Street at one of the parking lots.  That was his day job.  And, he--I always admired the fact that he could do that job, raise his family, be to church on every Tuesday and Friday night and then on Sundays.  And, even before I was driving, he'd come and pick me up for service, Tuesday and Friday nights.  And, being in the church, I think, just helped me to build good moral character aside from what I learned from my mother [Mellenese Magee Anderson].  It was my mother who actually go me in the church in the first place.  And, when I was--this is kind of getting away from that, but it's, it's kind of important in my life.  When I was eleven or twelve and I went to New Orleans, I was diagnosed by my doctor with sickle cell anemia, and--which they have no cure for.  And, my mother took me to church where they believed in the power of prayer, believed that, that God would heal me.  Now, the doctors told my mom to keep me on greens, liver, you know beefs, high iron foods and things like that, which she did.  But, it was the prayer that I believe 'til this day that healed me.  And, there's, there's, you know, I--you can get into all kind of scientific, you know, theories about the whole thing, but you know, my pastor and others prayed for me that God would deliver me.  And, I believe that to today that I was healed of sickle cell anemia and that's why I've been able to go on with my life, through that healing.  And, in that too, was, was a, was a--being able to understand that there was a presence of God in my life, a spiritual connection, something to believe in, a high power.  That having, having that was instilled within me at a very young age was very important to me, I think in my development in life.  And, giving me tools that I needed to, to grow and become the person that I am.

Speaker 1: And, I think, that's what's missing a lot in our, in our kids today in the central cities.  We don't fear, if you don't fear God, you know, if you don't fear the police, you don't fear your parents, you have no god to fear, what do you fear?  And, that's where people are so, you know, out of whack.
Speaker 2: Now, some would argue that too much fear is actually what's wrong with the country you know.
Speaker 1: But, the fear of what, though?  What would--
Speaker 2: Of each other, basically.
Speaker 1: Of each other?  Fear of each other?  But, I think, all that is born out of a fact that not having a, a moral conscience to fear, you know.  There are some things I think that, you know, when you have a spiritual connection or something that morally makes you do that right thing, tells you to do the right thing, then you don't have to fear anybody.  You're not gonna, you're not gonna go out and hurt anybody.  You walk out now, you see a couple of young kids coming at you all hooded up, you know, if they got a gun they're gonna rob you for whatever.  Because they--that moral compass is not guiding them.  And, I think that's--and, then if I, if you, we're in our fifties and we walk around and we walk out there then I don't care if they're black or what color, we're turning and go the other way.  We're suspicious.  That wasn't so back then.  You know, when I--when we had that spiritual going to church and those things to guide you to do the right thing.  We're dealing with a group of children now who don't have that because mom ain't, is not there around the clock.  The police are not there around the clock.  What else do you have to make you do the right thing?
Story_ID: 565041
Speaker 1: By the time you were in high school now, were you involved in high school activities and things?  Or, were most of your activities centered around the church [Algiers Church of God in Christ, New Orleans, Louisiana], you know?
Speaker 2: A lot of activities that I did in high school centered around the church.  But, I was active in high school [Joseph S. Clark High School; Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], I sang in the choir.  I was on the football team briefly.  I played a little bit of tight end.  But, not very long.  My mom [Mellenese Magee Anderson] didn't want me to play anyway.  She was afraid I'd get hurt.  But, it was a neat, short experience.  And, then also in high school is when I had my quartet through the church.  We'd sing primarily at our church and we did a couple of, I won't call 'em (unclear), but performances at other churches too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let me ask you this, now Church of God in Christ members are referred to, I don't know it's official from the church or from people from outside, they're known as sanctified, right?
Speaker 2: Sanctified, yes.
Speaker 1: And, is this an official term from the church itself, or?
Speaker 2: Sanctification, sanctified?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, does that not, there's certain restrictions, there're things you can and can't do--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --if you're sanctified, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, they have to do with consumption of popular culture, you--certain music you can't listen to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or, movies you can't see--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --things like--.  How did that affect you growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, that's one of those things that I guess that when, I talk about that make you do the right thing, make you do good things.  I didn't do a lot of partying.  I didn't do any partying at all.  I started working when I was fourteen, I--a paper route, and the rest was church and school activities.  Then I worked as a waiter, as bus--as a dishwasher at the Governor's House Hotel [Governor House Motor Hotel, New Orleans, Louisiana] there at Claiborne [Avenue] and Canal [Street].  And, then I worked as a busboy, then I worked as a waiter, and then I moved on to working as a cook.  So, I was always doing something.  And, I didn't have a lot of time to, you know, get into any trouble or, you know, party, hangout at people's houses and things like that.  There was just never any time for that because I was always doing something.  I was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] for a little bit at s- in high school.  So, I was always, I would--but, to answer your question about the restrictive on the activities.  Yeah, the church, in some churches in the sanctified church, they didn't want you to go to movies.  They didn't want you to go to football games, didn't want you to participate in any secular activities.  The woman couldn't wear skirts above their knees, you know, all those kinds of things.  I think that's kind of relaxed in some churches now.  I don't think that they are quite as strict as they used to be.  But, those were those restrictions, yeah.  And, then even--it was debated even during that time on what was too strict and what wasn't.  I think some of 'em was a little bit, you know, like, you know, going to a football game or going to, to movies and things like that.  I do remember though, even though I was in church, my dad [Robert Anderson, Jr.] taking me to see the Jets [New York Jets] play the Saints [New Orleans Saints].  I do remember, like I say, I did play football a little bit.
Speaker 1: Now, was your dad as involved in the church as your mom?
Speaker 2: No.  My dad is--naw, furthest thing from it, you know.
Speaker 1: So, that may explain why you went to see (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: The Saints, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, my dad was, my dad was not very religious oriented at all.
Story_ID: 565042
Speaker 1: Now, was your mother [Mellenese Magee Anderson] involved in the church [Algiers Church of God in Christ, New Orleans, Louisiana] when they met, or did it happen--was your mother as involved in the church when your mother and father [Robert Anderson, Jr.] met or did--was that something that she developed later?
Speaker 2: I think that, I don't, my father was never in the church as far as I know.  So, but, my mom has always been involved in the church.  How she got hooked up with him, I don't know.  But, it wasn't in the church (laughter).  It wasn't in the church.  I don't know.  And, I think she would tell you that herself today if, if you asked her.  But, she and I think her church come--upbringing came from--when we were growing up in the country [in Franklinton, Louisiana], you know, the church was, you know, back in the old days, that's all we had, black folks in community, for the most part, coming together for the church.  And, so, I think she had that from her childhood and that carried over into when she moved to New Orleans [Louisiana].  And, she got hook up with the--.  And she's very much still today, you know, close to church members, church life.  And, but, I, I, I think that, you know, having those roots during those time- even though it was kind of restrictive on what you could do or what you could not do and all that.  I think it was still a help to me in those formative years.
Speaker 1: I mean, were, did you toe the line completely or were you tempted to sing--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --secular music or listen to The Temptations--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --or something, or?
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and to be honest with you, I didn't really--that's one rule that I violated.  I listened to what we, what they call the blues during those days.  I'd have my radio on listening to The Temptations and, you know, [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson and all these people.  I, you know, within my own mind, that wasn't a big deal, you know.  So, I didn't consil- consider myself a sinner by listening to that kind of music.  And, I didn't go to a lot of the dances and, and all of that stuff, you know.  But, I listened to the music.  Maybe that's why I ended up recording music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: So, would your mother, were you allowed, were you allowed to play it with--
Speaker 2: I didn't play it around her.
Speaker 1: --when your mother was at home?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't play it around her, no.  'Cause she--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, she was pretty strict on, you know, listening to the blues and all that stuff, you know.  And, still she today is not, you know, she doesn't--that's not her.  She likes the gospel, and you know.  I like gospel music but I've always for some reason when I was a kid, I liked all different kinds of music.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, New Orleans is the place to really--
Speaker 2: New Orleans is a place--
Speaker 1: --appreciate it, you know.
Speaker 2: Sure.  And, I'd hear it.  I'd be around it all the time even when I worked at the restaurants, you know, I'd hear the music, you know.  And, yeah, I, I kind of bent that rule a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565043
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your quartet?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  It was me and a couple of other guys from the church [Algiers Church of God in Christ, New Orleans, Louisiana].  But, I don't remember what we called ourselves.  I think we did have a name, but I don't remember what it was.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a particular kind of sanctified music or is it--you just draw from general gospel music or spirituals, I don't know?
Speaker 2: It was from traditional hymns to a couple of tunes that I wrote that we sang.  And, 'cause I used to play the tambourines, the tambourines and the cymbals in church.  And, I would--the old hymns, the traditional hymns, sanctified, Pentecostal hymns, I would lead those in the service a lot.
Speaker 1: Now, what would be an example of a sanctified hymn?
Speaker 2: 'I'm A Solider' ['I'm a Soldier in the Army of the Lord'].  I'm a s- (singing), "I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord.  I'm a soldier in the army.  I'm a soldier.  I'm a sanctified soldier in the army of the Lord.  I'm a sanctified soldier in the army."  You know, and you're playing them tambourines, you know, and that's--I would lead those kinds of songs in the, in the church.  That was one of my favorites.  And, that would--man, people would be up on the floor, you know, dancing, you'd have the guitars playing.  That's, that's what my mother [Mellenese Magee Anderson] calls a lively church versus a dry church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dry, she considers, you know, when you're just--soft music and the hymn and nobody moving.  And, you know, but, when your get those tambourines--
Speaker 1: Episcopalian church is something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when you get your tambourines going, though, and people shouting and dancing in the church, that's--
Speaker 1: Now, was there ever a discussion or do you have any thoughts about--I know when the Ray Charles movie ['Ray'] came out a couple years ago, there was a discussion about Ray Charles as being someone who took church music and made it secular (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Incorporating--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  By insert- by exchanging Jesus for baby.
Speaker 2: Oh, you find a lot of your old ministers, traditional ministers in sanctified church, just consider that taboo.  You don't, you don't do that.  But, I think a lot of people have, I think in--within the church have kind of grown out of that a little bit.  A lot, as a matter of fact, than from the old days.  And, I don't know why that's been relaxed.  I don't know, to attract more--younger people, I don't, I don't know.  But, yeah, when Ray Charles started doing that, aw man he was just, you know, outcast as far as the church goes.  To him, because, but, but, you know, the roots of, of R and B, blues some of it, comes right out of the church.  The songs, some of the songs that I wrote, the flavor of that was based on, you know, what I learned in church.  How to sing, you know, those kinds of hymns and things in church.  So, you can't--you don't really get away from that.  Aretha [Aretha Franklin] is a perfect example of that, you know.  She grew up singing gospel music with her dad [C.L. Franklin] in, in the church.  So, you can't get away from that.  If you're gonna sing secular music that's gonna bleed over.
Speaker 1: There's another story, just to throw this in, but, you know, Thomas Dorsey [Thomas A. Dorsey], the father of gospel music they called him, was a blues singer before he started singing gospel (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if it, which one feeds--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: You know, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Sure, and then you find a lot of artist who have left gospel music to sing secular music, go back to gospel music.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he was called Alabama Tom [sic. Georgia Tom] as a blues musician, and then became--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --Thomas Dorsey.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Gospel.
Speaker 2: Well, you look at Sam Cooke, you know, Johnnie Taylor, you know, Bobby Womack, all these guys have had roots in gospel music.  And, do they go into R and B because of the money?  Yeah.  A lot of it has to do with the money.  You make more money there.
Speaker 1: Some come back, like Al Green.  And then--
Speaker 2: Some come back like Al Green.
Speaker 1: And, then go back again.
Speaker 2: And, then some kind of mix the two.  R. Kelly came here to perform in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] some years back at our Summerfest event.  And, he was singing, 'Bump n' Grind,' one song, and then he tried to go sing a gospel right after.  It didn't work, you know.  I don't think it worked because, you know, the, I think you gotta know your limitations on that.  You gotta kind of be one or the other.  Which--when you're going that really, it almost kind of is a sign of confusion is that you're torn between which way to go.  Not to say that you can't do one and then do the other.  But, I'm just saying, in the way that's it's done, sometimes you might find someone who's going through some confusion state when they're trying to figure out which way to go.  It comes through within their music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565044
Speaker 1: Now tell us something about J.S. Clark [Joseph S. Clark High School; Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Now, what, was this--this is an all-black high school in--?
Speaker 2: We had one or two white students at Clark--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was there.  One of 'em I think played on the football team.  But, it was primar- predominantly black school, Clark was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And, so, you went there all four years?
Speaker 2: In a black neighborhood, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, did you, did you run for class office or anything like that, or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Didn't run for any class office.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I participated in, I did a couple of talent shows.  A couple in particular where I recited Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] speech, after he died in '68 [1968].  At a talent show after that and I did his, I did his I Have a Dream speech.
Speaker 1: Now, were you, in high school when he was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Killed?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you remember how it affected you and the other students at the time?
Speaker 2: It affect--it had a tremendous impact on me and the other students.  And, I had, in the talent show, I, as I said, I did Dr. King's speech.  And, I had it down so pat, I could sound just like him.  And, deliver it just like him.  And, the kids, a lot of 'em thought that when Dr. King died, he was passing, you know, his, his role in life on down to me 'cause I could sound just--'cause I could deliver just like him.  And, I became so--and they would call me, people would call me to come to whatever event to do that speech.  And, I got so into it that my mom [Mellenese Magee Anderson] started to worry about me.  To think that, you know, "No, son, I mean, Dr. King is gone, you're not gonna be Dr. King.  You're not Dr. King."  And, I had to catch myself too, to realize that no, I'm not the second coming of Dr. King.  And, but, it was amazing how I could, without a whole lot of effort, just stand there, and if you didn't know he wasn't in the room, you'd think it was him.  And, we were all--because Dr. King, at that time, he was, he was the inspiration that guided us all, you know.  We had James Brown of course, 'Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud' those kinds of things.  But, Dr. King being the, being the--he was the Moses of, of our time.  And, even as young people, you know, we saw that and understood that.  So, yeah, when he died it was a tremendous--
Speaker 1: Now, were there riots in New Orleans [Louisiana] when he, when he died?
Speaker 2: I don't recall that there were riots in New Orleans.  Not like there were at some other places, no.
Story_ID: 565045
Speaker 1: So, when you were a senior in high school [Joseph S. Clark High School; Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], what were your prospects?  What did you aspire to do after high school?
Speaker 2: Well, if you look on my high school yearbook, right under my picture, it says, TV news reporter.  And, my inspiration at that time for wanting to go into the business was Walter Cronkite.  Now, during that time there were--you could count the African Americans on one hand who you might see on TV, if at all.  And, even then it was on the weekends if you did, for, for--in a lot of cases.  Walter Cronkite though was a, was a guy who I saw as trustworthy, even though he was white.  Whatever he said, I felt that I could believe him and trust him.  And, I used to sit there and watch him and wonder, how did he get so smart?  How did he--how does he know all of that stuff?  You know, and I didn't know at the time--I don't know if he had a teleprompter but, I guess, he did have a script (laughter), you know.  And, then I've come to realize later.  But, he was believable.  And, for a white man to be that, to have that kind of impression on a young black man growing up during that time, that was--I mean, that meant something, it said something.  So, that's what I wanted to do.  I wanted to be like him.  Yeah, well I said, I wanted to do what he, he did.  And, I--my mom [Mellenese Magee Anderson] wanted me to go to LSU [Louisiana State University - New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana] and be a teacher.  And, because being a teacher, for black folks during that time, that was you know, you were somebody if you were a teacher or a minister.
Speaker 1: Now, were you on a college prep track?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: In--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: All right. So, you, you really weren't on a college prep track but you, you had asp- you had aspirations for college at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, there was no question that I was gonna go to college.  But, I wanted to, I already knew what I wanted to do.  And, I wanted a career in communications that was, not only Walter Cronkite but, a radio announcer by the name of Dr. Daddy-O [Vernon Winslow], worked on WL- WYLD [WYLD Radio] in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Do you remember him?
Speaker 1: No, I don't.  But, those seem like the--two poles, of Walter Cronkite and Dr. Daddy-O.
Speaker 2: Dr. Daddy-O.  Now, Dr. Daddy-O was my French teacher's husband who I told you about earlier.  But, he had a, he played gospel.  And, I'd never heard anyone like him before.  He, he would ha- he would read a scripture and then he would kind of laugh and he'd play some music, and then he'd--he had such a calming, smooth delivery, and I just loved it.  And, so, I w- there was a cross between radio, television, Walter Cronkite and Dr. Daddy-O.
Story_ID: 565046
Speaker 1: I started--but like I said, my mom [Mellenese Magee Anderson] wanted me to be a teacher.  So, I started at LSU New Orleans [Louisiana State University - New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana] the fall after I got out of high school [Joseph S. Clark High School; Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Now, what year did you graduate?
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, in the fall of 1970, I started at LSU New Orleans, and taking basic to freshman courses.  And--
Speaker 2: So, this is the New Orleans [Louisiana] campus of LSU?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The regular campus is in Baton Rouge [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Baton Rouge.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And, so, you know, I don't hardly remember what I, my intent- I knew what I wanted to do, but I don't know if I was going then just to be a teacher or whatever.  But, anyway, I went that first semester.  And, then in about January or so, there was a representative from Career Academy came to the house, I'm not sure how I even met them, found out about them.  But, I found out about this school which taught journalism and broadcasting.  And, it was only like a year course or something like that.  And, so, I talked my mom--had--either the representative came to the house and talked to my mom.  She was very reluctant.  And, their nearest campus was in Atlanta, Georgia.  And, so, I told my mom that's what I wanted to do.  And, she didn't--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: All right.  Nineteen seventy-one [1971] I guess we're at now.  Where you're deciding to go to broadcast school in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Career Academy in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mom was very reluctant for me to go there.  She wanted me to stay on at LSU and, and become a teacher.  But, there was a guy who came through--I'm not really sure how I learned about Career Academy but, I learned that they offered a, a program for broadcast journalism.  And, it wouldn't take me four years to graduate and to get a job.  So, I persuaded her to let me go away to that school, which the nearest location was Atlanta, Georgia.  And, so, we went to Atlanta, I went to Atlanta and within a year I think I had graduated Career Academy.  And, I then went to a school called WNR Electronics [ph.] for--to learn how to read the, the transmitters and stuff like that.  And I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was this like to get a first class license?
Speaker 1: First class license, yeah.
Story_ID: 565047
Speaker 1: So, I got my first class license and I got my--in the meantime, I got my first job as an announcer overnight doing news at WKLS [WKLS Radio; WWPW Radio] I believe it is, in Atlanta [Georgia].  And, I would read the news on the hour from mid- between midnight and six o'clock, five minutes of news.  So, that was my first job.  And, I always for some reason change my name when I (laughter), from station to station where I worked.  I went on the air as Roshell Magee [HistoryMaker Roshell "Mike" Anderson], my mother's maiden (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Roshell Magee?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My--Roshell Magee, my mother's [Mellenese Magee Anderson] maiden name.  And, I don't know why I did that.  It just seemed like the thing to do that not many people on the air at that time were using their real names.  So, I just made that name, you know, just chose that name.
Speaker 2: Now, that's a name, that's--it's interesting, 'cause I've, I've heard that name before--
Speaker 1: Roshell Magee?
Speaker 2: --from a ra- a radio personality.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it's, yeah, that's interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, that's one that you came by naturally by going through your mother's maiden name.  But--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I've heard that name before.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's probably more than one of us somewhere out there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.  So this is 1972, you go on the air with--
Speaker 1: This is 19--
Speaker 2: W--
Speaker 1: --seventy-two [1972], yeah.
Speaker 2: WXNS, right?
Speaker 1: That would be WKLS.
Speaker 2: KLS, WKLS.
Speaker 1: It think it be--WKLS, yeah.  It was an easy listening station at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 565048
Speaker 1: When you were growing up were you kind of a student of the news?  Did you watch the news a lot on television?
Speaker 2: I was student I would say of broadcasting and public speaking.  Because when I--in the church [Algiers Church of God in Christ, New Orleans, Louisiana] is when I was first got introduced to public speaking.  I would open the testifying service, where people get up and give testimonials in church service.  I would open the prayer service.  So, that was my first introduction to public speaking in the church.  And, I felt at that point that's why I chose being a reporter not only from watching Walter Cronkite, but I felt that that's where my talent was, and to doing, doing that type of thing.  And, so, it felt like that was the area for me.  You know, as, as sometimes you, you know, if you're around people who are engineers or teachers or whatever they do, cooks, whatever, you, you kind of grow in--go that way.  Well, this was my sense of what my calling was, is to do something in the, in the public--area of public speaking.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever, before we go further into your career, did you ever consider becoming a minister?
Speaker 2: Yes, very much so.  In fact, my mother [Mellenese Magee Anderson] still thinks that that's a calling for me as well.  And, I'm not too sure that it isn't now.  That may be an area where I end up, in the ministry.  And, it's very possible that, you know, since I'm a strong spiritual believer in God, that maybe God might still have me do some work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't, I wouldn't count that out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565049
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-two [1972] you're at WKLS [WKLS Radio; WWPW Radio, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, I wasn't there, I wasn't there very long.  I then also while in Atlanta [Georgia], I worked for, I also had a job when I was at school there in Atlanta, waiting tables and bussing tables at the Lions Club [Atlanta Lions Club] I think it is on Peachtree [Street].  It was a restaurant.  And, then I also had another job, part-time job, working at W--is it AOK [WAOK Radio] in Atlanta?  Very, very part time.  They let--it was more like an internship at WAOK reading a little bit of news there and kind of hanging out.  And, I remember one of my favorite deejays who put me on the air and got reprimanded for it, Doug Steele.  He was on WAOK at the time.  One of my favorite jocks of all time.  And, he let me go on the air and read news in the newsroom, as they called it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, is he, was he black?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's black.
Speaker 1: Doug Steele.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And, the news director called him up and chewed him out at the time for putting me on 'cause he wasn't supposed to put me on.  But, he believed in me.  He felt that I was ready to go on 'cause he had heard me read and everything.  And, so, so, I actually worked at two stations, I was on the air at two stations, WAOK, and WKLS in Atlanta.  And, that, that--and then a short time later, I moved down to WGOV [WGOV Radio] in Valdosta, Georgia.  And, that was my first job as a deejay primarily at WGOV.  And, then that's where I met the record producer and then got into music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 565050
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You told the story about how, how--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you pressed your first record (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And I think got it--another, another addition pressed in Nashville [Tennessee], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And distributed?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, what was it?  Was that WLAC [WLAC Radio, Nashville, Tennessee] that distributed the record?  It was--okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it wasn't.  It was Nashboro [Nashboro Records, Nashville, Tennessee].  I think they distributed their own music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or, they had a subsidiary that distributed their music or some- something.  That was one my first record.  And, then my subsequent records I made in--and I got pick up by Sunburst Records [Sunburst Records, Ltd.] out of New York [New York] and, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your first record?  What was it?
Speaker 2: A 'Snake Out Of Green Grass.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was on Nashboro.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the message in that, that song?  What was, what were the lyrics (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, the message was this woman who, this guy who met this woman, fell in love with her, and basically she was a snake.  She, he told, she, he thought she was single, you know, alone.  Turned out she had a husband.  And, then the husband find out about them and the guy came at him with a pistol, you know.  That was the story.  It wasn't me.  It was a fictional story that I wrote about someone else (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was it a bluesy kind of song, or?
Speaker 2: Bluesy, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you kind of hum a little bit of it for us?
Speaker 2: (Singing), "Along came a lonely tired woman, oh, she look so innocent, as humble as a lamb."  But, then the hook goes on, (singing), "She was snake out of green grass," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  That has--does have kind of a blues kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --riff to it.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was a bluesy tune.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you said it did fairly well on the East Coast, and--
Speaker 2: It did fairly well in the South and overseas, England, and I'm not really sure where all that record went.  But, it, it got pretty good play.  And, then my second song was called, 'Know What You're Doing When You Leave.'  That one got picked up by Sunburst out of New York, and it made the Billboard charts.  And, then the third song I did called the 'Grapevine Will Lie Sometimes.'  'Grapevine Will Lie Sometimes' also made the Billboard charts.  So, I had two singles that made the Billboard.  And, they were big records in New York City, both of those songs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Up and down the East Coast, in the South, they were, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Big R and B records.
Story_ID: 565051
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you're at WGOV [WGOV Radio] now in Valdosta, Georgia.  Now, why did you decide to take that job?  Now, was that a high- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wanted to have--
Speaker 1: --better paying job, or?
Speaker 2: I wanted to have some fun.  Actually, I took less money to go from KLS [WKLS Radio; WWPW Radio, Atlanta, Georgia] to WGOV.  I was making like 115 bucks [dollars] a--no, 115,000 a year in--at that station was my salary.  And, so I went to 100,000.  Wait a minute, am I right?  No, I was making $115 a week at KLS, Atlanta [Georgia], and I went to $100 a week in WGOV in Valdosta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I took less money to go down there because I wanted to have more fun.  And, then when I, when I--and I saw that Doug Steele, the guy that I mentioned who was the jock in--at AOK [WAOK Radio, Atlanta, Georgia], had so much fun doing the jock show, I didn't wanna do news then.  I wanted to be a jock.  I wanna be like the real Doug Steele; playing that music, you know, having callers call in and all, that was fun.  So, this job opened up at GOV in Valdosta.  I jumped on it, even though it was less money.  And, I was working from midnight to six [o'clock] to start out on that job.  But, it was, you know, I wanted to have fun, and I did.  And, there we got a chance to book, through the station, some recording artist.  This was before I started singing.  Now, they told me before I got there, they had just booked Al Green, had him bring, had him--they were charging fifty cents at the door from what I, from what one of the jocks told me.  And, this was before 'Tired of Being Alone.'  Before, you know, he hit it big and all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I do remember Bobby Womack, [HistoryMaker] Tyrone Davis, those guys coming through.  I remember meeting 'em.  Now, that was fun to me, you know.  So, I traded in that for, to go and have some fun.  And, and, and I did.  And, then that led to, you know, my music career after that.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have an opportunity to, you know, make money doing personal appearances and that sort of thing, you know?  A lot of times deejays are--deejay different sets and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Spinning records and things like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't spin records.  I made money--I remember my first, the first thing I did, not spinning records but singing.  And, as a deejay then before I actually recorded.  You know, we, we just put on a talent, sort of like a talent show.  And, I sang a couple of songs there.  So, I did that a couple of times.  But as far as, you know, spinning records and all that, no, I never did that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, you wouldn't out to the local sock hop or anything and--
Speaker 2: No.  No, sock hops.
Speaker 1: None of that stuff.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, did you have a particular kind of music that you would play or was it just regular R and B, or?
Speaker 2: I played regular R and B, soul music at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Soul music was really big.
Speaker 1: And, it encompassed a lot of--?
Speaker 2: Not a lot of blues, mostly just soul.  You know your Marvin Gayes, your Al Greens, your Bobby Womacks, people like that.  When soul was really in its heyday, soul music they called it.  Not necessarily R and B, not blues, just soul.  You know, sweet music, sweet soul music.  That was the kind of stuff that we played primarily during that time.  [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler, you know.  That kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 565052
Speaker 1: You were in Valdosta [Georgia]--now, were you like splitting these days between your singing career and being a disc jockey [at WGOV Radio] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I hadn't started singing full time yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, now, I left Valdosta and went down to WERD [WERD Radio] in Jacksonville, Florida.  And, this must've been in '73 [1973]-ish. I think it was, '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Yes.  It says '72 [1972] to '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  By that time I'm there, I'd already recorded, 'Know What You're Doing When You Leave.'  So, I'm working at WERD Radio, Billboard comes in one week.  I open the charts, there I am.  Now, I had been at WERD for, I don't know, six months or something like that, maybe.  And, I saw my name--I saw my record on the charts and I wrote my resignation, handed it to the owners; I'm out of here.  That day.  And, so, and then I went over to Albany [Georgia] where I recorded, hooked up with my producer there who was Jesse Boone, Jesse Boone and the Astros.  And, just did gigs.  Just did gigs after that.  And, I--and from that time through '74 [1974], '75 [1975] that's all I did was, was perform.  And, that's how I made my money.  And, it was mostly all cash.  You know, and I was playing night clubs.  Mostly what they call the Chitlin' Circuit during those days.  These were not, you know, your fancy night clubs.  These were your clubs what they call mainly the juke joints, which were kind of out away from everything, kind of in the woods like a lot of those clubs were.
Speaker 1: Mostly in the South?
Speaker 2: Mostly in the South.  And, so that, I made a living like that for, you know, a couple of years.  And, and, but, I was hot then, you know.  My tunes were hot in those areas and people loved them.  And, so, I could draw enough on weekends, you know, to pay bills, to sustain myself, you know.  And, I wasn't married at the time, and so.  It was, it was just a good time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 565053
Speaker 1: At any point in your singing career did you, did you--how close were you to a big break through at some, at a certain point, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I didn't have the, I think I didn't have the, the production to--my songs were not produced, like to go pop, or anything like that.  They were R and B kind of tunes and they were produced that way.  So, I didn't cross over, you know what I mean.  In order to have a huge, huge record during those days to make the pop charts, you had to have a crossover sound.  I didn't have a crossover sound.  I had the right people backing me, these people at Sunburst [Sunburst Records, Ltd.] out of New York [New York].  And, they tried to cross me over, but my sound didn't cross.  So, I stayed in that primary R and B area.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, is Sunburst associated with Dick Griffey?  Is that who I'm thinking of?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Different?
Speaker 2: They were owned by an Italian family in New York, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, now, those are the days, '75 [1975] or so is when disco was starting to become (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, I came in, I came in as--R and B soul was starting to be--get pushed back a little bit in favor of disco.  And, I wasn't--although I did record one single called 'Disco Numbers' trying to, you know, bridge into that.  And, it, it wasn't my style.  It wasn't for me.  So, in about '76 [1976] my songs had gotten cold.  I stop getting calls for guaranteed money for performances.  The promoters wanted me to play for the door.  Well, when you're playing for the door, if it rains, you know, you got bad weather, nobody show up, then you don't make any money, you know.  So, I realized what was happening to me then, and I already had a career in broadcasting.  So, I had to make a decision in about seventy--no, in about--I had to make a decision about what I wanted to do.  By that time, we're talking now in 1976 I think it is, I'm still recording and doing some things.  But, I go work for Milliken textile [Milliken and Company] to supplement my income 'cause I'm not making enough off of gigs.  So, I, I work at Milliken textile in LaGrange, Georgia to supplement my income.  And, then I did that for a while and then I did a few gigs here and there.  And, I'm thinking, well, you know, to myself, I already have a career in broadcasting.  Do I wanna just throw that away trying and maybe never get a hit, big super hit?  So, I decided to give up music and at this point we're talking into seventy--make a long story short, we're into like '77 [1977], '78 [1978] now.  And, so, that's when I go and apply for the job at WL- WLWI [WLWI Radio] in Montgomery [Alabama], the country and western station that I was talking about.  And, so, I resumed my career in radio.  And, and then I worked at WLWI, and then I also got another job at the same--in the same market in Montgomery, Alabama at WXVI [WXVI Radio] being a deejay.  So, I was doing news in the morning at WLWI.  And, then I was doing a deejay jock show playing soul R and B music on WXVI in the afternoons.  And, in the mornings I was Mike Anderson [HistoryMaker Roshell "Mike" Anderson] on WLWI.  In the afternoons I was General Frank Magee [ph.] on WXVI (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, General Frank Magee, that's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) General Frank Magee--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my deejay name in Montgomery.
Speaker 1: And, how did you chose that one, the General Frank Magee?
Speaker 2: How did I?
Speaker 1: How did you manage to choose that name?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.  I just--well, Magee again, my mother's [Mellenese Magee Anderson] maiden name.  General Frank, just, I don't--it just came to me, you know.  It's just--you know, made it up, you know, I was on the air, General Franklin Magee (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: Franklin is like Franklin, Louisiana [sic. Franklinton, Louisiana], I guess, or Franklin (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, okay.  So, so, how did that--so, you're doing these two jobs; news and doing--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --spinning records too.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 565054
Speaker 1: And, that was a good time in my life.  And, then my news director at WLWI [WLWI Radio, Montgomery, Alabama] left that station and went to Birmingham [Alabama] as a producer.  His name was Jimmy Carter [ph.].  Not to be confused with the President Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] at the time.  But, his name was Jimmy Carter.  And, he went to work for WAPI [WAPI-TV] at the time, it's now WVTM [WVTM-TV], Channel 13 in Birmingham, and--as a producer.  And, they were looking for more reporters to add on to their staff, so he recommend me.  This is a TV station.  I'd never done television before.  But, I'm thinking, wow, you know, this might be a shot.  So, I went up to WAPI and the news director--I made a resume tape of my voice work, gave that to 'em.  But, they wanted to see what I could do on camera.  So, I went up, they liked my resume, they sent me out on a story and--with another reporter who was gonna report for that day.  But, they wanted me to do the same story so they could view it behind the scenes to see how I present it.  I asked the guy, the reporter I was with, I said, "What's the hardest thing to do--?"  About putting together a story.  And, the reporter told me it was a stand up.  He said his hardest thing for him to do is to stand in front of that camera and deliver a stand up.  And, so, I thought to myself, okay, if that's the hardest thing to do, that's what I'm gonna do.  So, I did my whole story straight stand up, wrote it, rememorized it, and did the whole thing stand up.  And, then the editor, the photographer who was with us, he says, "Don't you wanna put some B-roll over that?"  I said, "B-ro- ?"  I didn't know what B-roll was.  That meant cover shots, okay.  Then I says, "Well, I suppose you could, yeah."  Threw a little cover shots over there, put a sound bite in there, and then the news director said that's what he was impressed with.  The fact that I was able to stand in front of the camera, with cars passing behind me, and I wasn't distracted, did the whole thing.  Took me like two takes, but I did it.  So, I got the job.  And, I became a reporter there at W- WAPI, Channel 13.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is nineteen seventy--
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: --nine [1979].  Okay.
Story_ID: 565055
Speaker 1: Then I'm working there, and there was--back in '79 [1979], late '79 [1979] a white police officer shot a black young woman in the back five times.  She was at a convenience store.  There was a robbery, and the police responded, they thought, they said they thought she was a part of the robbery, somebody was robbing the store, or something like that, I think it was.  It was a national story.  Made Jet magazine, made--.  Anyway, she was shot five times in the back.  That led to, to demonstrations on the part of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC].  The KKK [Ku Klux Klan] was out there marching.  I was the reporter on that story.  Every night there was something going on around that story for a long time.  And, anyway, my news director from what I understand, kept getting calls and--from people saying, "I don't care what your black reporter says," and all that kind of stuff.  And, I don't know if this directly had anything to do with, do with it or not, but not long after that my news director called me in and told me that, you know, I wasn't cutting it in, in television.  Says, "I know my people, and you're not happy."  His name was Wendell Harris, he was the news director at Channel 13 [WAPI-TV; WVTM-TV, Birmingham, Alabama], he said, "I know my people and you're not, and you're not happy here."  I says, "Well, Wendell," you know, "what do, what do you mean?"  I said, "I'm--," you know, "I'm--."  He says, "No, no, no, no, no, no, now I could fire you, now.  But, I'm not gonna do that, I'm gonna send you over to radio.  That's where you come from.  I think you'll be much happier in radio."  And, I had to swallow that.  I, I felt that, you know, it was wrong, what he was doing.  'Cause I didn't, I didn't find any justification for, you know, sending me to radio.  Or, I didn't, I thought I was doing okay.  And, he didn't really give me justi- a real reason for, for doing it.  Other than he's telling me that I wasn't happy.  I don't know what made him think that I wasn't happy.  So, I bit my tongue.  I went over to radio.  'Cause there were, there were--API was radio and TV.  I went over to the radio station [WAPI Radio, Birmingham, Alabama].  The general manager welcomed me, gave me a little raise, all that, you know.  And, I felt kind of bad.  I grew a beard, and you know, I just, let my hair grow and I didn't--I just kind of felt kind of depressed, but I did the job.  And, radio was happy to have me.
Story_ID: 565056
Speaker 1: But, at the same time, I was getting my television resume together and sending out my resume tapes.  And, lo and behold, I got a call from Seattle [KIRO-TV, Seattle, Washington], and they liked what I was doing, they liked my style, they wanted me to come out for an interview.  I did that.  I got the job in Seattle [Washington].  I'm back in TV.  So, that would've been 1980, right doing the eruption of Mount St. Helens.  And, in fact, I got there just in--when I went over for my interview, Mount St. Helens was active.  It hadn't burst yet, but it was active.  And, then after I moved out there and got the job, that was my story, pretty much every day, covering Mount St. Helens after the eruption.  I mean, and they, and they would send us down there sometimes in a helicopter.  Send me sometimes down there in a little fixed wing airplane, you know, where I'm right over the crater, fly down there, do my story, come back.
Speaker 2: What was that like?  What did you, I mean--?
Speaker 1: It was scary.  It was not scary at the time, at the time it was the big story, biggest story in the world.  And, I was on it.  So, that's the only thing that matters (background noise).  And, and now, I think about it, it's crazy.  It's scary because I wasn't flying with the best of pilots.  These were, these are young people in a lot of cases, you know.  They put us on these planes, send us down there.  And, I think about how scary it is now.  But, during the time, all that matters that I was on the big story.  And, so, I'd to come back and I, sometimes I'd walk in the station, we had a helipad right up on top of the building.  I'd come in, I'm lead story at 6:00, I get back, it's 5:30, 5:40.  I gotta get that story, get it tracked, get it edited, and on the air by 6:00.  Now, that's adrenaline.  But, that's how I learned the art of working fast, and really helped sharpen my skills to be able to turn stories quickly.
Story_ID: 565057
Speaker 1: So, and then later on I found out what anchors were making in the business.  And, I got a job--we had somebody to leave Channel 7 [KIRO-TV], which was the station in Seattle [Washington] where I was working.  So, I applied for the weekend anchor job, and I got a weekend co-anchor job.  And, still not really thinking that, you know, anchoring is where, where I wanna be.  I found out what anchors were making, how much more they were making than reporters.  I'm thinking, wow, this anchor thing, you know, might be all right.  This is where I wanna be.  So, then I sent out resume tapes to consultants around the country.  Let them know I was available as an anchor.  I was up for a job in Atlanta [Georgia], and I was up for a job here at WISN [WISN-TV] in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  Atlanta never flew me out, they--we just exchanged telephone conversations.  They were kind of dragging their feet.  I came here, this place, for my interview.  Then they invited me back--no, I came here, I did my interview.  Within a month or two they called and said, "We want you, want you here."  And, after--I remember doing my job interview, my news director came and shook my hand.  I mean, the general manager shook and said, shook my hand like this, said, "We'd love to have you here."  His name was Mickey Hooten.  And, that was one of the things that, that made me take this job.  And, I've been here ever since, you know.  I, I had planned to be here for three years.  I'd signed the contract with the William Morris Agency [William Morris Endeavor].  And, had planned to, you know, had been on other, been on other interviews over the years but for some reason it's just worked out that I've always stayed here.
Story_ID: 565058
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about what things have been like here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], at--
Speaker 2: In Milwaukee, because I had moved around so much before I came here, and when I came, one of the things I heard was that I was gonna freeze my butt off, that was the first thing.  And, then when I came to do my interview, the cab driver, I believe he was a Russian cab driver said to me that, "If--you're gonna move to Milwaukee?"  I says, "Well, I don't know.  But we're thinking about it."  He says, "Well, if you do, you have to live on the North Side, you have to live on the North Side; don't like blacks on the, on the South Side."  So, I'm thinking, oh, man, I don't know about this.  And, come to find out later on that Milwaukee has a, still has a reputation as being one of the most segregated cities in the, in the country.  But, I never thought of it that way.  I never looked at it that way.  I never thought about the cold.  I never thought about anything.  I just came here and ex- looked at the city for what it was for me.  And, it's just turned out that the cold, I adjusted to.  And, the city itself I adjusted to.  Yes, it's very, it's kind of unique in a way in that it is kind of segregated.  I found out that there were people who had never, who lived on the South Side, had never been on the North Side ever before.  People who live on the north had never been on the South Side before.  People didn't know each other ethnically.  Like they had from when I was--grew up in the South.  In Alabama, Georgia, Florida, all these places, black and white, whether you agree or disagree with the (unclear), like each other or dislike each other, you at some point come face to face with each other.  Here, people had never, there were blacks who had never been around white folks in their whole lives.  Whites who'd never been around blacks.  All they know is what they see on TV, read in the papers, or hear on the radio.  And, for me having lived such a diverse life before and been around all kinds of different people that worked and helped I think me to understand that a get along with everybody.  I could go on the South Side, I could just--I think God gave me an ability to just kind of relate to all kinds of people.  So, that's kind of what I, I think that helped me work through that segregation part of, of Milwaukee.  And, I found that be it through television, people have accepted me here, they seem to like my work here, and that's really all that matters.  And, I've made a lot friends here, possibly through television and some just kind of on my own.  So, it's been a city that I've been able to work pretty comfortably in despite whatever shortcomings that it, that it might have.  And, it does have quite a few like many, like many cities.  But, you know, you go through life in my opinion and you find, I mean, you're gonna find something that's not right no matter where you go, I think.  Whether you live where I lived in New Orleans [Louisiana], Atlanta [Georgia], Florida, you know, Alabama, there's something that's gonna be wrong.  So, if you find the niche that works for you, then go with that.  And, that's kind of the way it's worked out for me here in Milwaukee.  And, as I said before, I didn't plan to be here but three years.  I have had job interviews in Chicago [Illinois], Boston [Massachusetts], St. Louis [Missouri], other bigger markets, but for some reason the timing just never worked out for me to leave [WISN-TV, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And, so, that fact that I've stayed here and been here and built much of my career here, I think it's the way the Lord planned it and meant for me to be.  And, I think that's why I've stayed here.  I think that's why I'm here now.
Story_ID: 565059
Speaker 1: During your tenure here [WISN-TV, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], what's been the biggest news story you've covered?
Speaker 2: Well, Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer was one of the bigger stories that I covered I can think of offhand.  I've done (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he lived in a black neighborhood, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's--not far from here.
Speaker 1: Was that a North Side neighborhood [Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Not far from our studios.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You could walk.  It's right off--on Kilbourn [Street].  You could walk from here to there.  That was one of the bigger stories that I've covered and, you know, I've done so many different things that I kind of forget over the years.  There was a drought in '88 [1988] that I covered.  And, there's, now that, now that you ask me, I can't think of, I'm sure there's something that I'm gonna be thinking of, wow, that was a big story.  But, I've done a number of, of big stories.  I've had a number of great interviews since I've been here.  And, when I was in Seattle [KIRO-TV, Seattle, Washington] I re- .  Stevie Wonder who I interviewed in Seattle [Washington].  Rod Stewart in Birmingham [WAPI-TV; WVTM-TV, Birmingham, Alabama] come to mind.  [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, one of the most interesting people that I've ever met and have respect for that I had an opportunity to interview.  And, there've been a number of other stories.  When I came here there was story where a young man, right after I got here, was killed in police custody by the name of Ernie Lacy [Ernest Lacy].  That was a big story 'cause that that had somewhat of a movement here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] like we had in the South that we normally didn't see here.  Milwaukee had its share of--they talk about in '67 [1967], I think there was a riot here related to demonstrations, civil rights.  But, there was a really coming together of people in the black community here in Milwaukee that was, that I hadn't heard of.  I hadn't been here long enough to see it but, I hadn't heard of, of a togetherness in the city after that, that incident.  Now, I see that, that was very prevalent in the South but I don't see that kind of togetherness here in the black community that I see in the South, even today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: You're a weekend anchor?
Speaker 2: I don't anchor anymore (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You don't anchor anymore?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I mostly report now [for WISN-TV, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, (cough), I haven't anchored much since, on a regular basis since 2003, 2004.  So, yeah, 2004.  So, I mostly do reports.  But, I, I have a great schedule now.  The best schedule I think I've ever had.  In that I work Monday through Friday.  I work like usually ten to six.  And, when I was anchoring, I either worked nights or I worked weekends or, you know.  But, I have a great schedule and so, I'm kind of like at a good point (knocks on wood).  (Laughter) I don't wanna say that too loud because sometimes on the job if you, if you start saying you're really happy, they find something that'll make you miserable, you know.  But, right now, I'm at--I get a lot of good stories that I have an opportunity to do.  And, I kind of--hopefully stay under the radar and so that they don't notice I'm here for a few more years (laughter).  And, stay on the job for a little longer.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Tell me, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My concern for the African American community is that we've lost a lot of moral value.  We never had a lot of money.  But, then in days when I grew up, money--we didn't need a lot of money, we needed each other.  We were more family.  In, in the '70s [1970s] my maturation process we had, as I might have mentioned before, James Brown, 'Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud.'  You meet a, meet another black person on the street, it was your brother, "What's up, what's happening?"  You know, it's like, "What can I do for you, anything, any old--if you need something, you know, I'm there for you," that kind of stuff.  We don't have that right now.  And, I don't see that in our younger people.  It's about me, me, my, what can I take from you.  And, that's a sad state.  And, I think that contributes in large part to a lot of the violence and to some degree the poverty within our community.  And, when I say poverty, I mean, sick poverty.  I mean, the days when I was growing up in the African American community, it wasn't about the money.  If I had a pot of beans, and you needed, you need s- and you need something to eat, you got it.  There's no problem.  And, I don't see that today.  That's my biggest concern.  A sharing of love.  We don't have brotherly love for each other.  We hate each other.  I mean, you know, if we had, if we had an augment or disagreement, at most it would be a fist fight.  Somebody might pull a knife.  But, now it's a gun and it's over.  Human life, human dignity, respect for each other is not there in our community.  That concerns me greatly in our, in our community.  The fact that our young people don't take education seriously.  That's a great concern to me, so.  And, where our future goes, and the lack of spiritual connection to, to God is, is I think, is one of the leading causes of our problem.  And, if we don't get that turned around then I think we're in deep trouble.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  I think my path to where I am has been a natural path.  It's been a natural progression to where I am now.  Part--in part, I believe that God helps those who helps themselves.  So, I in part engineered where I am now.  But, I think God led me to where I am now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, I think I'm doing what he wants me to do.
Story_ID: 565063
Speaker 1: And, likewise, when you look at what you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Being a good father, being a good a husband when I was married [to Beulah Elaine Anderson].  That's chief among them.  I think that's--I think if we in life can be good parents that's--because that's the future.  You're breeding other parents--parents to be, to carry on.  And, I think unfortunately, that's what's missing in a lot of cases, so I did that.  I, I did, I did, I did what I felt was best for my family, and having good family life.  And, I think, it's God, family, and career.  Those three things in that order.  If you put those in perspective then you, you're okay.
Story_ID: 565064
Speaker 1: The last question is, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone who was a good person, a good human being.  As a professional, someone who respected himself and someone who respected others.  And in turn that made me whole.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
