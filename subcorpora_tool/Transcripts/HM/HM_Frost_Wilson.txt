Speaker 1: Okay.  We are rolling, and if you can just tell us a little bit about what we're seeing--
Speaker 2: Well, what you're seeing there is at a political affair.  Joining me is some of my colleagues in the city council, and Ed Vrdolyak, and this was Senator--I forget his name now.  But Ed Vrdolyak was a--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Which one's--Ed Vrdolyak is all the way on the left?
Speaker 2: No, in the center.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: At one time, he was the party chairman, too.  He was in city council.  And he became infamous for his lead against Mayor [Harold] Washington.  When Mayor Washington was elected, he had a group of aldermen in what we called the 29-21.
Speaker 1: You said it didn't make any difference now, yeah.
Speaker 2: So who's to Ed Vrdolyak's right there?
Speaker 1: Frank, uh--
Speaker 2: To his right is actually, you know--his left, and to the right in the lower left.
Speaker 1: Well, that would be Alder-, an alderman from the 15th Ward, and that would be his committeeman to his right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is about when?
Speaker 1: This was taken--oh, I would say about 1980, about 1980.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He's having a Variety Golf Outing.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the center.  And I think that was the team that I played on out there that, that afternoon.
Speaker 2: Yeah, celebrity golf tournament in 1977, September.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  At one of our dances, and a lot of the people now are deceased, but [HistoryMaker] Jim Montgomery's in there, Calvin Hall.  I think the people were still alive.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: No, no, I've--I'm sorry.  That's the Cook County Bar Association.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. And where are you?
Speaker 1: I am right here.  And that was taken when--in 19-, it says July 1989, I think, that's, that's-
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, it is, '89 [1989].  I don't recognize that stuff and that's funny.  I know some of them.
Speaker 1: Well, George Howard--you have, a lot of them are dead now--Bill Elston.  We were there for a world conference.  It was during Jane Byrne's administration.  And we were all given audiences with the Pope and that was in--or about 1980.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We have--and I'm not getting closer.
Speaker 1: That's my wife and I, yes.
Speaker 2: What's your wife's name?
Speaker 1: My wife at that time--her name was Gloria.  She's deceased.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's Ralph Metcalfe.  Ralph and I were in the Varsity Club together.  Ralph was alderman and the Chairman of the Building and Zoning Committee when I first came into the council.  Then subsequently, he went to Congress.  And to the right over here, this looks like Justice [HistoryMaker] [Charles] Freeman who's now on the Supreme Court of State of Illinois.  Ralph Met-, Metcalfe, Jesse Owens, and Ozzie Simmons, and a lot of us were in clubs called the Colored Varsity Club where the requisite to joining that club was that you have gone to college and earned a letter in a sport.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Doug Wilder is a former governor of Virginia.
Speaker 2: That was taken--oh, based on the hairstyle and everything and the color of my hair, I'll, I would say it was about 1970-something (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was this taken for so I can put those?
Speaker 2: It, it might have been taken as a photograph to be used in some of my involvements.  The photograph here was taken--oh, I would say in 19-, about 1969 or '70 [1970].  This was when they first started putting telephones on this, on the street. I was the chairman of the Utilities Committee at that time for the city council.  And this was one of the phones that they used for demonstration purposes and I was checking it out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, (unclear), ready.
Speaker 1: This is my mother, Freddie Frost, and this was taken shortly after I was elected as alderman in 1967.  She's now deceased.  She died in '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Quicker than I am.  Yeah, he's, he's got on the pause, you know.  Every time he takes it off, he has to put it back on.  Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my wife, Gloria, and I.  It was taken in February of 1967.  We were going into a polling place in--for my election.
Speaker 2: And you were voting for yourself and (laughter)?
Speaker 1: That is correct.  I hope I got two votes that day.
Speaker 2: At least--we can hold up two fingers. (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Next. Okay.  Well, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, [HistoryMaker] Fred Herzog was my law professor at Kent [Chicago-Kent College of Law, Chicago, Illinois].  Subsequently, he became the Dean of John Marshall Law School [Chicago, Illinois].  And that picture, I would say, was taken--this was prior to the time that [HistoryMaker] Roland [Burris] became comptroller.
Speaker 2: So, Herzog is in the center, and Roland Burris all the way on the right?
Speaker 1: That is correct.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Herzog?
Speaker 1: H-E-R-Z-O-G.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is John Glenn.  John Glenn was a good friend of Harold Washington.  And he brought into some affair and we were introduced to him.
Speaker 2: And he was a senator?
Speaker 1: And then--that is correct, but also I came in contact with him because I was a member of the Democratic National Committee.
Speaker 2: He, he ran for president one year.
Speaker 1: That's correct.  But that is Maynard Jackson, the mayor of Atlanta [Georgia] at the time.  And that's Michael Bilandic, who was mayor [of Chicago, Illinois], and this was taken in 1977.
Speaker 2: Well, Maynard Jackson.
Speaker 1: Cartwright, Roland Burris, Lenora Cartwright used to be the Commissioner of Human Resources.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: She's deceased now.
Speaker 2: She died of cancer or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's Eugene Barnes.  He was a state rep at one time.  He was in my political organization.  That's his wife.  She's deceased, and [Senator] Paul Simon and myself with my wife at that time, Gloria.
Story_ID: 192989
Speaker 1: Ed Vrdolyak.
Speaker 2: Oh, did we just shoot that up?  No.
Speaker 1: No, you shot another with, with, with--
Speaker 2: You're sitting in that far right. I mean, what--we haven't finished--
Speaker 1: That's a picture--I think we were in New York [New York].  We might have been in New York.  We had gone there for the bond rating.  We used to have to go to Standard & Poor and Moody's.
Speaker 2: And get a city bond rating?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that would have been taken in '82 [1982] or thereabouts.
Speaker 2: Were you the finance chair then?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And who's with you?
Speaker 1: This is--the woman is Jane Byrne and she was the mayor [of Chicago, Illinois] at that time.  And that's Lou Hill.  He was the commissioner of a major department--
Speaker 2: As long as we have his name.  Okay
Speaker 1: And those are her bodyguards in the back.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, that's Lisa (sic) Minnelli, Liza Minnelli.  Eugene, [HistoryMaker] Eugene Sawyer and I, and I, and I think that was when--this might have been be-, this was before Sawyer became mayor, 'cause I was not in the council when he became mayor.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now this was at some social affair or something.  He--that's George Dunne on the right here.  This is President [Jimmy] Carter and Michael Bilandic and that's all.
Speaker 2: They all standing in line to greet you (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Well, I was invited to the White House several times when Carter was, was there as well.  Now, Carter was a pretty good friend of Cecil Partee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, as a matter of fact, on some occasion, prior to him becoming president, Cecil spent a night at his home.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He's an interesting person, Cecil--
Speaker 1: Now, this is a picture of my law office.  This is Howard Miller.  He subsequently became a judge.
Speaker 2: He may be doing this.  Make a point with this and just put it in--
Speaker 1: Howard Miller; this is Leon Meyer, and this is Paul--his son's a judge now.  That was a picture taken at some affair, and those are, those that were in my law office at the time.  Now this is a picture of my family.  This is my daughter.  This is my son-in-law.  This is my late wife [Gloria Frost].  This was her sister and her husband, Carl Dusom.  This is my mother-in-law, Mae [ph.] Shepherd [ph.].  This is my mother [Freddie Frost] and this is me.
Speaker 2: Do you want to give their names later?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Mae Shepherd, Freddie Frost, Joyce Dusom, Carl Dusom, Gloria Frost, Benjamin Baldridge, Jacqueline Baldridge.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Dusom?
Speaker 1: D-U-S-O-M.
Speaker 2: And Baldridge?
Speaker 1: B-A-L-D-R-I-D-G-E.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is Richard J. Daley.  This is one of my precinct cap-, these were two of my precinct captains.  This was taken at one of our political affairs, and the mayor used to visit our affairs, you know.
Speaker 2: Do you remember their names?
Speaker 1: I've got their names somewhere, but I don't remember their name--
Speaker 2: And this is in--
Speaker 1: This was taken--it had to be taken before--
Speaker 2: '77 [1977]?
Speaker 1: Before '76 [1976], before December '76 [1976].  He died December 20, 20 of the, some--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This again is Mayor Daley at one of the affairs.  Now I was the president pro tempore after Claude Holman.  Initially blacks holding the position of president pro tempore was--Metcalfe became president pro tempore.  Then he had to give it up when he became Chairman of Building and Zoning.  Claude Holman succeeded him, and I succeeded Claude Holman upon Claude Holman's death.
Speaker 2: Okay. He was bored with something (unclear) and had something else to do, and then just leaving--
Speaker 1: Now, this is the mayor.  This is [HistoryMaker] Emil Jones' first wife.  This is Eugene Barnes and his wife.  And this is none other than Emil Jones.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: Now, Emil was my first aldermanic secretary when I was elected in 1967.
Speaker 2: And who, who's the woman right here on your right?
Speaker 1: Here?

Speaker 1: That picture was taken at the time--this is Ogilvie, [Governor] Richard Ogilvie.  This is George Dunne, Mayor Daley, Bishop Ford.
Speaker 2: It sure is.  On your far right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And this picture was taken when the Dan Ryan was extended and it was open at 95th Street.  This was taken at 95th and State.
Speaker 2: Or were they extended it out to Calumet (unclear)?
Speaker 1: When it start sending it--
Speaker 2: Well, does that have any bearing on why they named it Ford Expressway--I mean, named that, that stretch after the Calumet--
Speaker 1: No, no.  This was--the Dan Ryan didn't--this was the first extension to--
Speaker 2: Oh, 290?
Speaker 1: 95th.  This was prior to it going 57 and 94.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Man.
Speaker 1: That was subsequent.
Speaker 2: So what year was this?
Speaker 1: This was, this would have to be in 1968 or '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: The picture of my wife and my mother.
Speaker 2: About what year is that?
Speaker 1: That would have to be about 1970.
Speaker 2: All right, got it.
Speaker 1: This picture was taken at one of my ward picnics.  I used to hold picnics every summer for all the children in the ward, and we would have games and give out prizes.  And, and this is a picture taken of my--with my children, with Kimberly [ph.] and Michael.  This picture was taken--oh, I would say in 19-, about 1970.
Speaker 2: That was 1975.  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of--in the center, you have Joseph Bertrand.  On the other side of me, you have [HistoryMaker] Clark Burrus, who was the city comptroller, and you had Wilson Frost, who was the chairman of the Finance Committee.  And this was taken in November of '78 [1978], is it?
Speaker 2: Yes. Now, this is a picture--
Speaker 1: But when--hold on one second.  And give it to me (unclear).

Story_ID: 192990
Speaker 1: Yes, 2001.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That was taken in 2000 at [HistoryMaker] Emil Jones' golf outing.  This is a picture of the Mayor of Ford City.
Speaker 1: Ford Heights [Illinois]?  Why is it Ford City?
Speaker 2: Well, we are talking about the same place.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ford Heights, all right.
Speaker 2: And this is my wife, Myra, and myself.  And this is Senator Jones.  And I don't remember his name.  Here are the same two children that you saw at my ward picnic, Michael and his sister, Kimberly [ph.], and my daughter, Jacqueline, and Ben Baldridge.  That is, that is a picture that was taken when I was at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and that was taken in 19-, about 1948.
Speaker 1: You were on the basketball team?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you--what position did you play?
Speaker 2: I played forward and guard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is what got you into the Varsity Club, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of season did you have?
Speaker 2: We--that year, we won enough games to get into the tournament.  Usually, the first four teams in the division, I think we were on the--now we played in the SCIA [sic. SIAC, Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Were you bas-, basically raised in Chicago [Illinois] or came here?
Speaker 2: I came to Chicago when I was six months old (laughter), so you (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you're in Chicago now.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  That's a picture taken of me addressing some group or something.  They sent me the picture.  By the hairstyle, I would say that was in the 1970s.  That picture was taken--we had a meeting of the Democratic National Committee and I was one of the members representing here.  To my right, we have [HistoryMaker] Cardiss Collins, congresswoman.  We have Supreme Court Justice Cecil Partee, Alderman [HistoryMaker] [Iola] McGowan, Ron Brown.  Ron Brown subsequently became the National Party Chair.  This fellow used to be the Speaker Madigan's chief of staff.  [HistoryMaker] Roland Burris, myself, and Emil Jones.  That was taken out at O'Hare Field, and it was taken during the time when Ron Brown was the chairman of the National Democratic Party.  This was before he--and subsequently, he was appointed as a cabinet member.
Speaker 1: It's in '92 [1992] then, I guess around the time of Clinton's--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Something parked over there (unclear).
Speaker 2: Now, this picture, this picture was taken, oh, around 1987.  This is when I was the--on the Board of Tax Appeals.
Speaker 1: All right, you must have lots of, lots of friends then (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  You better know it (laughter).  Actually, I, I was there for 12 years from--
Speaker 1: Then about one guy, I was reading in, you know, the paper or something, this--they, they got around the board, with (unclear) he got indicted or something or (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No.  In with [HistoryMaker] Eric Johnson and his wife, Pam, taken out at Olympia Fields golf course.  And that's my wife, Myra, and myself.  And this was taken--oh, I'd say, about 1997.  And subsequently, he went to the bench.  Then after he retired, then he came back on--then he held a substantial rank in the National Guard [of the United States] or something.
Speaker 1: About what, what year is this?  Just you and [HistoryMaker] Judge Earl Strayhorn--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would have been taken around 1990--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You think I've got a lot?  You haven't seen nothing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a picture that's taken of a lot of my former classmates and friends.  And we would go during the winter time, during this time of year, we would go to places like Myrtle Beach and various other places.  This picture was taken in Myrtle Beach.  This is Carl Bonner, Wayman [ph.] Ward, Alvin [ph.] Body [ph.].  This fellow was with Social Security.  I'll think of his name.  And, but these are all Chicagoans.  But this fellow and I went to kindergarten together and went all the way through kindergarten through high school, in the [U.S.] Army.  And then subsequently, I got out of the Army before he did, and we--he ended up down at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Now where did y'all go to kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Chicago, Doolittle [Doolittle Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: To Doolittle, yeah.  I, I thought it was Doolittle, I was thinking Doolittle because--
Speaker 2: Now, this is a picture at one of the golf outings, taken in 1992.  And this is when I was on the board of appeals.  And this is with my partner on the board of appeals at that time with Joe Berrios.  And this is Bob Martwick, a committeeman, and this is his law partner.  That was taken in '92 [1992].  That is a picture that I think this picture was taken at the time I retired from the board, so that would have been December of '98 [1998].  And it was taken with my long-time friend, Senator Jones.  It was taken in the '90's [1990s] while I was on the board of appeals.  Like I see, that it's start to turn my hair gray (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now it's (unclear).
Speaker 2: Now, that's a picture that was taken with Emil Jones and I.  And this is a judge--what's the judge's name?  He ran for the county court (ph.) a couple of times.  I'll think of it in a few seconds.  And in the early '50's [1950s], and at that time I was a juvenile parole agent.  And I got an award from Nutsie [ph.] Kenache [ph.].  He was our superintendent at that time, and I was in law school at that time.  This is a picture with--in Maui, Hawaii.  And the--in the team pairings, I pulled her as a pro, and we won the pro-am.
Speaker 1: Oh, who, who is that?
Speaker 2: Alice Miller.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to represent Helene Curtis.  And every year, we--in February, we had an opportunity to go to Maui and play.  This is a picture that's taken at one of the golf, golf outings.  This is Senator Alan Dixon, the person that Moseley beat, [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun beat.  This is Ed Burke and I don't know who some of the others are, but that was taken while he was a senator.
Story_ID: 192991
Speaker 1: Now that's a good one of Cecil Partee.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, Cecil Partee on my right there.  In the middle is Mar-, Marty Tuccio [ph.] who is a county commissioner.  And myself, I think at that time, I was on the board of appeals.  And I think Cecil was the state's attorney at that time.  On with Cecil, that is a picture where I was receiving an award from the 40 Club as Man of the Year, and [Richard J.] Daley came there to make the presentation.  And that was after, shortly after I'd become president pro tempore, so that would have been around '73 [1973].  The interesting part about it was all of the club members--they were surprised that I could get Daley out to an all-black affair.  And so that I was talking to the chief of staff one day and he said that all the people marveled that I could get him there and, and the chief of staff said you know why they can't get them there?  I said why?  He said they nev-, never invited him (laughter).
Speaker 1: I, I heard that Daley got criticized--
Speaker 2: That was a softball game.  It's when I was in the city council.   We had a softball team, and we would play the executive (unclear), and sometimes we would play city councils from other cities like Cleveland [Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: We had a pretty good team.
Speaker 1: Who, who was the best player on the city council team?
Speaker 2: The best player on the city council team at that time, it would have possibly been between Terry Kibiskey [ph.] and I.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a pitcher where that I was being sworn in as a member of the Board of Tax Appeals and I'm being sworn by Chief Justice [HistoryMaker] [Charles] Freeman.  And that along with me was Joe Berrios, so that this would have been in 1991, I would say.  That is a picture when Harry Summerall and I were being sworn in at the Board of Tax Appeals, and this was in 1984.  And Harold Washington came, mayor, he was the mayor at the time and I had left the city council, and he came over to assist in the swearing in.  These are three of my great-grandsons.  This one here is--
Speaker 1: At the top?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Austin Tyler, this is Michael Baldridge, and this is Justin Baldridge.
Speaker 1: Michael Baldridge and Justin Baldridge?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Geneva, she is the only sister that I have at this time.  I had two sisters that predis-, I mean, that's deceased.  But Geneva Harris is about ten years younger than I and she's a nurse by profession.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Arizona.
Speaker 1: About what year was this shot?
Speaker 2: This was taken of her when she graduated--got her master's in nursing and this was taken about twenty years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, about 1980 or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: This is a picture that was taken in April of 1944.  I was inducted into the [U.S.] Army, gone to Fort Sheridan [Illinois], and I was coming back through Chicago, being shimpped [sic] to, shipped to Camp Crowder, Missouri.  I had time to get out at the train station and have this photograph taken to send to my mother in my army uniform.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This picture, the purpose of this was I was on the Demo-, State Central Committee at that time.  And this was a time when [HistoryMaker] Roland [Burris] had made an appearance before the State Central Committee for the position of comptroller.  And we, as black elected official, held a press conference giving him our support.  And, subsequently, he got the endorsement of the party and was elected as comptroller.  [HistoryMaker] Eugene Sawyer, Eugene Bond, [HistoryMaker] Emil Jones, and--
Speaker 1: Emil Jones had a big Afro, didn't he?
Speaker 2: Yep.  Emil's father used to be one of my precinct captains as well as Emil.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) black and white, I think it's a (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Now that, that was one of the pieces of my political campaign when I was elected in 1967.  And the person who helped me design that would use a theme that we used on all my campaign literature was to do something different so that it would catch someone's eye.  It would cause them to read it, not to toss it away, and to look at it to see what it was.  That was the whole theory.
Story_ID: 192992
Speaker 1: Okay.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Observing is Sandra Johnson.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Wilson Frost, W-I-L-S-O-N F-R-O-S-T.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: December 27, 1925, born in Cairo, Illinois, Alexander County.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: My occupation, I'm a lawyer by profession.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, and just kinda update on some of your positions that you've--
Speaker 2: Well, I have served as, I served twenty years in the Chicago City Council.  And I served twelve years on the Cook County Board of Tax Appeals.  I'm currently semi-retired and I'm on the Illinois Clean--I'm a trustee for the Illinois Clean Energy Foundation and I'm the secretary of that body.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is October 10--no, October 9, 2003 (laughter).
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at The History Makers at 1900 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.
Story_ID: 192993
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five People magazineish type questions that I am compelled to ask you, and they only require a short answer.  The first question is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, I would say, spaghetti (laughter).  I'm like a little kid.  I still enjoy spaghetti.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color would be blue.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: As you can see, I'm wearing a blue shirt (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is summertime.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, that's the reason I retired to California because I can enjoy summer time three hundred and sixty-five days a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation destination would be Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Maui, Hawaii.
Speaker 1: And, finally, sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I, I have several.  One of my favorite saying, "It is what it is."  And I use that phrase as, quite often in my practice.  Sometimes we have a factual situation and we think in terms of how we could solve the problem if the facts were different.  And I then say, "It is what it is", so we have to deal with the realities as we find them.
Story_ID: 192994
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  But first, I want you to give us the full names of your mother and your father, and their dates of birth and places of birth.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Freddie, Bond was her maiden name, Frost.  She was born in Mason, Tennessee.  She was born March 12, 1901.  My father's name was General Frost, just like a general in the Army.  He was born in Brownsville, Tennessee.  He was born February 12, in 1900.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story behind how your father got the name General Frost?
Speaker 2: I, unfortunately, never had an opportunity to either tease or to get full explanations how he acquired that name, or how, how he was given that name.  Unfortunately, my father died when I was about seven years--I mean, about nine years old, so that I didn't get an opportunity to enjoy that type of relationship.  And during the time that I was growing up, it was during the Depression, and my father, having several children, had to spend most of his time away from home working.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have any brothers and sisters with--
Speaker 2: Yes, he had brothers and sisters.  The brothers and sisters that he had, they lived in Tennessee.  However, he did have a sister, Mary Lee, that, that did come to live with us in Chicago [Illinois] for a while.  But his brothers and sisters, I had very little contact with them unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know much about that side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them or, or there, there any stories that they passed down about--
Speaker 2: Well, I cannot trace them as well.  Now, I have a younger sister who spent a lot of time tracing the history of the family and getting information so that if I wanted or sought information there, she would be my research source.
Story_ID: 192995
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well, tell us about your mother [Freddie Bond Frost]'s side?  How, how much do you know about that side?
Speaker 2: My, my mother's side, my mother, she moved away from Tennessee at, at the time, before the time of my birth.  And that would have been December 19, '25 [1925], we lived in Cairo, Illinois.  And during that particular time, there was a big flood in Cairo--Ohio river, Mississippi River or something that over-flooded and what-have-you.  My father [General Frost] worked for the railroads at that time.  And as a result of those experiences of flooding and everything, my father then moved and brought the family to Chicago [Illinois].  And I was six months old at the time that we came to Chicago--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, are, are there any stories passed down from your mother's side of the family about, about what their family, what your family was doing in the 19th century or what--
Speaker 2: Well, my mother and father grew up on farms in Tennessee, so that there was nothing from the standpoint of unusual achievements at that time.  And most of people who lived in those areas were sharecroppers, and I think the major crop in those areas was cotton.  And so many of the young people would pick cotton--and during the time that it had to be harvested and everything, and even to a point where that they would--their school year would be shortened in order to maintain--to make sure that those crops were harvested.
Speaker 1: Did they own, own their own land or were they sharecropping or--
Speaker 2: My grandparents, as best I can recollect, did own their land.  But it was not a sizeable piece of land where that they had a major farm or anything or any property that passed along through generations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the reason why I asked is that's a, that's a dramatic time in the history, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with leaving slavery and going through Reconstruction and all that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And a lot of people don't like to talk about it that much, but that's a, it's a tremendous human struggle, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --involved in.  I just wondered if there were any stories, that's all.
Speaker 2: No, not that I am aware of.
Story_ID: 192996
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was your, your father [General Frost] like?  I mean, I know your dad died when you were young.
Speaker 2: My, my father as I remember him was a pretty enterprising fellow.  He held various jobs.  During the Depression, he was an insurance agent.  He worked at the stockyards--any type of employment that, you know, would aid and assist him in caring for a family.  My father took ill and he died of diabetes and tuberculosis at the time.  And I remember him going to the County Hospital [later John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] at that time, and my mother [Freddie Bond Frost] later coming back and telling us that, that he wouldn't be coming home because he had died.  And this was--I, I was in grammar school at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that must have been a--
Speaker 2: It was a traumatic experience, but my father was the type of person that I regret and wish that, had an opportunity to see me participate in sports, to share with him some of my experiences.  And I often wondered my experiences in politics, how he would have reacted to it, and whether--what assistance he might have given me or advice he might have given me in my journey.
Speaker 1: Now, he obviously had some, some schooling, but how, how far did he go?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was pretty crafty.  I don't know whether or not he finished high school, but my father was a pretty learned person because I could see, in terms of the insurance debit books, and all of these things.  And I knew he was a salesman so he had to sell policies to the people who were interested in insurance, so that he had to be able to, be able to communicate in that regard.  Now, my mother [Freddie Bond Frost], she did not finish college or anything.  As a matter of fact, I was the first in the family to finish college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did your parents meet?  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: My mother, she was an attractive woman, and my father evidently had seen her at some church outing or something.  And after then, they came in contact with each other and started courting and subsequently were married.
Story_ID: 192997
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what was your mother [Freddie Bond Frost] like and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother was primarily one of the best homemakers you could ever find.  My mother, she, in spite of the fact that my father [General Frost] died when we were young, my mother gave us a lot of attention and love.  And even though we were a single-parent family at that time, she made tremendous sacrifices.  And my mother, she had what people used to refer to in those days as mother wit.  And what is mother wit?  Mother wit was considered common sense, and she used that as her approach in dealing not only with us, but with other people.  Now, she had jobs from various times, working at--we'll say the factories and what-have-you, but never anything of a professional or nature of that.  And one of the most enjoyable times that I had was to, after I became a lawyer and started doing some things, is to share experiences with her and give her opportunities to travel.  In many instances, we traveled together.
Story_ID: 192998
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Tell me about growing up.  What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, growing up, I grew up in Chicago [Illinois].  I grew up on the South Side of Chicago.  I grew up in the ghetto, and it was a dog-eat-dog situation.  And during the time, it was during the [Great] Depression and many instances, our survival had to be dependent upon us being able to get relief, or to get some type of assistance in terms of clothing, other to assist in food stamps, and all of those things.  This was in the early part of the alphabetical ["alphabet soup," federal agencies created as part of the New Deal] during [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt's administration.  And the--fortunate for me, sports was one of my outlets and I used sports as a means of traveling, meeting people, as well as continuing and pursuing an education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did you play, like organized basketball when you were real young?  Did you start at a real young age or--
Speaker 2: Well, growing up in my neighborhood, we had in that neighborhood, as the seasons changed, our participation in sports changed.  In the summertime, we would play softball.  In the fall, we would play football.  In the winter, we would play basketball.  And we would have neighborhood teams.  And some of these teams would be sort of coordinated or sponsored by some of the local churches.  And the local churches, they had these WPA programs, Works Progress Administration, and what-have-you.  And at the police station, they had police athletic leagues, and all of those things.  And we would play and participate in those leagues and plus, even in our neighborhood, we even had our own team where we, as junior members, would organize.  And one of those teams, I would most often be the captain or the manager of the team.
Story_ID: 192999
Speaker 1: Let's see--now the name of the neighborhood that you grew up--you grew up around Doolittle School [James R. Doolittle Jr. Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that, is that Madden Park, they call it, is that--
Speaker 2: Madden Park was the, the major park in, in our community.  Madden Park was, was developed and created while I lived in that community.  It was over on, between 37th and 38th and, and Rhodes, between Rhodes and South Park [later Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard] in that area.
Speaker 1: Like, they call that area sometimes a Douglas neighborhood, I guess?
Speaker 2: Now, Douglas would be a little further north.
Speaker 1: A little bit, okay.
Speaker 2: Douglas was north of 35th Street.  Madden Park was 37th Street South.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And usually teams, sports teams and everything would--you could determine them because they were organized by neighborhoods.  And, unfortunately, a lot of those sports teams and those groups later became gangs and unfortunate, went in a different direction than most of the sports and athletics did during the time I came up.
Speaker 1: Were, were, were there such groups in your, your neighborhood when you were growing up--gang, I mean, the precursors of gangs or--
Speaker 2: Well, initially, there weren't, but in the early '40s [1940s], gangs started rising.  In many instances, they grew out of softball teams, or what-have-you.  And, and they would stake out their turf or their areas where they live.  And then, they, in many instances, some of these boys would get involved in other difficult--and, and crime, criminal situations.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of some of those gangs that you can tell us--
Speaker 2: Oh, they had the Cobras.  They had the Four Corners.  They had--a lot of them don't come to mind right now but they had quite a few gangs there.
Speaker 1: Now, did you avoid being involved in gangs or were you involved in gangs--
Speaker 2: No, I was never involved in any gangs.  And primarily, I feel that my involvement in, continuous involvement in sports kept me busy and kept me out of the gangs, and kept me doing positive things.  And I played on teams that would travel out of the neighborhood, whether it was running track or playing softball or playing basketball or playing football, so that by the time I had finished those activities, I'd be too tired to hang out.  And my mother [Freddie Bond Frost], she enjoyed that very much because it didn't give me an opportunity to hang out.
Story_ID: 193000
Speaker 1: How many people were in your household when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Growing up in my household after my father's [General Frost] death, I had three sisters, one older than I, Lila [ph.]; one younger than I, Dorothy; and the baby, Geneva.  Presently, I only have one sister and that's the youngest one, Geneva.
Speaker 1: Okay, no brothers?
Speaker 2: No brothers, I was the only boy.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So there were no grandparents living with you or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No, we migrated here, and my grandparents had died.  And the mortality or the rate, the death rate of people during those times was a lot different than it is today.  And I'm fortunate enough right now as being a head of a family where that I've got three great-grandsons, the oldest being, just made five.  I've got one that's four, and the one that's, two.  And I get the enjoyment of being able for them to know me, and for me to know them, and for me to be able to communicate and visit with them.  Two of my grandchildren, great-grandchildren live in Chicago [Illinois].  One live in New London, Connecticut.  I have a daughter and two grandchildren, a grandson, and a granddaughter.  My granddaughter lives in New London, Connecticut.  She's a teacher there.  And I have a grandson who works for the Department of Transportation for the City of Chicago, and he has two sons which are my great-grandsons.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were growing up, what, what activities did you enjoy as a, as a little boy growing up or as a young man--I mean, other, other than sports.  Now, we talked about sports.  You were good at sports but like, what, what else did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I enjoyed school.  Fortunate for me, I didn't have any difficulty in surviving or passing in school, so school was never really difficult, so that I enjoyed it.  And, initially, when I was in school, I took courses in business training and everything.  And at one time, I thought of being an accountant and I took courses in accounting.  And when I went to junior college, I took courses in accounting but then, subsequently, I, I changed and went into law.
Story_ID: 193001
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about Doolittle [James R. Doolittle Jr. Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  Now you attended Doolittle School--
Speaker 2: I attended Doolittle.  Doolittle was on 35th Street between Cottage Grove and Rhodes Avenue.  As a matter of fact, the school is still at that location.  It has expanded some since I attended.  I graduated from Doolittle in 1939.  At Doolittle was my first experience in politics.  I ran for police commissioner.  In our little civics class, we had a little mock election and I ran for police commissioner.  Unfortunately, that was my--I lost that election (laughter).  And--
Speaker 1: It's before you joined the Democratic Party, right?
Speaker 2: And, and I knock on wood, that's the only election I ever lost (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were pretty popular in school and it was kind of easy for you.
Speaker 2: Well, I was a little fellow.  When I finished grammar school, I was 4'11" and weighed less than a hundred pounds, but I was a rugged little fellow.  And I hope I showed some signs of leadership and that's what caused me to be able to survive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were there, were there any teachers or, or mentors in the school or in the neighborhood that, that encouraged you?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, I had Mrs. Lawson [ph.].  I had Spaulding from the renowned Spaulding family from North Carolina, one of--Spaulding was one of my teachers.
Speaker 1: Oh, that, that insurance of--from that insurance family--
Speaker 2: The family, yes.
Speaker 1: --Charles Clinton Spaulding, yeah.
Speaker 2: And Stratton, and all of those.  And Hampton [ph.] was my physical ed teacher.  And when I was in grammar school, I think I was one of the first little fellows to be permitted to be a patrol boy.  And that was a status thing at that particular time because we had our little belts on.  And we would march at the assemblies and, you know, it gave us a little recognition.  And these--and during the morning before and after school, we had our little posts.  And this was before crossing guards so we had a tremendous amount of responsibility.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Patrol boys had been discontinued.  And I, I remember the pride that kids had to be a patrol boy.  You get--it's a belt and a badge.
Speaker 2: You get, and a badge--that's correct.
Speaker 1: And a pole with--it says with a flag that said "Stop" on it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, we didn't have--
Speaker 1: You didn't have that, okay.
Speaker 2: --the pole and the flag but we had all the other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had the belt and the badge.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sign or anything that said "Stop" or--
Speaker 2: No, no, nope, but you just had to make your physical presence.  Now, we were not given the liberty of where we could stop cars.  We would stop students, as opposed to trying to stop the cars (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had to wait till the coast was clear to let them--
Speaker 2: During the time that I went to grammar school, Chicago's [Illinois] schools in the black communities were overpopulated.  It had quite a migration from the South--young people of school age, and so most of the schools were overpopulated.  And schools were segregated at the particular time, so that at Doolittle, they started the double shift program if--and it started while I was in grammar school where students from seven, from six--what we called junior high now, would go in the morning from seven, and get out at noon.  And then students from the lower grade would start at noon, and get out around 3:30 or four o'clock.  And so did--and the same thing happened when I went to Wendell Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] in 1939.  They had classes that sometimes it would be night by the time--if you were a freshman by the time you got out of school, it would be 4:39.  Well, in the winter time at 4:39, it's, it's dark.
Story_ID: 193002
Speaker 1: So, well, tell me about high, high school at Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  What was that like?
Speaker 2: High school, I went to Phillips High School in September, 1939.  And when I got to Phillips High School, this was a new experience.  I had an opportunity, you know, where all the grammar schools start sending their little students in.  Well, I got to high school, and they had athletic teams there that I'd be--when I first got to high school, I was too small to play football in high school.  But they had what they called basketball teams where they had the lights and the heavies.  The lights were for smaller players, 5'7" and under, and the heavies were for people over 5'7".  And it had nothing to do with weight, but it had to do primarily with height.  And you would have to weigh in and be measured to make sure.  And I played with the lights which subsequently be--were called the juniors.  And I played with, I played varsity ball there for three years before I went, went to Wilson Junior College [later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: And I, I played for the Chicago Junior Cardinals.  They used to have little teams where that they would provide the entertainment between the halftimes of the regular professional games.  And it was sponsored by the Chicago Sun Times, by the Sun Times, and they would have uniforms that were similar to those of the professional teams.  And during the halftimes, well, they would play each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They would--the [Chicago] Bears had a team and the [Chicago] Cardinals had a team.  I played with the Cardinals and we played at Comiskey Park, the old Comiskey Park.
Story_ID: 193003
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you were, you were, you were talking about playing football, junior football with the--
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: --Chicago [Illinois] Car-, Cardinals junior team?
Speaker 2: --yeah, I did not play football in high school [Wendell Phillips High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I played basketball in high school and ran track in high school.  I played football for the Junior Cardinals.  This was what we called outside of school.  And this was entertainment football.  And they would have tryouts and, and pick teams of players from all over the city.  And these were players who were--I'd say, under the age of fourteen and they couldn't weigh any more than a hundred and twenty pounds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what position did you play when you played football?
Speaker 2: I played halfback.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were pretty fast then, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, you, did you run the sprints in track?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I used to run the forty and the fifty yard.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, those are the fastest sprints.
Speaker 2: But, but, I was okay until along come a fellow by the name of Ranus Thomas and Buddy Young.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  They were right--Ranus was with me in high school and Buddy was right behind me.
Speaker 1: You know, Buddy Young is a legend now.  And Ranus Thomas, I've heard of him, too, but Buddy Young went on to play pro football.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that was really--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he played at the University of Illinois [Champaign, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  He was small.  His body was, was smaller than you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--
Speaker 1: I mean, smaller than you are right now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, okay.  What else, else about high school?  Now, now did you run for class office in high school or--
Speaker 2: No, I never, I never ran for class office in high school.  I think my involvement in the sports kept me consumed--whether that didn't take the time to run for class office or school office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were, were you engaged in any other activities in high school, clubs or, or--
Speaker 2: Regular social clubs but nothing, not on any debating teams or anything of that nature.  And in my later years, in my later years in high school, the war started and many of us had after-school employment.
Story_ID: 193004
Speaker 1: So were--who were some of the teachers and that you remember from Wendell Phillips High School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I would remember Dorner [ph.].  I remember Mrs. Maudelle Bousfield; she was the principal.  The coaches, Bernard Libby [ph.], Lou Tortorelli [ph.].  And during the time that I was in high school, it was just before you had integration to the extent that you later did, so we didn't have as many black teachers even though Wendell Phillips was primarily an all-black school.  It was interesting.  The part of the community in my, my community, people who lived east of Cottage Grove which was about--I lived on Vincennes.  We had Vincennes, Cottage Grove, and people who lived east of Cottage Grove went to a different grammar school.  You had a lot of whites and Chinese, I mean, Japanese, they would--went to a different grammar school, and they went to Hyde Park High School [Chicago, Illinois], even though Phillips, if you had done it on district and location basis, would have been the school in their district.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that seems like an obvious attempt to, you know, keep Phillips all black.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, okay.  Any, any other mem-, memories of Phillips High School?
Speaker 2: Well, Phillips was a, a place where I enjoyed and made a lot of friends--still have some friends that I went to school with and closeness that developed over the period of years.
Speaker 1: And I read that quite a few musicians came out of Phillips High School.  Were there, were there some of those people?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had a lot of musicians that came of Phillips and a lot that came out of DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois].  DuSable was really an offspring of Phillips.  When they had the fire at Phillips--well, DuSable was then--a lot of the students from there, like a lot of your--and then Captain [Walter] Dyett over at DuSable, he was able to attract a lot of students who were interested in music.  And DuSable had a, a pretty exciting school band and everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you were a senior at Phillips, had you decided on a career?
Speaker 2: I decided, I had decided on a career, and that was to be in accounting.  And one of the teachers, a Mrs. Petrelli [ph.], was trying to aid and assist me in getting a scholarship at, at that time.  But, unfortunately, the war and many schools were on war programs and everything.  And I, since I was, would be of draft age shortly after graduation--well, those things were put on hold.  So I, when I had left Phillips, I attended Wilson Junior College [later, Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's, that's in Englewood, right, or what, what was--
Speaker 2: It was 6800 South Stewart.  It's now Kennedy-King.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  What, what did you take up?  Did you take, take up accounting there?
Speaker 2: I, I took accounting there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I took, I took accounting there and I was drafted in April of 1944.  I went to Wilson Junior College in September '43 [1943] and was drafted in April of '44 [1944] and--
Speaker 1: So you weren't there a year really--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --before you got drafted?
Story_ID: 193005
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, this is towards the tail end of the war, World War II, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was in the middle of it.  See, the war didn't end until '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I thought--it was the tail 'cause it's only a year left (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, well, they didn't know that at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, that's true.
Speaker 2: They had, they had V-J Day--V-E Day, and then V-J Day.
Speaker 1: That's right.  They did not know that day (laughter), okay.  So, so you couldn't anticipate how long you were going to be in?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how--now what happened to you in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Well, I--in the Army, I injured my knee, my left knee, and tore some cartilages and everything in, in training.
Speaker 1: How did you, how did you injure it?
Speaker 2: Well, in training and what-have-you--and was climbing and, and tore it.  And it was torn so bad that it required an operation to attempt to repair it.  And the training that I was receiving, and the kind of injury I had would not be compatible to continuing.  So they did an evaluation and since it was a knee, and a knee is a necessary joint in use and for a soldier, they made a determination that I should be medically discharged.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were only in a short period, period of time?
Speaker 2: I was in about a year and a half.
Speaker 1: So, so did you go back to school?  Did you in fact?
Speaker 2: When I finished, when I was discharged from the Army, I came back to Chicago [Illinois].  And I took a job at the United States Treasury Department in the Bureau of the Public Debt, a clerical position.  And while I was here, I was playing in a basketball league.  And the coach from Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] was visiting and, and he invited me to attend Fisk, so I went to Fisk in January of '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now you started paying basketball again, so I guess your knee healed up pretty good, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you really didn't have any big problem with your leg after that?
Speaker 2: Well, I--my knee never returned to its original condition.  I always had restrictions and limitations in terms of in bending and movement of it.  And, but fortunately, it didn't prevent me from doing some of the things that I did before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you go to Fisk, you know, on a basketball scholarship basically?
Speaker 2: I, I, when I went to Fisk, I--as a veteran.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And while I was there, I was encouraged to play basketball, but my education was under Public Law 16.  As a disabled vet, I would be entitled to pursue an objective, and to be able to, if I finished, they would pay as long as I was successful in the studies.  And my objective was to be an accountant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it meant your playing basketball didn't put you in jeopardy or any kind of way?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, how did you--
Speaker 2: But it, it aided and assist me because I got some benefits from that as well in terms of room and board and a few other--
Story_ID: 193006
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, well, when you were at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], I--was it, the president, I guess, was Charles Spurgeon Johnson, right?  What was he--
Speaker 2: Johnson.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, Charles S. Johnson.
Speaker 2: No, Johnson became president when I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I was there before he was president.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Someone else was president before and slips my memory right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was inaugurated as president while I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know, who, who else was--now he, he was a great sociologist.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Everybody now, you know, recognized him?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And we had, we had a great historian, Dean Taylor.  I see here when I was coming in here today, I seen [HistoryMaker] [Samuel] Massie.  Massie was one of the chemistry professors.  He was a student at--there at the time working on his master's.
Speaker 1: Dr. Samuel Massie--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who went on to work with the Manhattan Project.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: He was there at that particular time.  As a matter of fact, he married one of the girls from Fisk.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Who else was there that you remember from Fisk?
Speaker 2: During the time I was there, we had people who were well-known in many endeavors who had been the--I mean, and we had a Nora--I'm trying to think of her first name.  She was an opera singer, as well as Martha Flowers.  We, we had a lot of people here from Chicago [Illinois].  We had Clay Jones, Dr. Clay Jones, who was a pediatrician.  We had Jimmy Allison who was one of our doctors here.  A woman who headed the--was over at County Hospital [later John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] for a while--she lives in my building.  As a matter of fact, it slipped me.  I'll think of it while I'm talking.
Speaker 1: That's all right.  It, you know, you keep going.  It's--yeah.
Speaker 2: I had Carl Bonner, who's one of the, who is one of the coaches and the teachers who subsequently went back to teach at Wendell Phillips High School [Chicago, Illinois] and now retired.
Speaker 1: Were, were you trying of think of Leontyne Price as an opera singer?
Speaker 2: Well Leontyne Price was not at Fisk, but she did come and do concerts there while I was there.  She was invited and as long-along with Philippa Duke Schuyler and all--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the piano prodigy, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fisk had one of the renowned musical programs in the country--Oscar Henry.  And they used to put on music festivals in the spring.  And the governor from Tennessee, and all of the entourage from the legislature, you know--Nashville being the capital, would come out to the campus and parti-, participate and come in to be entertained by a lot of those.  And we had--
Speaker 1: The Jubilee Singers were still--
Speaker 2: The Jubilee Singers had notoriety and there.  And, in my class, we--I'm thinking now, most of the members of my class at that particular time ended up being doctors, dentists, and some teachers, primarily college teachers and some lawyers.  And I'm trying to think of the woman who came from Chicago and then moved to Texas, and ended up in Texas legislature--[HistoryMaker] Wilhelmina Warfield [sic. Fitzgerald, later Delco].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, alright.  So, now were you, did you really get involved in campus life at Fisk?  Did you--
Speaker 2: I was involved in campus life at Fisk.  I was a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity.  I played on the basketball team.  I was a student employment representative.  And at Fisk, I got my degree in economics, which was a combination of accounting and I had a history minor.
Story_ID: 193007
Speaker 1: And when I came back to Chicago [Illinois], I attempted to get jobs at places like Commonwealth Edison, People Gas, or what-have-you--a junior executive or accountant, what-have-you.  I did get a job as a junior accountant at Provident Hospital [Chicago, Illinois], and then subsequent, realized that I'd be better suited to take a position--I mean, to go back to school and go to law school.  Prior to doing that, though, I was a juvenile parole agent for the State of Illinois and--
Speaker 2: What, what was that like in those days?
Speaker 1: What was a very interesting job.  As a matter of fact, when I took the job, I was given a job on the basis that I would work toward a master's degree in sociology.  And I interviewed for master's program at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], at Columbia [University, New York, New York] and at Atlanta School of Social Work [later Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And subsequently, I realized and seen what the pay was in those jobs and what the opportunities were, and that I'd be better suited to go to law school and I did.  I went to Kent College at Chicago-Kent [Chicago-Kent College of Law, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: College of Law, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, were, were there black students in Kent College of Law when you started?
Speaker 1: When I started at Kent, in my class, there were two of us.  One was a policeman and I was a juvenile parole agent.
Speaker 2: What, what was the other man's name?
Speaker 1: Klesby [ph.], James, James Klesby--James Klesby, he left at the end of the first semester so for the remaining period.  Now at Kent College of Law at that time, I knew some--one of my former friends from the neighborhood had gone there--Calvin Hall.  Calvin Hall subsequently was attorney for the Chicago Housing Authority, subsequently became a judge, and he's now retired.  And it was Clarence--I'll think of his name in a few minutes.  He was another student that was ahead of me there, but these were the only two that were in both day and night divisions and so--
Speaker 2: Not the Clarence that was in the Washington administration?
Speaker 1: Clarence Bryant was his name.
Speaker 2: Clarence Bryant, okay.
Speaker 1: So that during the three and a half years that I was there, in my class after Klesby left, I was the only black in the class.  And I finished in the class of '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Okay.  I mean, how did you do?  Did you find it pretty easy or did you have to--
Speaker 1: Uh--
Speaker 2: Did you find it kind of hard being the only black person in the class or--
Speaker 1: Well, there were times when there was a struggle because I was working full time.  And I was trying to support a family and do all those things, so that it was not as easy as going to high school.  But after I'd dug in and had made the determination that I was going to prevail, it was just a matter of time.  And what I did while I was there, I seized upon the opportunity to go to summer school when, wherever, and when I could, if I could get courses.  And then, I even took courses at another law school to aid and assist me in getting my requirements in to finish on time.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So you graduated in, in '58 [1958]?
Speaker 1: In '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: In June of '58 [1958].
Story_ID: 193008
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do upon graduation [from Chicago-Kent College of Law, Chicago, Illinois]?  Did you--
Speaker 2: On graduation, I took the bar.  And in those days, the bar examination was something that was feared by most people.  In those days, very seldom--only one or two minorities passed.  And I think at the time I took it, we had the greatest number of minorities that passed.  Now Jill Aufenthalt's [ph.] husband, Ernest--and I'm not talking about a Jack Rogers, he took it with me.  I mean, he was admitted.  Brown from the famous Brown family took the bar and passed it the same time I did.  I, I think about seven of us passed that year in November of '58 [1958], and I think that was the largest number that had been admitted in one, at one time for a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So now, now you went right into a firm, right after?
Speaker 2: No, I, I went into an association.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was in private practice, but I was primarily working as an associate within an--in an association where that, we were not partners.  And if I got a difficult case that required some experience, I would use my associate, Joseph Adwell [ph.] who--he was about ten or fifteen years my senior and had extraordinary amount of experience in the practice of law.  And then later, I started my own office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, all right.  And what, you started your own office by yourself without having anybody else?
Speaker 2: Well, a group of us started.  There was Frost, Claytor, Sherard, and Howse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, well, what kind of law did you practice basically?  Did you--
Speaker 2: When I first started to practice, I--it was a general practice, and I would say the majority of it was criminal.  And this was nothing unusual.  Criminal law would be the kind of law that would be most accessible and available for--and it was more rewarding, and more financially rewarding.  In, in those days, you had very few minorities in major law firms and all of those things so that--
Story_ID: 193009
Speaker 1: Now, can, can you think of any particular criminal cases that stands out that were challenging or some victory that you were able to achieve?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I would prefer not to refer, relate to that because, unfortunately, it, in some instances, I might be disturbing the tranquility of a defendant.
Speaker 1: Well, you don't have to name them, you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You can talk about a case--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --maybe let people guess as to who it might be.
Speaker 2: Well, again--and I've been, I've been somewhat guarded in terms of my attitude on--about those things.  And to make it, to correspond it, I remember when I first became alderman, and I used to have Christmas programs where I would give away baskets and all of those things.  And reporters wanted to come and wanted to take the pictures of me giving away baskets.  And I refused because I didn't want to capitalize on someone's misfortune.  And to someone who might need this basket or what-have-you--for me to have them in a picture where I'd politically capitalize on it, I thought would be unfair and unfortunate to them.  And the same thing is true with, you know, in representing people in a criminal case.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, if they want it told, then I give them the right and the permission to tell it.  But in those days, the cameras did not come in the courtroom (laughter).  And if a reporter was in the courtroom, if the court had picked up the story--well, so be it.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, this is an archived biography.  It's not broadcast on there but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but, but, what, I just have a feeling about it.  And the, and these are some of the things that even my family at home sometimes used to sort of become disappointed when they figured I'd had an eventful day, or they heard about something that I'd done that they considered ex-, exciting.
Speaker 1: That you couldn't talk--
Speaker 2: And I didn't share it with them.
Story_ID: 193010
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what--tell us about the criminal justice system vis-a-vis the black community when you started practicing law and, you know, during your tenure as a lawyer.  I mean, what was it like?  Has, has it changed any or, you know, as a--is it better or worse?
Speaker 2: There are times when I would say that there is improvement.  Then, there are times when it appears that all the improvements that I thought was there vanished.  Unfortunately, even-handed justice is hard to come by in certain communities.  Since state's attorneys make the decision as to who's going to be prosecuted and what charges are going to be made, in many instances, they respond to political pressures, media, exploitation, all of those things.  And I think that's what's lost in the ordeal at times is that young prosecutors are more concerned with getting convictions than they are with administering justice.  And during the time that I'd been in political office in Chicago [Illinois], and during the times when I was a ward committeeman, I had an opportunity to get involved with helping judges get elected and encouraging lawyers to run for judgeships.  And I had a crusade to make sure that we had at least more representation on the bench.  And I was just told today that one of the--a former colleagues and one of the fellows that we used to discuss legal issues-[HistoryMaker] Leo Holt is at a mandatory retirement age.  Why do I say something about Leo Holt?  I read not too long ago when I was in Chicago [Illinois] about Leo Holt making an unpopular decision where that he dismissed a case or found the defendant not guilty even though the press and others felt differently based on evidence that was presented to him.  And too often--and [Governor] George Ryan and his commutation of many of the prisoners--
Speaker 1: You're talking about the--
Speaker 2: --on death row.
Speaker 1: --the past governor of Illinois?
Speaker 2: The past governor of the State of Illinois--his commutation was based primarily on the fact that there was so much evidence of miscarriages of justice that he felt there was nothing that he could do other than to commute the sentences that he could feel comfortable with because even if he had chose some of the inmates and left out others, there was a possibility in the ones that he left out--miscarriages would still have been prevalent, so that the system, in my opinion, is a good system.  It's the people who operate the system and how they use the system.  And in most instances, deprived minorities stand little chance of getting the same type of a trial as someone who have means and resources.  And I don't feel justice should be dispensed or delivered on that basis.  And I'm on the board of trustees of John Marshall Law School [Chicago, Illinois], been on the board there for some fifteen, sixteen years.  And these are some of the things that we discuss at some of our meetings.  And we discuss it with some of the law professors and some of the judges and others as to what, if anything, can be done to right the system.  And sometimes, it appears as though the system is improving and then all of a sudden, it get back to business as yesterday.  And I hope, but the disturbing fact is I look at the law schools today and find that we have fewer minorities enrolling in law schools than we did ten years ago.  And few are finishing than we did ten years ago.
Speaker 1: While the black prison population continues to grow--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so we're--
Speaker 2: And this is not only true with Illinois but it's true with the other states.  I see the same thing out in California.
Story_ID: 193011
Speaker 1: Well, tell us, how did you first get involved in--well, we know you ran in grade school [James R. Doolittle Jr. Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] for (laughter) police commissioner.
Speaker 2: Police commissioner.
Speaker 1: But, but how did you get involved in adult modern politics here?
Speaker 2: In politics in Chicago [Illinois]--well, I moved to the Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] area when I was in law school [Chicago-Kent College of Law, Chicago, Illinois].  This would have been around 1954 or someplace thereon.  And they redistricted the City of Chicago and they put us in a new ward.  Now I was in a club called the Varsity Club and in that club, we had a person such as Fred Duke Slater, Jesse Owens, Ralph Metcalfe, Ozzie Simmons, all former athletes, college graduates, and men who--Aaron Payne, men who were striving to achieve and to do things.  And so, I saw politics as an avenue to aid and assist me in the practice of law, for me to be able to do some things that I wanted to do in terms of helping others.  They redistricted the ward and they didn't have any leadership in there.  And the area was changing from white to mixed, and I saw this as an opportunity.  And I talked with Congressman [William] Dawson who was the titular leader of the black politicians at that time.  And he suggests that I go out and work with the person that he had appointed, [Joseph J.] Joe Robichaux, as it--and I went out as one of his lieutenants and started assisting in the organizing part of the ward and everything and started representing certain areas of the ward in zoning matters and various other things.  And an opportunity came in 1967 for me to run for alderman of the 21st Ward.  I had missed an opportunity when I thought that we were gonna get an opportunity for me to run for the state legislature a couple of years before, but our ward didn't get any opportunities there.  And so that when this opportunity came up, I talked with Joe Robichaux and many of the other leaders in the community and I got their blessings to run.  And who were my opponents in that race?
Speaker 1: Now you ran for what position now?
Speaker 2: Alderman.
Speaker 1: Alderman of the--
Speaker 2: 21st Ward.
Speaker 1: 21st Ward, okay.
Speaker 2: My opponents was [HistoryMaker] Jim Montgomery, [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage (laughter), and we were running against the--the incumbent was Sam Yaksic, a Serbian.  The three of us--and the interesting thing about the three of us that we had in common--all three of us went to Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips High School, Chicago, Illinois] (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you ran against Jim Montgomery and--
Speaker 2: Gus Savage.
Speaker 1: Gus Savage, wow.  You know, and Gus Savage would go on to become a congressman.  And Jim Montgomery would be the counsel for the, corporate counsel for the mayor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for the City of Chicago.
Speaker 1: For the City of Chicago, yeah.
Speaker 2: Not for the mayor, but the City of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the City of Chicago, right, exactly, right, okay.  So, how did you do?
Speaker 2: I won.  Nope, I didn't win.  In the, in the aldermanic election, we had a different type of format.  The candidate, in order to win, you have to get in the first election, you have to get fifty percent plus one of the people who voted for that office.  Failure to do that, the two top candidates end up going into a runoff.  Sam Yaksic and I went into a runoff.  Sam Yaksic got the greater portion of the vote--I think he got the fifty some percent [sic. Yaksic received under forty percent] and I got some forty percent initially.  And then in the runoff, I beat him because I got all the people who had voted for Gus Savage and Jim Montgomery and Bradbury [ph.], and all the other candidates.  And I was elected in 1967.  The ward redistricted again in 1970 and I moved to the Thirty-Fourth part-Ward.  And I became the committeeman and the alderman of the 34th Ward.  And I was elected there four additional times--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I end up being elected as alderman five times.
Story_ID: 193012
Speaker 1: Now, I have a note here.  I think current state senator [HistoryMaker] Emil Jones worked for you when he was a young man.
Speaker 2: Emil, Emil Jones was my first administrative assistant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was my aldermanic secretary when I was elected in 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In the 21st Ward, right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he, and he was--Emil Jones, was first my aldermanic secretary, and then when they redistricted the legislature, and Gene Barnes was the state rep at the time.  Then when they redistricted, I was put in a position where that my ward was so large, I was in two legislative districts.  I had Eugene Barnes in one, and Emil Jones in the other.  I had Eugene Barnes in the 29th and Emil Jones in the 28th, so I had two legislators in the General Assembly.  Then in the redistricting subsequently, I had Nelson Rice.  I had, then I had moved Emil up to the Senate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you at that time pretty much ensconced in Democratic Party politics here in the city?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was a committeeman--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I was the state central committeeman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had a good relationship with the Democratic, the, Democratic Party here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had one of the wards that could deliver.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the candidates who sought public office sought our support.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And to be able to get a state senator, I was thinking you must have a lot, had some clout, you know, and so, as, as you're creating the city council--I mean, you, you rose sort of as a, to be president pro tempore to the council in 1973, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I was--in '73 [1973], I became president pro tempore when Claude Holman died.  Claude Holman--I went to the city council in 1967.  Ralph Metcalfe was president pro tempore then.  Subsequent, Ralph Metcalfe went to Congress.  Claude Holman became the successor as president pro tempore.  Claude Holman died and I replaced Claude Holman in '73 [1973] as president pro tempore.
Story_ID: 193013
Speaker 1: Now, what you're describing here is a pattern in the city.  I think we should take note of 'cause that from the time, I guess, of--before, of, since the time of Ralph Metcalfe in the city council, the mayor [Richard J. Daley] was selecting a black president pro tempore, right--'cause you got three of them in a row coming here, you know?  It seems like it's just, it's something you think is (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes, well--
Speaker 1: Is he trying to--what's he trying to do here?
Speaker 2: --well, politics and election deals with numbers, and the black community could deliver a sizeable number of votes.  And any successful Democrat would try to get the support of the black community.  This goes back to initially during the days of [U.S. Congressman William L.] Dawson.  And mayors like Daley and, and others before him needed the black community in order to prevail over some of the contests of some of the opposition that they might have.
Speaker 1: And by--
Speaker 2: Now, Metcalfe was made the president pro tempore.  I, I think Metcalfe replaced Matt [ph.], one of Daley's aldermen, but he, he became the president pro tempore.  Then subsequently, he went to Congress and [Claude] Holman replaced him, and I replaced Holman.  And I was president pro tempore when Daley died in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  So I was just thinking, I was just trying to establish his pattern of, of giving the black community this president pro tempore spot in the city council as a, as a--that being now the person that takes Daley's seat when he gets up to go to some other meeting or some, or any--presides over city council in the absence of the mayor, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Whether he's, he's out of town or something and--
Speaker 2: Well, well, let me give you a little history during--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the time I was in the city council.  During the time I was in the city council, Mayor Richard J. Daley, you could just about count the number of times when he would leave the chair without recessing the body to go to the toilet or to do anything.
Speaker 1: Are you, are you saying he was mostly always in the chair?
Speaker 2: Right.  So that any president pro tempore prior to my time spent very little time in the chair, you know.  You stand over to the side, or you go back in the anteroom to talk to someone, you might--  He had a heart attack while I was president pro tempore that took him out of the council.  I'm talking about before his death so that during that period of time, there were months that I had to sit in the chair--preside over during the time of even budget hearings.  Tom Keane was the floor leader then so that I had gotten and logged more experience and time as sitting in the chair.  Seymour Simon was in the council at that time, you know, we had Jack Sperling.  We had a lot of the heavies still in the city council at, at that time.  I'm talking about guys who were parliamentary whizzes and everything.  And so, I had an opportunity to sit in the chair because of his heart attack.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, you actually logged more time than any of these other black aldermen--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in, in the chair actually?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But that was about by virtue of the--
Speaker 1: Natural causes, not political (laughter)?  That would--manipulation, right ?
Speaker 2: That wasn't something that someone was, was preparing me or grooming me for.  As a matter of fact, I recall when, once I was in the chair when Seymour Simon, subsequently justice on the Supreme Court, he challenged the ruling of the chair, you know.  He was going to take issue with the ruling that I had made.  He was going to try to embarrass me.  And I told him he was out of order.  He said he appealed the ruling of the chair.  So I said, shall the ruling of the chair be sustained--asked for a roll call.  I didn't ask for a roll call, I said, I want a roll call.  I'm a member of this body even though I'm president pro tempore.  And any member of this body can ask for a roll call.  So I was going to put everybody on the spot whether they, whether they were going to support me or support him.  They supported me on that, but after then, I didn't have to embarrass anyone else with that.  So that this was kind of body that we had where the people who would always take their edge.
Story_ID: 193014
Speaker 1: Right.  You had the city council, Chicago City Council has been for any number of years a body that, except for the Harold Washington years, has basically controlled by a strong mayor.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Even though it wasn't designed to--like that.
Speaker 2: Well, the system is weak mayor, strong council, if it plays out to the way that it was created.  And for me, during the time when I became chairman of finance, I became the floor leader.  This is after being president pro tempore.  I visited with Jake Arvey, who was formerly chairman of finance for the city council.  I visited with the former assessor who was formerly chairman.  And Tom Keane.  And I got their input in terms of the Finance Committee.  At that time, the Finance Committee controlled all fiscal matters, budget and otherwise, when now they've separated and divided those departments.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I don't want to get you into the Finance Committee yet because we've got a big crisis here.  You're already on the hot seat here in, in city council as president pro tempore.  And the black community is getting excited.  People are starting to say on the radio, you know, suppose something happens to Richard J. Daley.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause he'd had the heart attack.
Speaker 1: Yeah, then could we not have a black mayor, the first black mayor in the person of Alderman Wilson Frost?  And so, people are speculating.  They're talking.  They're buzzing about this.  You know, they see you in the seat.  They see you take control of things.  They say, I don't know where, wait a minute, we got (laughter), got, got another young mayor here, you know, maybe, maybe, you know.  Other big cities had black mayors, you know, but--
Speaker 2: Well, you had, you had--the only cities that had black mayors, you had Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: [Carl] Stokes, yeah.
Speaker 2: Stokes, and you had Gary [Indiana].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Walter Washington in Washington, D.C.  He was the mayor then [from 1975 to 1979].
Speaker 2: Was he a mayor in '76 [1976]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think, in Atlanta [Georgia], we had--
Speaker 2: No, not in Atlanta yet.
Speaker 1: Not, not yet?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Not in '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh. [sic. Maynard Jackson became the first black mayor of Atlanta in 1974.]
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, they, they were drumming for one.  And Cole-, Coleman Young was in Detroit [Michigan], was, was he not? [sic, Young was mayor of Detroit from 1974 to 1994]
Speaker 2: No, after--
Speaker 1: Afterwards, okay.
Speaker 2: I served on the Democratic National Committee with them so I know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, all right.  It was a lot, you know, Kenneth Gibson in Newark [New Jersey], though, was installed.  He, He was in office, you know, yeah, Kenneth Gibson was.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I'm not certain of that.
Speaker 1: He was, he was 'cause they, they elected him in the late '60s [1960s] or right after Stokes, but that's, you know, people were gearing up for this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what happens, Mayor Daley dies in the spring of '76 [1976]--
Speaker 2: He died the, no, he died December 22, 1976 [sic. December 20, 1976].
Speaker 1: Oh, it's okay.  All right, okay.  And you were, were--
Speaker 2: I was president pro tempore.
Story_ID: 193015
Speaker 1: And what happened is now, it's, it's all in legend form now, so I don't know.  Tell, tell us what really happened.  It's a legend that--the story is that they locked you out of the mayor's office and--
Speaker 2: Now here's, here's, here's fact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My law offices were the same place where they are now, 123 West Madison, and I moved back to the same building.  I received a call that the mayor [Richard J. Daley] had been taken to the hospital from the fire department.  Subsequently, I received a call that he had died.  This is before it hit the newspaper or anything.  I left my law office and it was subzero outside.  I left my office which is one block from City Hall.  And I went over to City Hall, and when I was going into City Hall, I saw Tom Donovan who was the mayor's Chief of Staff, along with Michael Bilandic who was the mayor's alderman and--
Speaker 1: That means the alderman of the Eleventh Ward, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  And they said that they had locked the offices upstairs and that we would meet the following day.  I held, and the reporter saw me there down in front of City Hall that night.  They questioned me as to what I thought my stat-, what was my status?  I said, well, in our form of government, something happens to the mayor, then the president pro tempore succeeds him.  I said because government has to perpetuate itself.  It has to be continuity, and as if for any other scenario, then Chicago would not have a mayor so the city could not conduct any business, couldn't do anything.  So I told them, so I am the interim mayor.  All hell broke loose--I mean, all confusion and everything else, so now the following morning--
Speaker 1: So did the med-, did, did, did the media--how did the media respond when you said that?  Did they--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Were they alarmed or were they--
Speaker 2: Well, they, well, they took the position--they had other people that were given advice and all of these things.  The next morning, I receive a call from Bill Scott.  Bill Scott was the attorney general for the State of Illinois.  And since the City of Chicago is a creature of the state, legal opinions and everything are given by the attorney general.  Now, Bill Scott, I knew.  We'd gone to the same law school and what-have-you, so he hadn't given me a written and legal opinion.  So now, by this time, and some of the mayor's cabinet heads and what-have-you, they wanted to start asserting themselves and everything.  This is when the so-called lockup occurred in terms of saying that the mayor's office was closed in deference to him.  Because of his death and everything, they didn't want to disturb things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We have to change tape.
Story_ID: 193016
Speaker 1: So he's talked to the press.  You've, you've talked to the press about this and the press is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and it's kinda like an atmosphere, kind of a carnival atmosphere is developing around your statements that you--
Speaker 2: Not really carnival but it was, it was interesting because many of the statements that I gave were not reported.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the--and having a little knowledge about media and what-have-you, sometimes people don't want to report certain things or want to edit or give their interpretation as opposed to giving you the direct tape or the (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Now, you said that Bill Scott, the attorney general, the state's attorney general, called you the next day.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he was in a position to--I guess, outline what the procedure would be for--
Speaker 2: What he told me, you know, because he had--evidently someone had questioned it and someone had called him.  And he, now he pointed out to me that I was the interim person, but that it was the obligation of the council to elect one of its own members at a meeting that I could call and that I would preside at.  Now, and subsequently, that did occur.  The meeting was held--I think on the 28th of December 'cause it was right after my birthday.  Now, during the interim period, I realized that I needed twenty-five votes, 'cause I was going to vote for myself.  You know, it was fifty, fifty of us.  I need twenty-five votes in order to be the interim person.  So, I polled and talked personally with all of the members of the council that I thought I could get their support.  The most I could get--and I had other people talking, and people like [Ralph] Metcalfe and various others talking to other council members.
Speaker 1: Now, well, just, let me ask you, who were your allies in city council?  Now you said Metcalfe was a congressman in the First District there, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but who were your allies on the city council?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, in the city council at that particular time, I had, I'd have to look at a--
Speaker 1: Well, are all the black alderman allies?
Speaker 2: I'll explain that to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All the black alderman were in my corner, whether they wanted to be or not.  Bennett Stewart, one of the ones in the 21st Ward, that succeeded me in the 21st Ward, was one of the alderman who was a little hesitant and a little lukewarm.  He's the one that subsequently replaced Metcalfe in Congress when Metcalfe died--prior to Harold Washington went in that district.
Speaker 1: Yeah, didn't Stewart get in trouble or something?
Speaker 2: The trouble was that the remarks that he made on the floor of the city council at my--at the time at the council meeting for the succession of the mayor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just--go on and explain that to us.
Speaker 2: Well, he made some remark that questioned--we had worked out an accord at that time so these were gratuitous that he made.  And this is the reason that he did himself more harm than good because if he had let the subject alone, it wouldn't have--but he made a remark, something similar to my expectations of sitting in that seat or being entitled to it, was absurd--was the gist of it.  And I'm sure if you look at some of the newspapers and what-have-you, you can pull the verbatim statement from it.  But I knew that I had all of their votes whether they liked it or not.  They were painted into a corner because it would have been political suicide for them to vote against me.  But I didn't have but twenty-two votes, including the liberals and the blacks.  I had twenty-two votes--with mine, it's twenty-three.  And I had people from high places--contact First National Bank, Bob Abboud, and all of them.  He used the civic leaders because they were afraid that something might occur where that you could have civil disobedience in the city, and the city could go up for grabs.
Story_ID: 193017
Speaker 1: But most people thought in the black community, I, I know that you should have been--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --the interim mayor by, by current law and they were pulling a parliamentary end-around--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, but, but we had the vote and everything.  And most people--and told, for the seven days, whether they like it or not, I was, because that's what the law provided.  And as a matter of fact, someone had even made mention of the fact that I should have brought a declaratory judgment against them or something to have that spread of record, but we worked out an accord.  And the accord was that I would become pres-, I mean, the floor leader, and the chairman of finance.  And so, since I couldn't get twenty-eight--I mean, twenty-five votes, and, otherwise, we'd walked away with nothing because under the way the scenario was, [Edward] Burke or [Ed] Vrdolyak was going to be chairman of finance, so we'd walk away with nothing.  At that time, I was chairman of utilities so that, that accord was worked out, and that's the accord that you heard on the floor of the city council on the 28th.  Now, then you had several groups who came down and wanted to talk to me and wanted--they wanted to have me sworn in, in a mock ceremony at Operation PUSH [People United to Save Humanity] on a Saturday morning, and all of those things.  Now, that would have accomplished nothing because that had no role in the big picture.  And for me to be held out as a toy and, you know, to satisfy other people's egos and what-have-you, I wasn't going to permit.  I insisted that a rule be put in that no one could nominate or appoint anyone without the permission of the person they were nominating or appointing, so that nobody could put me--throw my name in off the floor and knowing that I didn't have enough votes in.  So as a result of it, [Michael] Bilandic ended up being the one that was appointed by the council.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, when you look back on that now, is there anything that you would have done differently in that scenario or you think that was--
Speaker 2: Hindsight is always twenty-twenty.  Would I have done anything different?  I thought that question many times, but I don't know of anything legally that I could have done that I didn't do that.  Now, politically, maybe if I'd had some contacts that I later found out about, I could have maximized the use of it.  But, you know, there are many times that people who might have the power and the strength to be of assistance, but you might not have any way of knowing who they are and where they are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And unless they come forward, you don't know about them, but later in, you know, and then again, in many instances when people tell you things later, you don't know whether that's for real, or whether that's a just a way of appeasing you and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  But some activists thought at the time, some, some of them were disappointed.  And when you say--they said they were and they thought that you had kind of given up too easily or something.
Speaker 2: No, no.  The interesting part about the political climate in Chicago [Illinois]--many of the people who--the activists who wanted me to follow their thought process, do what they felt that I should do were people who were my opponents in most elections, so that they were not interested in perpetuating Wilson Frost, so that I'm not going to let a [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage, who I had run against two times myself, come in and tell me what he think is best for me when he's used all the energy and resources that he had at every opportunity to either run against me or cause his son to run against me.  And many of the people who--Operation PUSH and all--they were people who oppose.  And they would come out to my ward organization, and many times and tried to disrupt in all of those things and never prevailed.  So now, for me to permit them to give me some guidance (laughter), I think not.  So that's something that I never regretted.  And in retrospect, I played the cards that were dealt me and I think I got the best hand at that particular time.
Story_ID: 193018
Speaker 1: Now subsequently, I remember shortly after then, when Morgan Murphy gave up his seat in the [U.S.] Congress, and the chairman of the party called me in, when [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage first ran for Congress, and asked me to run, since I lived in that district and I was a state central committeeman in that district, to run for Congress in the Second District.  I refused because I said to do this would be backing out on the commitment that I made to the people when I became chairman of finance.  If chairman of finance is a position that I could use to aid and assist a lot of people, and then for me to abandon it shortly after arriving there to go to Congress would be hypocrisy.  At that time, Reginald Brown ran against Gus Savage, and Gus Savage beat Reggie Brown, and that's how Gus Savage got to Congress.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 1: Gus never beat me in an election during the whole time (laughter) that he was running.  And he never beat me at golf either (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, well, the Finance Committee is a coveted position in the city council.
Speaker 1: It was, it was bigger even then than it is now because it handled the budget in total as well.  It had leases.  It had the whole operation.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's before some of the reforms during the--made during the Washington administration, yeah.
Speaker 1: For the reforms at, at Washington when they broke it down and, and--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, what were you able to do as a Finance Committee chair to im-, improve the--
Speaker 1: Well, I can cite two instances of thing.  Lenora Cartwright was the commissioner of human resources.  I remember we were doing the budget and I was up in Jane Byrne's office.  And she was telling me about the raises that she was getting ready to give all of her department heads.  I looked down and saw two department heads that hadn't been given the same kind of raise that she was talking about giving others.  It was Sam Nolan, who was director of the Department of Public Safety, and Lenora Cartwright.  I said, well--
Speaker 2: They're both black people, right?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You got that right.  I said, Madame Mayor, I said, this must be an oversight.  If you're gonna do this, it has to be done for them as well.  Otherwise, you don't have any support down at council and I'm gonna raise the question.  She said, "Oh, I forgot.  I didn't mean it that way."  I called in Lenora Cartwright and Sam Nolan.  I said, Merry Christmas.  They said, Merry Christmas what?  I said, I just got you a fifteen thousand dollar raise (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, that's actually a case where if you had not--well, presumably, if you had not been there, you know, I mean if--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --if [Edward] Burke had been finance chair, he may or may not have caught that error, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Or he, he might not have wanted to bother with it.  And, and it, and the fortunate thing for her, for the mayor, is doing the way I did it.  We didn't have to end up being in a combative situation.  She was able to save face and she ended up getting the credit for it.  And I had the galley sheet showing how what the original proposal was, so that it wasn't something that I created just to, you know, fluff someone and--
Speaker 2: It would have--had, had you not caught it, it would have been in a news notebook.
Speaker 1: And during that time, there were many numbers of situations where that things were--they would attempt to do certain things.  And I could just do it and change it and all of those things in terms of apportionment, of curbs and gutters and alleys and streets, and all for various communities and all of those things.  I, I would look to make sure that one community's resources were--especially if they were on the socioeconomic level lower that they would get aid, additional assistance, you know.  I live in the Fifth Ward now but at that time, I lived in the Thirty-Fourth.  I saw the Fifth Ward getting certain things.  They had the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and all of these.  I wanted to make sure that the 2nd Ward or the 20th Ward or the 34th Ward--well, the 34th Ward was gonna be taken care of with me being the chairman of finance, but to make sure that those services were equally applied.
Story_ID: 193019
Speaker 1: Now, this raises an interesting question.  In your opinion, having, you know, served long on the city, Chicago City Council, and been in this position to be in charge of this important committee in the city, you know.  It nev-, which had never had a black mayor before, dominated by white city council, and a city that was then at least 50 percent black or pretty much--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: --pretty much the--
Speaker 2: --yeah, it was in the forties.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, now and, and, and so I don't want to argue with your statistics because these are things and issues that quite often--
Speaker 1: Yeah, fifty was close.
Speaker 2: No, it--let me make a distinction.  Head count is one thing.  Head count, you use head count for censor purpose or what-have-you.  In that way, you're probably right, but in terms of registered voters and adults, it's different and that's where the political decisions are made-
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on the basis of--
Speaker 1: It's a little lower.  The black population--
Speaker 2: --on--
Speaker 1: --is a little lower in terms of registered voters.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, in, yeah, on registered voters so that, that's where your political decisions are made.  But from a standpoint of head count and everything like, places like Robert Taylor Homes and everything during those days, they had a tremendous amount of people under the age of eighteen.
Speaker 1: I'm just going to ask you if you had observations about the traditional use of power in the city.  Was a person like Jane Byrne just kinda, just sleepwalking, doing what she does usually, or did she have some kind of particular vitriol for the black community?  I mean, why, why, why, why would people leave a part of the city out consistently?  What did they--
Speaker 2: Well, but--
Speaker 1: What did they, were they so used, used to it, to it or what was it?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Politics is a business, and it's not a religion.  And certain people place emphasis on certain things.  It depends upon what your objective is.  If your objective, if you go in there with the objective of saying that you're going to cut the pie even, then people, as opposed to being embarrassed, are gonna listen to you.  But, unfortunately, for us most often is most of the time when we get opportunities to serve in government, and this is the reason I took the Finance Committee, we usually serve in the basis of the social things in terms of dealing with those issues, as opposed to the fiscal.  But having knowledge and working with the fiscal, you can be just as effective in accomplishing the social needs.  You know, I serve right now on a board and we got $250 million to give grants and various other things.  I'm looking around the office one day--said, bam, I don't see any other people of color around there.  I said, now the people that I'm supposed to represent, in general, I don't see any reflection here.  So I talked to the executive director.   Oh, such and such and such, he give me.  I say, I don't want to hear it.  So, he had a proposal coming up.  I tabled it.  So he said, well, next time, I'm going to do it.  I said, well, I got a couple of other trustees to go along with me.  Now, I could have gone to the media, done a few other things, but I gave him the treatment of I'm tabling it for first, to get your attention.  I got some attention before the next meeting.  Now, sure, I could have gone public and do all those things.  Sure, I'd get dinged as being someone who is difficult to deal with and provocative and all of those things.  Sure, I'd get a ton of publicity, but it might prolong getting the job done.  Unfortunately, some of the gains that we made in this city in politics have been lost.  Unfortunately, at Harold's demise, the black community, the energy that it possessed at that time, sort of went down the drain, and it hasn't been rekindled and who and when--they're gonna be able to harness it and use it again.  I don't know, but at one time, we had the city clerk.  We, we had, we had more positions than we currently have.  I'm talking about positions of power.  At one time, [HistoryMaker] Clark Burrus was the comptroller.  Joe Bertrand was the treasurer, and I was the chairman of finance, you know, right here in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  And what--that makes the determination as to what banks get what deposits and all of these things, and all of those things.
Story_ID: 193020
Speaker 1: Is--I, I notice that nowadays we don't have as many black banks.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Is that--
Speaker 2: Well, big ones, you have little ones now.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: You know, when, when they come in, when they permitted bank, bank, banking and all of those things--well, it's just like with single proprietorships and ma and pa operations.  In this current economic climate, they can't exist.
Speaker 1: So what, what you're saying is that, that as an insider in a, in a key position, you can create social change on a level that's different from an outsider being on, on television or calling it from the other side?  You're saying--I mean, you, you have this different approach to--
Speaker 2: I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm, I'm saying that in part--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but I'm also saying that in any scenario, you need people on the outside.  You need people on the inside.  You shake the tree one day.  I pick up the apples.  The next day, reverse it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, sure, it's the activists and all those.  They have a role and they get people's attention, but in most instances, when it comes down to doing business, the people that they provoke are not going to do business directly with them.  And I mean and this is true, not only in Chicago [Illinois], but in Washington, D.C. and New York [New York], talk with Sullivan and Bertrand [ph.] Sutton [ph.] and all of them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, yeah, so, by the same token, you need some agitation--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so those on the inside, what about you.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Because but for them, there'd be no need for you.  If everything is going business as usual, nobody's gonna bring you to the table.
Speaker 1: But did it bother you--I know at one time they were referring to the black city council members at a certain point as being a silent six and that's what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was before I got there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and people in the community complained that our black city council didn't say enough and they were part of the machine.
Speaker 2: Well, what was fortunate for me that during the time that I came to the city council, Sammy Rayner, [HistoryMaker] Bill Cousins, and I came in around the same time, and I think Bill Shannon.  And it was a different breed.  I think I was probably one of the only regular Democratic organization candidate that came in that was not only a committeeman.  Shannon was a committeeman.  Cousins and Rayner, they came in as independents.  And they and [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage were all a part of the independent movement, so that I, I came in being somewhat bearing the label of regular Democrat, but I was not wedded and owned by them to the extent where that I cannot make my own decisions or use my own method of doing things.  And like I used to talk with my then-committeeman and he--someone had told him about a vote I'd made in the city council.  And I explained to him that I did that for a reason and I showed him how it--I'd gotten results for, for our community in doing it that way.  And after then, he appreciated me more, and he didn't want me to vote in lockstep with the other Democrats at all times.
Story_ID: 193021
Speaker 1: Alright, now, tell us about the Harold Washington era.  And this is an exciting time in politics in the city, and it changed the city council and it's created a--in fact, the death of Mayor Richard J. Daley started the ball spinning and what--
Speaker 2: Well, I used to tell Mayor Washington and I said, you and I should be called nip and tuck so he--I said, I nip them and you took them (laughter), so that I'd put at least put the thought in there because Harold had run for mayor before, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, he ran in '77 [1977]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right after the, the change in government after, you know, Richard J. Daley died, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But Harold brought some exciting times to politics.  And Harold, even though he was identified with the independent movement, Harold had come from the regular Democratic organization.  He was a member of [Ralph] Metcalfe's organization.  As a matter of fact, Harold and I had served on a couple of committees together back during those times--him from the, from the 3rd Ward, and me from the 21st Ward.  Harold was doing things and was getting a knowledge of city government, you know.  It's massive, it's a lot to know about, you know, all of those things.
Story_ID: 193022
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're talking about the Harold Washington era.  Now, how--Harold Washington, you know, ran symbolically for mayor in '77 [1977], lost, but he was trying to raise issues when he ran.  And subsequent to--well, Michael Bilandic was mayor until '79 [1979] when the big snowstorm hit.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then he, he lost the election in '82 [1982]--
Speaker 2: To Jane Byrne.
Speaker 1: Jane Byrne, right.  And her--what was, what was life like for you during the Bilandic era and the Jane Byrne era?
Speaker 2: Well, during both eras, I was chairman of finance.  And I had staked out my territory.  And I used the office to make sure that I had protected and enjoyed for the benefits, that our communities enjoyed the benefit of any services or benefits that the city was offering.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the crises in Jane Byrne's administration centered around the school board--I mean, that was a real trigger.  They were--
Speaker 2: That, that was, that was the issue that, in my opinion, that took her down.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Can you explain to us what, what happened with the school board?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, there--the mayor appoints school board members under our system.  And Jane Byrne, Byrne appointed or reappointed a school board member or members who were antagonistic and had been disliked by the black community.
Speaker 1: Is it--
Speaker 2: And why were they disliked by the black community is because they were trying to put in policies that were in the community's favor and opinion that were detrimental to the children in our community.
Speaker 1: Well, they naturally, physically opposed the segregation in Bogan High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think both of them actually got, physically got out, and tried, tried to stop buses from bring, bringing black students to Bogan High School which had previously been all white--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --prior to desegregation order, right, in a Southwest Side school, Bogan High School.  And they were known as the 'Bogan Broads' by--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --by, by self-definition.  That's what they called themselves.  And they--
Speaker 2: The Southwest Side, it was a, that was a Southwest Side group.
Speaker 1: And they replaced two black people on city council.  They were dismissed, Kenneth Smith and Rev., Rev. Smith or somebody.  I can't think of the other one but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ken Smith, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But that inflamed the black community against Jane Byrne--I mean, that and other things, but she was asking to be--
Speaker 2: That was the major issue that solidified the black community.
Speaker 1: And I believe--is it, is it Allan Streeter, Seventeenth Ward, who had been appointed by Jane Byrne--actually backed the community and voted against the Bogan women.  And Jane Byrne vowed publicly to defeat him in a special election for alderman of the Seventeenth Ward and that became a big battle as well, which--and Streeter won that battle.  I mean, the community felt they had licked the mayor in that battle.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Streeter won that--
Speaker 1: You know, 'cause all the forces of the mayor were aligned against Streeter, but Streeter won anyway.  And people were beating up--putting post-, posters up.  It was a wild scenario on the--yeah.
Story_ID: 193023
Speaker 1: So what, so as you observe all this, you know, all this going on now--I mean, every day we heard people calling for--we need a black mayor, we need a black mayor.  Now, how, how did you feel about it and did you think that was possible at the time?
Speaker 2: I had a political organization, the Thirty-Fourth Ward.  I could take a sounding and do a poll of my community.  And I saw the change in the trend shift to a point that when the mayor, when Mayor Byrne was running, that people would not put her picture in their window.  My captains would come and tell me that I can't sell this woman.  People don't like her, and we're not going to take her literature out to the community.
Speaker 1: This is powerful stuff when the people are, when the pulse of the people are like that, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, I would see downtown--Harold Washington people had the blue and white buttons.  And it was almost like a wave.  All of a sudden it became stylish for people to have that button.  These were not just blacks.  These were young people and middle age people and old people.  All colors started wearing Harold buttons.  So this meant that people felt so good about it that they wanted to advertise the fact that they were supporting.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that blue button was something.  When you saw it, you, you could see it coming (laughter).  Right.  I mean, they were everywhere and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you kind of saw it, you know, but, but when Harold Washington was drafted, did you think--I mean, what did you think about the--were you aware of the process to draft him or run and all that?
Speaker 2: Well, now, all that sounds dramatic and everything, but it--being drafted, I don't think that there was anyone on the scene in their quarters that would have been as effective as--Harold was a good orator.  Harold had gained some momentum and stature from his election against Benny Stewart.  And Benny Stewart was thought of as being the person that was put there by John Donovan, Bilandic's chief of staff, so that Harold had all of these things going for him.  And then, as say, when you talk about--the reason I say [HistoryMaker] Tim Black, Tim Black, even though Tim was with the activists, Tim still, still had the academians in his corner.  Tim had many ties and everything with the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], that group over there as well, so that those were things that Harold had working for him.  Now, most people thought that, at the time, that Harold and I were at loggerheads.  That was far from the truth.  As a matter of fact, when Harold first became a senator, Jim Taylor tried to knock him off the ballot.  I represented Harold before the Board of Elections and won the case.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jim Taylor was an ardent Jane Byrne man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they called him 'Bull Jive.'
Speaker 1: 'Bull Jive' Taylor, right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's true.  That's the way--
Speaker 2: And you remember that.
Speaker 1: --like, like Mike Royko's column, you know.  They would always refer to him as James 'Bull Jive' Taylor, right, you know.  Something he said, that sparked it, yeah.
Speaker 2: He, he was in the legislature.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, so did you play a role in the campaign at all or what role did you play?  I know you played several roles.  You had an important position.
Speaker 2: Well, sure, I played a, a role.  And I was, I, you know, had a type of relationship with Jane, Jane Byrne that I could be truthful with her.  And I sat and told her that my ward was not going to be for her.  So it came as no surprise and during that time, money was coming out of the sky in terms of her fundraising capabilities, but that was one time that money couldn't buy an election.  And because the energies that had consolidated in the black community was something that was mindboggling.  I had never seen anything like it during my political career.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what Harold used to say--take the turkey, take the ten dollars, then pull the curtain, and vote for me (laughter).
Story_ID: 193024
Speaker 1: So, anyway, the--that's the time when--well, what about the, the--well, after the election of Harold Washington, you seemed to have a very solid--it was shaky for a minute, but then, then a very solid black, black vote, and liberals are on the side of the mayor, Harold Washington.
Speaker 2: Well, after Harold's election, the Northwest Side and various other communities, Polish ethnic community, and all of those things, I used to see Harold Washington come to the funerals and wakes, and how the people would--they would treat him like Michael Jordan.  They want to hug him.  They want to kiss him and all of those things.
Speaker 1: This is in a part of town that didn't vote for him.
Speaker 2: I know that.
Speaker 1: Right, and didn't, right.  I'm just trying to just make that point for the, for the tape.  This is part of town that did not vote for him.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  No, no.
Speaker 1: These are mostly Eastern Europeans or Irish, you know.
Speaker 2: So in the next election, he wins by even by a greater margin.  In my opinion, Harold Washington, if he were alive, would be mayor today.
Speaker 1: And he said that was his intention--
Speaker 2: Now, it was two things that happened that I remember is that Harold--one, Harold said that the energy and the effort and the associations that I had to make for the first election is going to have to change in order for me to govern because there were a lot of people who had worked for Harold who thought that after his election that they were going to get patronage.  And Harold did not operate on the basis of patronage.  And I took issue with him many times because I said, Mr. Mayor, I said, a lot of the jobs that were given as patronage by your predecessor, these are people that are using those things to fight you with.  I said, you know, wouldn't it be nice to give some of those things to your supporters?  He said, I don't want to get involved in all that because it won't last, so he never--and many of the little things that I used to tease him about--mayor had limousine drivers.  He and usually, back in those days, it was a Cadillac, a limousine Cadillac, specially ordered.  The chairman of finance had one, and the mayor had one.  And this wasn't something that was created when I became chairman of finance.  People who were before me had them.  And, but he wanted to give the humble and the appearance that he wasn't effected so that many of the perks and things that went with the office, he wouldn't take.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he drove an Oldsmobile, an 88, or 98, or something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, he was driven, but he was in his Oldsmobile.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I used to tell him, I said, look, I said, I mean, tell you what my point of view is.  I feel that you should retain some of those things because it's not yours.  It goes with the office.  I said, when you go to a grammar school and talk to some young students, you exemplify to them hope, success, and opportunity without it having to be by selling narcotics or something.  So that if you take away this, I said, so a rapper or something comes in with the black long Cadillac or limousine, he's going to be more impressive than you.  So if a child has to make a decision as to who he or she wants to be like, she might, for the wrong reason, choose the other.  And he was turning around then and started appreciating some of the things because he could appreciate the niceness.  But I first met Harold Washington when I used to be a part-time salesman in a haberdashery store on 47th Street.  And [HistoryMaker] [John] Stroger and Harold were both members of the Third Ward organization, which was right down on the corner of the 47th and South Park, then it was subsequently King Drive.  And they used to go up there and I'd stop and talk to them as they passed the store.  I'd work at the store on the weekends as a salesman.  And I knew him, knew both of them from back then, and we were all involved in young politics together.

Speaker 1: Harold Washington, right after the election of '87 [1987], died of a heart attack just shortly into his new term.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He wouldn't--I think about six months into the new term.  And when he won the election--I mean, he had achieved a majority vote of city council for the first time in his, you know--
Speaker 2: On his budget.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and, unfortunately, when he was first elected mayor, brought in a lot of people to assist in his administration from out of city.  And Chicago [Illinois] is the kind of town is that you can come in with certain theories, but you've gotta understand and appreciate the local background.  And some of his people didn't.  And many times in city council, we would end up getting caught in box situations that the staff had put us in because they didn't understand, you know, the turf.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He brought in some people from Atlanta [Georgia], you know.  They had worked with Maynard Jackson and some of them, but Chicago is a--every city is different.  And in order for you to appreciate this, you, you can make comparison theoretically, but actuality, sometimes is, is different, you know.  And sometimes it's a matter of perception.  Perception isn't always a fact.  It's what people believe it to be.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when, when Harold Washington died in '87 [1987], there was a big controversy of who would succeed Harold Washington.  And, you know, now how did you stand on that, that controversy?
Speaker 2: I wasn't in the city council then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You'd already moved?
Speaker 2: I was on the board of appeals.  Now, I had an alderman in the city council that succeeded me, Lemuel Austin--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --he subsequently became budget chairman.  I was--at the time when Harold died, I was at the funeral of my colleague on the Board of Tax Appeals.  I was in the church, in the funeral, when the fireman came in and told me that the mayor had just had a heart attack and was taken to the hospital.  And then by the time I got back downtown to my office, I found out that he had expired.  Unfortunately, I think that the way the thing was handled in terms of, with [Tim] Evans and [HistoryMaker] [Eugene] Sawyer, that they splintered and disappointed the black community as such that the energy was lost.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Sawyer was always perceived as not being the activist.  Tim was conceived as being the activist.  Sawyer lost to Daley, and then subsequently even Tim lost his seat in the city council to [HistoryMaker] [Toni] Preckwinkle.  Then Tim subsequently became a judge, and now Tim Evans is a chief judge at the circuit court.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Eugene Sawyer is retired, you know, now.
Speaker 2: Gene Sawyer is retired.  Gene Sawyer is doing pretty good.  I talked to his brother a few weeks ago--Ernest.  Gene had been sick.  Now Gene had a, Gene was a supplier, a wholesaler of fuel oil, jet fuel for one of the companies that serviced O'Hare.  And it was a pretty lucrative business and what-have-you, and then I think one of his employees--
Speaker 1: There was a big scandal about that, yeah.
Speaker 2: --embe-, embezzled a lot of money and everything out of that.  Now, what the status of the company is right now, I don't know, but I haven't talked with Gene in a couple of years now.
Speaker 1: Well, he took a big loss and he's, he's doing okay, you know, he's--
Speaker 2: But I, I said I haven't talked with him.  I, I see his brother, Ernest, but Gene and I used to be pretty close.
Story_ID: 193026
Speaker 1: Now, now tell, tell us how you went to the Cook County Board--
Speaker 2: Board of Tax Appeals?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-hum.
Speaker 2: I was in city council and I spent twenty years there--been elected five times.  And so I just wanted to change, you know, wanted to phase out the--my activities there.  And I, just, I was the first black to run county-wide and, and get elected.  And so, I ran for board of appeals.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, what are some of your accomplishments there?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things about the board of appeals--the first thing I did, I made sure that people who had never heard of that office know how to file an appeal.  At one time, very--we didn't own a lot of property, so we didn't have to know about assessed valuations and how that impacts the amount that we pay for real estate taxes.  When I went in that office, the office was lily white.  They might have had two or three blacks in there, yeah.  The time I left, we had, I had Eleanor Frederick, a certified public accountant who was my, my chief of staff.  I had them involved in the churches and all of those things.  They get exemptions.  I--head of the exemption department, all of those things were minority.  I had women as well as men, plus I had put in an outreach program where that we would take it to churches, we would take it to the community, we would take it to banks, and everything where the people could become familiar with the, the process.  And I would venture to say during the twelve years that I served there, more people became aware, and used the office and got relief.  I'm talking about debt reduction.  I'm not talking about whether we gave lip service.  And I'm not talking about the kind of reduc-, reductions that only reimbursed them for the carfare to be paid to get down there.  I'm talking about--'cause the property system in Cook County [Illinois], this involved Cook County and not just Chicago [Illinois], is based on a lot of variables.  And so the assessor, and the way he makes assessment and everything, is difficult to understand for the average person.  In many instances in certain neighborhoods, property appreciate in value more than they do in certain other areas.  But sometimes on these books--let's say that in some of your ghetto areas, they might have a higher assessed valuation than some of your upper-class areas.  Well, I made sure that those distinctions were taken out.  And, but the interesting part about it is the changes that occur in Chicago, that some of the same property at--before it was considered ghetto property, and now considered prime property, because of its location.  Places like Cabrini-Green, places like Robert Taylor Homes--they're all going to have a different value because of their closeness to the city, and the people repopulating the city, because they're tired of spending hours on the expressways, and the length of time going to and from work--the people who normally had abandoned and left the city for the suburbs, you know, returning in your lofts and your townhouses.
Story_ID: 193027
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in office, I guess there was a big scandal when Joseph Berrios started out.  Now, you didn't get hurt by this, but Berrios was--
Speaker 2: What scandal was involved when I was there?
Speaker 1: Well, Joseph Berrios was on Cook County Board of Tax Appeals, too, the same time you were.
Speaker 2: He is--still is.
Speaker 1: He still is, okay.  There was somewhat of a scandal involving him.  He was subpoenaed, along with that guy, Ralph Capparelli and Sean [sic. Sam] Panayotovich.
Speaker 2: Pan-, Sam Panayotovich.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that all carried while I was there.  That had to do with some of his other activities, not with the board activities, not with them selling reductions or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: During one time that I was there, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] did come in and they, they came in claiming that we had some ghost payrollers, that people were being paid that were not working.  They did an investigation.  It was based on a tip of someone that had given them some--say, I never saw the affidavit on which the search warrant was based.  They had full access.  They took our records and all of those things.  And, you know, as a matter of fact, one of the persons that they had wanted to investigate was one of my first deputies who was a certified public accountant.  They looked at her tax returns and (laughter).  And the other one was a little fellow that had come from a law firm, Bert [ph.] Weisenfeld [ph.] that was making six figures at a law firm.  Now I'm paying him something like about fifty, sixty thousand dollars, but he was so happy to, as an older man, to be doing something like that.  He brought innovative ideas and ways that we change the system and he had no reason to want to do anything kinky or anything because he had assets and all of those things that far succeeded what--and the investigation was dropped.  Nobody was ever charged and that was ten years ago.
Story_ID: 193028
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I--concerns first.  My concern is that I don't see advancements commensurate with some of the efforts that were made in the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s].  I don't see a type of encouragement that I feel is necessary for black males to achieve.  I'm pleased with some of the achievements of black females, seeing them become judges and chairmen and directors of corporations, but unless and until they have the same type of thrust and achievements, black males, the families that we know of heretofore in terms of we want to set as examples, won't exist.  I was reading a magazine the other day.  And that point was made, and based on my experience--and my wife [Myra Frost] and I, we were traveling up in Central and Northern California just this past month.  And the concerns that I raised, I noticed exist there so it's not just Chicago.  And the question as to whether or not we're getting the best bank for our buck in our education program.  The question as to whether or not the employment opportunities are decreasing as opposed to increase.  What concerns me more is that I see that a lot of the services in the jobs that heretofore were done in the United States are being farmed out to foreign countries.  Now computer programs and dealing with credit cards are in some of the foreign countries.  It's difficult for you to find a shirt or a garment that's made in these United States.  And when I travel up and down Highway 101 and 1, California, looking at the road repair and all of these things--didn't see very many Afro-Americans.  At one time, I know that Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] used to provide a lot of tradesmen.  Here right in Chicago [Illinois], we had Dunbar Trade School [Dunbar Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois].  We had a trade school on the Near North Side that would turn out plumbers.
Speaker 1: Wash-, Washburne [Trade School, Chicago, Illinois], uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Washburne is the one I'm looking for.  And then it moved to the Far West Side.  And I don't see those tradesmen replacing the ones that's dying.  In my organization, I was instrumental in terms of getting some electricians licensed, 'cause at one time, very few of them were licensed in our programs here.  And I was able to get this accomplished under the late Richard J. Daley.  And, and normally you would see companies that when they were trying to get some consideration in terms of some of the building, a home building and what-have-you, and the trades and everything, and then they could bid and get their own jobs.  But they're not even there.  And John Marshall Law School [Chicago, Illinois], the number of black males that are in school right now--I would say is about one-fifth the number that used to be.  And I'd say that if you got 10 in the whole school, they're hiding and I haven't seen them.  I'm talking about males; I'm not talking about females.  And, and so, where do you get your extension and your development and, and your continuation from?  And in a political scene, [HistoryMaker] [John] Stroger and I talked about it quite a lot.  John right now is at an age where he'll possibly be retiring or, physically, he's not going to be able to keep up the same pace that he did before.  Chances are someone replacing him, very slight.
Story_ID: 193029
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir, now you retired from public life in 1998.  Is that correct?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Well, from the Board of Tax Appeals.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And 'cause you're still involved on a part-time basis with, with some boards and so forth, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But when you look back on all your years in city council and with the Board of Tax Appeals, what would you consider at this juncture to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Giving people opportunities to participate and to know about things that they wouldn't have had an opportunity before.  Over at the board of appeals, the clerk over there is someone that I brought on board.  And seeing even my successor in the city council now the--Carrie Austin and Deborah Sims, these were all young people who started as (unclear) on the Cook County Board of Commissioners. [HistoryMaker] Emil Jones, president of the Senate.  And I played a part in judges being elected, other people being elected to office.  And those were part of my organization and what-have-you.  And I still participate in sort of an informal manner.  And I go out from time to time and meet with them and talk with them, and sometime attend some of their meetings just to try to bridge the gap and to show them that they're fortunate enough to be able to appreciate how it was done before, why it was done before, and how and, you know, what changes are--if changes should be made, how they can make them, and, of course, people to feel that they can accomplish something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is, is there anything that you would do differently as you look back on all of it?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, hindsight's always twenty-twenty.  You know, there are times when possibly I could have done something more provocative.  And, but I have no regrets over the way that I did things and I, I have never had to beat up on myself or figure that I failed to take advantage of an opportunity that was available to do something or not do something.
Story_ID: 193030
Speaker 1: Okay, and one last question, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: He did it his way.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you, sir.  What, what--oh, did you have something else?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of the things that I enjoy, you know, when I get up in the morning and have breakfast and go out to the golf course.  I get out there and I say many times when it might be snowing here, a foot deep, and everything, I said, I could have been there doing something, but I had the courage to, to leave before they turned the lights out.  And, you know, in public life and doing certain things, it comes to a point when you gotta know when to hold them and when to fold them.  And, sure, there are certain perks that go along with the office and all those things you can become accustomed to, but you can come--become enslaved by them as well.  And now, the most enjoyable thing is not what I do, but the things that I could do if I wanted to.  Just say, for instance, if I wanted to go a [Chicago] Cubs game, I can go to the Cubs game (laughter), if I say so.
Speaker 1: I mean, now engage in this great struggle (laughter) which may lead to a World Series, who knows?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Oh, just for the record, one last question, question.  What are the parameters of the, what were the parameters, or are the parameters of the 34th Ward?
Speaker 2: Okay.  34th Ward, the boundaries are--right now the boundaries would go back to about 99th Street, go as far east as State Street--city limits which would be Calumet Park [Chicago, Illinois], west would be Vincennes.  Vincennes runs diagonal.  It borders the 19th Ward which is Beverly Hills.  It borders the 9th Ward and it borders the 21st Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the communities, is there, is there a name for that community or a name for predominant feature?
Speaker 2: Well, there are several names, Washington Heights, you've got--
Speaker 1: And Maple Park in it?
Speaker 2: Maple Park, you've got Victory Heights, you've got Roseland, and you've got Morgan Park.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.  Thank you, sir, all right.
