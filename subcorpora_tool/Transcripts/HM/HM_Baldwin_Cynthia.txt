Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And before that, I was on the Court of Common Pleas for sixteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it's interesting to know that before that, you actually taught literature, right?
Speaker 2: Before that, yes, I was an academe.  I taught English literature, and then I was Assistant Dean of Student Affairs--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Penn State [Pennsylvania State Greater Allegheny, McKeesport, Pennsylvania]campus, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what is today's date?

Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136780
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone that we interview.  And they only require a short answer.  The first question in this set is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I have a lot of favorite foods.  Let me just tell you that I am quite an accomplished cook.  My daughter [Crystal Baldwin] is an executive chef, so we're a cooking family.  And I have a lot of foods.  I like, I like a lot of the southern foods that I grew up with, and I've managed to make them healthy and still taste great.  And I like also Asian foods, a lot of Asian foods.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, yellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No, I like all times of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: We are currently building a vacation home in Turks and Caicos Islands.  So, I have to say yes, we do have a favorite place.
Speaker 1: Now, what are these islands called again?
Speaker 2: Turks and Caicos.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's T-U-R-K-S and C-A-I-C-O-S Islands.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I have a couple of favorite phrases or sayings.  The first one is, success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get, and experience is what you get when you don't get what you want.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a favorite one of mine that I think is pretty true.  And I think the other one, although I have a lot of them, would be that--it's more of a Biblical phrase about the fact that--I'm trying to remember the exact Bible verse.  But it's, "To him whom much is given, much is required" [Luke 12:48].  The Bible says required.  We always try to say expected, but it is required.  So that's a favorite, too, because I believe that we are required to give back.
Story_ID: 136781
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, I want to ask you about your family history.  I want to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we'll start with just your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's full name is Iona, I-O-N-A--her mother liked Greek literature--Meriweather, M-E-R-I-W-E-A-T-H-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very English, Greek and English.
Speaker 1: And her married name is Baldwin?
Speaker 2: No, my mother's name is Iona Meriweather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her married name is Ackron.
Speaker 1: Ackron, that's right, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: We put a German name on top of that.  (Laughter).  So it's Greek, English and German.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Ackron, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born February 10th, 1914 in Augusta, Georgia.
Story_ID: 136782
Speaker 1: Okay.  Augusta, G-A [Georgia], okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's [Iona Meriweather Ackron] side?  How far back, first of all, can you trace your mother's line?
Speaker 2: Not very far.  In fact, when I was born, both of my mother's parents were dead.  I know their names.  We really don't even have many pictures.  I have a picture of my grandmother on my mother's side, but I don't have a picture of my grandfather.  My grandmother's name was Alberta [Meriweather], A-L-B-E-R-T-A.  And my grandfather's name was William [Meriweather].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there any stories about--did they live in Augusta?
Speaker 2: They did, and then they moved to McKeesport [Pennsylvania].  A lot of people from the South, a lot of African Americans moved up from the South to move to this area because of the steel mills.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And McKeesport had a large one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when do you think they moved to McKeesport?  Was it in the 1880s or 1890s or--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it would have been probably in--because my mother was a little girl.  She was about, she was about--that is one story.  My mother came from a large blended family.  Her father, his first wife had died, and he had re-married.  And so, he came to McKeesport to find a job at a steel mill, and then he sent back for his family.  Well, needless to say, it cost a lot to put everybody on the train and bring them up.  And I think my mother said there was about nine of them that were coming, and she was the youngest one.  So everybody got to come, but they didn't have the money for her, so she was the basket lunch.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that she was smuggled, then?
Speaker 2: (Nods head, yes.) (Laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  She was smuggled to--did they come by train?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, are there any stories from Augusta, Georgia about what life was like down there for the family before they moved to McKeesport?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Although I know that my mother had a lot of relatives on the outskirts of Augusta.  And we went down to visit, so there were a lot of farming people.  So they ate well, that's one thing that she does remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Augusta, Georgia, everybody knows that it's the home of James Brown.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So, your parents--
Speaker 2: And the Masters [Golf Tournament], that's the two things people know about Augusta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: And the Masters Golf Tournament, that's right.  So, now, so your mother was a little, was small enough to be smuggled.  So--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, small enough to fit in that basket.
Speaker 1: So, somewhere between, let me think, 1916, 1917 or something, she was brought--
Speaker 2: I would say about them uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I would say she was about three.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your grandfather worked at the--
Speaker 2: The steel mill.
Speaker 1: --steel mill, okay.  Do you know which mill it was?
Speaker 2: National Tube [Works].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136783
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Iona Merriweather Ackron] talk about growing up, and what it was like?
Speaker 2: She didn't talk a lot about growing up in Augusta [Georgia].  She wanted me to go--when I was sixteen, it was the first time that I went South with her.  And it was the first time that I faced overt segregation.  And so, it was an interesting experience for me, but she thought it was very important that I know what it was like, where she was from.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you went down?
Speaker 2: Sixteen.
Speaker 1: For the first time?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was sixteen, I will never forget it.  I remember that we went out to the country.  I remember just sitting on the porch, and, you know, everybody talking about getting up before the heat--of course, when we got up, it was already hot.  I walked miles to see other young people, which I wasn't used to.  Because we walked city blocks, not country miles.  And I remember that most of the people did not have television sets.  And I remember one day my mother sent me to the store, which was maybe about half a mile away to get something.  And in fact, I remember what it was.  It was Alaga syrup. (Laughter).  And she sent me to the store to get Alaga syrup.  And I went to the store, and it was a little country store.  And the man was waiting on somebody, and he had a television in the store.  And there were a couple of men standing around looking, and I hadn't seen television in a while.  So, you know, I walked to the front of the store and stood--since I'm short--stood in the front of the men to look up at the television.  And I remember the man saying, you know, "Girl, what can I get for you?"  And I told him I wanted Alaga syrup.  And he said, "I can tell by the way you talk that you're not from here.  But I knew that before, standing up there, front of the television set."
Speaker 1: So these are white men standing in the store?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136784
Speaker 1: So your mother [Iona Meriweather Ackron] went to school in McKeesport [Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was she able to finish high school and all that?
Speaker 2: No.  My mother went to eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when she came out and started to work.  And in fact, both my mother and my father [James Ackron] finished eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were the schools integrated in McKeesport?
Speaker 2: Schools were integrated in McKeesport, because I met some of the people that she went to school with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They weren't all integrated in the North, you know, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, I know.
Speaker 1: So, okay.  So, well, you grew up in McKeesport, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, did your parents, did you grow up with the same parents that your--I mean the same neighborhood that your parents, that your mother grew up in?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother grew up in the 1st Ward of McKeesport.  And when she and my dad married, they bought a house in the 3rd Ward of McKeesport.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I take it, it was a step up from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --where they were?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136785
Speaker 1: Well, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's full name is James Alexander, A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R, Ackron, A-C-K-R-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 26, 1910, Madisonville, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Madisonville, now do you know where Madisonville is?
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere outside of Louisville [Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's somewhere in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, back to the name, though.  Now this is, you say it's a name of German origin--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Ackron.  Now, is there a story on your father's side of the family about the--
Speaker 2: There's definitely a story on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The surname is Ackron, which is German, and it's fairly rare.  And there were very few German slave owners.  But the interesting thing is my dad is half Cherokee.  So that meant that his father, a full-blooded Cherokee, had a German last name.  And we went looking for the records in Louisville where they had been, but there had been a big fire in Louisville, so it was hard to find records.  So we just surmised that at one time in this country they tried to enslave Native Americans, too, but the Native Americans didn't enslave well.  They died at a larger rate, and was very, very independent, and wanted to be back with the land.  So, we think that it must have been at time that my grandfather, Raymond Ackron's father, had been enslaved, but was free for some reason.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories about--because he was half Cherokee.  Are there any stories about Cherokee culture or anything that has been passed down?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Was he basically raised in a black community?
Speaker 2: That's right, because he married my grandmother [Mary Ackron], who's an African American, black.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he was half Cherokee, but not full.  So, he was black and Cherokee?
Speaker 2: My dad, uh-huh--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, okay.  All right, so--
Speaker 2: --very much.  I mean, and I did bring a picture, and you can see that he has the hook nose and the very high cheekbones.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did he have stories about growing up in Madisonville, and what it was like?
Speaker 2: I know the stories that he told me.  My dad had a very interesting upbringing.  He went to a Methodist boarding school, and his, my grandmother, ran a boarding house in Louisville.  And so, they could afford to send my father--my grandfather was a coalminer.  And they could afford to send my father to a boarding school, and he got a very good education.  But he would be away for large parts of the time, and then he'd come back.  And my father as well as my mother [Iona Meriweather Ackron] was an excellent, excellent cook, because he helped in the boarding house when he was going through school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He cooked.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know the name of the boarding school he attended?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  All is know is that it was a Methodist boarding school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, it was probably something set up by the Methodist church for--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --colored children, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so, your grandmother--
Speaker 2: I know it was the United Methodist--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that set it up.  Because my dad, when my dad moved to McKeesport [Pennsylvania], he became one of the founding members of a Black United Methodist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, how did your father decide to move to McKeesport?
Speaker 2: Well, his parents decided to move to McKeesport because the steel mills, of course, were working at capacity.  And his father worked in the coal mines and in the steel mills.  And so, they decided that coming North would be the right thing to do.  And my grandmother also, in addition to running the boarding house, was an accomplished seamstress.  And so they knew that they'd be able to do well, and they came north.  And my father finished, as I said, eleventh grade and then he started to work in the mills.
Speaker 1: Now, did your grandmother run a boardinghouse in McKeesport, too, did she--?
Speaker 2: No, she was a seamstress.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 136786
Speaker 1: All right, so, now is there a story about how your parents [Iona Meriweather Ackron and James Ackron] met, that they tell?
Speaker 2: Actually, they met at a social.  There was some club that had a social--a group of people, they had a social.  And my father said he was attracted immediately to my mother.  And the funniest thing about it is that he was attracted because my mother loved to dance, and he was watching her dance.  My father did not like to dance, so it was interesting.  (Laughter).  But that's, but she had, she had a wonderful laugh and a terrific smile.  So he said that was what attracted him.  And she was very attractive, and so was he, a very attractive man.  So they, I guess they were attracted to each other.  And when I say attractive, I don't mean just physically.  I mean, my father was a very hardworking, quiet, articulate man.  So, I think that was attractive to my mother.  And the opposite--he was attracted because he noticed that she was intelligent and well-read.  My mother wrote poetry, but loved to dance, and laughed a lot.
Speaker 1: Now, was higher--I mean, was high school graduation discouraged kind of in that town?  Because what I see are two people that seem to be--your father went to private school, a private boarding school in Kentucky.  And he seemed to be on a track to at least, you know, go to teacher's college or do something like that.  And your mother, you know, with writing poetry, and--you know, are they--
Speaker 2: Well, the fact is that I don't think it was discouraged.  I think that it was the times that--I mean, because times were, you know, not as good economically.  And I think that my mother, being from a large family, really came out of school to help out there.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because they both came of age during the [Great] Depression, right?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  And my father could get a job in the mill; that was a fabulous job.  And so, it was a choice between doing that and helping out and eating, or continuing school.  And there was no guarantee that he would be able to go on to college.  I mean he never talked about his family talking about going to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It seems like if they were to send him to boarding school, they were thinking about, you know, they were thinking that way.
Speaker 2: Well, I think they thought about that.  They definitely were believers in education.  They definitely--I know my grandmother [Mary Ackron] was very practical.  She thought everybody should be able to read and write and do math, because she was an entrepreneur.  So, it was important to her that you know how to do that.  And I think that--but she always thought about it, in terms of being self-sufficient, and being an entrepreneur and not being a college graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 136787
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you think about your parents' [Iona Meriweather Ackron and James Ackron] personalities and their talents and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Both of them.  And my husband [Arthur Baldwin], to whom I've been married almost forty-two years now, will tell everybody that I take after both of them.  I think I have my mother's smile and laugh and the love of dancing, and needless to say, the love of poetry and literature and all of those kinds of things.  My father, I have a lot of my father's stoicism and work ethic--and the moments that I need to be quiet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I think I take after both.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I'm it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is very interesting.  I'm an only child.  My father was an only child, his father was an only child, and his mother was an only child.  Very odd for that time.
Speaker 1: That is odd for that time.
Speaker 2: Very odd.
Speaker 1: You know, we've interviewed people who came up at same time, and their parents had twelve children and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Very odd.
Speaker 1: Especially in a small place where--
Speaker 2: My mother's blended family was thirteen.  But my father's family was very small.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, when you were growing up, your household consisted of your mother, your father, and yourself.  Were any of your grandparents around?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father's mother [Mary Ackron] lived with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I have to tell you that I was born eleven years after my parents were married, which made a difference in the way that I was raised, too.
Story_ID: 136788
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory of the home?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  I loved the house.  I grew up on a block that was very, very ethnic, and I loved it.  In my block we had--and I can actually picture the block.  From the top of the block we had two Hungarian sisters that were not married, who lived on the corner.  And then we had, there was the duplex that they lived in.  And then there was an African American family that owned the corner store.  And then was another African American family.  There was a Hungarian family where the grandmother, her daughter, her son-in-law, and their three children lived in that house.  And then there was a Polish family, I believe they were Polish.  I still remember her name, Mrs. Kuhla [ph.], and she lived there with her two sons.  And they were grown sons, but they were, neither one of them had married.  And then we lived in the center of the block.  And then on the other side of us lived an Irish widow, her name was Kate Flynn.  And then in the next duplex, the Johnsons lived there, and they had two sons.  And then upstairs lived another couple.  Then we had another African American family.  Then we had an Italian family, an African American family, and a Jewish family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, a lot of these mining communities have a similar--well, steel mill, or small--
Speaker 2: It's the steel--
Speaker 1: --yeah, steel town.
Speaker 2: Everybody's father worked in the steel mill.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  So, it drew a lot of different kinds of people to the town.
Speaker 2: Right, and it was a wonderful community.  My--we knew everybody in the community, and everybody knew us.  On my way to school and on my way home from school, I saw almost everybody.  When the doors opened for school, all the children over there were going to school together.  So, it was--and I learned an appreciation early for all people, and for all different kinds of food.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: A recurring theme.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It is a recurring theme.  I tell you, it's funny, because sometimes people ask me--I'll have a dinner party, and I'll throw in some small pierogis as appetizers, or I'll make halushka.  People will say, "Where did you learn this?"  "When I was growing up on Morgan Street [McKeesport, Pennsylvania]."
Story_ID: 136789
Speaker 1: Well, we were describing where you grew up, and your childhood memories.  We always ask this question, and I know food's going to come out of this, too.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you one of the funniest--I used to always tell people how beautiful the evenings were, the sunsets.  In our neighborhood, everyone got cleaned up.  And that's what we called it, cleaned up, in the evenings.  And we came out and you sat on the porch, or you walked up and down the street and talked to your neighbors.  But everybody did it.  I mean, the women went in and put on clean housedresses, and everybody--and the children--everybody was cleaned up.
Speaker 1: Well, was this in the evening?
Speaker 2: Yes, in the evenings.  And you would come out, and I know we would sit on the front porch.  And I used to look at the sunsets, and I'd say, "Oh, so pretty."  It wasn't until I was much older that I realized the sunsets were so beautiful because of the pollution.  (Laughter).  Because there was so much in the air from the steel mills, that we had more colors than anybody else, in our sunset.  But that was one of my earliest memories.
Speaker 1: So, did the mountains sort of dominate the landscape, the Alleghenies?
Speaker 2: Well, there were, there were hills.  I mean it was mostly hills.  But the steel mill was so close, and my father [James Ackron] walked to work.  We never owned a car.  My father walked about a mile and a half to work.  And it was very interesting.  And you're right, that food was very important, because that's how we showed love in the community.  Whenever there was a wedding, everybody cooked and brought something.  Whenever there was a funeral, everybody cooked and brought something.  Whenever anybody was sick, I carried more pots of chicken soup to neighbors, because my mother [Iona Meriweather Ackron] would tell me that Mrs. so and so was sick, and take this pot of soup to them.  So, that was part of showing your caring, your love for your neighbors.  And so, I remember growing up and smelling absolutely wonderful food, and tasting absolutely wonderful food.  What else do I remember?
Speaker 1: Any particular--
Speaker 2: Of course, the smells of the steel mill, too.  Sulfur, there was a lot of sulfur in the air.  So, every once in a while, depending on the way the wind was blowing, you would smell the sulfur, too.  There was a wonderful Jewish delicatessen down the street.  And they made corned beef, they made fresh corned beef on Saturday mornings.  And my father would walk me down the street to this delicatessen.
Story_ID: 136790
Speaker 1: And he was, my dad [James Ackron] was well-known in the community.  He became a constable.  He was the first African American to run the diesel train in the [steel] mill.  They gave him that job because they couldn't make him a supervisor over white men.  So, they gave him the second best job, because he was such a hard worker.
Speaker 2: Then later he became a constable?
Speaker 1: He was a constable, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was he the first--
Speaker 1: He still has his badge.
Speaker 2: Was he the first black constable in town?
Speaker 1: You know what?  I really don't know that.  But I don't know of anybody else who was.  So, but my father was very, very--both of my parents [James Ackron and Iona Meriweather Ackron] were well-respected in the community.  I mean, to the extent that when people wanted advice, they would come to my parents.  If there was some family tragedy and they needed help, they came to my parents.  If they needed money, they came to my parents.  (Laughter.)  I mean, that's the way my parents were, and so that was a wonderful part of growing up, too.  And I guess the sound of just children playing, when for a long time in my neighborhood there were no girls.  So, I was a tomboy, there was no doubt about it, because there were no boys to play with.  So, I climbed trees and skinned knees, and did all of that.  And my father, who knew a great deal about the outdoors, taught me about the outdoors.  And on the weekend, my mother taught me.  And I learned, I was in Tom Thumb weddings and fashion shows.  And she put organdy dresses on me that stopped right above my skinned knees. (Laughter.)  So, she tried--I learned how to pour tea, and I learned how to keep house, that's what she taught me.  So, I thought I was pretty lucky.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did your mother work outside of the home?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: She stayed... okay.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, she was a stay at home mom.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my mother believed in that.  I cannot remember a parents' program, a parents' day, or a parents' night that either both of my parents--or my mother went if my dad was working.  She was always there.
Story_ID: 136791
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now what school, what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Which school?
Speaker 1: Well, the first school you started.
Speaker 2: The first school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: First school I went to was Walnut Street [Public] School [McKeesport, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Is this kindergarten?
Speaker 2: I skipped kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had kindergarten.  I took a state test, and that's how come I graduated from high school early.  I took a state test and skipped a grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you started grade one, were you five when you started?
Speaker 2: I had just turned five.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, do you remember your first day at school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was it like?
Speaker 2: (Laughter.)  I couldn't wait.  I wanted to go to school so badly.  My parents [James Ackron and Iona Meriweather Ackron] were firm believers in education, and I had learned everything--my numbers, my ABCs, you know, I could color in the lines.  I was ready, I couldn't wait.  And my mother dressed me up, and off we went to the school.  And my first grade teacher's name was Miss Slack [ph.], and she was absolutely wonderful.  I loved school from day one.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't imagine that I really had a favorite one in first grade.  I'm not going to give that answer, that my favorite subject was recess.  (Laughter.) But I loved being in the classroom.  As I, as I got older, I loved everything about school.  I loved English, and spelling, and geography, and history, and science, I loved biology and math.  I loved math all the way up to trig [trigonometry].  I can't say I loved trig, but I loved everything about school.
Story_ID: 136792
Speaker 1: Now, you were saying during the break that there's a story that Paul Laurence Dunbar visited McKeesport [Pennsylvania] and spoke before the Phillis Wheatley Literary Society.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So this, so would it be fair to say that black community, you know, was--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --had a cultural kind of a--
Speaker 2: It really had a cultural bent.  And remember, I said that my mother [Iona Meriweather Ackron], on the weekends--my father [James Ackron] had been a founding member of Calvary [United] Methodist Church, and my mother  was a member of Zion Baptist Church.  I went to Zion Baptist with my mother, and I went to Sunday School, youth church, and church.  And that's where I started public speaking.  I said my first speech at age two, and they got longer and longer.  And then I went into oratory, and they used to have oratorical contests in all of the churches, so I would compete in those contests.  And I would read a lot of the literature, and as I said, my mother loved poetry.  So, I read Paul Laurence Dunbar.  And she was a member of the Phillis Wheatley Literary Society.  So, she read everything and read to me.  A lot of times at the dinner table, we would have these discussions about either literary things or about current events.
Speaker 1: So, for instance, well, I mean that's unusual.  You know, there are very few families that I know today who discuss literature at the table, or even get at the table anymore together, you know.  So--
Speaker 2: It was, it was really funny, because there was a "pop poet" that's all I know to call it, named Edgar [A.] Guest, who was in a lot of the papers.  And both my mother and my father--my father was a 33rd degree Mason, so he did a lot of speaking at a lot of affairs.  And my mother, again, read and recited poetry.  But my dad liked a lot of those poems.  And I remember that my father had this one favorite poem.  And I used to just hate it when he'd recite it--and I'd say, "Oh, Dad, don't recite that poem again."  And the poem was called 'Shoes.'  And I still think I can recite some of it, but I'm not sure about all of it.  It went something like this:  "When I was young and my shoes were red, I could kick my feet way over my head.  As I got older and my shoes were blue, I could still dance the whole night through.  Now that I'm old and my shoes are black, I walk to the corner and puff my way back.  The reason I know my youth has been spent, is because my get up and go has got up and went.  Since I've withdrawn from life's competition, my every day is an exact repetition.  I wake up each morning and dust off my wits, pick up the paper and read the obits.  But my name is still missing, I know I'm not dead.  So, I eat a big breakfast and go back to bed."  He recited that poem all the time.  (Laughter.)  And I would say, "It's so corny."  And now that I'm at this age, I go, now I kind of know what he kind of meant about that.  (Laughter).  But he would, my mother would have me write the speeches that I performed in the churches.  And so, and both of my parents would go with me to hear me speak.  And I remember that once we traveled up the river, and I'm not quite sure where we went, maybe Manassas or Charlotte.  But our church was having an oratorical contest there, and it had been announced in my church.  So, I wrote a speech and I went up.  And when we got there, we found out--I was in junior high school.  And we found out it was for seniors, it was for people who were seniors, because they were going to give them a little scholarship for those people who were in the school.  That's what they were competing for.  And we'd come all of that way, and so the minister said well, he would let me give my presentation anyways.  So, I gave my presentation, and the church was wonderful, I got a standing ovation.  And they took up a collection for me, because there was no prize to give me (laughter).  So, they took up a collection for me, and so I remember that.  It was a big deal.  Those were, those were wonderful, wonderful times.
Story_ID: 136793
Speaker 1: Now, as you--now well, tell us about--now, did you go to middle school?  Was there a middle school?
Speaker 2: At that time, junior high school, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, our school system was very interesting.  Walnut Street [Public] School [McKeesport, Pennsylvania] was two buildings.  It was first through sixth in one building, and seventh and eighth in another building.  Then ninth grade was in a separate building altogether.  And then the senior high school was ten through twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the ninth grade was the junior high school in some ways?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was... yeah.  But even though seventh and eighth was part of it, we were still Walnut Street School for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it was still called Walnut Street School?
Speaker 2: Right.  And then ninth grade was Shaw Avenue.  And then tenth grade was Tech, or McKeesport Technical High School [later, McKeesport Area High School, McKeesport, Pennsylvania].  It's still called Technical High School, even though it wasn't a technical high school.  And then later on, it was just called McKeesport High School.  By the time I graduated, it was just McKeesport High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136794
Speaker 1: And there, and you know, while I talk about how, what a wonderful upbringing I had in the neighborhood, there was no doubt there was still segregation in McKeesport [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: In what ways did it manifest itself?
Speaker 1: Well, at Walnut Street [Public] School [McKeesport, Pennsylvania], when I was in seventh grade, the seventh grade teacher announced that we were going to have a spelling bee.  And the top three spellers would go to the [Carnegie Science Center] Buhl Planetarium where they would be in a spell-off, and then you went to the spelling bee in Washington, D.C.  And so, we all participated, and I came in second, and I was ecstatic.  But she also announced that, you know, you would go to Buhl Planetarium to be in this spell-off in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], where all the schools would come.  And it was on a Saturday, so she would take us all down and we'd have lunch and be in the spelling bee.  So, I went home and I told my mother, and my parents [Iona Meriweather Ackron and James Ackron] were proud and I was excited.  And the very next day I went back to school, and she called me up to her desk and she said... she said, "Cynthia, I know you will understand.  But I have always wanted to take a boy."  And, you know, there were three girls who'd won.  "And I really want to take a boy."  His name was Fred Ricky Hilton [ph.].  "And so, I know you won't mind that I'm not going to take you.  We're going to put up a little something in the room to show that you were-- but I'm not going to take you."  Well, I was devastated, just devastated.  So, I went home that night and told my mother.  The next day my mother went to school, and she went to see the principal, and his name was Harry Cone [ph.].  And she went to see Mr. Cone, and Mr. Cone, I'll never forget, he walked out of his office and he walked up to the spelling teacher, Miss Anderson [ph.] was her name, she taught spelling and music.  And they went up, and he called her out.  And he went back down, and he told my mother that the school was not sponsoring it, and that Miss Anderson had taken it upon herself to do this, and he couldn't stop it now.  And she did not want to take me because I couldn't eat lunch where she was going to take the children to eat.  And my mother said, "Well, Cynthia doesn't need to eat lunch, she wants to participate in the spelling bee."  And so he said, "There's not much I can do."  So, I do remember that story.  And I remember that when I ran for judge I was in a gathering, and this elderly woman came up to me and said, "I always knew that you were something special."  It was Mrs. Anderson (laughter).  So yeah, there was, there was segregation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was subtle, but it was definitely there.
Story_ID: 136795
Speaker 1: Was there actually an African American side of town at all in McKeesport [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: I know your neighborhood was integrated, but was there--
Speaker 2: I will tell you that the housing, the federal housing projects were segregated.  There was an African American project named Harrison Village.  And there was a white project, a Caucasian project, named Crawford Village.
Speaker 1: Now, these were new projects relatively, right?  I know in those days when you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were relatively new.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But all blacks lived in Harrison Village, and all whites lived in Crawford Village.
Speaker 1: And this was the plan of the government, you know, that set them up, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if you applied to live in the housing projects, if you were black, your application went to Harrison.  And if you were white, your application went to Crawford.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136796
Speaker 1: Now, well, what was [McKeesport] High School [later McKeesport Area High School, McKeesport, Pennsylvania] like?  Did you participate in clubs in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. I was on Red and Blue, which was our school newspaper.  I was in French Club.  I was on a capella choir.  And I was, of course, in the speech club.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a debate team or anything like that in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you on that team?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Debate, oration, whatever.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a speech star, or whatever.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Loved it, I enjoyed it very, very, very, much.  So, I was involved in a lot of the activities, and enjoyed each one.
Speaker 1: Were there many other African American youths involved in the same kind of things?
Speaker 2: Many others?  No.  A couple of others, sure.
Speaker 1: A couple of others?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the ratio in the school?
Speaker 2: Let me think.
Speaker 1: A third of the school, I mean, an eighth?  I don't know, tenth?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was as low as tenth.  Maybe a fifth or fourth, maybe a fourth.  There were in my graduating class 899 students.
Speaker 1: Eight hundred and ninety nine students graduated?
Speaker 2: We were going to a merged high school, 899.  And in the class before, there were a thousand.  We're the baby boomers. (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's incredible, that was a huge school.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: What did you have, like three thousand students, four thousand?
Speaker 2: Three thousand.
Speaker 1: Three thousand?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a huge school.  And my son [James Ackron Baldwin] came through the same high school when he graduated--I graduated in '62 [1962], and he graduated in '86 [1986].  I had 899 in my graduating class, and there were 499 in his.
Speaker 1: So, it was even bigger.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: So his school was even bigger, I mean it was even bigger.
Speaker 2: His was smaller, his graduating class was about half of mine.
Speaker 1: Oh, so--
Speaker 2: Mine was 899.
Speaker 1: Oh, 899, okay.
Speaker 2: His was 499.
Speaker 1: Oh, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.  But 899, that unbelievable.  That's, I think the average--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when you think about that, it went from a thousand to 899, because the class of '61 [1961] had a thousand.
Speaker 1: Wow.  So, I take it the teams probably won a lot of games?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, a great football team, great football team; terrific basketball teams.  We had, we enjoyed sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, there were also fights.  So, by the time that I got to senior high school, our football games were played on Saturdays, but it used to be Friday nights.
Speaker 1: There were actual fights with other--
Speaker 2: There were fights with other teams, yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, this is the football capital, one of the football capitals of America.
Speaker 2: Oh, it is; it is.
Speaker 1: So, they take it--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, football is, high school football is extremely important.
Speaker 1: --serious.
Speaker 2: Serious business.
Story_ID: 136797
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite instructors in high school [at McKeesport High School, later McKeesport Area High School, McKeesport, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did.  Mr. Allison [ph.], I remember.
Speaker 1: What did he teach?
Speaker 2: He taught history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Mr. Flynn [ph.] taught biology.  And Miss King [ph.] taught English.
Speaker 1: Now, I take it she had a tremendous influence on you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I enjoyed all of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, I take it you took to the library, you know, I suppose in those days?  All the books--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I loved the library.  And we had a wonderful Carnegie library in McKeesport [Pennsylvania], a big, imposing, stone building.  And I loved going to the library, I went to the library every day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you one of the highest ranked students in class?  I would guess that--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but let me put it this way.  My parents [Iona Meriweather Ackron and James Ackron] felt that everybody had a job in the family.  My father's job was to work and bring money home to take care of us.  My mother's job was taking care of the home.  And my job was to do well in school.  So, they, their expectation was excellence.  And my mother should have been a psychologist, she was fabulous at it.  I remember one time I came home, and I had four A's and a B.  I thought I had done fabulously well.  I talked to all of my friends on the way home, and we'd all checked our report cards, and I thought I'd done fabulously.  My mom, she looked at it, and she said, "This is great, this is wonderful.  And your father's going to be so proud."  She said, "Now, this B, this must be a really hard subject, because this is the best you can do in this subject, a B, huh?  This must be really hard.  Of course, you're so good.  Let me think. Gee, I would do more than a B in that subject.  Of course, I know, no subject's going to be--"  (Laughter).  So, she was really good.  But yeah, I did well in school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, I mean, did you run for class office or anything like that?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I never did run for class office, no.  I held offices in the clubs that I was in.  And I was, I was very, very active in our church.  So, I, in fact, by the time I was sixteen, I was running our youth church actually.  But I never ran--isn't that funny?  And I had never had the desire to run.  And then I'd wait all those years and run for judge.  That's really strange.  (Laughter).  I never thought of it that way.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the social set-up there?  Did you go to the proms, and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In high school?
Speaker 2: Everybody went together, blacks and whites.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they didn't make any discrimination there?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody went.
Story_ID: 136084
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were just talking about high school football during the break being a big part of the social life of the community.
Speaker 1: Right, it's part of the social life of the community.  Everybody goes, it's not just the students.  So, you'd go into the stands and you'd see loads of parents and relatives and people who just like high school football.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a pageant in a lot of ways.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: I mean it has more to do with, it's a social thing, rather than just a game.
Speaker 1: It is, it definitely is a social thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you don't see as much of it anymore.  But, okay, so, now did anything else special happen in high school [McKeesport High School, later McKeesport Area High School, McKeesport, Pennsylvania]?  Now, did you get a chance to go on any trips or--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, of course.  We had, needless to say, I went to a lot of places because I was in forensics.  So we did, of course, we debated against other schools; we did all of those kinds of things.
Speaker 2: This is within Pennsylvania, right?
Speaker 1: Right.  We had our ninth grade field trip, it was always the same; we went to Washington, D.C.  We left on Friday night, and we came back on Sunday afternoon.  And we stayed in a hotel, and I forgot how many of us they put into a room, but there was probably about three or four to a room.  And then you went to see the White House and the Jefferson Memorial, and we stopped by the Smithsonian and those kinds of things.  So, that was also very nice; we all looked forward to it.  What else did we do in high school?  I was in the acapella choir, so I got to travel a lot with the choir, and that was a good thing. That's about what I remember.
Speaker 2: So, did you get a chance to, I mean did they have the National Honor Society, and that sort of stuff?
Speaker 1: Yes, definitely, we had a National Honor Society.  Because by the time we went to college, we found out they were a dime a dozen, those National Honor Society kids. (Laughter).  Because when you go to college, everybody has a National Honor Society bit.  When you're in high school, you think you're really special because you have one. That, and I won the scholarships, several scholarships and--
Story_ID: 136085
Speaker 1: So you, well, you knew you were going to college, right?  So, you--
Speaker 2: There was never a doubt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a never a doubt.  I don't even remember having an overt conversation, but there was never a doubt in my mind I was going to college.  There was never a doubt.  I mean, my parents [Iona Meriweather Ackron and James Ackron] were so sure and focused that that was what it was going to be.
Speaker 1: Now, was there an existence of a role model of a black woman who was a college graduate in your town [McKeesport, Pennsylvania] that you knew?
Speaker 2: In my town, I became the first African American woman who taught on the secondary level.  So, there weren't a lot.  I mean, I remember the people.  There was John, I'm trying to think of his last name.  His first name was John, he was the first one.  Suzanne Jones was the second.
Speaker 1: The first ones to go to college in that town?
Speaker 2: They were the first ones to teach.
Speaker 1: Teach, okay.
Speaker 2: And I was the third one to come back and teach there.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have a black teacher in school at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the first ones emerged, what, in the '60s?  Or what would you say?
Speaker 2: Yes, in the '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 136086
Speaker 1: Now, did your family keep up with--now, you had a television--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: --I assume from what you were saying about going to Augusta [Georgia] for the first time and seeing television.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, did your family keep up with the news and the Civil Rights Movement, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Remember, I told you we had these conversations at the dinner table.  Oh, yes, and not only that, my mother [Iona Merriweather Ackron] would read parts of Ebony magazine a lot, about what was happening, so that, you know, we would be aware, so that we would know that the world didn't start and stop with McKeesport, Pennsylvania.  And she was that way with other children in the neighborhood.  She really thought that it was important that we knew--to the point that--I'll never forget.  I think that she and my dad  [James Ackron] debated whether I would be allowed to see the Ebony [sic, Jet magazine] with Emmett Till on the cover.  And I remember them sitting down and having this conversation with me about it was very important that I know how important all people were, and that the color of my skin should never hold me back from doing what I wanted to do, and that unfortunately there were people that judged people by the color of their skin and would hurt them simply because of the color of their skin.  And that there was a young boy traveling south that there had been some people who had done some horrible things to him, and that it was just traumatizing, but it was important that I know that there are some things that happen in the world that aren't pretty.  So, I remember that conversation, and then them saying to me that--because the Ebony came in--because that was a big thing, we all read the Ebony magazine.  I mean, I loved sitting down with Ebony.  And I don't know whether I had looked for it or whatever--to look at it--but then they showed me the cover, but not without that conversation.
Story_ID: 136087
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I know you were aware of black writers, with the Phillis Wheatley Literary Society and the discussion about [Paul Laurence] Dunbar, and--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you read, like, the Harlem Renaissance writers like Langston Hughes and people like that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and Countee Cullen.  Loved Langston Hughes, loved Langston Hughes.  And Langston Hughes came to McKeesport [Pennsylvania].  In fact, Paul Laurence Dunbar would come--that was the Langston Hughes Day.  Paul Laurence Dunbar had come early.  He had come, yeah, he had come a lot earlier.  But 1914 was Langston Hughes.  And there was somebody else that came.
Speaker 1: Dunbar, yeah, he died in 1906.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was a--
Speaker 2: No, he'd come--
Speaker 1: So that was, that means that they had a society a long time.
Speaker 2: They'd been around in 1900, I mean near the end of his--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had a society for a long time.
Speaker 2: But it was 1914 for Langston Hughes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was one other person, I can't think of who it was.  But there were three people that were well-known, and traveled to McKeesport.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  It would be interesting to know the history of that Phillis Wheatley Society.  That's really a unique kind of thing, yeah.
Speaker 2: And it's still in existence, still in existence.
Speaker 1: So, they've been in existence over a hundred years now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.  It was wonderful.  My mother [Iona Meriweather Ackron] looked forward to it.
Speaker 1: Is there a strong Masonic tradition in McKeesport?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Amongst the black men and women?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father [James Ackron] was a Mason; my mother an Eastern Star.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that was strong in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] in the nineteenth century, going the all way back to the 1820s.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, you know--
Speaker 2: A strong tradition.
Story_ID: 136088
Speaker 1: Now, did you know, what was your awareness like about the law, in terms of--did you have any thought about becoming a lawyer in those days?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The black professionals in our neighborhood were doctors and dentists.  Needless to say, there were not even teachers, because I told you-- But my godfather, Dr. Mark Hadley [sic, Dr. Matthew R. Hadley], was in fact looked up to the in the community, because he was the first one who had headed up the respiratory unit.  And he started health-a-rama, which everybody had some version of that, where they had these health fairs.  And he was very, very active with the community.  And again, another example of racism, our doctors all lived in a place called Pill Hill [McKeesport, Pennsylvania].  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, Chicago's [Illinois] got a famous neighborhood called Pill Hill, for the same reason.  So, doctors lived in--
Speaker 2: And he tried to buy a house there, and was not permitted to buy a house there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so white doctors lived on Pill Hill, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the white doctors lived on Pill Hill.  And so, he bought, he had to buy a house somewhere else.  But Dr. Hadley, Dr. Gettens [ph.], and the dentist, I can't think of his name, those were the three.  Dr. Downing [ph.] was the dentist, Dr. Downing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That seems like a pretty--well, decent group of black medical people--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --for the population, you would think.  So, but you didn't know any black lawyers in town in those days, right?
Speaker 2: There were no black lawyers in town.  I didn't know any because we didn't have any.  If you wanted a lawyer, you had to go to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you wanted a black lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you get the [Pittsburgh] Courier at home?
Speaker 2: Yes, didn't everyone?  (Laughter).  Yes, we got the Courier always.  I mean, we got the Courier, Ebony, Jet--if it was a black publication, we got it.  And then we got that in addition to our regular news, The Daily News, which was the newspaper for McKeesport.  And we got the morning-- the Sun Telegraph of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], Sun Telegraph, because it was a morning and an afternoon paper.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 136089
Speaker 1: So, well, when--now did you get any special recognition before you graduated, or at graduation [from McKeesport High School, later McKeesport Area High School, McKeesport, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, oh, yes.  We wore the cords, you had to wear (unclear).  I had, I was a Rotary Scholarship winner.  I mean, they print all of these things, and they announce that you're going to--
Speaker 1: So, you graduated in 1962?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you were a Rotary scholar, in the National Honor Society?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Were you the valedictorian or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I was not the valedictorian.  I was, I'm trying to think of the other--I got the Phillis Wheatley scholarship, something from Dallas--oh, boy, are you pushing me on this.
Speaker 1: Well, you don't have to give us all of them.  I just want some idea.
Speaker 2: It's good to be able to think back. I think those were the ones.
Speaker 1: So, okay.  Now, what was your, so you were counseled to go to college.  I mean nobody tried to discourage you, did they, from going?
Speaker 2: No, nobody tried to discourage me.  It was an oddity, because people weren't going to college from my neighborhood.  But, you know, I had friends who were also planning to go to college, and did go to college.  I do remember that when I went into to see my guidance counselor whom I hadn't seen in my whole high school career--at that time, you didn't go the guidance counselor unless you had some problems.  And so, I never had seen my guidance counselor.  I knew who the guidance counselors were, and we had them by alphabet, you know, alphabetically, you went to see the counselor.  And mine was Mr. Gross [ph.], and there was another lady named, I think her name was Miss Brown.  But I went to Mr. Gross, and I remember going in and saying--we had to make an appointment to see Mr. Gross.  I said, "Mr. Gross, I'm coming in because I want to go to college."  And so, he was writing, and kind of looked up at me.  He said, "College?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Where do you think you want to go?"  I said, "I want to go to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania]."  He said, "Penn State?  Do you know they only take the upper fifth of the class?"  And I said, "I'm in the upper tenth of the class."  And he said, "What's your name?"  And he looked up my record and he said, "Why doesn't a smart girl like you then go to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?"  And I will remember that, always.  And it was, you know, it was just, I had never had that experience.  It was just kind of a strange experience.  I went home and I told my parents [Iona Meriweather Ackron and James Ackron] and they said, my parents were like, "Well, why would he say that?"  (Laughter).  I said, "I don't know."  But I have to tell you, the other counselor was wonderful, because she--I wasn't even in her group, and she called me out of class once and told me that she could get me a full scholarship to Chatham [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], it was Chatham College then.  She could get me a full scholarship to Chatham College if I wanted to go to Chatham.  And I often think, poor dumb me, I just have this thing that--I had never even seen Penn State.  I had no idea what the campus looked like.  It's just that I had heard people say "Oh, Penn State is a wonderful college," and this, that, and the other.  And so, I went home and I told my parents.  And my dad said, "Well, that sounds like a really good idea, let's do that."  I said, "Dad, I don't want to go to Chatham.  I want to go to Penn State."  And I often laugh, I say I had no idea what it looked like.  I didn't even know really where it was.
Speaker 1: You just heard your classmates talk about it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I heard--
Speaker 1: And their brothers and sisters, and all of that?
Speaker 2: Yes, they had that.  So, I applied to one university, and that's where I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they offer you any money, or any support?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they offered me--but not nearly a full scholarship.
Speaker 1: Then you had the other scholarships from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --the other ones you earned as a student.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah--
Story_ID: 136090
Speaker 1: So, well, so you graduated in '62 [1962].  You started in the fall of '62 [1962] at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, well, what was your first day at Penn State like?  This is in State College, Pennsylvania, in the mountains, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember that they gave me a dink, a little hat to put on your head.
Speaker 1: Now, this is like a freshman beanie or something?
Speaker 2: Yes, this is like a freshman beanie, it's exactly--
Speaker 1: Now, this is something that, I don't think that exists anymore, does it?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  (Laughter).  Students today would not allow that to happen, but we did.  So, we wore this little hat, and it had "Penn State" and the Penn State insignia on it.  It was called a dink, and you wore a sign around your neck.  And depending, the color of your sign indicated your college.  I was in the College of Liberal Arts, and you had to write your name and where you were from on this cardboard sign that you wore.  And I will never forget that my first day this boy came up to me and he said, "Hi, freshman."  And I said, "Hello."  And he said, "I see you're from 'McKansas-port'."  (Laughter).  I said, "I'm from McKeesport [Pennsylvania]."  And then he said, "Naw, that's 'McKansas-port.'"  So, it was a nice experience.  But we only had to do it for a week, and most of us didn't last the whole week.  We found out that nobody would notice if we took it off.  It was too big, and there were too many of us.  I loved going to Penn State.  I was very active in a lot of activities.  I was very active in the Civil Rights Movement.
Story_ID: 136091
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How did the Civil Rights Movement affect the students at--
Speaker 1: How did it work at a mostly white university [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania]?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, up in the mountains at State College [Pennsylvania].  What was the connect there?
Speaker 1: Well, we had an organization.  Ours was called the Student Union for Racial Equality, S.U.R.E..
Speaker 2: Was it somehow connected to CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] in any way?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Student Union--
Speaker 1: For Racial Equality.
Speaker 2: --for Racial Equality, okay.
Speaker 1: SURE, S-U-R-E, Student Union for Racial Equality.  And how interesting our group was.  The year that I was vice-president, the president was white and Jewish, which probably was a little different than a lot of the other schools.  But we had a lot of activities, and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and CORE came to the university at different times to speak.
Speaker 2: Do you remember who from SNCC  or CORE came?  Were they people we would know?
Speaker 1: Stokely Carmichael came one time, I remember that.
Speaker 2: Well, that would have been like when you were a senior or something, or thereabouts?
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Or '65 [1965]?  You know, he reached the zenith of popularity in '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: With black power, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was around '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964], okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 136092
Speaker 1: SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], did SNCC recruit people to go to Mississippi in '64 [1964] to--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a whole other story with my mother [Iona Meriweather Ackron].  They--it would have been my sophomore year, the summer of my sophomore year [at Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], and I wanted to go South to help with the voter registration.
Speaker 1: So, this is '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963] or '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Well, I know the big registration push was in '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Sixty-Three [1963].
Speaker 1: Or was it--
Speaker 2: It was '63 [1963] or... '63 [1963] would have been the end of my freshman year.  So, it was in '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Sixty-two, [1962], '63 [1963], '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Yes, that's right, that's right, okay.
Speaker 2: So, that would have been the end of my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Okay, the end of your sophomore year.  This is the summer--
Speaker 2: Yes, the summer--
Speaker 1: What they call, Freedom Summer.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Of '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: In Mississippi.
Speaker 2: And I thought that was it.  I was going, I was going to register voters.  I was going to really make my mark in the Civil Rights Movement.  So, my mother would call me every Sunday at 4:30.  And so, she called me on a particular Sunday before the week I was coming home.   And I said, "Mom, I'm going to Mississippi to register voters."  There was dead silence.  It seemed to me forever, but probably only a minute.  And then she said, "Your father [James Ackron] will pick you up on Thursday."  And so, he did.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, she just basically dismissed that idea.
Speaker 2: So, Dad came and picked me up and hauled me to McKeesport [Pennsylvania], and I went.  And Saturday morning I was sleeping in, I was going to start to work that Monday.  And the door opened, and my mother walked into the room.  And she said, "Cynthia, you'd better get up, you have work to do."  And I said, "Mom, I don't start to work until Monday."  She said, "I thought you wanted to register voters?"  I said, "Mom, you're going to let me go to Mississippi?"  She said, "No, there are a whole lot of people right here in McKeesport that need to register to vote.  You need to get up and start working on that."  That summer I registered a whole lot of voters in McKeesport; every Saturday I was out.  And I think I learned a lesson from that, even though I really wanted to go to Mississippi.  But the lesson she was trying to teach me is that you don't have to go far to do the same kinds of things.  Because we didn't have a lot of black people who were voting in McKeesport.  A lot of them weren't registered; a lot of them didn't understand what they should be doing.  And that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting.  That's really--
Speaker 2: It is interesting.
Speaker 1: You had a remarkable mother.
Speaker 2: Oh, I did, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was--and she died young, she was only sixty.  She looked forty when she died at sixty.  But she left her mark.
Story_ID: 136093
Speaker 1: So, did you follow kind of, in the news what was going on in Mississippi that summer [1964]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, how could we not follow it?  I mean, we were just devastated with the things that were going on.  And--
Speaker 1: I think it started with the disappearance of [Andrew] Goodman, [Michael] Schwerner, and [James] Chaney, and ended with the Democratic National Convention [1964].
Speaker 2: I think that it impacted on us so much, because the first thing is that young people were involved, and we were doing things.  And people were paying attention to what we were doing.  But nobody ever thought we'd die doing it.  You know, we could talk about it from a philosophical point of view--that we would die for a cause--but we really didn't think we would die for a cause.  I mean that, you know, those two--the reality of dying with the philosophy of which you died for a cause, hadn't meshed in us until that happened.  And then we started thinking, well, wait a minute, this is really serious business, this really is.  And it led to a lot of interesting discussions among my friends and with my parents [Iona Meriweather Ackron and James Ackron].
Speaker 1: Did you see Fannie Lou Hamer's appearance on CBS when she--
Speaker 2: In our house, my mother was the television guide for historical things that were going to occur.  (Laughter).  And I have to say that for as long as I lived at home, I mean, it never occurred to me to say, "I don't think I want to watch that."  I mean we were, it was a family kind of thing, and we had a lot of discussions.  When I met my future husband [Arthur Baldwin] and he came home, that's the one thing he laughed about.  He said, "My God, you all talk about everything, don't you?"  "Yes, we do.  You know, if you're coming to the house, be prepared for conversation.  And don't be shy."
Story_ID: 136094
Speaker 1: Did you meet your future husband [Arthur Baldwin]--
Speaker 2: Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah, you met him at Penn State.  Now, when did you meet and--?
Speaker 2: He came up the, we were on the quarter system.  So he came up, it must have been the first quarter of my sophomore year.  He transferred.  He had started school in California, but his mother had a massive heart attack.  And my husband is the youngest of eight, and he came back home because everybody else was gone.  And he came back and then he started to be closer when he started at Penn State.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where we met.  My husband was in science, the college of science [Eberly College of Science, Pennsylvania State University], a real rarity.  And we met because he was doing very well in science.  He was on the dean's list in science, but he needed some English support.  So the dean of his college who became his mentor, because there were no blacks in the College of Science, called the dean of my college looking for a tutor for him in English.
Story_ID: 136095
Speaker 1: So, you met your husband [Arthur Baldwin] in college [at Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He was a science major.  And you were to be his tutor, right?
Speaker 2: Right, his English tutor.  And we became good friends.  We were both dating other people and, you know, when you meet like that, you don't care what you look--you know, you don't have to put on makeup before you go to tutor.  And you don't say, "Boy, I'd better change from these jeans and put something else on."  And so, we really became friends.  We started to talk, and I can't say that I really liked him when I first--I thought he was a bit arrogant, you know.  And he said that was confidence, and that I had mistaken him.  But the fact is that then we started to talk.  We came from similar backgrounds, and we, it was easy to laugh together and talk about serious subjects.  And so, we did, we became good friends.  And then one day he told me he was in love with me.  And so, we had to think that one through. You're a really good friend, I don't know whether I want to (unclear) and he's still my best friend. He really is still my best friend.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's great, that's great.
Speaker 2: He's a neat guy.
Story_ID: 136096
Speaker 1: So, okay, 1964. Well, we had you at your sophomore year.  So you meet your husband [Arthur Baldwin], and the summer of '64 [1964] rolls by.  Now, what happened in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was a continual thing that we did.  We did a lot of programs at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania].  There were a lot of things that I remember about Penn State that happened when I was at Penn State.  [President] John F. Kennedy was assassinated [1963].  Actually, Penn State was one of the last universities to cancel classes.  So, after the assassination, I actually went to class because I did not cut class.  It was unbelievable.  Again, it was kind of like that event where you say, "This cannot be happening, the President has now been shot."
Speaker 1: Now, that's your freshman year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was your freshman year when--
Speaker 2: It was in, must have been--
Speaker 1: Oh, the beginning of your sophomore year, the beginning of your sophomore year.
Speaker 2: It was in November, it was my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Yes, it was in November.  And the reason I remember that is because they cancelled the Penn State football game.
Speaker 1: Now, that's a big deal at Penn State, in Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: They cancelled the game.  And I was going home for the day, and I went home that weekend anyway because it was, it was just--my mother [Iona Meriweather Ackron] called me, and she was in tears.  She was just, she was just sobbing.  I remember going, I had a humanities class.  It was the last class before I went home, taught by a guy named Ken Williams [ph.].  I have no idea where he is now, because he wasn't a full professor yet, he was working on his doctorate.  And we were all, everybody was crying, everybody was talking about it.  And we were sitting--we go to his class, and we just kind of plopped down in the chairs and turned them around, because he's not there yet.  And when he arrived, he pulled his chair into the circle, instead of going to the podium.  And he started to talk about the sanctity of life, and about what you do with life while you have it, and the impact that you make on others, and whether you fulfill yourself and do the things you want to do.  And then he said, "You know, we're all very, very sad, because we lost the President, the President was killed."  He said, "But a policeman lost his life today."  He said, "Who's thinking about him and his family?"  Of course, [Governor] John Connally was shot, too.  And so, he brought us back to the reality that there were all of these lives that impacted on other people's lives.  And the fact is that, yes, we mourn the loss of those lives, but we have to--and we're very sad because of the way they taken, but we have to think about the positive things that were in their lives.  And then of course, there's '63 [1963] incident.  And we have to pray for their families, because these are families that are going to feel a void, feel a void for a while.  And while we feel a void, it's not nearly like the void that they're going through.  So that was interesting, you know--
Story_ID: 136097
Speaker 1: So--go back even further, though, the March on Washington [1963] was that summer after your freshman year, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you go, or did you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Did not go, I watched it on television, again, with my parents [Iona Meriweather Ackron and James Ackron] and some friends.  We had friends over to watch the March on Washington.  Oh, that was exciting for me.  But, you know, it's funny, because as I think about it, my parents were absolutely wonderful.  But they weren't a traveling family.  And I told you, we didn't own a car.  So, we weren't really the traveling family.  But, yeah, we did watch it, and then talked about it.  We had, I knew some people who had gone, some students who had gone.  And there had been some people from some of the churches who had gone in our area.  But that was, we were spellbound, absolutely spellbound.
Speaker 1: So this is really an exciting time, I guess, to think about activism and social change.  Anyway, I mean things were, it caused people do a lot of reflection.
Speaker 2: And to think about how it occurred.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that, I think that probably was the start of my leaning toward the law.  That, and the fact that my parents read "Brown v. Board of Education" [347 U.S. 483, 1954] at the dinner table.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Did they, really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.  I mean, I knew who Thurgood Marshall was.  And yeah, it was just--so, working within the system to affect change; that change can be affected within the system; and that the laws aren't always against you, and they can be for you.  And you just need people who are able to look at that.  And the interesting part of it was--and I think that's why I still do a lot of Constitutional law; I travel abroad and I do a lot of Constitutional education.  The fact that this document actually can be--this old document can actually be applied to the present--that what people wrote at that time is as applicable now, and that while we don't want to re-write a document, we can look at that document and see how it applies to this time.  I thought that was fascinating.
Story_ID: 136098
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, you majored in English at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, majored in English, minored in education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your goal was, you saw yourself as a teacher when you--
Speaker 2: No, my goal was to go to the [Greenwich] Village [New York, New York] and write the great American novel.  My parents' [Iona Meriweather Acrkon and James Ackron] goal was that I be able to take care of myself.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so, you were, were you engaged in creative writing in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I have probably about three books started now.  One day, I'm going to finish one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my parents were right, that it was really nice to be able to eat and have shelter, and those kinds of things.  But I thought, boy, wouldn't that be a great life, just to go to the Village and--I love jazz--listen to jazz upstairs and downstairs at the Village.  And I thought I'd wander around and write this book that's going to become wildly successful.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had it all figured out?
Speaker 2: I had it all figured out.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Except how I was going to live.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, what were you writing about for the most part?
Speaker 2: Mostly I was writing about what I knew, my life in McKeesport [Pennsylvania] and the people I knew in McKeesport.  And they made really kind of interesting stories.  So, that's what I was going to write about; and poetry, I was going to write poetry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there literary associations at Penn State that you could get involved with?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I also was in University Readers, which was a dramatic reading group.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, I guess around 1965 or so, we had a wave of what we call the Black Arts Movement--poetry and writing.  Now was that, did that affect you?
Speaker 2: [HM] Nikki Giovanni, yeah, I remember her coming to Penn State.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], I guess, in that era.  Nikki Giovanni--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I'm trying to think who else.  Of course, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] came and he spoke at Penn State so that was exciting.
Story_ID: 136099
Speaker 1: So, you were there [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] through '66 [1966] I would guess, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, graduated in June of '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did you graduate with honors, or did you have, did you continue that high academic standard?
Speaker 2: I continued that, and I was in Scrolls, Senior Women's Honorary Society.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you join a sorority when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Yes, Delta.
Speaker 1: Okay, Delta Sigma Theta.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, they were--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: There was a significant--
Speaker 2: I held almost every office in it, because we were on the term system.  And because I had the average, I went over my freshman year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, are there any other stories about Penn State, before we graduate you?
Speaker 2: We can move on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  There are probably a lot of stories about Penn State.
Speaker 1: Well, Penn State, I know--
Speaker 2: But, let's graduate.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I know the first year I started this project we interviewed [HM] Charles Blockson, who went to Penn State.
Speaker 2: Oh, I know Charlie, wow.
Speaker 1: Do you know him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  There are Penn Staters--have you interviewed [HM] Stan Lathan?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the project [The HistoryMakers] did.  I didn't do it, but the project did.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Penn State.
Speaker 1: Stan Lathan, okay.
Speaker 2: He was there at the same time we were.
Speaker 1: And I need to get our director to interview Lenny Moore.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure, I know Lenny.
Speaker 1: He was a great football player, yeah.  They were there ahead of you, I mean--
Speaker 2: They were a year ahead of me.  But the fact is, that I never cut my roots with Penn State.  I was very active in the Alumni Association, I was on the Board of Trustees.  So, I know almost everybody who's gone through, one way or another.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There was a black presence there, you know, way before, even before you got there in terms of--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --students.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Some of the scholarships tell us that.  The scholarship--Margaret--oh, gosh, when did she, I don't know when she graduated.  One of the judges here in Allegheny County, who is now dead, went to Penn State and graduated in '49 [1949].  So, I knew, you know, after I came out and started to meet other people that there was definitely a tradition there.
Speaker 1: Now, the lady [HM Gwendolyn Mitchell] that works with [HM] Haki Madhubuti at The World Press in Chicago [Illinois] right now is a Penn State grad.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: From Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 136100
Speaker 1: But so, now is, well, 1966, now what was going on when you graduated, and what did you decide to do?  What were you going to do next, when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Well, needless to say, I didn't go to the [Greenwich] Village [New York, New York ], and I didn't write that great American novel.  I went to, back to McKeesport [Pennsylvania], applied, and started to teach on the secondary level.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you, were you tempted to go to a bigger city, or to, I mean to go to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], or--
Speaker 2: I never even thought about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never even thought about it.  I knew that I wanted to go back, and I wanted to teach in McKeesport.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wanted to that, I wanted to go to McKeesport.  And of course, by now, I'm engaged [to Arthur Baldwin].  And so, there was a wedding to plan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went back and you taught school in McKeesport?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, you taught at the elementary level, or secondary?
Speaker 2: No, secondary level.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, oh, yeah, you were saying you were the first--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --one of the first--
Speaker 2: On the secondary level in the public schools, the first AfricanAmerican.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You taught at McKeesport High School [later McKeesport Area High School, McKeesport, Pennsylvania] then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I taught at, first I taught at McKeesport Junior High School [McKeesport, Pennsylvania].  And then I taught at Frances McClure [Junior High School, later Primary School, White Oak, Pennsylvania]  We had a series of junior high schools that all fed into the high school.  And I loved teaching, so that was fun.  And I taught from '66 [1966] until '72 [1972].  I had my daughter [Crystal Baldwin] in November of '72 [1972], and then I stayed home for five years.
Speaker 1: When you were still living in McKeesport?
Speaker 2: Really, we lived in towns around--we lived in North Versailles [Pennsylvania] then.  But, stayed home, and when I stayed home I finished my master's, started a library in North Versailles [Pennsylvania] (laughter).
Story_ID: 136101
Speaker 1: You started a library?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about this.  Now, where did you get your master's degree, again?
Speaker 2: I got my master's degree from Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: The library--I'd been used to working and doing things, and now I was staying home.  And my daughter, Crystal [Baldwin], was a toddler.  And we would walk over to the, there was a shopping center close to our house, and we'd walk over to the shopping center.  And they had kind of, a group of women had set up a kind of lending library.  They just put the books out there that--the shopping center had given them some space, and they put some books out.  And people, if you wanted one, you would take a book, and they would want you to bring one back.  And, but there was this much bigger space.  And I thought, well, why not have a library?  So, I met with this group of women, and we developed a plan.  And since I had the time and I had the knowledge of how to set it up, we actually ended up--the shopping mall gave us the space and the shelving; they donated the shelving.  And we bought some books, and then we got a grant, and we started a library, which is still going on.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, is it separate from the municipal, I mean, the city library system or the state library system?
Speaker 2: Well, see, the problem was there was no library in North Versailles [Pennsylvania].  It was a little township, so there was none.  So, they had to go into McKeesport [Pennsylvania] or someplace else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started the North Versailles-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --public library?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You and the ladies--
Speaker 2: And these ladies.  And yeah, I was one of them.  Maybe because I had the time and the expertise, I ended up doing the bulk of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what year was it you got your master's from Penn State?
Speaker 2: I got my master's from Penn State in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay, '74 [1974].
Story_ID: 136102
Speaker 1: Now, so then you taught on the college level, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, where did you teach?
Speaker 2: Penn State [Pennsylvania State Greater Allegheny, McKeesport, Pennsylvania].  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you move back to State College [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No, because there was a Penn State McKeesport campus.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Penn State had twenty-four campuses.
Speaker 1: So, is that where you got your master's, too?  Is that where you got your master's, too, from--
Speaker 2: No, I got that from University Park [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My husband [Arthur Baldwin] and I got married, and we spent our honeymoon at Penn State, and I started my master's.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, you got your master's in literature, right?
Speaker 2: American Literature.
Speaker 1: American Literature.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Any stories about that?  What was your thesis about?
Speaker 2: There is a story about that.  My thesis was on the fiction of W.E.B. Du Bois.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  But I have to tell you that, you had asked me--and very quickly--whether I had any black teachers at McKeesport [High School, McKeesport, Pennsylvania].  And I did not, I had my very first one when I was at Penn State, Dr. [Charles] Charlie Davis, who then went on to teach at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  He was wonderful, and had one of these resonant voices.  He talked like this, he was wonderful.  He also became my advisor.  And, a very quick story.  My senior year--I used to love to go at the beginning of the year to talk to Dr. Davis.  And he'd say, "Cynthia, how was your summer?"  And we'd start this discussion; well, that was every year.  My senior year, I go, and he says, "So, you're going to leave us and graduate."  I said, "Yes."  He says, "They make us check all of your grades."  And he checks, and he turns the page and he walks up, "It appears to me that you are half a credit short in physical education."  I thought to myself, "You're my advisor.  What do you mean, it appears that I'm half a credit short?  Did you sign me up?"  I said, "Really?"  "Yes, oh, we're going to have to do something.  Perhaps you could come back and take."  "No, you don't understand, Dr. Davis, I cannot come back.  My parents [Iona Meriweather Ackron and James Ackron] expect me to graduate in June.  I have to graduate."  So he says, "I will make some telephone calls and see what we can do."  I ended up my senior year taking swimming and diving.  I swim, but never, never dove in my life, and never planned to.  But I figured it was better to receive my degree posthumously because I'd broken my neck diving, than it was to tell my parents I wasn't going to graduate because I didn't have a half a credit of phys ed [physical education] (laughter).  He was a fascinating man, fascinating, but--.
Speaker 1: So, he went on to, you said to Yale?
Speaker 2: Yale.
Speaker 1: Yale, okay.
Speaker 2: Taught--had a very distinguished career at Yale, yeah, had a distinguished career at Penn State, but--.
Speaker 1: Dr. Charles Davis,
Speaker 2: Yes, Dr. Charles--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 136103
Speaker 1: Now, while we jumped forward to '74 [1974], now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were on my master's.  And I thought of him [Dr. Charles Davis] when I thought about W.E.B. Du Bois, because there wasn't an African American professor to oversee this.
Speaker 1: So, when he left, he just left--there was nobody there?
Speaker 2: There were other people, but they weren't in the department.  And so, they had to find someone to oversee my thesis when I decided that I wanted to do this, which to this day I'm trying to figure it out.  Because I ended up reading all the fiction on microfiche, because DuBois wrote so much in The Crisis.  And it was unsigned fiction, so then I had to go through and figure out whether it was his fiction or not, all of those things.  But the person who oversaw it was Dr. Dan Walden.  And Dr. Dan Walden was an expert in Jewish literature, and he volunteered to oversee my thesis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you discover anything surprising about Du Bois' fiction?
Speaker 2: Other than the fact that it was message fiction and it wasn't very good?  (Laughter).  But he was prolific.  But he did get his message across.  The characters were about the same.  The two male characters and the two female characters, and everyone was the same.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I'm not surprised, I just wanted to know.  Okay, so you taught at the Penn State McKeesport campus.  And--
Speaker 2: It's now Greater Allegheny [Pennsylvania State Greater Allegheny, McKeesport, Pennsylvania], but it was McKeesport then, yeah--
Story_ID: 136104
Speaker 1: Now what, what--I don't want to skip past anything, but what prompted you to think about law?  Now, you're doing something--you're teaching about literature, and this is something you've been interested in for a long time, American literature.  What prompted you to, you know, think about becoming a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I had been thinking about it a lot since I had left Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], and especially about the Civil Rights Movement and the cases that were coming out of that.  And my husband [Arthur Baldwin] and I had also started a counseling and tutorial service that we were running in McKeesport [Pennsylvania] for disadvantaged children.  And when we set up a board, a couple of people on the board were lawyers.  There were no African American lawyers, but they were lawyers.  And sometimes I would be arguing with them about things that we needed to do.  And more often than not, they would say, "You should be a lawyer."  And I started to think more about it, and talked to my husband.  And I was going to go right away, and my mother [Iona Meriweather Ackron] was going to watch--in fact, even before I finished my master's degree, I was going to go to law school, and my mother was going to babysit.  But then she died in '74 [1974].  So, I didn't go, and I was still teaching at Penn State [Greater Allegheny, McKeesport, Pennsylvania].  I would have these conversations with my husband, "Well, you know, I'm really thinking I should go to law school, because if I went to law school I could do this and the other."  And finally one day husband says, "If you're going to law school, you'd better go, because you're not getting any younger," (laughter) which was true.  And so, at the age of thirty-two, I went to law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you went to Duquesne University Law School [Duquesne University School of Law] here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was that experience like?  Was it what you expected, in terms of law school?
Speaker 2: I didn't know what to expect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had no idea what to expect.  And it was very difficult coming from one side of the desk to the other side of the desk--coming from the side where you're supposed to know it all, to the side where you know nothing.  And it was--and actually being older in the student body, too.  But it was a fascinating experience, I loved it.  It was a tough experience, with two children and a husband.  My husband was fantastic, and he ended up doing a whole lot of things to help out.  But I absolutely loved it, and did well; it was all law review.  So, it worked out.  But those days got pretty long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Worth it.
Speaker 1: So, when did you get your degree?
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977] I started, and '80 [1980], I got it. Three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136798
Speaker 1: Nineteen-eighty [1980], you complete law school at Duquesne University [School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And now--we were talking off-camera that you went--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --right to Neighborhood Legal Services [Association].
Speaker 2: Right.  I was a "Reggie," that's what they're called, a Reginald Heber Smith Fellow.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He funded this program so that they could be competitive in hiring people in the top of their class to go to Neighborhood Legal Services for a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's what I did.  I was supposed to go and do only housing, but I ended up doing a lot of litigation, and I really enjoyed it.  And after that, I ended up going to the Office of the Attorney General, because they were looking for a litigation lawyer for the Bureau of Consumer Protection.
Speaker 1: Now, the Neighborhood Legal Services advocates for people that can't, you know--
Speaker 2: Poor people.
Speaker 1: Poor people, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what kind of cases did you have to litigate?
Speaker 2: Every kind of case.  You know, domestic abuse cases, equitable-will distributions, divorces--all those family law things, anything that had to do with housing.  And we did foreclosures and evictions, and whatever.  We did, at that time we did everything.  It wasn't until after I left, that legal services was cut back, because they were doing so much discrimination work.  And there were people in Washington [D.C.] who were not happy that they were doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this was during the [Ronald] Reagan years and such, and so a lot of those things were cut back.
Speaker 2: Right.  But when I started, they did, it was a full-service law firm for the poor, for the poor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Something that we--have we gotten back to that today or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, not.
Story_ID: 136799
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you were there until 1983?
Speaker 2: What, legal services?
Speaker 1: Yeah, legal services.
Speaker 2: I was only there one year.
Speaker 1: One year, okay.
Speaker 2: I was a "Reggie."  I was a Reginald Heber Smith fellow.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And then I was supposed to leave and go to a law firm.  But instead of doing that, I went with the Office of Attorney General [Commonwealth of Pennsylvania], because they were looking for someone to do litigation in the Office of Attorney General, Bureau of Consumer Protection.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this would be 1982 when you--
Speaker 2: This would be, let's see, I graduated in '80 [1980], and I started in '81 [1981].  Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, tell us about that experience with the Attorney General's Office.
Speaker 2: Well, I was there for a good while.  I stayed with the Office of Attorney General for six years, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the fact is, is that it was a wonderful experience.  I went in because one of the attorneys was leaving.  And I was there only a few months when another attorney left.  And they were basically the litigation attorneys, so the more senior attorney that was in the office wasn't really a litigation attorney, and I was a litigation attorney.  And then they were looking for someone to head up the office.  And by the time, by that time, I had been there for about a year or a year and a half, and they were looking for somebody to head up the office.  And I was running the office, because then the person who wasn't the litigation attorney left to go into bankruptcy work.  And so they were interviewing people, and people were coming to the office, and I was showing them around.  And finally I said to them, "I'd like to be interviewed for the position.  After all, I'm doing the position.  And if somebody else comes, I have to train them to do what I'm doing."  And so, that's what happened.  They interviewed me, and I became the attorney in charge of the office.  And that was in '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, all right, that's about a year after you started?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you were there for six years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that takes us to 19--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took a leave of absence I think in '85 [1985], '86 [1986].  It should be in my resume, but it should be, I think it's '85 [1985], '86 [1986].  And I taught at Duquesne [University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] as a visiting professor.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you had a leave of absence.  So, you didn't do them both at the same time?
Speaker 2: No, I took a leave.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 136800
Speaker 1: Now, are there any, what are some of the--can you--are there some highlight cases of your stint in the attorney general's?
Speaker 2: Those were interesting days in the Office of the Attorney General.  As I said, it hadn't been a litigation office, and they had a special litigation team that was litigating all the cases.  Now, this is really going to date me, because some of the big cases then were the odometer rollback cases.  We were doing, those were huge cases because people--Pennsylvania has a lot of auto auctions.  And people were rolling back the odometers and selling them at the auto auctions, and people were getting cars that were falling apart thinking they only had a few miles, and somebody had spun the odometer.  So, and there were people--these were big rings that were doing it.  And there were also rent-to-own cases.  Those were the stores that you can go in and you rent something, and you end up paying for it fifteen times before you, you know, while you're renting it.  (Laughter).  And then they want to sell it to you for a little bit more.  So, that was, that was a big business, too.  I also was there when we were passing our lemon law, the automobile lemon law.  We did a lot of those cases, a lot of--you know, you do huge cases and you do little cases.  You do all of the home improvement cases, you do the credit card cases, you do all those, and you do everything else.  But the litigation cases at that time, the ones that were really hot, were those, those first three that I mentioned.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 136801
Speaker 1: Now, in '87 [1987], well, I guess in '86 [1986] I guess, you decided to run for office?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, how did that come about?  What gave you the idea to run for judge?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm trying to think about the dates here.  What happened is that Governor [Richard Lewis "Dick"] Thornburgh appointed Doris Smith [-Ribner], an African American woman, to the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County [Pennsylvania].  And she served for a year or a little under a year.  Anyway, it had always been that if you got an appointment from the governor and you ran, you won.  I mean, that was just it, because-- But she ran and she lost.  And there were a number of articles talking about an African American woman couldn't be elected, and was an African American woman electable in Allegheny County, those kinds of things.  And I had worked on Doris' campaign.  By the way, she ran the next time statewide, and won.  She's now sitting on the Commonwealth Court.  But I said to my husband [Arthur Baldwin], "I think I'd really like to try this.  I'd like to run.  I have the litigation background, you know, I have the administrative skills.  I think I'd like to do this."  Neither of us had any idea what we were getting into.  Needless to say, I hadn't even run for office when I was in high school, so I had no idea what it was like.  And, but we built up a grassroots campaign, literally.  And my husband said something that made a lot of sense, because we had never raised money--we didn't even know--we were reading all the rules and trying to do everything right.  And our friends were, of course, coming behind us and doing all of these kinds of things.  And, but he said, "You know what?  We invest in everybody else.  You know, if somebody's running and we think they're a good candidate, we put money into their campaign.  If we can't invest in you, then we're pretty poor."  You know, so we did.  We invested in the campaign and ran a low budget campaign.  It was a very difficult campaign.  I ended up--you can cross-file, and I ended up winning on the Republican ticket and losing on the Democratic ticket.  And then, of course, the Democrats said, "Well, of course, you're going to drop out of the race."  And I said, "No."  To me, it's a commitment.  If you put your name on the ballot, you don't say "If I lose on your ballot, I'm not running."  I said, "I don't think that's fair to the people who are voting for you.  So, I'm going to run, and they will know that I'm a Democrat, but I'm going to run on that ticket."  Well, it made some of the "powers that be" in the Democrat Party upset.  And anyway, to make a long story short, I came in third.  Unfortunately, there were two seats, so I lost in '87 [1987].  But I never stopped, I continued to run.  And they told me, "You're never going to get the endorsement from the Democrats now.  You've ruined your career and, tough."   I ended up getting the endorsement of the Democratic Party.  I ran and won.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you won in what?
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-nine [1989], okay.
Story_ID: 136802
Speaker 1: So well, tell us about being a judge.  You were the judge, the first elected African American female judge to the Allegheny Court of Common Pleas [Allegheny County, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's a mouthful (laughter).  I loved being a judge.  I absolutely loved being a judge.  I thought that, I really thought that I could make a difference on the court, and I think that I did make a difference.  It's very hard work.  You have to remember that you are a servant of the people, that's exactly what you do.  And I did.  I served in family court, I served in civil court, I served in juvenile court.  And I really think that I got a reputation of being fair, of listening, without trying to try the lawyer's cases.  So, it was a very good experience.  And I think I got an excellent reputation, and that's probably why I was nominated by the governor [Ed Rendell] for the Supreme Court [of Pennsylvania] when there was a vacancy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there, now, is there is training for judges when you get--you know, everybody's been to law school, but is there a training, special training for judges?
Speaker 2: Well, the fact is, that's why they want experienced people to run.  That is your training, so that's what I did.  I tried cases for all of these years, so I'd been trying cases for almost ten years.  And that's wonderful training.  You do get, you go to school for a week with, they call it--we call it "the baby judges school" (laughter) where they talk about the kinds of things that you're going to have to do as a judge, and how you should be--your demeanor, and those kinds of things.  But it really is wonderful when you have somebody that has the experience of practicing law who goes on to the bench.
Story_ID: 136803
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, so you dealt with a lot of different--
Speaker 2: A lot of different kinds of cases.
Speaker 1: --kinds of cases, okay.  From my outline it says that in 1990, you were a gubernatorial appointee to the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency.
Speaker 2: I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were appointed by, is that Tom Ridge who was the governor then?
Speaker 2: I was appointed by the governor then [Robert P. Casey].  And yeah, I guess he would have been the governor.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, yeah, okay.  No, was that him then?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not sure.  Now I'm not sure, because he [Tom Ridge] was governor in 9/11 [September 11], that's 2001.  So, maybe not in '90 [1990]--
Speaker 2: He was the governor before then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Because Mark [Schweiker], Mark came after Ridge.  And then Rendell.  [Dick] Thornburgh, who was the governor between Thornburgh and Ridge?  Had to be--
Speaker 1: I guess a better question is, though, like, what were some of the--can you give us examples of some of the cases?  What was the most remarkable case that came before you during that period of time?
Speaker 2: You know what, I've been asked that question a lot.  And I keep telling people that each case that comes before you is remarkable for some reason.  There are a lot of cases that was upheld on appeal, and they became precedential.  And those cases ranged from equitable distribution cases, and divorce cases, to product liability cases.  There were all kinds of cases that came up.  And it's interesting, because people--you know how important the case is by how many people read the case.  And they keep statistics on those kinds of things.   So, but there were very, there were a variety of cases that I had opinions that people--the last case that was extremely popular with people actually had to do with the dog law.  I mean, so you never know what's important, or why people think it's important.  And, but, what do I think?  I think that serving in the family division is extremely difficult.  We have a judge here in Allegheny County [Pennsylvania] that likes to say that the family division is the real criminal division.  And that may be true with those kinds of things that, you know, that happen.  And it's so emotional, and it deals with, you know, it deals with what's really important to people, and not the least, of course, their children.  So, serving in the family division can be very difficult, and I think that's extremely important.  Now, the sexy division for most people is the criminal, I mean, is the civil division.  Because that's where the products liability, the criminal cases, the injunctions--all of those things happen, and I love doing that, too.  I never served in the criminal division, although I served in the juvenile division and did delinquency, which is criminal.  But a lot of people will tell you that in the criminal division, most of the time, people are trying to plead, you know.  There's trying to get less time.  So, it never appealed to me to serve in that division.  But every division I served, I absolutely loved it, and I thought each case was important.
Story_ID: 136804
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now there comes a time in 1994 when you were chosen as a Fulbright Scholar.  And this started a series of overseas junkets, or I shouldn't say junkets--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were, believe me, there were no junkets.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  During this period of time--
Speaker 2: I would have loved the junkets.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I guess during a four-year stretch, you ended up going to the University of Zimbabwe [Harare, Zimbabwe], Malawi, Uganda, Tanzania, and mainland China.  So, tell us about that period.
Speaker 2: How that got started, well, the first thing is very interesting.  When I had been an academe, I had an opportunity to be a Fulbright, and started the process.  But when my mother [Iona Meriweather Ackron] died, I stopped that process.  So, I was actually teaching at Duquesne [University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and I was asked by another division if I would consider applying for a Fulbright.  And I said, "You do understand that I'm sitting on the bench.  I could apply for a Fulbright, but I don't know whether I'd ever be able to take advantage of it."  And so, I wrote a letter to the Chief Justice saying I'd been asked to apply for a Fulbright, and may I go through this process?  Because we do not have any sabbaticals on the court, we don't have any leaves of absence.  So, the Chief said, "Go ahead and apply, it sounds like a good thing."  So, I applied.  I now wonder if anybody thought that I'd get the Fulbright.  Because after I applied for the Fulbright and I got it--and three countries were in it.  They'd go through a bidding process to try and get you.  I wrote another letter saying I got the Fulbright.  And then of course, the court had to come together and vote on what they were going to do, and how they were going to do this, because I couldn't go traipsing off.  What are they going to say to everybody else, you know, when they're saying there are no sabbaticals and no leaves?  And finally, what they said is that I could take the Fulbright, and I could use all my vacation.  I hadn't used a lot of vacation on the bench, so I had a lot left.  And usually the Fulbright is four months, and I had to ask that it be reduced to three months.  And off I went to Zimbabwe.  And then I still had to do all of my cases.  So I had to write all of my opinions, and get them back from Zimbabwe.  So, it wasn't a leave.
Story_ID: 136805
Speaker 1: It was a wonderful experience. I taught at the University of Zimbabwe [Harare, Zimbabwe] faculty.  I worked with the supreme court there [Supreme Court of Zimbabwe] on issues dealing with due process and land re-distribution.  I wrote law articles--
Speaker 2: Now, that's the big issue there, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Land redistribution.
Speaker 1: [Robert] Mugabe didn't like my articles, he didn't, so--
Speaker 2: So what was, now what was he, what position was he taking then?  I mean--
Speaker 1: He had just started.  It was fourteen years after the Lancaster House Constitution [sic, Lancaster House Agreement].  Remember, the Lancaster House Constitution was a compromise constitution after the revolution.  So, he had promised the war veterans that they would get land.  Now, it was fourteen years later, and the war veterans were extremely impatient about getting the land.  And they said, "If we don't get the land, Mugabe's out.  We're tired of waiting for the land."  Well, what the war veterans did not know is that Mugabe had big money from the United States and Great Britain to buy land to give to the war veterans.  But he bought the land and gave it to his cronies.  So, now, he had no money and he had no land.  So, he goes back to the United States and Great Britain and says, "I need some money to buy some land for the war veterans."  And they go, "Didn't we give you money to buy land for the war veterans?"  He goes, "Yeah, but that land is gone."  And they say "Sorry, no money here."  So, the war veterans are really getting upset, and that's when he starts saying, "Well, I'll just take some land and give it to them."  And it didn't work.  So it led to a lot of problems, and that's what evolved.  I was there at the beginning of that, and so I was writing articles that basically said, "Yes, it was wrong for people to come in, for the whites to come in and take the land.  That's wrong, there's no doubt about it.  It was not their land, it was your land.  However, you have a constitution now, and the rule of law has to be supreme.  You have to follow the rule of law, and there are ways you can do this, but that's not one of the ways.  You just can't do--you have to give them a day in court.  You have to give them due process.  If you're going to use eminent domain, you're going to have to give them money for the land.  You have to do something.  But you just can't say, "It's now my land, goodbye."  So, it was a very, very interesting time.  The court that I worked with there, Mugabe got rid of all of them, there were five people.  It was probably the most representative court I've ever seen in my life.  There were two indigenous Zimbabweans, there were two white Zimbabweans, and there was an Indian Zimbabwean.  It was a fabulous courtroom.  They were all bright, bright people.  He got rid of all of them.  He got people who would do what he wanted them to do.
Speaker 2: Now, when you say got rid of--now, you know what could happen--
Speaker 1: He forced them into, he forced some of them into retirement, and he forced some of them into resigning.
Speaker 2: Okay, but they stayed alive.
Speaker 1: Right, they stayed alive.  But you have to remember, in Zimbabwe, once he did that, they lost their house, they lost their car.  That's all government.  They lost their house, they lost their car, they lost all their protection.  You know, they had soldiers to--so, they lost a lot.
Speaker 2: And our judges, who are cast back into the general population without any protection or resources are--
Speaker 1: Not a good thing.  And not only that, then inflation.  Now, they have hyper-inflation.  And so their retirement, their pension isn't worth anything.  So, they can't even leave the country, because if it's not worth anything in Zimbabwe, what's it going to be worth someplace else?
Speaker 2: So, you were there for like three months?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, I kept in touch with all of them, and continue to keep in touch.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm starting to work on a project.  I'm working on a white paper in Uganda on anti-corruption with the Brookings Institution [Washington, D.C.], which came from that experience too.  So, I still do a lot of constitutional work with them--
Story_ID: 136806
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in '95 [1995] you were on a team sponsored by the American Bar Association, right?
Speaker 2: To go to--. Yeah.
Speaker 1: To go to-
Speaker 2: Malawi.
Speaker 1: Malawi, Uganda--
Speaker 2: Tanzania, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Malawi, Uganda, and Tanzania. And so, how long was that trip?
Speaker 2: That trip was a short trip.  I think it was about three weeks.  And we met with the judiciary in all of those places.  And we did a lot of, basically, we were a teaching team for the judiciary, talking about case management, and about conducting trials, and, you know, some substantive types of things about--constitutional issues.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136807
Speaker 1: And in '98 [1998], you went to--
Speaker 2: I went to China.
Speaker 1: Mainland China.  And was that similar--
Speaker 2: That was under the Bill Clinton Rule of Law project [the Presidential Rule of Law Initiative].  Remember when [President] Bill Clinton was talking about, you know, we're going to send people to talk about the rule of law, and China wants to do this rule of law project.  I was in the, I think in the first group of lawyers, of judges that were sent over.  And I was the only trial judge, the only state trial judge.  They were all federal judges.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a fascinating encounter, too.  And it's interesting, because I think we learned a lot in that project.  Some of the judges thought that we were going to just take U.S. democracy and plop it down in China, forgetting that China, China has such a tradition.  China is so old, and we're a young pup of a country.  And here we're going, "Yeah, we know it all, we're going to teach you."  And they're going, "Excuse me.  When you didn't even have a country, we were civilized and we were doing these kinds of things."  And so, I think what we learned from that project is that there are different ways that you can package things to help people.  But you can't wholesale the United States' tradition of government.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how long were you there in China?
Speaker 2: I think the China trip was two weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136808
Speaker 1: Okay, well during this period of time you started working closely with Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] on the Board of Trustees, right?
Speaker 2: I was appointed to the board 1995.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1995, okay.
Speaker 2: That was by [Tom] Ridge.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was Tom Ridge?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you eventually became the chair of the board?
Speaker 2: I became the, yes, I became the vice-chair of the board in 2001, and the chair of the board in 2004.  And in 2007 I became the immediate past chair, which is actually a position, and that will last until 2010.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were, now were you the first African American to serve in that position?
Speaker 2: I was not the first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jesse Arnelle was the first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jesse was an All-American football player and basketball player.  Jesse must be in his late seventies now.  Yeah, but he was the first.  And I was not the first woman.  Mimi Fredman was the first woman.
Speaker 1: But you were the first black woman?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were there any, what were--were there any outstanding issues that you remember that you had to deal with as Chair?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a baptism by fire.  We had merged with Dickinson Law School [Carlisle, Pennsylvania], I think, in '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Is that Colliers Dickinson?
Speaker 2: No, Dickinson.
Speaker 1: Oh, the Dickinsons, just Dickinson.
Speaker 2: Just Dickinson.
Speaker 1: Dickinson, okay.
Speaker 2: Dickinson Law School.  It's in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  It had been a part of Dickinson College, but that had been dissolved a long, long time ago.  So, we had merged with Dickinson Law School.  And there was just an uproar about whether Penn State was going to close the Dickinson campus and was going to move it to University Park [State College, Pennsylvania], or what was happening there.  And it was, it became a political issue.  I mean, people stopped talking over this issue, over what they were thought was going to happen.  And finally when it was resolved, we actually we were the Dickinson Law School, but we have two campuses, one in Carlisle and one at University Park.  And so, but that took a lot of time and energy resolving that issue.
Story_ID: 136809
Speaker 1: Okay.  And in 2005, you were nominated for the Pennsylvania supreme court [Supreme Court of Pennsylvania] by Governor Edward Rendell.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, did this come as a surprise?  Did you know, did you see that coming?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  No, I didn't see it coming.  It was wonderful, it really was.  The whole--it was interesting that it came about, because a judge was not retained in the election, and that just didn't happen.  But now we had this vacancy on the Supreme Court, and the governor had to fill that vacancy.  And of course, everybody in the world who'd ever thought that they wanted to be on the Supreme Court put their hat in the ring.  I, for one, had never wanted to run for the Supreme Court.  I loved being on the trial level.  But then again, I'm no dummy.  (Laughter).  You know, if you're going to be offered a Supreme Court seat, it's smart to take it.  And the fact is that I was, I was thrilled that my name was being mentioned.  I mean, I think that in itself is an honor.  The fact that the governor actually appointed me was fabulous, it really was.  And serving on the Supreme Court for the two years that I did, it was just an honor to do.  And then I had an opportunity to stay on the Supreme Court, because the Chief Justice retired at the time that I was leaving.  But I had already thought about my life plan, and I wanted to, I wanted several things.  I wanted to get my voice back.  If you're a really good judge, you have no voice if you're on-- because it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.  What I'm doing is enforcing the law and interpreting the law.  And I always use this example:  Everybody wants to know if I'm for or against abortion, and for or against the death penalty.  And I would say, what difference does it make?  I raised my right hand, and I swore that I'm going to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States of the America and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The legislature passes laws.  The legislature says the death penalty is the law in Pennsylvania.  I get on the bench.  Who am I as a judge to say, "You know what, I don't think I agree with that.  I'm going to do this."  We then lose the rule of law.  What if every judge decided to do what the judge wanted to do?  And the people don't seem to understand that.  And they always ask you, you know, "What do you believe?" as if your belief is going to come out of that.  If you're electing judges whose belief is going to come out, then you need not to elect those judges, because that's not the way that it runs.  And so, the fact is, is that I think that at this point, I wanted to get my voice back; I wanted to be able to speak out on issues.  There were a lot of things happening with young people that I want to speak out on, and I think that this is important.  Now people, people forget that I couldn't go to a political rally for almost twenty years.  I couldn't ask my best friend to give to my favorite charity.  I mean, those are all things you cannot do as a judge.  You can't serve on a corporate board.  So, I wanted to do some of those things, and I decided that this was a great transition in order to do that.
Speaker 1: You hear all the time that judges use their position to influence the interpretation of the law to actually change--
Speaker 2: Activist judges, is what they say.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, this judge is interpreting it this way.  And to me, what people mean by an activist judge is a judge who decides in a way you don't want them to decide.  That's basically what it is, and it doesn't matter which side it comes down on, conservative or liberal.  If you don't like the decision, that's an activist judge.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, after--what was the biggest--
Speaker 2: You know what Sandra Day O'Connor said about activist judges.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: She said, "I thought an activist judge was one that got up each morning and went to the office."  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 136810
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what was the most significant case, or what was a significant case that came before the--because I know they're all significant.
Speaker 2: The pay raise case.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't know whether you all have heard about this.  But here in Pennsylvania, what happened is that the judges had not had a raise for ten years.  The legislature said, okay, we're going to give the judges a raise.  So, that's fabulous, we're all excited, we're going to get a raise.  Well, they decide to give us a raise, but also in that midnight hour they decide to give themselves a raise.  The next morning when people started reading in the paper that the legislators--and it was a big raise--the legislators and the judges got a raise--people go wild.  They say, "Not against us?"  They say, "Oh, yeah, the judges should have a raise.  But the legislators, they don't need a raise.  They have this large legislature, and they get a raise almost every other year.  We don't want them to have a raise."  Oh, they went wild, so wild that the legislators were afraid that they would not be re-elected, and so they rescinded their raise, and they rescinded our raise.  And fortunately, our constitution says, just like the U.S. Constitution, that once you give something to judges, you can't take it away, because that's a way to put pressure to bear on judges to do what you want them.  So, let's say, you know, if you wanted them to interpret the law a certain way, and they didn't do it, you then take away their money.  So, and then the case comes to us, and of course, we decide.  "You gave yours back, and that's fine, but you can't take ours away."  So, that was a very big case.  Also, the gaming cases.  You know, Pennsylvania now has gaming.  And everybody sued, every person who bid for a license sued.  So, those were big cases.  There's always big cases in the Supreme Court [of Pennsylvania], because we're the court of final jurisdiction.
Story_ID: 136811
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you served into 2008, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And now, that's the present year.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what did you do when your time was up?
Speaker 2: In January, I retired from the bench because I had the time in.  If you have the right amount of time in, you can retire, whatever your age is.  Because in Pennsylvania, you stay on the bench until you're seventy-eight, okay.  And so I had the time in, and so I retired from the bench.  And I was going to do those things I told you about.  I started to serve on a corporate board, I started to speak out on issues, and I was having a good time.  And then several law firms starting contacting me and asking me if I would be interested in being a partner with the firm.  And at first I wasn't interested, and I really didn't know a lot about Duane Morris [LLP].  I started to read up on them, we started to talk, and finally I agreed to become a partner at Duane Morris, because it had the culture that I liked.  And I will tell you that, you know, I'm a person who loves tradition and change.  Sometimes together they can get pretty radical.  But the fact is that I thought The Supreme Court [of Pennsylvania] was the right place for me, because we have the oldest Supreme Court in the nation, older than the U.S. Supreme Court.  And starting really somewhere around--
Speaker 1: So, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is older than the U.S. Supreme Court?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it started here.  And so, probably, I think 1726 [sic, 1722] was when we started.  But in all of that time, we had two other women who were appointed, and one who was elected before me in all of that time, and only one other African American.  That's a long time, when you start to think about that.  And then of course, one African American male became Chief Justice, Robert Nix [Jr.].  But that to me is pretty awesome, and I am hoping that we can change that record rapidly enough, and have a more diverse group.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, what do you do with Duane Morris?
Speaker 2: I do appellate and trial consultation, and needless to say, I have an expertise in both of those.  So, I, you know, I look at the cases and review cases and see what the chances are on an appeal, or what the chances are at trial, or what issues should be preserved on the trial level in order to get an appeal, all of those kinds of things.  And on the other hand, I do non-profit governance, which I also have an expertise in.  And those are the two things that I do mainly here.
Story_ID: 136812
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I think it is extremely important, extremely important, for us to decide that our young people are important enough for us to do whatever it is that we can in order to put them on the right track.  And when I say the right track, I don't mean on our track; I mean to make sure that we have people who are going to be able to carry on a proud tradition in the African American community.  It is unbelievable how many cities are talking about the numbers of young people that have been killed; it's unbelievable when you sit down and talk to young people.  And I actually talked to a young man, and I said to him, "You know, what do you think you're going to be doing at twenty-one?  He said, "I hope I'm alive at twenty-one, because I just lost two friends who'd been shot."  That's not the way that we want to go.  We'd better figure out what kind of investment we're going to make in our young people.  So I think that's extremely important.  And not only that, if we don't make investments, what's going to happen to the rest of us?  You know, we don't think in terms that we don't make those connections.  But when I retire, I expect that there are going to be people who will run cities and can run those non-profit organizations, and who teach school, and who do all of those kinds of things, you know, down to making sure that the cities have services.  At the rate we're going, who's going to do that?  We don't have, we have people not only dropping out of school very young, but we have people who are deciding that education is just not important to them.  And so, we're going to go back to a time where we're going to have people who just can't read and write, and we're going to have a lot of people who can't do that.  And so, I believe strongly that's part of that voice thing I'm talking about.  I really want to be a part of that, and to say to our young people that we care enough about it.  We always say, "What happened to our young people?"  We happened to them, that's what happened.  (Laughter).  I mean, we're the generation before.  So the fact is that we have to do something about that.  I think that it is imperative for us to start to make sure that we are all mainstream.  That is, sometimes we box ourselves in.  Look at the excitement over [HM Barack] Obama.  It's 2008.  Why are we so excited?  I mean, shouldn't we be running for president?  Shouldn't people run--people of color have run before?  We need to get out of that kind of, "I'm excited if a person of another race runs," whether it be Native American or Asian, or whatever.  Somebody told me that we're all Americans.  So, to me, it doesn't matter what the package is, it matters what's inside the package.  So, you know, I think we really need to encourage everybody to start to think in those terms, that we need the best people we can get.  Honestly, I couldn't care if they're purple, pink, or polka dots.  We need to get good people into the positions, so that they can do the types of things they need to do.  And that goes back to the fact that we have to excite our young people, all of them, whether they be poor,  whether they be black, or Native American, or whether they be Asian, whether they be Hispanic.  We need to excite all of them about educating themselves and doing the kinds of things they should.  And when I say educating themselves, I don't mean we need to tell everybody to go to college and do this.  No, but we're going to run out of artisans and artists.  And people who are, people who can make beautiful music may not want to teach music, just enough to play.  But we don't excite them about doing these kinds of things.  And we don't teach them the diversity of music.  It's funny when I hear people talking about what rap music has done to our young people.  Because our parents said the same thing about music was going to do to us.  But there has to be something else.  There's not just the music, it's the lack of something else.  It's a lack of what else they're doing.  So, I want to be a part of that discussion; I want to be a part of that change.  And I'm very excited about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136813
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I am--I am truly, truly blessed.  And I've had, and I'm having a terrific life.  And I really honestly think that maybe that's a part of attitude, too.  Because sure, there are probably some things that didn't turn out just as I wanted them to.  But when I weigh them, I'm not worried.  I think that I've really had a terrific, have a terrific life.  And that's, I think that's a matter of attitude.  And I--we really have to look at our attitude and the way that we approach things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136814
Speaker 1: Well, looking back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, along with my husband [Arthur Baldwin], I've raised two pretty special children who I think will be positive in this world.  I believe that not only have I enjoyed my profession, but I've made some small impact in showing people that judges can have integrity, can be human, and can do the job that they're elected to do.  I think that's extremely important.  And I think that I've shown a commitment to the law, of legislative law, and the Constitution, and that will make people at least discuss and perhaps want to emulate the fact that it's that important, so that we'll have more lawyers who care about what they're doing.
Story_ID: 136815
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us a little bit about your family.  You've got two children?
Speaker 2: Two children.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I have a husband [Arthur Baldwin] and two children [James Baldwin and Crystal Baldwin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of them are terrific, and I'm not biased in the least (laughter).  My husband is one of the smartest men I know.  He's a scientist, he's in fossil fuels.  So, as he says, he's in again.  (Laughter).  He knows, he deals with all kinds of projects, including clean coal, and anything that has to do with fossil fuel.  And he deals with the environmental side of it, too.  And he's a senior executive at the National Energy Technology Laboratory.  My son, James [Ackron Baldwin], is a corporate lawyer with [Squire] Patton Boggs in Washington, D.C.  And he deals with projects that have numbers larger than anything I ever thought my clients would bring to me.  But that's what he does in the corporate world, and he loves what he does there.  And as I said, he's getting married October 25th.  Our daughter, Crystal [Baldwin], is an executive chef at Gannon University in Erie [Pennsylvania].  She also has her own business, The Chef is In.  She's a personal chef, and she does a lot of high end stuff, you know, seven course wine dinners and things like that.  And the most important thing is that all three of them are the same way.  They're very involved in the community, very involved in the church, really believe him to whom much is given, much is required.
Story_ID: 136816
Speaker 1: Now, what about your future plans?  Are you going to write that novel now?
Speaker 2: I am, I'm going to finish it.  I'm going to finish it (laughter).  And it's been lying around for a while, so I think it's about time to finish it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, is there anything else we need to ask about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of.  I think I've talked more about myself today than I have in ages.  And it'll be ages before I do it again (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, that's good, that's good.
Story_ID: 136817
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That really is a difficult question, because I'm really busy living in the present.  And I'm hoping that I'm living my life in such a way that people will remember me in whatever way they think I impacted on their lives.  So, it's very difficult; I never think about how I want to be remembered.  I'd like to be remembered, but some people may remember me because they had a case in front of me, and they think that I was very fair on it.  And, but, I wouldn't say that's how I want people to remember me, just as a fair judge.  Some people may remember me because I'm, I went on a mission trip and helped build a house in Guyana.  Some people may remember me because I did something in constitutional education.  Some people may remember me because I cooked a good meal.  But it's just nice to be remembered in a positive way, from doing good in your life, something good.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.
Story_ID: 134666
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead and give us a description for the first photo when you're ready.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's my daughter [Crystal Baldwin] and me.  I am on the left, she is on the right.  And she has on her chef whites.  And she is visiting me at my office before I went on The Supreme Court [of Pennsylvania].  This is my Court of Common Pleas office.  And so, that has to be probably somewhere around 2003, 2004.
Speaker 1: Very good, next.  Well, this is what we do.  Just read through them one at a time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's my husband [Arthur Baldwin] and me.  And I think the guy in the middle is a little familiar, he's former President Bill Clinton.  And that's when he was visiting Penn State at University Park [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania].  And that was sometime around 2002, 2003.
Speaker 1: Good, next.
Speaker 2: That picture was taken in Zimbabwe.  It was at Chief Justice Anthony Gubbay's house, and he is the person who is on the far right.  Another one of the justices, and I forget his name, is on the left, and I am in the middle.  And that's when I was in Zimbabwe in 1994 working with the court.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That is a great picture of judges from the continent [of Africa].  And I believe these judges are all from--I forget, but it's not Malawi.  This is at the International Association of Women Judges Conference.  And this is the one that was in Sydney, Australia in 2006.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is at the luncheon celebrating my being sworn into The Supreme Court [of Pennsylvania]--onto the Supreme Court.  And these are the people who are there for the luncheon.  And this is a lady who's a friend of my family for a lot of years.  And that's her family.  And that's a member of the sheriff's department, he's there as protection.
Speaker 1: Good, next.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my husband and I in our best bib and tucker, and we're at a formal affair.  And I'm trying to figure out what that affair is for.  Oh, yes, it was for--Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] was celebrating its 250th anniversary, and that was the affair.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a picture with me and Kim Campbell, who, I'm trying to think of what her title is but--Canada, I think she was a high official in Canada [former Prime Minister].

Speaker 1: In 19--
Speaker 2: That was in 1966.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And those are the Supreme Court justices.  And that is the gift that I gave all the members of the Supreme Court when I left.  And that is a caricature of all of the members of this great court.  And that was in, really it was in 2007; it was in December of that year.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.

Speaker 1: Okay, carry on.
Speaker 2: That's my father [James Alexander Ackron], and that picture was taken probably in the 1980s, late 1980s.  And those pictures, those smaller pictures, are Polaroid pictures taken of him.  And that's my dad probably when my mom met him.  That's his I.D. card from National Tube [Works].
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Those are my in-laws.  That is Clifford Baldwin and Precious Baldwin.  And that's about the same time period as my dad's picture.
Speaker 1: Okay, got it, next.
Speaker 2: I am a big jazz fan.  That's Herbie Mann, and that is his wife [Susan Janeal Arison].  And that's my husband and me, my husband and me on the left.  And Herbie Mann and his wife are on the right.  And that picture was probably taken about a year before his death.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
