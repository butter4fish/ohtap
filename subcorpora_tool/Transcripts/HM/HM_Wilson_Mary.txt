Speaker 1: We do what are called live oral history interviews.  So, my name is Julieanna Richardson and I'm the interviewer; and Matthew Hickey is the videographer; and Turkessa Ferrer [Wilson's daughter, Turkessa Ferrer Babich] is the observer. And I'd like to have you start out by stating your name for us and spelling it?
Speaker 2: Sure, I'm [HistoryMaker] Mary Wilson, spelling it (laughter).  Let me start over again.  Who am I (laughter), I'm Mary Wilson and the spelling is M-A-R-Y, W-I-L-S-O-N, and I like to be called Ms. Wilson.
Speaker 1: Yes, Ms. Wilson (laughter), and I'd like to have your date of birth and today's date?
Speaker 2: It's March 6, 1944, I am a Pisces and today's date is November 24, 2013.
Speaker 1: And our location?
Speaker 2: We are at, in--excuse now, I don't normally give my home address.
Speaker 1: You don't have to, you can just say Las Vegas.
Speaker 2: Okay, yes, this is Las Vegas, Nevada and I actually live in Henderson.
Speaker 1: Okay, Henderson. It's Henderson, Nevada.
Speaker 2: And your occupation?
Speaker 1: I'm a performer, an author, I am somewhat of an actress (laughter), but basically, I'm a performer, singer, recording artist.
Speaker 2: And I wanna tell you that I loved your book.
Speaker 1: Oh, thank you.
Speaker 2: I loved your book, it's very well done.
Speaker 1: I actually have two books.
Speaker 2: You do?
'Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme' [Mary Wilson] is number one, and the second one was 'Supreme Faith: Someday We'll Be Together' [Mary Wilson and Patricia Romanowski]. So, 'Supreme Faith' is not as well known because that was the time of the, the war [Gulf War].   Was it the, the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the, the Iraq war?
Speaker 1: I keep wanting to say the quiet storm [Operation Desert Storm], it's not the quiet storm, it's in the '90s [1990].  So, it was kind of overlooked because the war took over all the media and whatever and so there was not a lot known about the second book, but it was like--the second book 'Supreme Faith' is more about what happened after The Supremes disbanded.
Speaker 2: Oh, good, okay.
Speaker 1: Basically, it's about me (laughter), you know it's more about me than The Supremes.
Speaker 2: Okay, I think, I think--I mean that's what we're here to get, but I think that it was a very good history book, you know for (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, you know they say that we need to write our own history and I started taking, writing diaries when I was in high school [Northeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan] and I, so I documented almost everything that we did and so I started actually keeping The Supremes' history before you know anyone really started writing their own biographies; and I'm very proud of that fact.
Speaker 2: No, I mean it's, it's very well written.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I want to thank you for that.
Story_ID: 647559
Speaker 1: So, we're gonna start with five People magazine-ish questions.  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food, gee, my favorite food more than likely would be Japanese food, I love sushi and I remember the first time we Supremes [The Supremes] started traveling around the world.  We were in, well back then we said the Orient--Asia and we traveled to Manila [Philippines], Tokyo [Japan], Hong Kong, we were all over the, the area in 1966, and that's when I really got hooked on Asian food.
Speaker 1: Way before a lot of other people (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know, I know, my children and my grandchildren are all--they love it.  So, yeah, I was eating sushi back then.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color.  My favorite color fluctuates.  Red, perhaps is my favorite, favorite color.  I mean generally red is my favorite color, but I do very well in, in blues and, and the pastel colors.  So, those would be my, my other colors.  I have to explain something, you asked very specific questions.  I'm not a person to give very specific answers.  I like--it depends on--I am a Pisces and that kind of floats around, so I kind of hit on everything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Pisces is supposed to be the end of the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The, the--so yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, favorite time of year (laughter), I really like them all but I'll try to be very specific.  Spring is really wonderful because it's, it's, things are reborn and whatever, so I would say spring, but we're doing this interview near Christmastime.  Christmastime is my favorite time too (laughter).
Speaker 1: And favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: In my house, in my home.  I travel so much that for me to vacation in the home is a great time.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Favorite phrase?  Gee, love.  Love.
Story_ID: 647560
Speaker 1: So I wanna ask you about your family background; and why don't we start on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it--I know.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know--well, so can you tell us about your family background?
Speaker 2: On the father's side?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That's very--on my father's side is a mystery because I'm told that my father worked on a riverboat in the Mississippi area, Louisiana and that he floated into town (laughter).  My mother and he fell in love and then--my mother couldn't read or write, let's say this, my mother couldn't read or write, so what happened was, knowing about our father, I was so young when we were with that I never really found out anything about him, and my mother never told us much about him and she never wrote anything because she couldn't read or write.  So, we don't know very much about my father.  Sam Wilson--Sam Wilson a very attractive man, he and my mother left Mississippi when I must've been two years old.  They did that, you know that, that black disburse--whatever.
Speaker 1: Migration [Great Migration].
Speaker 2: Migration, from Mississippi, I think they stopped through St. Louis [Missouri] and then Chicago [Illinois] and then my mother and father I guess separated and I was given to my [maternal] aunt [I.V. Lewis Pippin] and uncle [John L. Pippin] and from there I went to Detroit, Michigan, but that's pretty much all I know about my father.  I know that on the riverboats somehow or another, my aunt and uncle told me he was a butcher by trade.  He did that by trade, and that he may have picked up his name somewhere along the line, so I don't even know if Wilson is my real name.
Speaker 1: I see, and, well there's--you know in the black family you know we find some people know a lot about their history, and some people don't know a lot.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now your father's name Sam Wilson, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Johnnie Mae [Johnnie Lewis Wilson].
Speaker 1: Do you know your father's date of birth, or at least year of birth?
Speaker 2: No, I do know that when he passed in '61 [1961], because I graduated from high school [Northeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan] in '61 [1961], was when he passed, and just prior to my graduating I went down south to Mississippi and attended the funeral, but never really knew his date of birth, but I did know that he was like sixty something when he passed.  So, he was quite older than my mother, actually.
Speaker 1: Quite older?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Like twe- almost twenty, maybe twenty years or so (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It's probably twenty years, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 647561
Speaker 1: So, your mother, can you give her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name, Johnnie Mae Wilson [Johnnie Lewis Wilson], well that's when she married my father.  Prior to that was Woods, no it wasn't, Lewis (laughter).
Speaker 1: Lewis.
Speaker 2: Lewis, Lewis was her, her father's name [W.M. Lewis], yes.
Speaker 1: And she was from?  Where, where in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Mom, I think mom and her family came from Greenwood, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you, did your mother talk at all about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, well you know the whole--my mother and her siblings were, we were always around each other.  So, I got more of the information from her siblings because as I said my mother couldn't read or write, so there was not a lot of dialogue in our family, in our little family, my mom, my brother [Roosevelt Wilson], my sister [Cathy Wilson].  So, we got more of the information from family gatherings.  Holi- you know all the holidays, we were always together so, you know they all talked about picking cotton and, and my family I believe had their--they had farmland.  I mean they were, some of them were--I can't really remember if they actually owned the land.  I think they owned the land, but growing up the younger ones, they really picked cotton and they talked about how heavy it was and girl, you know they would (unclear) (laughter).  I would've--I was, I was remembering, was very funny to us because we were growing up in Detroit [Michigan] and it was very--not the South you know and we would hear them talking about, "Girl, honey that cotton was heavy, and whoa," and they'd just go on and but pretty much that's what they talked about, it was you know the cotton.  It was, it was a big deal in the family.
Speaker 1: Well, you know and I, I think in talking to your daughter [Turkessa Ferrer Babich], she was saying she's even--she's been tracing the family--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --history back to I think 1800, (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, she told me that last night, I didn't know that (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, there's a lot you know that's possible, we're all learning.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know out there but, and it's gonna have to be discovered family by family, but you--so you're--how would you describe your mother though?
Speaker 2: My mother, Johnnie Mae was--for me I really have to go back to my aunt [I.V. Lewis Pippin] and uncle [John L. Pippin] because I really did not know my mother well until I became a little older, like around ten or eleven.  So, basically my mother was my aunt and my father was my uncle.
Speaker 1: And, and so, explain why that happened because--okay.
Speaker 2: So, when, when my mother and father [Sam Wilson] went to Detroit, went to Chicago [Illinois], I, I, I'm told that because my mother had the, the younger daughter and--I have a younger sister and brother, and so I didn't know them because I was sent to Detroit to give my mom and I guess my dad time to kind of work out their problems and earn a living because it was very difficult and mom didn't have any trade, dad was the only one who had a trade.  So, when they sent me to Detroit with my aunt and uncle it was supposedly for just a little while 'til they got themselves together, but obviously, that family broke up.  So, I'm there in Detroit with my aunt and uncle and I just, that's all I knew.  I thought they were my mom and my dad.  I was an only child, it was a--it was a--post war [World War II, WWII] homes that they built, so they had their own little home in, in southwest Detroit there by the airport [Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, Detroit, Michigan] and I was, I had a very good life.  I was, you know brought up as a little princess because my aunt and uncle both worked.  Chevrolet--I think my dad worked--I call him my dad, my [maternal] Uncle John L. [John L. Pippin].  My Aunt I.V. [I.V. Lewis Pippin] worked at a cleaners and so they always had two jobs and we just had a very--I had a great upbringing.  Always was dressed up, pretty little dresses, got all kind of Christmas presents from you know my aunt and uncle and it was a great life, and then when I turned about ten I heard from a neighbor that I.V. and John L. were not my mom and my dad, and it basically destroyed me (laughter).  It really destroyed me because someone said, "Oh, I.V. and John L. they're not your parents, your parents--your mom is Johnnie Mae." And that's when I found out that my mother was my mother. But I had seen her, but I thought she was my aunt.
Story_ID: 647562
Speaker 1: That's shocking news, that happened to my mother [Margaret Barfield Richardson] actually too; you know, she was adopted, it's not clear who--.  But you know it, it can be--it's traumatic.
Speaker 2: It's very traumatic and what I found later, especially when writing my book, is that happened to a lot of black families where one person would take care of another child because they couldn't and that's what happened to us.  It just happened for me, it was really quite good until I found out that the people I thought--so, anyway my book, my first book 'Dreamgirl' ['Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme,' Mary Wilson] was based upon that whole sort of tragedy I call it.  When I was in--just at the time when my father [Sam Wilson] passed, I was graduating from high school [Northeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan] and my teacher, Mr. Boone [David Boone], my English teacher said to me, "Ms. Wilson [HistoryMaker Mary Wilson]," he says, "I know you're singing with this little group called The Primettes, but if you don't pass my, if you don't pass my class you will not be graduating and you will not be going out on tour with these folks at this Motown [Motown Records]."  He was really against it, and he, and so I had to write a paper to really make up for running down to Motown and doing you know the singing and whatever, and write a paper to pass the class.  And when I did it, I wrote it based upon finding out that my parents, my parent, my mom was not my--was my mom and my--you know, that whole thing.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: So, I wrote the paper and Mr. Boone called me into his office and he said, "Ms. Wilson," he says, "I'm gonna give you an A plus, plus on this paper because it's brilliant."  Well, I'm like, "What is he talking about, I just told how hurt I was about finding out that my parents were not my parents." And he says, "I think you should become a writer." And I'm saying to myself, "All I want to do is go down to Motown and sing." (Laughter) You know.  And what, something must've happened in that, that got me and I started keeping a diary from that point on.  Running down to Motown and meeting Mary Wells, meeting The Miracles, meeting Stevie Wonder, meeting Marvin Gaye--I started keeping that in a little journal from the time I was seventeen.  So, that's how I really wrote my book--but it was based upon the hurt.  So, the first chapter in my book, 'Dreamgirls,' is that paper that I wrote in school and how I became an author but that's, that's the story.  So, I was really hurt but, now you asked me about my mother.  When I was moved from my [maternal] aunt [I.V. Lewis Pippin] and uncle's [John L. Pippin] home in southwest Detroit, we went into the Brewster Projects [Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects; Frederick Douglass Homes, Detroit, Michigan].  My mother was a domestic worker, and I met my brother [Roosevelt Wilson] and sister [Cathy Wilson], as my brother and sister started living with mother and it was the most beautiful experience I had ever had in my life.  My mother, Johnnie Mae [Johnnie Lewis Wilson], was the most--she was an angel.  She--when I was little--sorry, when I was little, my aunt and uncle they were so busy with the two jobs and doing this, and I got all the pretty little things, but there was a distance between us and so when I went with my mother she was so kind and she was so warm that I just fell in love with her and my brother and my sister.
Speaker 1: So, this was, I mean this is, it's like having a new you know, a, a terrible secret and a new life and all strange, but you grew to love her then?
Speaker 2: I didn't grow to love her, I mean the instant I was with her I loved her.
Speaker 1: Oh I see.
Speaker 2: It was, it was one of those things where--sometimes, I don't know.  I've always said I had two, two great experiences.  You know the first was--well, very privileged little girl I was.  I remember my cousin Josephine [Josephine Jenkins] would always say, she says, "Oh, you were just so prissy and so cute, and so--"
Story_ID: 647563
Speaker 1: In any event, I want to take you back to, you know, before you were ten; and I want you to tell me what si- sights, smells and sounds remind you of-
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you and your childhood.  Now, what was your address?  You were living with?
Speaker 2: 3800 Bassett Street.
Speaker 1: So, what sights, smells and sounds?
Speaker 2: Oh, living on 3800 Bassett Street was the most beautiful smells of all.  Watermelon, cutting of grass, it was all over the neighborhood.  It--the beautiful--I was--at the very end of Michigan, so we lived right by the river [Detroit River] so you always have that kind of environment, it was very fresh.  There was orchards there, apples, peaches, so there was always a, a fruit kind of smell because walking to school and all I would pick the apples you know.  I remember--just, it was a very home environment community.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERUPTION)
Speaker 2: Turn off the--
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) earlier.
Speaker 2: But your mother [Johnnie Lewis Wilson] wanted--didn't your, [maternal] Aunt I.V. [I.V. Lewis Pippin] your Aunt I.V. she wanted to keep you, right?  Didn't she?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, they wanted, oh, oh, yes.
Speaker 2: They want--that was the whole thing they wanted.
Speaker 1: Well, they--I was--
Speaker 2: Did they have--were they able to have kids, I can't remember (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yes, they--at the beginning they were not.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, I'll explain it, let's finish.  So, I, I.V.--well, you want me to do--which one you want me to do, the trees and the smells?
Speaker 2: The trees and the (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was, you know living with I.V and John L. [Wilson's maternal uncle, John L. Pippin] was a perfect environment.  I mean it was really a perfect little--especially for blacks at that time, you know.  The community was all, was thoroughly a black community and we lived at the edge near Inkster, Michigan.  As I said you know it was, the, the--everyone had cars, everyone had lawns, so you would--and everyone was out there mowing the lawn on the weekends, washing the cars.  It was what you, when you watched TV back in the '60s [1960s] and you had these idyllic kind of home--environment, that's what I grew up in and it was definitely the watermelon.  The guys would come down the street, (singing) "Watermelon," coming down the street on the weekends.  So, all of those things was what I grew up you know around, yes.
Speaker 2: And let's talk about water--any other sounds in the household?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Or sounds, period (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Sounds?  Sounds, not much, my house was a very quiet house.  I grew up in a very quiet--because no one was ever there but me and there were no other children and I, I would always sit in front of the big glass plate window and just watch outside, watch the cars go by and watch people walk by.  I was an observer of things because I had no one to talk to, I was--like I said, I was an only child so it was very quiet.
Speaker 2: So you lived really inside your head in some respects?
Speaker 1: I totally lived inside my head, and, and I know that in--later on when people would write about me, they would always say I was kind of like this piece of fluff, I just went here, da, da, da; but people never knew that I was basically, as, as you said I was kind of always, always a thinker.  I mean I've always been a thinker.  I've always been a, what you call it, a seeker of truth.  Probably that happened you know, after I found out the truth about my existence is why I really became a seeker of trying to find out the truth about things because it just seemed like it was just such a mystery.  (Laughter) The world was such a mystery and I didn't know what was going on.  There were so many secrets.  So yeah, I was a big seeker of truth.
Story_ID: 647564
Speaker 1: So, can you describe I.V. and Johnnie?  I mean can you describe them as people?
Speaker 2: My, my [maternal] aunt I.V. [I.V. Lewis Pippin], I guess her real name was Ivory, but back in those days they said I.V., and John L. [John L. Pippin] were--I.V. was the youngest of all my mom's brothers and sisters.  So, she was like the baby and I, I guess she and John L. were not able at that early time to have children and so this was a great opportunity for them. They had just, John L. had just gotten out the World War [World War II, WWII].  What was that the, the?
Speaker 1: Two.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's II, '44 [1944], and so you know he'd come home, with his money bought a new home, car, they got jobs whatever, 'cause they, they were a very progressive kind of family and they were, they wanted to really succeed in life.  So, basically, they were hardworking people.  And, and then I came into their lives and I guess they had just a perfect little family, which is what they really wanted. And it went on until you know I guess my mother [Johnnie Lewis Wilson] came back and said, "I want Mary [HistoryMaker Mary Wilson] back." And at that point it was like, "You can't have Mary back, you told us you were giving her to us." And they--mom said, "Oh, no, I never said I was giving my child away." You know so that went on.  I, I only heard about this I don't know.  You know I didn't know all that was happening.  But I.V. was a very strong disciplinarian, disciplinarian kind of person and she was also, you know I'm very much into astrology, so she was also a Leo, which back then I didn't know, but she had to have everything perfect and everything her way, and then she--they finally had a child, Pat [Pat Pippin], and Pat and I grew up as, as sisters.  So, basically even now I think of her as my younger sister, but she definitely ruled the household you know and she was a little lady, but she was a pretty lady.  I.V. was extremely pretty and would always buy pretty clothes and she would buy me pretty clothes, and she had the Vogues [Vogue] and whatever the fashion magazine was there.  So, I was, I grew up around beauty and she was, she was really stern on me because she wanted me to be--probably more than my mother.  My mother was the eldest of all these children.  I guess it was eight children, three brothers, four sisters.  So, it was seven, and she was the eldest, I.V. was the youngest, and since mom had to, didn't read nor write, the others got great education.  I.V. had a great education, John L. had a great education, but my mother didn't, so I think I.V. was a bit harder on me because she didn't want me to be like my mother.  You know she wanted me to--and I'm, I'm a very sort of--I have my own way of doing things and I have found throughout my own life, people expect a lot of me and they think I should--I'm smarter than I am (laughter), so they kind of push me when they see me not doing as I guess they think I should, and so, this is the way I.V. was always, always pushing me and it hurt.  I loved her, you know I loved her, but it just hurt the way she was pushing me.
Speaker 1: She was strict and stern (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very strict (laughter), I remember--but it is part of why I'm as strong as I am now, because of her pushing so I mean it's--but back then it was very--it hurt.  I remember we had all the doilies back in those days, everything was--these doilies and they had little holes and so, if they were on the little table and, and I had to dust--you know when you're a kid, you dust around it and you keep on going.  And she'd come back and pick that little doily up and all the little dust holes was there, and boy would I get it.  She, she wouldn't beat me, but I mean scold and I mean so it was like always very, very intense for me and that really--I guess I regressed further into myself because of that. But yes, because of her being that way I'm the kind of person I, I clean (laughter)--I'm such, you know before the maid comes in the hotel, I will have cleaned the room, because that's kind of how I was taught and, and it really is a--because of I.V.  So, with everything that's going on with my life, I'm really a very, very hard worker, but I do it my own way.  I don't do it the way people think.  So, I still think people have this thing, if they don't know, they don't know me.  People don't know me (laughter).
Story_ID: 647565
Speaker 1: So your mother [Johnnie Lewis Pippin] comes at, you know ten, ele- I mean you find out about ten or eleven.  How long is it before you move in with her and your, you know, your, your siblings?
Speaker 2: I don't really know, probably it was short--it was soon, because my mother actually moved in with us, with my brother [Roosevelt Wilson] and sister [Cathy Wilson], so we were there at the little house on Bassett [Street] together for a while, and that's probably when I got to know my brother and my sister and my mom and to started really you know understanding that I'm going to eventually be going to there, and it was actually an easy move.  It, it was, it was not as hard as I would have thought it was going to be.  You know because they was--they were wild, my brother--they were from Mississippi.  You know, they were wild and, and so they were fun.  You know they were kind of--I didn't look down on them, but it was--they were from Mississippi (laughter) you know what I mean?  And I had been brought up this prissy little girl.  So, I actually ended up finding them fun, they brought excitement to my life that I had not really known.
Speaker 1: And then you describe Brewster Projects [Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects; Frederick Douglass Homes, Detroit, Michigan] as a place that was fun too with kids (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Brewster Projects became very fun because after we left Bassett and my mother took me into her, you know under her care, it--we had to move into, we had a couple of other little houses, little apartments before we went to the Brewster Projects, but it was fun.  As, as again, I'm saying all, all of a sudden, I'm on this journey and it was, it was a fun journey.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying in the places you moved before Brewster Projects, was, was that a difficult--I mean, I mean I understand that but you're--which, I mean they are strangers in a way and?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I'm, I'm really--I think I was born to be an entertainer.  I think that my dad [Sam Wilson], see even though I don't know my dad, I think that I'm very much like my dad.  I, I loved the idea of now we're on a journey and I was ready for that journey because the quietness was, it was beginning, it was getting boring if you know what I mean.  So, all of a sudden my mother and my brother and my sister came into my life, and we're moving from one little place--probably within a year you know and then it came, the government--I gotta say this you know, that the government's not doing this now, but back then the government were really looking after people and that's when my mother got on the, it was either the ADC [Aid to Dependent Children; Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)] or the welfare or something like that.  We were receiving certain supplementary kind of income and, because mom got a job at you know working--she use to say, "Working at the white folk's house." And that's when all of a sudden, we got the opportunity to get this new housing development and move into it, and that became a really big thing and once we, we went over there it was just great.  All these people out there, the big building, the da, ta, da.  It was fabulous.   So, that was the beginning of a, of a great time in my life: the Brewster Projects.
Story_ID: 647566
Speaker 1: My brother, who is two years younger than I, is Roosevelt Wilson.  My sister is Catherine Wilson, but she's now Catherine Wilson Witherspoon [Cathy Wilson].
Speaker 2: And how would you describe their personalities versus yours, except you know you said that they were Mississippi?
Speaker 1: My, my brother, Roosevelt, is--actually is a Vietnam vet [veteran] and he's always been very wild, kind of like when you meet someone, and they walk into the room and all of a sudden, they---he's like the center of attraction and he's kind of, he's that kind of guy, bubbly personality.  Always has a story, always happy.  He's been through a lot with the Vietnam War, it really took a lot out of him so now you know all those years he really has not been the person that I grew up with but I think right now he's beginning to get over some of the experiences he had in the war, but just a character.  You would call him a character.  I would think that if I had known my father [Sam Wilson], he probably would be the--just like my father you know.  So, one who worked on the river boat in Mississippi and always had a laugh or a story, loves to talk.  So, I, I would think that he's very much like my father whom I never really spent a lot of time with.  My sister, Catherine, was always my baby sister, and I always treated her like, "Oh this is my baby sister."  I was so proud of her and I was the big sister and I would always--and she hates when I say, "This is my baby sister," and I still say it (laugher) and she said--I think she just turned sixty, but I always say, "This is my baby sister."  I said, "Now aren't you happy you're my baby sister now?"  But they were, they would just--my sister and I were always ganging up on my brother because he was such a boy, and my sister and I are very cute little da, da, da, girls and I remember when we, my sister had this doll.  They use to have white dolls, they didn't have black dolls back in those day and the doll was made out of porcelain, the head was porcelain, and I remember one time my brother did something and my sister got so mad she took that doll and broke it over his head (laughter), so, we, we, but we had a, we really had a good time, and when we moved into the projects [Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects; Frederick Douglass Homes, Detroit, Michigan], we were one of the few families that only had, that had a small family.  There was just the three of us, everybody else had you know more, six, seven, eight, ten, da, da, da families.  So, we were really unique in the projects that we were a small family.
Speaker 2: And how--did you think your mother [Johnnie Lewis Wilson] was happy to have everyone together again and you know she's struggling, the kids, but you think she, she, she felt centered (unclear)?
Speaker 1: I never really, I, I never really had dialogue with my mom because she was not the kind of person that talked a lot, and, but the beauty of her is that she never had to talk.  I mean she was one of those people if you're around her, if anyone was around her, she was just so clear.  She was so, real, everything about her was just real, and so you didn't really have to talk a lot and I regret not talking to her because I would've--then I would have loved to know what was in her head, because here's a woman who would go shopping for the groceries, do all these things and couldn't read a label.  I would wonder how she never got anything mixed up, you know what I mean?  It--bleach, it was, was Argo starch, whatever it was, she never got anything mixed up.  She always knew exactly what things were but she could never read anything.  But, so I do wish that I had talked to her more and asked her about dad you know and asked her about this--ask her, but she never, she didn't talk.
Speaker 2: And she might've--she might not have said anything too.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: She may not have said anything either too (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think that she would have, I think that no one asked her.  I think no one asked her, and everyone else was so much smarter than her, you see.  So, I, I feel very sad that I didn't know enough to really talk with her and get some of that information.  Now, the other aunts and uncles you know, they were talking all the time; but no, I don't, I think people just didn't ask her.

Speaker 1: What was life like in your household in Brew- Brewster Projects [Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects; Frederick Douglass Homes, Detroit, Michigan]?  What was, what was the--'cause there's three of you now and--?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was--you know, very opposite from what I had, I was accustomed to.  I was accustomed to being told everything to do, what to do, how to do it.  And with my mom [Johnnie Lewis Wilson] and brother [Roosevelt Wilson] and sister [Cathy Wilson Witherspoon], I was never told what to do.  In, in terms of, I knew the things I was supposed to do.  I was the eldest, so I had to look over the other children.  It was my duty to wash the dishes.  I remember they had the, the washers and the dryers and you'd put the thing through that and to dry it out, I remember doing that, but mom would tell us what we needed to do and we just did it, and that was what was the beauty of growing up in that household was that you were, you were kind of left to be who you were.  You weren't made to be anyone else, but yet, and still you knew what you were supposed to do, and, and you know when the street lights came on you were supposed to be home.  I, mama told us everything we were supposed to do in a way of training and teaching without demanding.  She never demanded anything, but you know if, if someone--we got very few whippings.  My brother was the only one who got whippings and he should have 'cause he was really bad (laughter), you know what I mean.  And you know, the ironing cord, we got the whipping with the ironing cord or whatever, but I rarely got any spankings because I, I pretty much did, or I was very well trained with I.V. [Wilson's maternal aunt, I.V. Lewis Pippin] (laughter), I mean so I knew what I was supposed to do, but it was a quiet household, but it was, it was a very--how can I say it?  It was the kind of household that was orderly.  It was very orderly, and mom ran it that way without, you know without being demanding.  She was a perfect mom.  I always said that she was a--I would go and visit other friend's house and it would be chaos in their houses.  Our house was never like that.  It was always just a perfect little environment.  I mean you know we, we did things whatever, and momma would have to get--tell us, but it was done in a respectful manner.
Story_ID: 647568
Speaker 1: And so in school, now, what--before I get to school, what about church?  Was church (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was just gonna, I was just gonna bring up church.  Church was always a big thing in our community.  I mean from the time I was a child with I.V. [Wilson's maternal aunt, I.V. Lewis Pippin] and John L. [Wilson's maternal uncle, John L. Pippin], church was always--on Sunday, you knew that's where you were gonna be, in church you know.  And so, you know we learned about God.  We respected you know, the religion and those kinds of things.  I would say we all grew up in a very, very religious environment, and, and going on with, to mom [Johnnie Lewis Wilson], and when I moved with mom, same thing, we always went to church.  I remember we went to First Baptist [sic. New Bethel Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan] and Reverend Franklin, C.L. Franklin, you know Aretha's [Aretha Franklin] father. And, then I ended up going to school when there was busing from the projects [Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects; Frederick Douglass Homes, Detroit, Michigan].  This is when busing and all that the rules started and we were bused into another area, and that was very interesting because now we had been used to being altogether in this you know sort of black community, and then we were taken out of that community and going to another community because of busing, which ended up being really good, but again it broadened our perception of community.
Speaker 1: Now what, do you how--what year that was or how old you were?
Speaker 2: It was probably twelve because it was just before I joined The Primettes.  So, I remember that because Aretha's younger sister, Carolyn [Carolyn Franklin], was also attending Alger school [Alger Elementary School] I think it was in Detroit [Michigan], outside away from the Brewster Projects, and she had a little group and asked me if I wanted to sing in this group, and I said, "Yes." And I don't even know why I said yes because I was not really a singer.  I didn't know I was a singer, but I had always sang in you know the little church theater and little (unclear) basically in school.  I had done most of the choirs and glee clubs, but just--we all did.  So, I didn't think that was anything special, but she asked me to be in a group and I said, "Yeah."  And then when I was getting ready to sing in the group, this girl beat me up and so--who was in the group, and so years later when I started writing my book, I asked Carolyn, I said, "Why did that girl, you know, jump on me like that?"  And she said, "Did it ever occur to you that you were cute and she was jealous?"  I'm like, "No."  Never dawned on me, and so shortly after that they stopped busing us and we started going to the school that was in our community, and that's when I met Florence [Florence Ballard] and actually became a Primette.  Oh, I was probably eleven.
Speaker 1: At the time of the busing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when we changed.
Speaker 1: I wanna--when you think back at--to church, what song do you associate with church back then?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know if I think about any particular song because we, you know, Reverend C.L. Franklin sang everything (laughter), and when I was living I think with my aunt and uncle--it was really a, basically a choir kind of thing so I don't think I was really much into individual songs.  I, I you know I remember probably the 'His Hand is on the Sparrow.'
Speaker 1: That's 'Eyes on a Sparrow' [sic. 'His Eye Is on the Sparrow'] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Eyes on a Sparrow.' But basically, that's the only song I ever really remember 'cause pretty much it was all choir stuff, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 647569
Speaker 1: Now, when you, what--so, give me the elementary schools again?  Elementary is?
Speaker 2: Elementary?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: The name of the schools?
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: You have two, right?
Speaker 2: When the--Alger [Alger Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] was the school we were bused to, and after that we went to Bishop [Bishop Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] which was the actual elementary school before ninth grade, so it was like the seventh, sixth, seventh, eighth, that, that was Bishop, which was right at Brewster Projects [Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects; Frederick Douglass Homes, Detroit, Michigan] (unclear), and so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So it was just walking distance?
Speaker 2: Yes, we--that was just across the street there, so that's where we ended up going, but Alger was the one, fourth, fifth grade, something like that, that we were bused to.
Speaker 1: So, when you, when you--how long have you known Carolyn when she suggested the group that was just--
Speaker 2: Carolyn Franklin?  I knew Carolyn Franklin when we were bused to Alger.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't necessarily meet her at the church, you met her (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I knew of her.
Speaker 1: You knew of her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because we knew the whole family, Cecil [Cecil Franklin], Aretha [Aretha Franklin], Carolyn, they were all there, but I was so young that I didn't really know her, you know what I mean?  It wasn't a thing where I knew, "Oh, that's Carolyn, that's--," you know it wasn't, we hadn't grown up yet.  We were still babies (laughter).
Story_ID: 647570
Speaker 1: We're getting ready to enter this, you know, Motown [Motown Records] story and I just, I keep thinking about how amazing it was that all that talent occurred in such a small--
Speaker 2: Yes, in proximity of each other, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) little area.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, Detroit [Michigan] was really a, a, you know, if you look back at the history of Detroit, it was always a place where music was very strong.  I mean jazz, the, the clubs there.  You would have people performing, coming through Detroit; Flame Show Bar [Detroit, Michigan], Nat King Cole, that was the--they all came through there.  It was a musical town, so now all of a sudden you have this new generation of rock and rollers coming up and you know, [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy, Lu Pine Records and you have all these little record companies coming up and it just did happen all at the same time, but it came from that, that, the prior sort of nightclub scene, you know the Chitlin' Circuit where all the black people would perform, so, so I think it was just a natural progression of the music now coming from the jazz and the rhythm and blues now coming into the rock and roll era of it.
Speaker 1: Right, but I mean it, it Chicago [Illinois] would have the same thing, but it didn't, but I mean Detroit eclipsed it and Motown eclipsed it completely, it--
Speaker 2: Well, you, you know Berry Gordy was an entrepreneur and that was his dream, and had he not done that sort of Motown thing maybe it would not have happened, and it's all about the people.  I mean Chicago had its own. Stax [Stax Records] and what, not Stax (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We had C.J. Records and Chess Records.
Speaker 2: Yes, Chess, that's what I mean--that, in fact I think Berry went there a couple of times.  So, it was, it was kind of happening, but I think Berry Gordy was the one for Detroit that took it to that next level, you know.  I really think so 'cause the talent was--you're right, talent was definitely there.
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Speaker 2: The talent was there, yeah as you mentioned the close proximity in terms of the people.  You had the, well you had The Temptations you know, you'd--everyone still came from different areas. Because The Temptations came out of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --because The Temptations came out of, The Temptations came from Alabama.
Speaker 1: Right, but I'm saying, but they--wait they came from Alabama but to Detroit.
Speaker 2: But to Detroit.
Speaker 1: But to Detroit.
Speaker 2: See this is what I'm saying, people were coming in.  It wasn't that we were--everyone was there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's like people were coming into Detroit because it was a mecca for music.
Speaker 1: I see, oh so you're saying The Temptations didn't grow up in Detroit.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They came?  Oh, I wonder if I knew that.
Speaker 2: No, 'cause see this is what a lot of people were not aware.  Berry and everyone didn't go out and find people, people were coming into the area.
Speaker 1: Right, I see.
Speaker 2: Because Detroit was a really a happening town.  I remember Maurice King, who was a big band leader at the Flame Show Bar he would tell--he later came and worked with us at Motown in, in the artist development department, as did [HistoryMaker] Maxine Powell, as did a lot of other people, but prior to that these people had their own businesses, not businesses but they worked at the Chitlin' Circuits, they did all of that so, when they were getting ready to retire Motown all of a sudden is here.  They came into Motown into the artist development department and I remember Charles--Maurice telling us he had worked with, you know, Nat King Cole, Ella [Ella Fitzgerald], Carmen McRae.  He had worked with all of the greats, so now they're beginning to retire so they'd come in and, and train all of at Motown.  The artists as I mentioned, The Temptations came from Alabama--people were just coming into the city from different areas, and, and because Berry had this idea--Mr. Gordy had this idea of the new sound, the Motown sound; people were saying, "Well, this is where we should go."
Story_ID: 647571
Speaker 1: But you know, I--you're right about that, 'cause when I interviewed Bubba Knight [HistoryMaker Merald "Bubba" Knight, Jr.], he was talking about how he came to train with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There it was.  Cholly Atkins.
Speaker 1: No, no before Cholly Atkins, he trained with--his mother [Elizabeth Woods Knight] was bringing them up during the summers.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: To train I think with Mr. Knight or some--or a vocal coach there.
Speaker 2: Oh, really.
Speaker 1: And so they were coming up several summers in a row.  The thing that I wanna ask, 'cause I mean you're all young, but you know this is a time you have to sort of think of because the age people are singing.  I mean you, you're entertaining, you wanna form these groups, so she [Carolyn Franklin] asked you to form the group.  Talk about the story after that so--?
Speaker 2: Well, this is a time first of all in, not just Detroit [Michigan], in Chicago [Illinois], in New York [New York] because you had groups like--my favorite group The Teenagers, Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers, you had The Shirelles, you had The Chantels.  You have all these groups are coming up in different cities--same time, same time so the same thing was going on.  It's just that this new music is just beginning to just take over in spots.  So, in Detroit it was one of those things where I remember what great--well, I was--we started out at The Primettes, but you had the other little groups.  I'm trying to think of some names of the groups now and I can't think of them, but they were, they were forming the groups and, and they were in the hallways where the echo was good.  They were on the street corners.  So, you have all these little pockets of groups just, just singing, because what else are they gonna do at the age? I mean they can do sports.  We were very fortunate at, in the Brewster Projects [Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects, Detroit, Michigan] where we had a community center and that's where people would go when they started to play.  They either played sports or they'd be over here singing.  So, you had these kind of two dynamics that are going on, and it just seemed like the music was something that really took on because everybody could sing.  You know every--and everybody could do harmonies, so it you know you go in there and you say, "I wanna be in group." And you go in there and, "Well, can you sing?  No, you can't sing."   Send you out, you know, so it was one of those dynamics where everybody found that this was the new thing to do. And so then people would dance, they could dance so they started putting together their little choreography and then they put their harmonies and everyone had good ears, and if you didn't you weren't in a group.  You sing--in the projects we had stairwells and you would stand there and you'd get the echo you know.  So, whoever was good would have that spot.  If you weren't you'd have to move out the way.  So, it was really a competitive, creative time and I think people found that they either could play sports or they could sing, and that's, that's how all that happened, and then you had, of course, the people who were business minded.  "Oh, guys guess what, I know this person--." So, they became the managers you know (laughter).  Everyone found something that they were good in and that's how they contributed to this whole new movement, and then of course Mr. Berry, Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] was the one who also had the talent of writing lyrics, had the musical talent, had a great family behind him who had money.  They were all entrepreneurs, his father, Pops Gordy [Berry Gordy, Sr.], his mother [Bertha Fuller Gordy], they all were well educated people so, you know, he found that he was--I think he first went into boxing, like I said it was all sports or singing.  So, he went into boxing and pretty soon I guess he decided, now this I don't know for sure, but he decided well you know he really wanted to pursue more of the music than getting beat up (laughter).  Those are my words not his, but anyway and that's when he you know met The Miracles.  Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] and he got together writing lyrics and, da, da, da, and pretty soon I guess his family gave him money and that's how Motown got started.  So, all the groups now are elevated to this thing but they wanna do this as a business not just as singing on the street corners.  Now, it becomes a business.
Speaker 1: But you were singing at sock hops and things like that?  You're singing in basements first, and talk about where you sort of rehearsing 'cause you become The Primettes because you--they're The Primes right?
Speaker 2: Well, our, you know our beginnings, The Primettes beginnings was the same time as Motown Records.  Motown Records was formed in 1959, and in 1959 also we, we, The Primettes, we're still in high school [Northeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan], we're--yeah, still in high school; and Florence [Florence Ballard] and I started--Florence and I went to the same school.  Diane [Diana Ross] did not go to the same--
Story_ID: 647572
Speaker 1: But wait, but let, let's go--so it's you and Carol- Carolyn and you, right?  Carolyn suggests the group; let's, let--okay, before and then?
Speaker 2: Okay, well after we were no longer bused to the other school [Alger Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], we went to the school, Bishop [Bishop Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], and it was at that time when we had the--our school had a talent show and our school said, "If you wanna be a part of this talent show, sign up in the gymnasium wall and you know you'd be on the show."  So, here I am loving Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers, I saw them on some show. Now this was the beginning of, of rock and roll and, and I fell in love with Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers.  So, when I saw the sign on, on the gymnasium wall about being a part of a show, I said, "Oh, okay." And I dressed up in my brother's [Roosevelt Wilson] blue jeans and black leather jacket, and back then the colored boys, the black boys, Afro Americans we say now, wore processed hair. So, I had a du wet rag tied around my head, had a big a comb in my pocket, and I went up there and I pantomimed to Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers' song.  This was very odd--I just wanna regress a minute here.  Why I would do that?  Because my only experience, and this was having sung with Carolyn Franklin for a little bit, and then we were bused back to Bishop and now I see on TV, these guys singing.  Fell in love with Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers and now I'm signing up for this show.  I'm like--I didn't think about this then, but as I think about it now, where did that come from?  It wasn't like I said I wanna be a singer or whatever.  I mean these things are just kind of coming into my lap and I'm just following 'em.  So, I went up there, I never even thought I could sing, I never thought about it, and I pantomimed to that record.  Well, the crowd in the gymnasium went wild, they were like, "Go Mary [HistoryMaker Mary Wilson], go Mary," da, da.  And, and I mean I had the crowd just like going and I'm only twelve or twelve and a half, something like that.  So, then Florence [Florence Ballard] was on the same--she had, I guess she had signed up.  I didn't know her, but she lived in the projects [Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects; Frederick Douglass Homes, Detroit, Michigan] and in the projects, there were thousands of people.  You may see them but you don't really know them all the time.  So, she sang and she actually was singing, she said, (singing) "Ave Maria," ['Ave Maria,' Franz Schubert] and everybody was like, "Whoa!"  So, as wild as they were about me, we all were like, "She's only twelve and a half too." And she's this--voice was huge.  It was big and she sounded so great.  Somehow or another I don't remember anybody else on the show at all, never have actually, and she and I kind of migrated that day after the show and we started just talking and, and I said why--I said, "Ooh, your voice, it's so big and it's so beautiful," da, da. And she said, "Girl, you had the crowd going." They were.  Now, I'm a quiet, bashful type.  For me to get up there and do that was so out of character, but yet, and still when I did that, you know it dawned on me that I totally enjoyed doing that and did it so naturally, so it was if I had been trained and I had not been.  So, Florence and I became friends that day and she, we talked about you know everyone's got these little groups and this and that, I didn't think--I use to be with Carolyn and then, da, da, da, you know and then we started talking and said, "Well maybe we should start one or anyone talks--wants it, let's remember each other."  So, we walked home that day and became friends, and sure enough a couple of months later Florence came up to me on the playground and she said, "Mary," she said, "this, this group called The Primes wanna put a girl group together, and my sister [Maxine Ballard Jenkins] is dating one of the guys, and their manager, Milton Jenkins, wanted to know if, you know, if I wanna be in it."  She said, "I told them about you." And she said, "I heard they were gonna go across the street.  You know this girl Diana [Diana Ross] that lives right across the street from you?"  "Yeah, I've seen her out there.  She's always playing with the boys," and da, da.  "They've asked her so and they want to see us." And then we all, me, Diana and Flo walked down to the guy's apartment.  Our parents would've killed us had they known we did that, but we went over to their house and that's when we met The Primes, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams and Kell Osborne and the manager, Milton Jenkins.  And, so they asked us, "Well can you girls sing?" You know, and so we're like um, you know, and so Florence says, "I know this song." And she started singing 'You Know the Night Time is the Right Time,' the Ray Charles song, and so Diane and I--and then there was another girl there, Betty [Betty McGlown].  I guess she had been dating one of the guys and we all chimed in and sang the song.  Not taught anything and it sounded beautiful, so Milton said, "All right, we've got the group.  We're The Primes and you're The Primettes."  And that's how we started singing.
Story_ID: 647573
Speaker 1: And so Milton Jenkins becomes your manager of sorts?
Speaker 2: Yes, because he's the manager of The Primes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And their whole idea was that they're working around Detroit [Michigan].  Detroit had loads or different kind of places, the--usually union places where they would have weekend shows and so The Primes would go there, they'd do their--they'd have a package, so we would be part of the package because we'd sing a couple of the little numbers, then The Primes would come on and do theirs.  We did that for you know months and there were different other places in Detroit where to, to work.  We had, you know, church places we would and different locals.  Different Local 344 [Detroit Firefighters Association, Local No. 344] or whatever that was, you know, they would have their weekend parties and the community would come out, and they absolutely loved us.  I mean we really, to be novices, we really were very good.  You know we would teach ourselves a song, we'd find the songs we wanted to sing.  We met this young kid who played guitar, Marvin Tarplin [Marv Tarplin], he went to the same school that Florence [Florence Ballard] and I did [Bishop Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], so we had him play the guitar and we, you know we killed audience and then The Primes would come out and do theirs.  It didn't last long for some reason, I don't know what happened, but we knew that we enjoyed it and so we just continued to do these little record hops.  Every weekend the deejays would say it, "Come on down to the 20 Grand and we have Johnny Mathis singing da, da, da and our own local girls, The Primettes." (Laughter) And that's what, that's what we did for you know like a year or two, and then we did a contest in Canada, which had people from all the area.  They were coming from Ohio, from Michigan, from, from Canada--from Canadian areas, Windsor [Canada] and all, and we won the contest which was very strange.  Out of all those people we won the cost, and lost the fifteen dollars that we won, and they always thought that I had kept the money, but I think we went on one of the rides after the show, it must've fallen out of my pocket or something.  I was so embarrassed I had lost that fifteen dollars.  That was a lot of money for us back then.
Story_ID: 647574
Speaker 1: Now, the groups when you're performing, are, is each person taking a role at this point, or is it all you know group singing with harmonies?  You know (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It depended on the group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It really depended on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I mean in the early years (unclear)?
Speaker 2: In terms, in terms of, I, I--
Speaker 1: You and the (unclear).
Speaker 2: --understand what you mean, it--whoever had the capability of certain things.  There's certain people who do have, you know, you know they are the lead singers.  You, you have that and so they would be the lead singer and then you have the person who has the bass, they would do the bass.  One who had the top voice would be the--you know so, you kind of knew what your, your--you knew what you could bring to the group, and if that didn't fit then you, you were moved around.  In our group, it was just automatic, we all kind of had certain styles.  Florence [Florence Ballard] had more of the R and B style like Ray Charles kind of thing, Etta James.  So, she would take those kind of songs; so basically, you're taking songs and just re- you know re-do them and you did that style.  So, Florence had the R and B, Diane [Diana Ross] had the really kind of pop, pop sound and I had just basically the, the ballad.  So, I would just sing, basically just a slow ballad, love songs you know and that's how we split it up, but most of the time people knew exactly who was gonna be their lead singer.  We had not yet gotten to that point.
Speaker 1: And then you know the thing I think that gets lost historically that you, you know, brought out in the book ['Dreamgirl: My Life As A Supreme,' Mary Wilson] and everything is that there were four of you, all--you know for a, a good amount of time and you're very (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, because, we were four because you had better harmonies with four (laughter), you know what I mean.  You, and it was back in the days of The Four Freshman, da, da, da.  So, harmonies were really important so that's why you had--we had four because we could get the better harmonic structure in the singing and that's Betty McGlown was the first member, who was, had been dating one of The Primes [Paul Williams] and she was the fourth member.  What happened was that the first year she was there, and she was a little older than we were.  I, I gotta say, we were probably, I don't know thirteen.  She may have been fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, sixteen something like that.  I'm not sure but something along that.  So, she was older than we were and her interests were a little different than ours.  We were still like little girls you know, and, and so she stayed with us about a year.  After that we continued to want the four parts because that was the structure of a group and we found Betty--Barbara, Barbara Martin, a beautiful, beautiful girl and so she took the fourth place and she actually was the member, the fourth member when we went to Motown [Motown Records] and auditioned for Motown, and so we, we still had four at the time.  In fact, we did a lot of the tours, you mentioned Bubba Knight [HistoryMaker Merald "Bubba" Knight, Jr.] of the, the, Gladys Knight and the Pips.  We actually did a couple of shows with them back in early days; and we were still four at that point.

Speaker 1: You know the other thing is--I think amazing is that The Primes and The Primettes became successful groups.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean you know and, now they formed so--Milton Jenkins, he, he had, he was able to identify talent.  I mean he did, he, he ended up, he ended up--what happened to him?  He caught?  What happened to Milton Jenkins?  He (unclear).
Speaker 2: Milton Jenkins was another one of the entrepreneurs.  You had a lot of people like that, as I said they found their little niche and he was definitely a manager type person and after, after we left Milton he still had, had other groups that he, he managed.  What happened with The Primes was that Otis Williams [HistoryMaker Otis Clayborn Williams] of The Distants needed other members, and that's when Eddie [Eddie Kendricks] and Paul [Paul Williams] went to form The Temptations with Otis Williams and The Distants.  So, they became one entity, but for, for people like Milton, oftentimes if they didn't get the right, you know artists to move on then they probably went to another job or whatever (laughter), but I think, I think that Milton did stay in management for quite some time.
Speaker 1: But he got gangrene, right, and he, he (unclear).
Speaker 2: Milton--well when we first met Milton he had something going on with his arm.  I never knew exactly what it was, but he always had a sling.  But he was a very sharp dresser and no matter what he was dressed in, and he always had a really cool sort of sling for the arm; but I never knew exactly what happened to--why he had that arm.  I thought he just broke his wrist or something.
Story_ID: 647576
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, the other thing in terms of schools, you were--when you and Flo [Florence Ballard] got together you were at Commerce [High School of Commerce, Detroit, Michigan], that was the white--was that the white (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: Why do I have Commerce here?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I have Commerce and I--
Speaker 2: Well, there, there's lots of things in there.  I was even looking at the bio [biography] and I thought that there are lot of things that, that--
Speaker 1: That are wrong?
Speaker 2: Well, not wrong but you know.
Speaker 1: Correct it, please (laughter).
Speaker 2: I do need to--after a--when, when we finish I would like to go and really do that.
Speaker 1: Good, okay.
Speaker 2: But you know I figure we could do that if you have time.  So, when we were still at elementary school [Bishop Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] after we had our, after we put the group together [The Primettes] then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were in junior high by that--?
Speaker 2: Well, see this, this is what's different, different structures.  For us, elementary school ended in the eighth grade.  So, at that point is when you go on to either--in our, in Detroit [Michigan] you had high school.  You went to high school, so we were sent to, according to your academic skills you were sent to a certain school.  And I had in school, I guess they thought I should go to Commerce because Commerce was more of a, you know, typing, da, da, and all that kind of stuff.  Well, I got over there and didn't like it because it was like all girls.  That was the first thing (laughter), but also, I just didn't like the environment and, and Diane [Diana Ross] and--from her school went to Cass [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], which was a really higher academic type school, but I didn't want to go there either.  I just wanted to have fun.  Northeastern [Northeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan] was the school that was in our area that was just, you know it was just--it didn't have the academic sort of majors and, and minors that you could take at Commerce and Cass, and I preferred that.  So, that's where I went and Florence [Florence Ballard] went there as well, but what was really good about going to Northeastern from the elementary, was they had a great musical department, that was where they excelled and their football and basketball.  So, those were, what I had been accustomed to you know and I had went there and I joined the glee club, the choir, the ensemble, the da, da.  And Florence and I were in all of those, and thank god because the teachers who were there were just excellent.  Mr. Philbert, he was a white teacher, was over the entire music department.  Mrs. Breaux was over most of the musical classes and so Florence and I were in all of those and she taught us very well.  In fact, one--she said that, "I know you girls are singing this rock and roll," she said, "but you know, you need to be singing opera."  She wanted to--and so we were trained in that, in that way, Florence and I was and then later on she came back she said, "I'm so glad that you guys didn't listen to me." (Laughter) But they were all on us.  So, they were really excellent--Detroit had an excellent educational program.  It just, it was just beautiful, the teachers were really well--you know they just, they cared about the students.  They really, really did and we were well trained in everything that we did.
Story_ID: 647577
Speaker 1: What happens then?  You, you, you win the contest; and, and you were talking about you know you lost fifteen dollars, but you won the contest.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What happens after that?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you're excited, I mean that's a big deal you win first prize?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Big deal.
Speaker 2: And we [The Primettes] didn't have a manager--yeah it, it was a big deal.  We won over all these you know different cities and states and countries and everything, but it still--we were, we didn't have management, didn't have direction or anything, we were just singing.  Still in school [Bishop Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], so we couldn't really think about this as a career.  We weren't really thinking about it as a career, we were just like, "Well, what do we do next?"  And that actually happens just prior to--you know we've, we've been working with a lot of artists who were doing--actually recording, which we had never even thought about.  So, that brought to our attention at this point that, "Wow, you know maybe we should start thinking about something more serious."  And again, we were doing this on our own, we were--how old are we now?  We're not even sixteen yet.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because we didn't sign our contract until we were sixteen.  So, here we are fifteen and a half year-old girls, planning our own future.  And we said, "Well maybe we should now think about recording."  And that, at that point is when we started looking and keeping our eyes and ears open to various opportunities with record companies, didn't even know if there were record companies in Detroit [Michigan] until you know we started looking around.  And one thing that was probably to our benefit, not probably, was, is Diane [Diana Ross] grew up in another neighborhood where [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson and his family grew up.  So, when we hear them on the radio it's like, "Oh, wait a minute, I know Smokey." You know, Diane?  And so, she said, "I'll, I'll get in touch, I'll, I'll try to get in touch with him," da, da.  Which she did and that's how we met and auditioned with The Miracles over at [HistoryMaker] Claudette Robinson's who later became Smokey's wife.  And that's when we met [HistoryMaker] Bobby Rogers, [HistoryMaker] Pete Moore, Smokey and Claudette in her basement and we auditioned for them.  It was wonderful.  Now, the big thing happened there, two big things happened.  They fell in love with our guitarist, Marvin Tarplin [Marv Tarplin], and in the middle of our audition, they asked Marvin, "Man, you play that guitar, can, can you play this?" Da, da, da.  They started talking to Marvin.  Before we know it Marvin's going with The Miracles, we lost Marvin.  The other thing of course we got an audition with Motown [Motown Records] with Berry and that came about through several people actually.  I think The Miracles one, and then there were a couple of other ways we got in there, which we did and we auditioned for [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy and there were several people who also saw us.  Mr. Gordy said--and we were sharp, I gotta say this.  We were in there, we were all matching, our skirts and our shoes and our socks and everything was matching and we sang our songs.  Diane did 'There Goes My Baby' by The Miracles [sic. The Drifters].  Florence [Florence Ballard], did you know 'Nighttime is the Right Time.'  I may have sang my ballad, I don't know, but they liked us.  Everybody there liked us and at the end Berry said, "Well," he says, "why don't you girls come back and see me after you graduate from high school."  Well, we were crushed, you know it's like, "What?"  And I remember when Florence was walking out of the building, when we all were walking out of the building, she said, "Hm, can't be that good if they don't know how good we are." (Laughter) And we're all kind of like, "Yeah, right.  What was all that about--'til we graduate from high school?'"
Story_ID: 647578
Speaker 1: And so, there was one writer who was in the room--several people, but one writer ran out to us, his name was Morris?
Speaker 2: Richard Morris, Richard Morris (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Richard Morris. And he said, he said, "Girls," he says, "listen.  I know a place where you can go." And we said, "Oh, yeah?"  And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."  So, we, you know, talked whatever and somehow or another he took us over to this record company called Lu Pine Records.  And, Mr. West [Robert West], I guess that guy's name is, and we actually did some recordings there with them.  The Falcons, I was trying to mention--remember the--some of the group's name, The Falcons and, The Falcons and a couple of other groups--oh, oh, oh, Wilson Pickett--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --was one of the others there.  I gotta wipe, again, sorry.  Wilson Pickett was one of, was a member of one of the groups and so we recorded a lot of things there.
Speaker 2: At Lu Pine?
Speaker 1: At Lu Pine Records, in fact Eddie Floyd, we did a lot of recordings with Eddie Floyd, and we sang with The Falcons and Wilson Pickett a little bit. And pretty soon we just said but this is, "We wanna be back at Motown [Motown Records]."  We--you know because Motown was had Marv Johnson, it was Mary Wells, it was The Miracles and they were--you could hear them on the radio.  That was the thing.  You could hear them on the radio, and we were like, "That's where we wanna be."  So, we just went back over to Motown and every day after school we would hitchhike to Motown, sit on the lawn.  Mary Wells would come by, "Hi, Mary!"  You know, so like, "Hey, it's Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson]! Pete [HistoryMaker Pete Moore]! Hi, hi." We, and so you know we just endeared ourselves to everyone.  We were there every day.  And so, one day some of the writers, producers came running out the doorway and they said, "Oh, my god, we got, we're in the middle of a session.  We need some handclaps, or some background vocals, or something."  I forgot which ones they wanted; and we said, "We'll do it!"  And that's how we got into Motown.
Story_ID: 647579
Speaker 1: You know I didn't know that [HistoryMaker] Janie Bradford was the receptionist.
Speaker 2: I was just, I was gonna bring her up too when, when I mentioned we ran out the door because she was there, but Janie Bradford, you see this, there's a string here--was also there with The Primes during the early days. She was there as well, so, Janie Bradford was there with The Primes.  She was also there at Motown [Motown Records] when we were first there and she wrote, helped write or wrote "Money, (That's What I Want)" by Barrett Strong.  So, she was kind of like always there.  Sometimes I forget to, to mention that, but she's one of the main characters in this as well.
Speaker 1: So, she had already started working with, with [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy with "Money" 'cause "Money" was earlier right.  So, she (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Bernie--Janie Bradford was, had gotten there before, but you know we all kind of--in fact, Otis Williams [HistoryMaker Otis Clayborn Williams] of The Temps [The Temptations] and I were talking about that.  We all kind of ended during the same time at Motown you know.
Speaker 1: But it's, so this is 19--this 1961, right?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, no.  We didn't, we signed our contract in '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 2: But we were there in '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960]?  So, all, '60 [1960].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, is this--were you helping at all?  Like you know, like running errands or things like that?  Are you, were you?
Speaker 2: No, I had my own job.  No, I, I had a job working in a record shop, and, and you know the record that was out?  And I hope that's the year, '60 [1960] it came out, was 'Green Onions.'  I sold a lot of 'Green Onions' (laughter), the record, but I was working at a record shop.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Diane [Diana Ross], and Diane--once we got there, Diane got a part time job working there at the company, but Florence [Florence Ballard], I don't think Florence ever, Florence never worked there, nor did Barbara [Barbara Martin].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you would just go and sort of hang out and see what was happening, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Every, everybody--
Speaker 1: Everybody.
Speaker 2: Everybody would go hang out at Motown, because it was such a happening place.  You know it was the kind of place that you wanted to be around.  Once--I always said Motown to me was like Disney world [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida] or Disneyland [Anaheim, California] you know, and we were all the rides, but we were (laughter), it was so much fun.  Many of the artists did get jobs there because, especially the older ones.  That way they could get paid, do the job at Motown, and still be around you know the music and everything as opposed to getting a job outside and then having to come into Motown.  So, that's kind of what happened there.  I remember The Contours. A couple of The Contours would have jobs driving, they would drive us to the record hops on the weekend.  So, that was kind of like their gig and they got paid doing it.  So, it, it was a place where everybody just wanted--you wanted to be there.  They had food there.
Speaker 1: Miss Lily, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, she would prepare lunches and this and that and so you could have your lunch there and, and all.  It was a family--as they say a family-run business and then Berry's father, Pops Gordy [Berry Gordy, Sr.] would do all the maintenance around and you could often drive up and you'd see him up on the ceiling you know or up on the roof repairing things.  His mother, Berry's mother [Bertha Fuller Gordy] was there doing things.  Mrs. Edwards [Esther Gordy Edwards], his sister I guess, ran the, the business area.  His brothers and sisters all worked there, so you know it, they brought in more of a family kind of a feeling for you, for the artists and then the artists became--and said, "Hey, Pops."  You know everyone was family.
Speaker 1: So, you, you, when you--I was--I thought--the description of when you, Berry Gordy the first time you auditioned, what did you think of him at first, 'cause you had heard about him, but I don't think you were--when is the first?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I thought much.  It was just the whole idea of being there.  As, as an individual, I don't think I thought much.  I, I shouldn't say it like that, I mean, I'm just thinking that the whole.
Speaker 1: The whole thing.
Speaker 2: The whole thing was kind of--and he was the man who was in charge you know so, (laughter) you know wanted to please or be you know and then you found out definitely he was the guy in charge when he said, "Come back and see me after you graduate." "Oh, that's the man."
Story_ID: 647580
Speaker 1: So you went over to Lu Pine [Lu Pine Records]; but didn't those records, the records never got released?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me tell you when we--years later, we never thought that anything happened to the records, you know we just walked away and just left it, but years later traveling in Europe someone brought up the al- CD [compact disc], not a CD, it was a record back then, it's still records you know, 45s [45 rpm record] and said, "Would you sign this?" And we looked at it and it was, it said, Lu Pine and it was one of our 'Tears of Sorrow,' our first song that we recorded there with them, Richard Morris and we're like, "We didn't know this was out."  So, we really never got paid for that, but it, it is a collector's item (laughter) these days, yes.
Speaker 1: I believe it, so but it, it had--so, it did get distributed in some way.  So, it may have gotten distributed in Europe or?
Speaker 2: There's a record--I do have a record of what has happened to it.  In fact, we had--there was a legal something that's--I think has been resolved, but I, I, I think it was released worldwide, I believe worldwide, but pretty much they are really collectors over there.  So, now it's everywhere, but I believe worldwide and England, not back here.  But see people are more into it there than here.
Speaker 1: Well that's a whole, I'm--when we take our--there, there's a whole thing about that I (unclear) find it a little disturbing.  But anyway, 'cause they, you know they have the collect--
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: They have a collection, of black music.
Story_ID: 647581
Speaker 1: So, Mary Wells is hot during this time, right?
Speaker 2: Mary Wells and Marv Johnson; and also Butterball--what's his name Popcorn, Popcorn Wylie.  They were, they were kind of like the major ones at Motown [Motown Records], yes.
Speaker 1: And what was she like?
Speaker 2: Mary Wells?  What was Mary Wells like?  Mary Wells--I would say pretty much like a--really a country kind of girl.  Not, not as sophisticated, because we're still talking about a time when pretty much everybody was you know out of the church kind of thing.  I would say still much a street kind of person, could jam.  I mean really, really could jam.  I, I didn't know her on a day to day basis, but I would say she's very nice, very nice, but definitely kind of church girl you know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Country roots, you know and still there.  Not really, she--I, I would imagine had she lived she would've you know evolved into another plateau there, but I think, I would say pretty much a country church girl.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that's who Berry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Street (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, street, well that's who [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy was banking on in the beginning too?
Speaker 2: And she, and she was really good, she was very, very good at what she did.  She wrote music as well, I think she wrote her first song.  Yeah, I, I think so because she had, she had what it took especially for that timeframe, you know for the rock and roll and what--there were very few females. Sorry, (wipes nose) golly, sorry.  So, so I would say that yes, definitely Motown was banking on Mary Wells.
Story_ID: 647582
Speaker 1: And was Ramona, was she helping run the office at the time when you guys were hanging around or was that later?  Ramona lo- his sec--
Speaker 2: She was, she--Ramona was there.  We always--Ray [Raynoma Gordy Singleton], that's why I said (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry, Ray.
Speaker 2: No, I'm not--you're right, that is her name, but we always called her Ray.  She definitely was in charge of I would say the music you know and everything that went on.  They were, they had the waiver voices that were, did all the background and so Ray was always there doing the music at that point.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know that, I think when I was talking to [HistoryMaker] Pete Moore, he was saying that she didn't get the credit she really deserves in many ways.
Speaker 2: She did, Ray did so much of the music back in the early days.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, was ahead of all that.
Speaker 1: Now when you say she was head of it, was she scheduling it, or what, when you said she was head of the music, what do you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, you know you have people who are head of the financial department.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You have people that are head of the booking departure, so she was over the music.  Obviously, there were other people there doing as well, [HistoryMaker] Mickey Stevenson, you know came in and became part of that.  So, they all were in the music department, let's put it that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And ran the music department, but each had probably you know a certain area that they did because I know that [HistoryMaker] Martha Reeves eventually came in and was working with Mickey Stevenson in the music department, but they had their expertise in certain areas.
Speaker 1: But she was, Martha Reeves was a secretary at first, right? But that's--I think she, she was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Martha Reeves--I'll let her tell her story, but Martha, Martha was, came in and just made herself secretary.  I mean that's her story.  I don't know, you know what I mean?   She said she came in, Mickey started singing, but when she came in she started doing work for him in a secretarial capacity.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so you--
Speaker 2: Hoping to soon be singing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I mean you get in you ha- and you go, go in any way you can, that's what I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and that's it.
Speaker 1: I mean that's, that's the way.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Everything in entertainment works that way, you try to go in any way you can.  So then how does the--how does the contract that you actually signed--so, you go in and you do the handclapping and everything, one time--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, and, and that's the other thing that I don't think people realize is that it really was, people were background singers, you know you were really playing different roles.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yes, that, the thing about Motown [Motown Records], it was such a new company that, and people were coming in from different areas and people were suggested--well, I know this person and you know they can do this very well so then they would come in and do whatever it is.  So, in the earlier days before it was very--you know, whoever was put in charge of something, you did do other things, you know.  Like I said we did handclaps for a while, we did backgrounds for a while and pretty soon Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] realized we were very serious, which I think he was unsure of, you know, four teenage girls coming into the company.  He didn't know if we were just gonna all get pregnant and you know, sue the company (laughter), you know all the guys running around.  But after he saw that we were very serious what we were doing, then he, he put us with--well, they first of all he recorded us on lots of different things with lots, lots of different producers and pretty soon he said, "You know, I, I think I'm gonna put you girls with my--one of my top writing teams." And that's when he put us with Holland Dozier Holland.  But up to that point, not only us but everyone else was just doing whatever they could to stay at Motown--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --and to prove themselves.
Story_ID: 647583
Speaker 1: When is there a Motown [Motown Records] song; I mean when, what--I'm just trying to figure out, even when you walk into the place you know like, where are people eating?  You know what--I hear there's an upstairs, is that where the business offices are?  I hear there's a second building, you know I'm just--when, when does the second building occur?
Speaker 2: Oh, you'll have to get that from someone else.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't have all that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I you know they, as, as they became, as Motown became more influential let's just say, you know they would add a building on here and there, and there and there probably ended up being, I don't know, three, or four or five buildings.  I don't' have--I just don't remember, but there's some people who could tell you all that.  But it was very well run I mean in terms of departments.  And at first, all, everything was in the one building so you would have a room here for that, and a room here for that so, it, and, and if lunchtime came then you would go to a certain place to eat.  So, it was very well, it wasn't just everything thrown in there.  It was very well run and as I mentioned earlier, Mr. Gordy's family was a--always had lots of businesses, so they were very knowledgeable about how to run a business.  And so, it was always run that way and everybody respected it that way, and I, I think, it, it, it was a lot more respectable than what people really thought it was.  People kind of think, "Oh, you got a lot of--a bunch of black folks running around."  It was just, it was just a beautiful place to be around.  You know everyone doing what they were supposed to do.  There was not cursing and things like that.  There were no drugs around during that time.  It was really nice.  It was pleasant to be around.
Speaker 1: It's exciting, I mean to be around music that sort of changed the world.  It did change the world.
Speaker 2: It was, it was very, also it was creative because you could see, they had a piano there.  You could see perhaps one time Marvin Gaye sitting at the piano playing something.  Then people would just sit and watch him.  (Unclear) the producers, everyone just watch him.  You could see Holland Dozier Holland putting together, "Man, what do you think about this?"  "Well, I don't know maybe we'll change."  You know you--so, it was all creative and I remember the time when--well, let me just say this one part leading up to when, before we really started recording The Supremes.  We were called the no-hit Supremes, because, because we didn't really have a hit yet, and we had all the other girl groups come in and they got a hit record.  We still didn't have one.  So, behind our back--now, I made up this phrase.  You'll find it everywhere now because I said it first and you can look in my book ['Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme,' Mary Wilson], no one said it before I said it.  They were talking behind our back, "Them Supremes (laughter)."  So, the one time--so, we were called--we, Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] would have us as his shadows.  No matter what was going on we'd be right behind Berry, just following behind Berry, you know, and this one day he said, "I got a genius coming in here today and I want you girls to stick with me.  I want you to be around."  I'm paraphrasing what he said, "But, I want you to check this out."  So, we're talking about, "A genius? Well, okay."  You know we were really excited about this and then pretty soon, little Stevie Wonder comes in, and he's every bit of I guess nine, maybe just going on nine, I'm not quite sure, and so we're watching him and we go into the studio.  He jumps on the keyboard and starts playing the piano and jumps on the drums and start beating the drums (makes noise), and you know he played every instrument in there and so we're saying, "Wow. Now that's what a genius is (laughter)."  So, this is what we were around all the time, seeing people come in and, and being just in a natural state just so creative.  That's what Motown was all about.
Story_ID: 647584
Speaker 1: We would go, we would travel the world and--working in all these great places.  Bern's Cafe in Sweden [Berns, Stockholm, Sweden] where the future king [Carl XVI Gustaf] would come and see us, well he didn't come and see us, his sister would drag him there, Princess Christina [Christina Magnuson] and then he'd just sit in the corner like this (demonstrates), but he became a future king.  So, you know we're starring there, and we'd go to--all the over the world and it was always Motown's Supremes.  I was, I, I--to me I wanted it to be The Supremes, and you find that then you see Elton John and all these people and they are in their own right who they are.  So, the thing that I'd say with Motown [Motown Records], we are very, we were very privileged to be there, but there's something that happens being--having so many under one umbrella.  It kind of sometimes can take away from your own space, or your own--
Speaker 2: What, what the--
Speaker 1: Who you are.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean the reason, the reason--I mean it was just that there were so many (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's what I'm saying there were so many of--
Speaker 2: --that became, that became big, I mean that's I think one or two people would have they'd be happy.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: But it just so, so many of you.
Speaker 1: There were so many of us.  I mean you've had, you--I mean let's name 'em; Temptations [The Temptations], Miracles [The Miracles], Marvelettes [The Marvelettes], Supremes, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas [Martha and The Vandellas], Stevie Wonder, you had Marvin Gaye--I mean The Contours, I mean go on and on--the Pips [Gladys Knight and the Pips].  It's on and on, and on.  Let's just put them under one umbrella and then get under on it.  Well, I'm very happy to say The Supremes are definitely still have our identity, The Supremes as The Supremes.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's true but now he [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] did--so, don't--let's go back to the contract negotiations because in the book ['Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme,' Mary Wilson], which I--you know you lay out the contract.  I'd never seen that, you know before, you know we've heard about how--you know that well there was--you know that it was hard to make money--based on the contract terms it was hard to make money.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so--but you're eager, like that day you signed your contract everyone is ecstatic, right, 'cause your parents [Wilson's mother, Johnnie Lewis Wilson] were there, right your parents were there?
Speaker 1: Yes, our parents were there.  When we, you see, the thing about--and I, I always have to say this because people bring it up.  In those days, the contracts that were given to artists were not very good (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's all--that's across the board.
Speaker 1: And, and many of them are still suffering from that.  So, what I thought and I'm very happy to say that the artists today have learned what we have, because we're talking about it and I'm very happy to say that the younger artists now, you know go in there saying, "Okay, we gotta get our contracts done," da, da. So they're taking care of that.  Back in those days we were so happy to, to be with anybody, we'd sign away anything, and this had been going on prior to The Supremes.  Supremes, Motown, we're the '60s [1960s], but this in the '50s [1950s] was going on, and some of those groups from the '50s [1950s] are to this day still dealing with that and passing, dying without any money.  So, when I finally realized that that was a big issue and people have really put me down for it, but I thought it was a big issue, not just Motown, it was as you said across the board.  I said you know, "I need to bring this out because even we fell into it."  We've, we gained a lot of things from Motown, but we also gave up some things.  We gave up our name, Supremes, so we never had ownership of it.  I didn't even know it until after Florence [Florence Ballard] was out.  So, we gave up that 'cause we didn't know anything, but we were happy to be there.  I'm very happy to say that Motown actually has given me a life, so I'm happy about that you know what I mean?  But yet and still I think that you have to say certain things in order for future generations not to fall into the same trap, trap.  Education is one of the main things that we need to give to our people coming up now so that they will know, "Get yourself a lawyer."  We did not have a lawyer, but you know like I say, we were happy to be there.  They said, "We'll take care of you."  We were like, "Great, we're here."  So, that was our--we gave that up.  So, you know you can't others, but yet and still somebody needs to say what it is and if I'm the one that said it and put it in the book, and a lot of people are not happy with me for saying that, but I know that I have helped the generations to come by saying: "This is what happens if you don't get your own at- attorney."
Story_ID: 647585
Speaker 1: People are saying, "Well don't bite the hand that fed you." But at the same time--I think people--you know the thing is, is that you're kids.  I mean you couldn't--you're kids and it's a black community and the fact is--
Speaker 2: It is but you know the thing that I see in looking back is that everyone is just trying to make it.  So, back in those days they were just trying to make it and they were trying to do the best they could, and that's fine.  And, I, I totally get it, but I still felt it was my obligation to, to talk out so that, you know, we can get the record straight and then we can go on and, and everything, everyone at that point will be able to get there, but back then black people were just trying to get it straight themselves.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, I, I wrote about it, but I didn't write about it with any animosity.  I just wrote the facts.  It's like I remember that TV show ['Dragnet'], "Just the facts ma'am, just the facts."  What was that Jack Webb or whatever (laughter), "Just give me the facts."  I was giving the facts and, and trust me I have a lot of people who are upset with me about that and I just have to take that, but I feel that someone has got to help the future generations go forward, and, and get the record straight.
Speaker 1: Well I hope there's a coming together too 'cause, I mean nothing, nothing before and nothing--I don't think it'll ever happen again, and you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I hope, I hope to be a part of that not happening again, I really do.  And as I said, I didn't do it with any animosity, I did what you know, I guess in, in I.V [Wilson's maternal aunt, I.V. Lewis Pippin] and John L.'s [Wilson's maternal uncle, John L. Pippin] mirror in thinking you, trying to seek the truth is what I was trying to do.
Speaker 1: Right, so now every--so, you have, so you, you sign your contract and then?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'll tell you, we signed the contract and we were very happy, okay (laughter).  Several things happened when we signed that contract.  First of all, we found out that perhaps Barbara [Barbara Martin] was expecting and she may not be in the group.  Although she did record the first album ['Meet The Supremes'] with us, which a lot of people are not aware of.  I don't think she ever got paid for that, for that as well.  So, that was one of the things.  The other thing is that my mother [Johnnie Lewis Wilson] couldn't read or write, so you know she knew I wanted to do this, so she just signed it.  So, we signed and, and also on that paper is when we signed away our name, Supremes [The Supremes], it said if, "If ever--any name that you will get from here on will belong to the management." And that's when we had to change our name from Primettes [The Primettes] to Supremes.  So, we lost our name upon that.  So, that's one of the things I, I've also wrote out because you know we didn't or couldn't read the small print, but our kids now cannot use that as an excuse, they must read the small print, or get someone to read it for them.
Speaker 1: Who do you think developed the contracts for Motown [Motown Records]?  You think they were following other contracts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I don't want to get into that.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear), okay.
Speaker 2: Because then I would be getting into another area and I will get upset (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, sorry. Okay, okay but I was just, I was just--okay, sorry.  Okay, I was just thinking, (unclear) maybe if they were going---they just went and found some contracts.
Speaker 2: No, not it was, it was, it was, it was done.
Story_ID: 647586
Speaker 1: So talk about 1961 and what, what things you're doing in 1961 because that's before the Mo- 'Motortown Revue' was 1961.
Speaker 2: Well, 1961 was when we [The Supremes], when we signed our contract, so we actually became a really, you know a, a bonafide member of the Motown [Motown Records] family, 1961.  We were still in high school [Northeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan] and we were still recording, we were still doing record hops.  We were moving forward and basically waiting just to graduate from high school.  Our parents wanted us to go to college, and it was amazing because I remember speaking to Eddie Holland and well, actually that's before, that's right after--that's '64 [1964], that's '63 [1963], so we, we were basically just still in school, biding our time.  We couldn't go on any, any tours because we were still in high school.  We didn't do that until after high school, after '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: So that your parents can't be thinking you're going to, to college if they just signed you off right, or they were?
Speaker 2: No, no we, that, it was not something that you, you thought in one, one context.  You know what I mean (laughter), they still think we're just doing this for fun you know and this would maybe get money, you know be paid for the things we're doing, because we are spending a lot times there, so it was more that than, than the realization that we were going to college, you know came in terms of us saying, graduating right and saying, "Okay, what are you gonna do for the rest of your life now?  You have really got to decide something here, you can do this singing but you still--you're going to college."  So, we told our, we told Motown, Eddie Holland and Brian Holland that, "Listen, if we don't get a hit record, no matter what, we're gonna have to go to college and it still--everything will be hold, we'll still be singing," da, da, da, "but we gonna have to go to college 'cause our parents are insisting that we get an education."  So, it wasn't something that we were all sitting in one room and said, "Okay, guys we gotta decide right now, Motown or college."  The two never really met, (laughter) you know what I mean.  They just assumed that we were definitely going to be going to college.
Story_ID: 647587
Speaker 1: And so you're, you're, are--you're performing around Detroit [Michigan] at this point.  Did you go--other, you went up to I think Inkster [Michigan], I mean Michigan?  I'm trying to think during that--
Speaker 2: We, we toured, we toured on the weekends anywhere in a proximity of say Ohio and things like that.  We never went further than that because we had--it was only for the weekends until we graduated, once we graduated then of course we toured.  Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]--I remember we did Pittsburgh, we did some things in--well, after that of course the Motown revue ['Motortown Revue'] we did the, the history.
Speaker 1: Talk about--
Speaker 2: Mississippi and the South.
Speaker 1: Right, so talk about that.
Speaker 2: Sorry, let me dry off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Turkessa [Wilson's daughter, Turkessa Ferrer Babich], you think--I think I should get some powder (unclear).
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERUPTION)
Speaker 2: Because I started writing this history as it was happening, I started noting certain things that I just felt as a--I feel I am a writer, Mr. Boone [David Boone] was right.  You know I really do like detailed things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And this, and so it's part of the story.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, if someone else outside it says it then you know people kind of, I don't know if they accept it, but I mean they're outside so it's okay, but if you're inside and you write about it, it becomes something else and I think that I've probably fallen in that category, but I really do like to document things.  I always have.  I'm very observant and that's why writing all my diaries and things, you know.  That's how I wrote my book ['Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme,' Mary Wilson].
Speaker 1: Do you still have those diaries?
Speaker 2: I'm not telling if I still have those diaries.  I might have to have a bonfire (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's off camera, we're not recording I'm just.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We're recording.
Speaker 1: Oh, we are?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay well (laughter), okay.  I think those would be very valuable, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm all into archives and preservation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean I am, okay, so talk about the 'Motortown Revue'?
Speaker 2: Oh, the Motown revue was a great, it was a great tour.  The one sad part for us is that we were not on the earlier tours because we couldn't go because we were in high school [Northeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan], and when we finally got on them it was great.  You had The Contours, you know Stevie [Stevie Wonder], Temps [The Temptations], Marvelettes [The Marvelettes], Mary Wells and it was so much fun.  It was fun because we were all together in the bus.  We lived together, and, and then we would, you know we were touring in the South and we were going to different places and we had to stay on the bus, we had to dress on the bus.  You know all these wonderful things, get off the bus and guys would go and tee tee off on the side of the bus, you know it was a raggedy bus and, and we had a great experience of what the music was doing, 'cause a lot of times we would perform in segregated places, not a lot almost, almost--probably 80 percent of the time they were segregated, and you would have on one side the white audience and on the other side you would have the black audiences, and then at the end pretty much they'd all come together and the music was just great, and people loved the music, and this was our first time doing something in the big arena, you know out in the big arena as opposed to just in Detroit.  So, it was, it was not only fun, but very educational because we--you learned about people and you learned who you could live with, who you couldn't.  It was being that close to everyone, you really got a chance to see how people inter--interchanged with each other and I, I always wrote about that as well.  So, it was fun, it was fun.  It was also seeing that your music, your creativity, things that you had seen in Motown that was being created, now is out in the arena.  You've seen how while you're reaching people.  All of that was very, very--no, it just showed me that I knew this is--I was doing the right thing in my life, I mean just like when I met Flo [Florence Ballard], Diane [Diana Ross] and Betty [Betty McGlown] I knew that that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  I mean when I actually performed for Frankie Lymon and stuff, I knew that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  So now all of a sudden, you're out there in the world and you're performing and you're performing to all people, not just black people who we were accustomed to performing to.  You're performing before all people; and, and you're seeing how the music is touching these people.  So, it was, it was just an amazing time.
Story_ID: 647588
Speaker 1: So who was on the tour with you as, as chaperones and you know respon- Esther Gordy [Esther Gordy Edwards]?  Was she?
Speaker 2: The chaperones varied [of the 'Motortown Revue'].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The chaperones varied and oftentimes it would come from the, the maternal part of Berry's [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] family.  Oftentimes, it would be friends of theirs, Mrs. Powell [HistoryMaker Maxine Powell] came in but she came in later actually.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Morrison?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Morrison was there, and one lady--well, she came in later, Marjorie Wooden came later, but it was, Mrs. Morrison was our main one, she was the earlier one.  Mrs. Powell came later, and then also--a beautiful lady, Loucye Gordy [Loucye Gordy Wakefield] who passed away early.  This was Berry's, one of his younger sisters, and she was out with us--I think she was out with us when we first became, did start doing the nightclubs, and she helped us in lots, in lots of areas you know with the dress 'cause she was kind of closer to our age and she was really beautiful out there with us.  So, we, we did have a lot of chaperones, but mostly they were from I think the family, families you know the female family part.
Speaker 1: And you know, I was surprised that Diane [Diana Ross], Diana's mother [Ernestine Moten Ross] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm sorry I forgot, I'm so sorry, Mrs. Ross was our, our main chaperone from very early on.  Oh, and she was great, Mrs. Ross was tall, attractive, very nice, very nice and fair you know being that Diane was her daughter.  She was fair to all of us, which was really good and of course we knew her very well from when were The Primettes, so that made it very nice that, that she was our earlier--and she loved to play cards.  So, she and, and Mr. Maurice King would always play bid whist and that was one of the things.  I think, yes, Mrs. Ross was on the early Dick Clark--she was on one of those tours with us and traveled along; and she, so she was great, she was always just great.
Story_ID: 647589
Speaker 1: What impressed me about the Dick Clark tour [Caravan of Stars], which was separate from--'cause 'Motortown Revue' you know you're talking about being in the southern parts--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you know the water fountains and then you--did, someone died?
Speaker 2: On one of the tours, Motown revue tours, one--a couple of people, yes, passed away.  It was a terrible.
Speaker 1: Beans [Thomas "Beans" Bowles]?
Speaker 2: No, not Beans.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: It was a terrible accident on the bus, no, no they--actually they were not on the bus.  We had some in the cars that were driving and then we had the bus.  The car accident happened with one of the drivers and it was absolutely, it, it kind of really messed all of us up because we were out there happy doing the tour and all this stuff and then we got word back that they had, had the car accident, and that.
Speaker 1: One of them was beheaded right?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know, don't remember.
Speaker 1: So, the Dick Clark tour though, that was, that was--'cause I was impressed that he actually traveled with, with you and so he--'cause this (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 647590
Speaker 1: I mean I think of Dick Clark, so can you talk about that tour [Caravan of Stars], or do you even know how that tour came to be (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the thing about--first of all we're--[HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy has put us with Holland Dozier Holland to record music for us, and in '63 [1963] we recorded a number of songs, and everyone was very excited about them, because now all of a sudden maybe The Supremes will have a hit.  And it, the first one that they released was 'When the Lovelight Starts Shining Though His Eyes,' and it became a hit.  It wasn't our major hit, but it became like a top on the charts you know.  One, first it was bubbling under and then I think it went to the top.  They had had, in those days the cash (unclear) would top one hundred and so pretty soon--it's on the charts.  So, they're saying, "Okay, we think we got the hits for The Supremes." And, then when they released, 'Where Did Our Love Go,' someone at Motown [Motown Records] said, said we got a call from Dick Clark who wants to book Brenda Holloway, Holloway? Holliday?
Speaker 1: It's Holloway.
Speaker 2: I always get the two--Holloway, we want to, he wants to have Brenda Holloway on his tour.  His tour is massive, I mean you know it's from 'American Bandstand,' it's got The Drifters, The Shirelles, da, da, da.  And they said he wants Brenda Russell--or Brenda Holloway because she has a hit record, (singing) "Every little bit hurts" ['Every Little Bit Hurts'], and he wants to have her on.  And so, they said, "Well okay you can have her but we also want you to take The Supremes."  So, they said, "The who?"  They said, "The Supremes."  They said, "Well, no we just want Brenda Holloway."  They said, "No, but in order to get Brenda Holloway you gotta take The Supremes 'cause they have a hit record that's coming out."  Now, this was the Esther Edwards' [Esther Gordy Edwards] department that, you know who books, and the head of Motown and everything, and so (laughter), it's my understanding they had to do a lot of convincing to take them, to take The Supremes in order you know to get, you know, Brenda.  And so, the big thing was, here we were.  We're gonna go on the Dick Clark tour, which is a biggie, right?  Drifters, Shirelles, Brenda Holloway, da, da, da and others, (laughter) and we were the, and, others, right?  He did know who we were but anyway we go on the tour.  Gene Pitney is the headliner and we're on this tour and the three of us we're always dressing up and put a--Dick said, "Every time we see The Supremes they're back there putting on makeup and," da, da, da, "and combing their hair and always being prissy, prissy, prissy and always doing harmonies."  We were always doing that.  So, he always talked about us you know because of that.  He really liked us actually but had no idea what we were doing.  Anyway, two or three weeks after we were on the tour, and they had released 'Where Did Our Love Go.'  The record became a hit, surprised everybody including us, right.  So, every night he said, "And here they are The Supremes." They went clapping, and we're touring the South all over the world.  Nobody had no idea who we were, and then it got louder and louder (clapping), and one day the crowd went berserk.  Well, we thought--we're back there we're getting ready to go on.  We thought that maybe Gene Pitney had stuck his head out and the kids saw him and went crazy.  But it was for us, because the record had actually become a smash all over America, and I remember they actually flew us home.  The first time we had ridden on an airplane, flew us home because our record became so big they wanted to start, you know doing all the PR [public relations] for us and whatever, and, but everyone always loved us because we were always good even though we didn't have a hit record we were just, you know we were still good, but that's when we became famous on, on that tour, and you, but you did mention about Dick.  Let me just bring this up about Dick (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I thought, thought it surprised--you know 'cause he was in the bus then.
Speaker 2: But you take--when I said earlier about people like Milton [Milton Jenkins], or Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] or whatever, they were in this whole sort of thing about finding your place where you go.  So, they loved the music, they're in it because they love the music.  They're not in it for--I mean maybe money and all that stuff, yes, but I'm saying the point is Dick Clark was one of those people who got into it because he loved the music.  He wanted to be out there on the road with the music.  He was as happy as we were signing it, he was happy doing his thing.  So, it was all, we were all together.  But that was his, he was in management you know putting it all together, but his joy was in the music.  So, he loved being out there with us.
Story_ID: 647591
Speaker 1: Was there any racial dynamics at that time, you know on that tour?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In '64 [1964]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964].
Speaker 1: No, no I know, but I'm talking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What I'm saying is we were, we were doing this at the same time that was going on, of course.
Speaker 1: No, but I'm saying on that--but with him, when you're on the Dick Clark tour [Caravan of Stars], within the groups themselves?  I--you're looking at me (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm listening to you.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm trying to see what, 'cause I'm getting ready to tell you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because I don't remember.
Speaker 2: --what I think you're talking about.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But I'm gonna let you finish to see what (unclear).
Speaker 1: No, I'm just trying to understand that--I understand, that's been well reported about what happened, you know a lot of the things that happened and some of the tensions, but I didn't see that in your book ['Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme,' Mary Wilson] about tensions with you know, within the groups.  It's an integrated tour that's going out, right?
Speaker 2: The thing, I, I, may be missing what you're asking but there's not tension within the groups and the music.  That's one thing that people don't seem to get.  We've--blacks and white have worked together on stage.  You don't have it, you just don't have that because people are pretty much all about the creativity, and if you have creativity in it you don't really have any, "I don't like that person."  It's all about seeing that, that beauty of the creativity and working with it.  So, you don't, you don't really have that.  On the tour with, with Dick Clark the one thing that I always liked is if we were going to a town and, and they would always of course have everything mapped out where you could stay and all this stuff, so we didn't have a lot of that, but sometimes you did just have to stop and when that happened Dick was always the kind of person who would say, "If all of us can't eat here, none of us will."  And he'd just take the bus and go on, that's the kind of guy he was.  So, you know we, we--they probably kept us away from a lot of that, the ugliness; but it was all there because it's all going on.  But the music was the one thing that made it all happy.
Story_ID: 647592
Speaker 1: Now HDH, talk about them and their, you know their role with you; and also when they start--can you just talk about them, and?
Speaker 2: HDH was really great to work with, HDH being Eddie [Eddie Holland] and Brian Holland, who were brothers, and Lamont Dozier.  Lamont was a singer, as was, Brian was a singer and I guess they all came together because they just didn't do the singing well, whatever and this is how they came together.  When Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] put us [The Supremes] with them, it changed our life first of all because they came up with these songs that were--just made us hits and it actually put them on the map as well.  Of course, they were doing things with the Four Tops, kind of just starting with them as well.  So, we all kind of began to, to rise in terms of, of our talents.  Holland Dozier Holland were just great guys to work with as a team because they each had areas that they were strong in.  Eddie was a guy who did a lot of lyrics, mostly lyrics.  So, the lyric contents of these songs, you listen to them today they're just beautiful.  People study that, and he was just an expert at doing it, and both Brian and Lamont were musical, are musical geniuses.  So, working together with them was great because they would each get with us and Eddie would teach Diane [Diana Ross] the lyrics, he'd teach people you know like Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops and, so they had just a great work of teamwork of working with the artist, and you never, people said, "Well, did you want to write songs?"  Well, we never did have to because they did--they were so, you know they were like geniuses in their right.  It's like you couldn't top what they were doing.  So, they were just great.  I always felt comfortable, I know Diane felt comfortable working with Eddie.  You felt like you were learning, you know it was all a learning curve.  It's, it's one of those things where you were with people that--you, were teaching you the best things.  So, it was about just learning and creating, very, very wonderful people to work with.
Speaker 1: And I notice you still call her Diane 'cause that's her, her birth name.
Speaker 2: No, people get into me calling her Diane, and it's like sometimes it really pisses me off because--well, because everyone brings it up.  They think that I come from a place--
Speaker 1: Oh no, no, no.
Speaker 2: I'm not saying you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm saying it's always brought up in--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --in this thing, "Well, and so you know her name is Diana, why do you call her Diane?"  It's like my sister, I call my sister Cat.  Her name is Catherine [Cathy Wilson] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry, I wanna understand.
Speaker 2: I don' call her Catherine, I call her Cat, 'cause that's the person I know, it's the person I love, the person I understand and it's hard to break old habits.
Speaker 1: Right.  No, I under- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, you know the other person just like that?
Speaker 1: We're gonna change--(unclear).
Speaker 2: Another person who's like that is Muhammad Ali.
Story_ID: 647593
Speaker 1: You also, when, when Holland Dozier Holland--
Speaker 2: You can ask me that now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you called--(laughter) I can ask you, okay.  So you, you call her Diane [Diana Ross]?
Speaker 2: I call her Diane because I know Diane, I love Diane and that's who I know, and I'll give you a great example so maybe people can understand this and get off my back.  My sister's name is Catherine [Cathy Wilson].  I don't think I've ever called her Catherine.  I call her Cat, so that's just my little thing and then that's all.
Speaker 1: Now when, when HDH gets assigned to you, Holland Dozier Holland, you don't like the songs?  I mean you're, you're like, "What are these songs?"  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, well when HDH brought us the songs, per- and I, I don't think any of us really cared for it because you know as I said before the other girl groups; The Marvelettes and, and The Vandellas all--they were, had some soulful songs and so we wanted soulful songs too, and when they brought us these songs, they were so simple and, and we also didn't have much to sing.  Flo [Florence Ballard] and I didn't have hardly anything to sing in 'em, in all unison where we come up singing harmony.  So, when they're bringing the songs they're all unison, singing just, "Baby, baby, ooh baby, baby, baby, baby."  We're like, "What is that, that's not singing, we're not doing what--."  So, we felt that we were doing less than, than we were capable and also the main thing though we wanted to be more soulful.  We were envious of you know Martha and The Vandellas and all the other girls being, you know R and B singing, getting down (laughter), and so we told the guys that, "You know we really need some hit records, because if we don't get a hit record we're not gonna--we're gonna have to go to college" (laughter). You know and they said, "Trust us, these songs are going to be smashes." That's what they use to say, "They're a smash."  So, we had to, we had to record them because we were not high on the totem pole, and so we had to do whatever they you know said, so we had to sing them, but we were not very happy about it.  But--for in, in our defense, once we started singing songs we'd get into them, we so we did the very best, we never slouched on any of it, but you know we just wanted, we wanted one of The Marvelettes' songs or one of The Vandellas' songs you know 'Heat Wave' you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were there--have they, how do you think that happened though?  I mean do you think it was--obviously, Mr. Gordy, he believes in you as a group you know 'cause he's put a lot of investment--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How, how is it, because Diane, Diana or Diane, whatever had more of a--they said pop sound, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so are they thinking that this is good, I mean that's what I'm trying to wonder.  What is going--because he's very much, Mr. Gordy's very much a songwriter himself.
Speaker 2: He is a songwriter, I mean his heart and soul is song, songwriting.  I think the guys--see a lot of times it has to do with whoever the artists are themselves or where, where the writers are themselves and these songs were songs that they came up with.  I, I don't they were thinking so much that--and I can't speak for them you know you have to talk to them, but I don't think that, in speaking to them they were saying, "We're gonna make these songs for The Supremes."  I, I think it just sort of evolved and, and then in, in writing them, then they you know said, "Well, oh okay, this is right then we'll give this to The Supremes."  So, it's hard to say you know where, where they, where they are as writers at that time.
Speaker 1: And then so, so Eddie Holland says to you--I think it's Eddie Holland who says, "We're gonna give--Diane's gonna sing the, the lead and these are gonna be your parts." Right?  Is that when that starts happening and then?
Speaker 2: No, [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy, that, that's all Berry's decision in terms of who he wants to place at, at the, in the lead spot.  That was not for Eddie--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and the guys.  No, this all came from, from Mr. Gordy.
Story_ID: 647594
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then when that happens how do you--'cause it takes time--you, you--to sing unison.  It's different from singing harmony?
Speaker 2: Well, some people would say it's easy to sing unison (laughter), you just--but it really isn't, but it, it is something.
Speaker 1: Just because the description of you and Flo's [Florence Ballard] voices were (unclear).
Speaker 2: Our voices [The Supremes], Florence's voice and my voice was totally different.  In fact, I took the lead from Florence on, on almost everything because she had a, a lead quality--not sound, but her, her soul and everything was--that's who she was.  So, I mean I, I always followed her and when, but when these songs were brought to us, a lot of those songs and I'm, I'm getting this from Eddie Holland, said, you know, like my voice was softer and so they would have to kind of--Florence was strong, too strong so like on, 'Where Did Our Love Go' you basically hear my voice on the background part, and then on some of the songs like, 'Come See About Me' you really heard Flo.  Flo was like, (singing) "Come see about," you know she was just jamming like she was in church.  So, it depended on what the song called for.  Who was the one more dominant in it, and then of course you mentioned the, the unison parts.  That was easy to do because I just followed Flo you know, and let her take the lead whatever, but our, to me our harmonies were really great and our voices were very distinct.  You could hear Flo's top voice at a very, very strong top and I was the alto.  Then Diane, Diane [Diana Ross] and Flo's voice were pretty much kind of the same timbre in terms of being soprano.
Speaker 1: Now do you, you know--but each person has their own personalities and at that time you know people liked the different personalities (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, they're camps (laughter).
Speaker 1: Huh?  No, they would choose.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, "Like I like So and So, I--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --like their look, you know, I like--."
Story_ID: 647595
Speaker 1: What is happening in the group [The Supremes] at this point in time?  I mean you're all enjoying your--you know you're on the rise.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what is happening in the Motown [Motown Records] family?  Are people making comments like, "Why are they getting so much attention?" You know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, well there, it was always there in terms of whoever now has a hit record is where all the attention goes, and so whoever did not then you had that little backlash and that was always there, but it was not the kind of thing I would think where people think there was hatred or that kind of thing.  We all really--that, the, the best part about Motown and all the artists there, everyone looked up to everybody you know.  Really, everyone liked everybody.  That, that was the best thing about Motown, but when someone did get a hit record, say first it was Mary Wells, everybody kind of looked up to Mary.  Then if someone else say The Marvelettes came in, and they come in after whatever and they get a hit record--yeah, you might have a little thing where, "Oh, my god." You know, but still I--we were friends, because I remember when The Marvelettes were singing one of the songs, Florence [Florence Ballard] actually went in to help Gladys Horton to, to nail the lead part on that, on, on 'Please Mr. Postman.'  So--you, people helped each other.  It wasn't an animosity kind of thing, but yes, if you were at top then the others you know were feeling a little left out, which made you work harder.  You know in fact, that's what happened.  A lot of times you, you really knew you had to work harder so that hopefully this next record that was released would be a hit and then you would be in that spot, and, that, that was always pretty much how people saw it.  Some people maybe never got the hit record, you know.  May have really felt left out, so I'm--that's just human nature, but I, I think we all enjoyed each other enough and liked each other and admired, because everybody there was good you know.  Gladys Knight would be singing so soulful, if The Temps [The Temptations] were singing and you know, you'd be standing out the door just listening, you know you were enjoying it.
Speaker 1: That's what--I mean everybody has said uniformly, they talk about family, they talk, love, love.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: They talk about- [HistoryMaker] Valerie Simpson was talking about, you know, in each room you could hear different people rehearsing and so it's you know--'cause that, that's--
Speaker 2: And you, you would hang around, say if you knew The Temps were going to be recording at six [o'clock] and it was like four, you would hang around to, to listen to them record.  So, it was always that, that's why I've always told everyone that we really, really did--and even now you know if I hear that Smokey's [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] coming in town I'll run over and see the show you know.  We just kind of admire, that's what I think I'm trying to--we all admired everybody there, 'cause you recognized talent so that you didn't have to hate someone for their talent.  We really--even we were talking about the black and white situation on the road, it was the same thing.  I remember we would hang out on the buses with a lot of the white artists and we'd just have a ball 'cause we--everyone admired, you admire talent and creativity.  There's a different thing from ordinary living.  Creativity is, is a beautiful--to be a part of it, it's like magic.  You're part of magic, so I mean how could you hate magic (laughter), you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: But he, Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] also fostered family, the family atmosphere in a competitive way, right?  He fostered that?
Speaker 2: I don't know, you have to tell me what you mean (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I mean he--well, this whole Motown song, and love, love is family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that all came from his family, his roots.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2: He carried that on through that, but, but that was not anything different from what the artists were.  I mean we--like is said all of us grew up in a family situation where holidays were always a family.  So, that's--he just carried that there; and it was good because we all understood it.  It wasn't like something different that no one understood (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 647596
Speaker 1: So talk, talk about the, the--your first tour to the UK [United Kingdom].
Speaker 2: We, well, we had the, you know, the, we were flown home from the Dick Clark tour [Caravan of Stars] and we were given this whole new sort of itinerary of events because the record ['Where Did Our Love Go'] now was also a hit in, in the UK and I guess the sales--see, the sales department was a big part of Motown [Motown Records] and it was basically white, Barney Ales was a white gentleman.  Everyone loved him he was so much fun, but they handled the sales and I guess you know, you mind if I--don't get me to start telling you who, who was in what, but anyway they said, "Okay, we're do it--take The Supremes over to the UK and introduce that market to kind of Motown."  Records in Motown had been selling in the UK for a while.  People knew of, of 'em, you know you'd listen to The Beatles and Rolling Stones [The Rolling Stones] and all kind of people and they said they've been hearing the music.  So, now this is the opportunity from the sales department and go to really get that market open and The Supremes have a hit record.  So even though other people may have been known over there, it was The Supremes who opened the door wide and so we went over and we did a lot of promotion for our record and they were just releasing "Baby Love," which became number one.  So, then of course, they wanted to take the whole Motown revue ['Motortown Revue'] over there.  Now, this causes problems because we had before that been the ones who were the no hit Supremes.  Now, you have the people who were the stars, The Miracles, The Temps [The Temptations], the da, da, da, all these people, they're no longer stars, we are.  I never--they never said this to me and, and I don't know it for a fact but I think they were really pissed that we were now the ones who were you know the stars, we had the hit record there.  And we went over there and unfortunately the tour didn't do well 'cause it was just us, we had the hit record right, but the tour was you know, the Motown revue tour has come over to England and we had the other theater gigs, people didn't--no one showed up.  The problem was they did the TV show ['The Sound of Motown'] and they didn't release the TV show with all of us on it until after the tour was over.  So, you had--and Dusty Springfield was the person who, who got us over there.  I don't know what market he [sic.] is, but everyone knows Dusty Springfield, but she talked 'em into doing the TV show so we did it.  After we left then the tour, then everything became a bit hit, but they were calling it the ghost tour because no one showed up.  I mean it was you know, maybe a hundred people in the theater, those huge theaters, right?  So, this was a really a smack in our faces because--but we were taking pictures all over the place you know, oh we were like the--I remember on newspaper said, "Three black negresses have just landed on the shores of Great Britain." So, you know you had all that going on but still people hadn't really gotten into all the music.  So, the tour was not a success, but it certainly did break, break open the doors after when the TV show came on, then it was a big smash and from then on.
Speaker 1: Now talk about which TV show this is?
Speaker 2: This is--you're right.  The TV show was, oh gee I can't remember it.  I'll come back to--it'll come back to me.  Ask me that a little later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause we did 'Top of the Pops', so it wasn't that it was--in fact, this was out on, on a DVD [digital video disc].
Speaker 1: 'Cause you did--I mean you did a lot of TV shows (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure we did a lot.
Speaker 1: Lot, lots, lots.
Speaker 2: And we did loads of TV, as, as The Supremes the first time before the Motown revue tour came over, but we did all the major--we did like, it was like the Dick Clark Caravan [Caravan of Stars]--Dick Clark and 'Bandstand' ['American Bandstand'] and all that over in the UK.
Speaker 1: But during the ghost tour, you're now riding in a separate car with Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy], right?  Isn't that, that's, that 'cause I think--
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes we did, we, we, it, what it--we all started out together and then initially, then we, we were put up into a mansion where we stayed with the duke and duchess of--
Speaker 1: London [England]?
Speaker 2: No, it was, it was Lord [Alistair Londonderry] and Lady Londonderry [Nicolette Harrison Powell], and we stayed at their palace and so yeah, we had different you know, rides and there were--else was on the bus.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, but this--now, this--
Speaker 2: That ended up being a big scandal too, but that's another thing.
Speaker 1: Like what, what's that?
Speaker 2: That for the royalty, yes--one of the, the Londonderrys fell in love with, with--the female fell in love with the English star on our tour.  It was George, Georgie Fame, and so they broke up, the Londonderrys broke up and Georgie married Lady Londonderry, and that was all while we were there at the palace.  So, that's us--a bit of royalty history there.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That you were part of (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you know I just heard that Georgie Fame, just someone who worked with Georgie Fame is ill.  I've gotta call him in England.  Anyway that's (laughter)--all these friendships last forever, that's another thing about entertainers.  You, you meet back then and you end up--it's like this one huge family; and we're all kind of part of it, but it's a musical family.
Story_ID: 647597
Speaker 1: So, now this is--when you come back or before is when [HistoryMaker] Maxine Powell is hired?  Is she, has she already been training you as to?
Speaker 2: I'm, I, I don't know the exact date (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exact date.
Speaker 2: That Mrs. Powell came, but you see the, the department [at Motown Records] was called artist development and it was--they came, people came in at different times.  You had Cholly Atkins who was the choreographer, you had Mrs. Maxine Powell who was the finishing school person.  Maurice King who I've spoken to earlier who was the big band leader back at the Flame Show Bar [Detroit, Michigan].  You also had Harvey Fuqua who was part of that whole sort of artist development, and it, it probably happened sometime in 1965 or so, maybe a little earlier than that.  So, when it was found out that we would start, we Supremes would go into some of the clubs, nightclubs, Copacabana [New York, New York], Cocoanut Grove [Los Angeles, California], Talk of the Town [Hippodrome] in London [England] then they started saying, "Okay we need to put the--make this department work hands on with the artist."  Whereas before we may have been doing a record, they would teach us the choreography for that, da, da, so individually, but now there was a concerted effort to really put together shows for these clubs, and we The Supremes were the first ones to, to go into like the Copacabana and there was, you know that's when we really started working hard.  So, we were working with Mrs. Powell before that, shortly before that but you know just as individual classes.  So, they put together our first nightclub act for the Copacabana and we were the first artists to kind of open those doors.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I, I, I had read Mr. Gordy's [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] book ['To Be Loved,' Berry Gordy] about the Copacabana that, that was such a huge, huge deal and what he had worked with.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know I came across someone who is--her father was in the audience there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that night with them.
Story_ID: 647598
Speaker 1: But can you talk about that, because really in some respects, isn't this a whirlwind; everything's coming so quickly?
Speaker 2: When The Supremes got the first million seller, everything started moving, period, because now it's opening doors, you know for the record industry because we never got Grammys [Grammy Award] early on 'cause we were just not part of that whole--all that's happened, but this now puts us into the arena of you know the recording, really the big time I guess we would call it.  Yeah, so it was a time when things definitely moved up, the--that a group was--a rock and roll group was going into the Copacabana [New York, New York] was a major thing.  I mean because prior to that you only had people like you know, Sammie Davis, Jr., Nat King Cole, you know all those kind of people--Frank Sinatra, going into those places and into Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada].  You, you know you--so, rock and roll artists didn't, weren't doing that.  So, all of a sudden now The Supremes are doing that.  So, it was, it was like major and of course they wanted to get the best show possible, but we had been doing shows as The Supremes prior so we were pretty, I won't say ready, but we were all, already into doing standard material.  So, it, it makes sense that it was us.  We weren't just doing the record, the hit records and we were doing things that were Broadway kind of shows, people, we already were doing it so now they said, "Okay, let's get all this together, everybody working here put together a show."  So pretty much everything that they put together we had already done.  Cholly Atkins brought in other things, really top hats and canes, you know and so we did those type things.  So, we were really the ones to do it at that time and once we did the Copa and got rave reviews and everybody who was anybody showed up, you know Walter Cronkite, Cronkite, (laughter) you know showed up.  I remember the--what was it, the, the, 'Where did Our Love Go' went to the moon, it was one of the songs that they used in the moon and Gemini spaceship [Project Gemini] or something.  So, we were so hot it just all made sense for the Copa and after that (snaps fingers) we were just all over the place.
Speaker 1: All kind- I mean all the top shows, and Ed, Ed Sullivan loved you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, we did sixteen Ed Sullivan shows ['The Ed Sullivan Show'].
Story_ID: 647599
Speaker 1: So, what did you like--do you have a favorite Cholly Atkins story?
Speaker 2: Well, Cholly Atkins--first, a lot of people are not aware that he was a brilliant tap dancer, choreographer.  Worked the, the Chitlin' Circuit and you know he's taught almost everybody in the business.  So, a favorite story, you know I have many of them, but probably the best would be he--I loaned, I rented my house to him.  I had a duplex in Detroit [Michigan] on the West Side and so I actually rented--he had a whole house on the other side of me and you know I would just go over and see everybody rehearse.  He would, he would teach Aretha Franklin, I'd go there and see Aretha you know.  And he'd teach all the Four Tops, and Temps [The Temptations].  He taught everybody, so pretty much for, for I and Cholly would be more of a family member than a choreographer from what I would remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But wasn't their relationship--
Speaker 2: But I don't know about any stories.
Speaker 1: How did that relation develop because I did read that, you know, he was living in half the house.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That once you came back from one of the tours, you know everybody bought homes--I mean you bought a home you--he just--so, how did that relationship happen with, you know, you and he that he and his wife were--?
Speaker 2: No, I just rented it to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They needed a house, I just rented the other half, that's all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know what I mean--it was I had the house and, and had the availability to rent to someone and he just happened, he and his family just happened to have, needed a place.  I'm like, "Well, I've got my place." So then, so that's what was really good for me because I became not just an artist of his but became family.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard--I mean wonderful things, like I didn't even know the--you know, I didn't know all the connections.  I didn't know the connections with Gladys Knight and the Pips beforehand and I didn't know the connections with [HistoryMaker] Eddie Levert afterwards and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, he really was responsible I would say for Gladys Knight and the Pips being there, maybe not, not you know the, the person that got them there, but because had worked with them years before Motown [Motown Records], you know that connection was just a natural.
Speaker 1: And everybody I mean speaks so highly of him, I wish people knew.
Speaker 2: Cholly Atkins? Oh, Cholly Atkins he was just great.  I mean right now if you ever seen any Motown artists anywhere, you will know it's Cholly Atkins because he was so precise.  I mean The Temptations' whole thing is all Cholly Atkins.  Supremes [The Supremes], you know it's all Cholly.  It's very visual, he was very, and, and I think if you look at any other artists in the world who would not say who was their choreographer, but if you look at any Motown artist, it's Cholly Atkins; very identifiable.
Story_ID: 647600
Speaker 1: So what is, what, how are you handling the whirlwind, and how is the group handling the whirlwind, all the things happening?  Is it just fun?  I mean you're shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue, you've got all the clothes?
Speaker 2: For us it was such--we had waited for so many years and prepared for so many years.  We were really ready for our success, you know from thirteen years old and we were when it happened we were like, "Okay, what took so long for everybody to get it, you know." (Laughter), And it, it was one of those--it was supposed to happen for us you know.  It was one of those things where you know it was supposed to happen for us.  We made the right decisions being, going to Motown [Motown Records]. Motown made the right decisions choosing us.  Holland Dozier Holland made the right decisions giving us songs and then the machinery started going so fast that in a way I don't, I don't know if everybody was ready for it because the world was changing.  It wasn't just us and the music and (unclear), it was like the whole world was changing.  You know the civil rights was there.  We were--I won't say thrown into it but I mean we had a responsibility as, as being now three black women who were--you know, sort of--you hear people like [HistoryMaker] Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey say well you know, "When we saw The Supremes on TV you know that gave us the idea," da, da. So we had to, and our image, glamour.  We were coming from a time when black wasn't beautiful, now all of a sudden, we're black, we're beautiful.  We're on every station, we are traveling the world, we are jet setting, we are all these things, and it's moving really fast.  I personally loved it, 'cause again I loved the journey, but then you see individual people who--their lives are, you know they don't know what the heck's going on, and, and how people handle that.  That became a big problem, it became a big problem because you're being torn here, one (unclear) torn there--pretty soon you the nucleus, which we were over here is no longer there.  So, to me that happens to a lot of people.  You know it's not, it wasn't just us.  It was a thing of the machinery is really going fast.  Are we still on the same accord?  No, we're not any more, you know and so, then things did start happening.  The biggest thing that hap- two that happened was that Florence [Florence Ballard] had, had a horrible, horrible violation done to her when she was fourteen.  We were still The Primettes, and it really just--she was abused by a neighborhood person and it just actually destroyed her, totally destroyed her.
Speaker 1: She was?
Speaker 2: She was never, ever, ever the same.  The thing that we thought was that she would get over this, but this was a time when before people would talk about these things.  So, everyone kept it really quiet.  She never got the help that she was supposed to get to kind of help her get beyond it.  So, Diane [Diana Ross] and I, and I'm speaking for Diane now only because I'm thinking she thinking the same way I did, was that we thought once we became famous and rich you know, Florence would be over it you know, but she never did.  So, when little things started coming here, she doesn't--she's a very family--she was a really the kind of person who wanted to be with her family.  So, now we're never home, we're always traveling and she wanted to be you know with her family and she felt, you know, this has kind of hurt her and then when she no longer could sing anything other than our, "Oohs," or, "ahs," that tore at her.  So, every little thing started tearing at her and anytime something was not going the way we wanted it, her wanting it or whatever, then it would just, she would get deep depressed, depressed and pretty soon it just really, it really destroyed her.  So, that was the first thing that really messed up our, our closeness as friends, and we really, really were close.  So, that, that really destroyed everything and then of course Diane was going on and she and Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] became an item.  So, that again, and this happens in friendships you know when the guy starts dating someone else and they're no longer with their friends, so all those things started really getting in our way of--but the one great thing about it was, even though that was going on--when we're on stage, we still got that thing going, you know but pretty soon even that was kind of just dissipated, and that, that's basically what was happening.  So, we were really you know touring and doing what we had to do, but the joy, for me, seeing all of this; and I, I understand what's going on with me.  My unhappiness came from seeing all the unhappiness around me, so.
Story_ID: 647601
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier about the, the different camps, and that was--and I think in every group, every group has certain members migrate to certain members of, of the group; and for ours [The Supremes], Flo [Florence Ballard] was sort of like the, not the underground, but I mean people really, really dug Flo.  I mean I've had guys come up and says, "Oh, honey that Flo (makes sounds)!"  And so, in our, in our thing most people wanna be Diane [Diana Ross] you know, that's, that's like a given, but then you have the others who really loved Flo.  She really was a--had a following and even today she has a huge following, and there's not been a lot written about her, which is very strange too.  You know, it's not a lot written about her but she has a huge--I would say a fat camp (laughter) going.  I haven't found many [HistoryMaker] Mary Wilsons but anyway, you know that's okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Is that true?  No, because each of you had your following, each of you.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: But you're (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was always in the middle.
Speaker 2: Right, you were in the middle.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I was like a--and people said I was always a fence sitter, Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] always called me a fence sitter.
Speaker 2: But, talk, talk about--can you share stories of--let's, let's talk about Flo since we were talking about her?  You--she had a big voice.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And yet, so what about her--how would you go and describe her though?
Speaker 1: You mean--?
Speaker 2: As a personality.
Speaker 1: As a personality?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Flo was the kind of person before her--actually before her rape, I'll just say it like so people really understand what it was.  Before her rape, Flo was an earthy, street girl, and if you needed to be told off, Flo would tell off.  You know she wouldn't let anybody get away with saying the wrong thing.  You know she would tell you, she could tell you, and you know people always could have the last, last say?  Flo was that kind of way, she always could come up with the right thing would be the--whatever.  She always was the kind of person, also was the kind of person who had this very hearty laugh.  If Flo was happy, she could laugh and everybody would be laughing, she just had this Santa Claus, ho, ho, ho--kind of laugh, and she was just real.  Florence was a real--I would say she was like a real black--have you ever seen a real black good woman?  Flo was that woman (laughter), you know.  She was that way, but she also had a great voice.  I also--I always thought she sounded very much--she had the kind of style of Etta James style.  So, she really had a good R and B sound and, and her voice was pure, she had a pure, pure voice, and I think the only thing that really made her--I won't say made her happy, but the only thing that she really--she loved to sing, that's what she loved to do.  That was all--I think that was her biggest thing, and then once she was no longer singing, her children were her, the, the love of her life, her children, she loved her children, but singing was what made Flo, so when that was no longer there, she lost a lot of herself.
Speaker 2: Because she was really the start in, in something 'cause she approached--wait, Carolyn [Carolyn Franklin] approached?  No, she approached.
Speaker 1: I got into trouble putting that together and I'm, I'm gonna retract it.
Speaker 2: You are?
Speaker 1: I'm gonna--what I'm saying is that all of us did it at the same time.
Speaker 2: No, but I'm saying recruiting wise, because--
Speaker 1: No, she only recruited me.
Speaker 2: She recruited you, but then Diana--but I'm saying it started with her 'cause Diana--
Speaker 1: For me it started with Flo, yes.
Speaker 2: Right, it started with and then for, for Diane it was?
Speaker 1: One of The Primes.
Speaker 2: One of The Primes, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm and, and Betty [Betty McGlown] was already there through one (unclear).
Speaker 2: But what I'm saying--the reason I'm saying it that way is that she recruited, so it was already in her.  I mean not to say that she--and then you're at, sort of in the center.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's what I'm saying when you said, "I was in the center."  You were in the center holding it together?
Speaker 1: No, it's--no, no, no I just--that's my personality and Flo and Diane were opposites.  So, I had to be the center, but see I could've been on any side, any side, but I had to be in the center because of the way they are.  They both were very, very opinionated, strong people.  So, I mean didn't need me being that way in the middle (laughter) when I never had been that way anyway, so I mean I fit right there in the middle; and that's, and that was, that was it.
Story_ID: 647602
Speaker 1: But that can be complicated sometimes to do that 'cause you've gotta, well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you lose self.
Speaker 1: You lose self, because you either have to go either one way or the other.
Speaker 2: I was never really myself with them [Florence Ballard and Diana Ross] 'cause I'm so busy trying to keep the peace (laughter).
Speaker 1: To keep the peace, and so what about Diane, what would you way was her--you know how would you describe her?
Speaker 2: Diane was always extremely like a tomboy, impetuous, just out there playful.  That, that was her--she always liked to be--she was very impetuous I would say--if that's the right word, but she liked fun.  She liked fun.
Speaker 1: But she seemed, was she opinionated?  Both of them were opinionated?
Speaker 2: Totally.
Speaker 1: Opinionated, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--you didn't have an opinion anywhere, in between or you were just?
Speaker 2: I--see I'm kind of, I'm such a rounded person that I can have fun pretty much anywhere.  Pretty much I like everything.  There comes every thirty years when I don't like something and when I don't like it, I don't like to be there.  It's not good for me.  I, I do like just to have fun.  I like happiness, and so I can be happy in many different ways.  I'm very flexible, and when I'm not that way, I like to be by myself.  I'm also--I go back to being by myself.  By myself, I'm perfect 'cause then I don't have to be swayed by other people's what they like, what they don't like.  Not everyone likes or don't like that I, I'm so happy I'm alive.  You know me, I'm kind of--how can I say this and, and I'm really formulating this, this late in my life where I've had to become, had to become opinionated in terms of because other people are, but really I could just probably last the whole year just living life and being happy.  I mean this is kind of like the way I am.  But now, you have to make, you have to have an opinion.  If you don't then people will say you don't, you don't, you know or you don't have it and so now I guess--I don't know.  I, I still like being by myself.  I really like being--I like hearing my own voice.  I've heard some many other people's voices in my life; and then that, that's not good for me.  It takes me for--away from being who I really am.
Story_ID: 647603
Speaker 1: So during, okay so you--I wanna go back to the sort of the critical periods in the group [The Supremes] and so you're say- so, Flo [Florence Ballard] is getting--as you guys are becoming more and more popular, she's getting more and more disgruntled and some way because she's had to silence her voice?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where do you fit?  I mean, how are you--where are you fitting also in this?
Speaker 2: It was a time when I became very unhappy you, you know if I could ever say there was a time in my life when I was very unhappy that was it, because I was seeing our friendship was no longer the friendship that I, I knew and that was very disheartening for me, but the main part was that I could see the unhappiness in the two of, of them you know, and I shouldn't say so much unhappiness with Diane [Diana Ross], but more the unhappiness with, with Florence, and, and you know Diane was under a lot of pressure as well, which I saw as well.  That's what I mean by the unhappiness.  I saw that she's, she's probably got to make a decision and you know she didn't look very happy during that time because of that.  So, I, I'm not in her head I don't what--I could see, I knew what Florence's was you know, but I, I didn't know about Diane but I could see that she was unhappy, and it was a, just a very.  It, it you could see that something perfect was destroyed, it was not there anymore.
Speaker 1: So, it was perfect for how long?  How long was it perfect?  You signed it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, as long as I was on stage, I'm still perfect.  See, this is one thing that, that was great about being in the music thing.  When you're on that stage singing everything else goes away, 'cause when you come off--
Speaker 1: It's just you and the audience.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's when you come back that reality sets in.  When you're on stage, you're in heaven, you're in heaven.  The harmonies were there, the singing was good and we--you know doing our thing.  That was there, it was there.  I never saw you know Diane stop growing, I never saw Florence stop growing.  We were still there on stage, but once you get off, the real, the reality is there.  You're back to reality and that's when you (makes noise) (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, okay, but what I, what I'm trying to understand, you signed [with Motown Records] in January, January 15 of 1961.  You go, you're at 1962, you know, but by the end of 1962 you have your hits, your three, your hits?
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964] was a big hit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963] was the beginning of it, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so '63 [1963], so '64 [1964].  So, at what point is it starting to you know, get difficult?  That's what I'm wondering 'cause there's some point where you're all--I mean you talk about it in the book ['Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme,' Mary Wilson].  You, you know you're having--I mean you're, it's--everything sort of changes.  You know there's money, there's fans, there's--
Speaker 2: It's hard to sometimes, pinpoint things like.  You know it slowly starts creeping in, but you know I love traveling.  So, for me that was always still happy even though things were going on that were not, you know 100 percent like they had been.  Just seeing Florence's [Florence Ballard] demise and seeing how unhappy she was about not, about the change, about us moving forward.  All those things were beginning to be there but I'm, I'm happy enough to, to really at that point still hold on to what makes me happy.  I mean I was loving it.  I was loving meeting people, we were meeting royalties, you know we were meeting people like Ethel Waters you know working--I remember here in Las Vegas [Nevada] the first time we did the, the Las Vegas show was at the Flamingo [The Fabulous Flamingo; Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino], and we were coming in after Pearl Bailey.  So, we got there the night before she closed and we were able to go to her show, go backstage and meet her.  I was terribly happy.  The first time we met Lena Horne, we were on our way to do--I think it was '68 [1968] to do Talk of the Town [Hippodrome, London, England] which was a biggie, just as big as the Copacabana [New York, New York] was and Lena Horne was closing the night before we, we opened and we got a chance to go and see her and spend two or three hours in her dressing room backstage.  So, all of these are happening, I'm happy you know, but then you gotta notice that maybe some other things are going on that are not happy but I'm still trying to hold onto my happiness, which I did.  So, I can't say when it stopped in terms of totally stopped.  Totally stopped was probably when the group you know when Flo was no longer in the group for me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: To really be honest about it.  Thank god that we got a great person to replace Flo who was Cindy Birdsong.
Story_ID: 647604
Speaker 1: But even that I--you know in, when you talked about the, the thing, the meeting with Flo [Florence Ballard] and her mother [Lurlee Ballard] and you know how you felt.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, in between, in a difficult position (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, this is the time when you know when it was determined Flo could no longer perform.
Speaker 1: She was drinking, she's drinking.
Speaker 2: Florence could no longer you know do the job well, let's say it, put that way, and so it was brought up for discussion of what's gonna happen, and so of course, Florence's mother was there and we all were there, Berry, Diane [Diana Ross] and myself and we were all there and this discussion's happening.  Well, it's not a very happy discussion.  If one of your, your original members, you know if this is a discussion of her no, no longer being in the group [The Supremes] and I knowing, being a professional knowing that she is not really doing, can do it right now unless she gets some kind of help or something, but in--still in those days we were not talking about help.  No one, that never came up.  Like what about going right now?  He's like, let's go to, you know, get the top psychiatrist, psychologist or whomever you know to talk to her and see if can work through these things that happened, and that was never brought up, and so it was put to me, "Mary [HistoryMaker Mary Wilson], what do you think?"  Well, here I am in the middle again, and of course she is my dear friend, just like Diane's my dear friend, but you know she's not doing the job.  So, if I have to say that her mother's gonna be very upset with me and Flo's gonna be very upset with me, but I mean I can't lie and it, it tore my heart apart to have to say that.
Speaker 1: What did you say?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I can't remember what I said, but I, I did have to say that you know she was having these problems and the other thing is, I know what I had to do.  I'm better at doing things than saying.  I knew that I had to up what I was trying to do to help her when she wasn't on stage, and I did everything that I could.  I was, I, I, made myself her caregiver.
Speaker 1: Did, did you ever as a group try to go talk to [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy, or was that just not--because of the relationship that he was having with Diane?  Oh.
Speaker 2: I, no I never did, but I actually thought Diane had spoken to him about it but I, I never--I still don't know if that was done.
Speaker 1: But these, okay--relationships are complicated?
Speaker 2: Relationships are complicated and that's what to me has been you know the majority of the problems is that--now, what's really good is that you see on TV where these people, especially on the soaps [soap operas] where they talk about all their problems (laughter) out loud.  If we had been able to do those kinds of things early on, I think a lot of things would've been resolved but we never--you, you weren't supposed to do that.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: You didn't air your dirty laundry on you know television.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 647605
Speaker 1: So, what is your favorite song of the songs that you [The Supremes] had, you know?
Speaker 2: That we recorded or that we sang, sing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That you recorded, that you recorded?  Well, but I wanna ask both.
Speaker 2: The--my favorite songs have always varied, but I mean I love singing now 'Reflections.' I think lyrically it's just a great, it never dies.  The timeline is like now, then, forever.  It's so--now, I, I can sing it and it means something very personal to me, just like life.  'I Hear a Symphony' is a--one of--has always been my favorite song.  'Where Did Our Love Go' was never my favorite song (laughter), but I'm beginning to like it now.
Speaker 1: It wasn't?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't.  Oh, no it wasn't, I didn't like it at all, but I've been wrong, so now, I like it.  But yeah, those are, 'Reflections' I would say that, 'I Hear a Symphony,' have always remained my, some of my favorite songs.
Speaker 1: How about 'Baby Love' when, you know, because that was Grammy nominated [Grammy Award].  What about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know we only found out that was Grammy nominated recently.  I never knew back in those days it was and then until I started doing research and you know got paperwork on it.  Like we never really received a Grammy until after the fact, nominated maybe, but not--we never received one.  And you would think after having twelve million selling records that we never received a Grammy.  We got Grammy recognition later after the fact, a few years later.  So, I don't have any Grammys in the house.  I got one certificate, I think 'Stop in the Name of Love' and maybe 'Baby Love' that they gave us just a few--not, not many years ago.
Speaker 1: Good, okay, there're two, two questions I have with that.  One, wouldn't they announce the Grammy nominated, or was that post?
Speaker 2: Post.
Speaker 1: It was post.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, post.
Speaker 1: So, is that racism or because?
Speaker 2: On no, no, that has something totally to do with--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You have to be a part of an organization at rece- the record company and, and so they count the amount of the records sold, da, da and, and it's done.  So, I think that Motown [Motown Records] at the time was not part of that, whatever that organization was.
Speaker 1: Well, right, okay, but that is sort of, I mean that.
Speaker 2: I, I don't think racism is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, I mean they were supposed to and they--I guess they choose not to so for whatever reason, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Oh I see. Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I said you have to get that from the other folks (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I gotcha, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't--I just know we didn't, we never got a Grammy.
Story_ID: 647606
Speaker 1: What about--can you talk about the night of the Copacabana [New York, New York]?  Can you talk?
Speaker 2: Which night?  We were there for two weeks.
Speaker 1: Oh, the first night, the opening, I mean the--well, you don't wanna talk about that?
Speaker 2: Um.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I mean I don't know what you mean?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just saying can you talk about the whole--let's say--
Speaker 2: The experience?
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the experience, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, sure.  Gee, the experience.  First of all, it was extremely exciting to, to know, to be rehearsing for a show that you know could go this way or go that way (gestures), and we had enough experience to know that we were, should be going there, and we rehearsed on all the songs.  We knew the songs very well and I think there was one, only area where it could've been negative and that was I think Florence [Florence Ballard] was supposed to sing "People" and that song was--chose not to.  She couldn't sing it.  I think that was the only downer that I can remember of opening at the Copa.  It was extremely exciting.  It was a place where Mr. Jules Podell, supposedly this was all mafia and all kind of stuff, and you know you'd hear all the stories throughout the years, so it was very exciting to, to know that we were going to be in that environment 'cause in a way it kind of put back into the old mature, you know the, in the days when things were--it was a different generation so we're kind of catching the last part of a generation that's dying out and we're there.  I remember seeing a contract or something of Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.], who he was making five thousand dollars and I think we were making five thousand dollars too.  So, it--things like that were, were happening and you're like just so excited that you're actually right now living your dream.  So, all remember is that we were actually living our dream.  We were there at the Copacabana.  The place was packed.  We heard that all kinds of people were there.  I don't know if it was the first night we were there it was Flip Wilson, or I mean all kinds of who, who was, or who is, was there.  So, yeah, it was, it was and then after the--during the show it was a very exciting.  Everyone was sitting there and they were very excited.  You could tell that they were totally into it.  So, it was a success.  It was--to talk about the experience we lived our dream at the Copacabana.  They actually recorded it as well and, oh, I'll tell you the other downer was we had on these horrible outfits that we did not like and they had, someone had brought all these flowers and put 'em around here, fake flowers, right?  We hated those gowns, I know I did and I remember we tore 'em off later, but, and, and then we had a hat--got straw hats with a cane and that was the album cover of the, of the album that they recorded there ['The Supremes at the Copa'].  So, that was--it was very, very exciting.  It was everything you would want a successful night opening to be.
Speaker 1: Who, who was responsible for that?  Was that a whole group or team of people at, at Motown [Motown Records] and did [HistoryMakers] Berry Gordy sit down and talk to you about the significance of that as a--?
Speaker 2: I don't know if Berry had to sit and talk to us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think that, that was something that we--I say that to say we all knew that this was.
Speaker 1: A big deal.
Speaker 2: The big, the biggie.  Well, that's that I think I'm saying it wasn't something that he would say, "Girl we gonna go to the Copa."  I don't think that had to happen because we had been preparing for that, but there was a team of people, yes, working around us.  As I mentioned earlier, the artist development people.  But they also had the P, the PR [public relations] and I'm quite sure who they used for that and then you had the marketing, Barney Ales and the sales department.  But I think they also had a, you know the new public relations team that was helping, 'cause this is New York [New York].  So, I think we had all kind of New York affiliations there that would help them in that.  So, it was a, a full fledged, everybody was involved in it.
Speaker 1: Now, the line up, 'cause there were, you did a whole range of songs, you weren't just doing your, your, popu- you know your hits?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So how were those decisions made?
Speaker 2: Well, as I mentioned earlier we, we actually had been doing loads of, of standard material.  The kind of in our earlier days we, that's what we , we actually--that was our expertise and I think Berry in his you know knowing that we could go to this next level understood that they're already doing this kind of standard material.  They call it today, 'American Songbook,' ['Great American Songbook'] they didn't say that back then, but that's what it was, and we were already doing that, so this kind of fit into a scheme of where they wanted to be as a company too because we were already, we were already singing some of those kind of songs, so it just made sense to continue on, and I, I that's one thing that Mrs. Powell [HistoryMaker Maxine Powell] always said, "You're diamonds in the rough and we're just here to polish you."  So, I think that Berry and Motown, everyone kind of you know had said you know, "Supremes, they can do this.  We, our dream is to go there, The Supremes can take us there."  So, they gave us all the ammunition they had and we were able to do it.
Story_ID: 647607
Speaker 1: But you had been preparing.  You know I'm even looking at how you're sitting.  You know you're sitting all, you know, straight up.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh really?  Oh.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No slouching.
Speaker 2: I'm actually trying.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Unclear) Like you got the rod at the back of it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You don't have, but you know all poised, very--so, if it could only happen these days.
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you I.V. [Wilson's maternal aunt, I.V Lewis Pippin] taught me very well, I mean I really have had a wonderful sort of experience in terms of being taught well--things, and I think Motown [Motown Records] was very, and, and Diane [Diana Ross] and Flo [Florence Ballard].  I think Motown recognized that in us you know that we, we came with a certain and it was the three of us you know together.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they were smart enough to see it.
Speaker 1: But they, their livelihood was hitched to your star in many ways.  I'm not, you know 'cause they were wanting--you were to be their mega stars.  They had plenty of stars.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know but they had others before, you know Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson], The Miracles, Marvin Gaye, da, da--they had others but I don't know it's something about us that I think it was our own little sort of you know knowing who we were.
Speaker 1: Right, they did have the others, but those are still black--I mean largely more black audiences.  You were a mega star crossover, that's what I'm trying to say.  Switch around in the chair, so I don't have the edge of the chair, okay.  Sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you talk about the time that you, you know you're in the meeting, you know Flo was not gonna be there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Flo had, had--there'd been actually a bad concert leading up to that, right?  Well, there may have been--well, there was several.
Speaker 2: Las Vegas [Nevada] was one of the last ones that she did at, where it was very obvious that she really needed to--it was just obvious to everyone.  We could no longer hide that she was digressing.
Speaker 1: Her wig was, when she had been drinking, her--she wasn't in good form that evening in Las Vegas?
Speaker 2: I, I--you know, I just don't want to go there.
Speaker 1: Okay, gotcha, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I--I don't think it's something that needs to be described.
Speaker 1: No, no that's fair enough, that's fair enough.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, then Cindy Birdsong, tell, talk about her because she had been in the entertainment space I was--so can you talk about?
Speaker 2: Cindy Birdsong as I mentioned was a great replacement for, for Florence because she looked like Flo.  She as extremely professional because she had been one of the Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles singers, and we had always worked with them on the Chitlin' Circuit and everyone would always say, "God you guys look alike." You know so there was always something that was there and when, when it was decided perhaps you know since Florence would no longer be there, Cindy's name came up and that's, that's kind of how she was recommended and we never really looked for anyone else or because the word wasn't out that Florence would no longer be there.  It was kind of kept on the quiet and so she was never, so Cindy was always the one that was going to replace Florence, and Florence actually--there were two times because at the one meeting when this all came about the first time; then somehow or another Florence was brought back in; and then the second time, they said "Okay, that's it."  And that's when Cindy came in.
Story_ID: 647608
Speaker 1: So, the transition was easy into the group for her?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: The transition was easy into the group?
Speaker 2: It was easy because they preferred to keep it quiet; and so actually I think the first gig that Cindy [Cindy Birdsong] did with us was at the Hollywood Bowl in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and most of the general public had no idea it wasn't Florence [Florence Ballard].  So, it was--if you want to put it easy, but not for me, but it was--yes.
Speaker 1: And then, then that period lasted how long?  I know when the announcement--people were like well they were so used to seeing the three of you, you know, and so this was a new one we had to get use to but what, what happens, what happens next?
Speaker 2: I don't--I couldn't give you a running order of it, but you know we had lots of gigs to do.  This was like the later of part of '68 [1968], we had lots of gigs on the books, European gigs as well of the states.  We had lots of television shows, and so we were very, very busy.  We did, we still had some command performances to do that Cindy did with us.  So, we basically toured a lot, did some recordings, not a lot of recordings.  In fact, they probably--this was the time when Holland Dozier Holland were leaving Motown [Motown Records], so there was a lot of upheaval things going on during that period but we basically stayed very, very busy.  The, the announcement that Diane [Diana Ross] would be leaving came out during this time, but we still had time to work together, which we did and that was '68 [1968], '69 [1969]. So around '69 [1969] I believe they put out in words, in terms of who would replace Diane, so there was a lot of, you know, people saying this--I think Syreeta Wright was one of the people that were recommended, and it was also a time when I had to decide what I was going to do and my whole thing at that point was I didn't know--but I also knew that I wasn't going to quit.  I mean I knew that I wasn't going to quit.  I mean I knew I wasn't going to quit, but I had no idea what I was going to do, and it was [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy who brought in Jean Terrell's name and so again, I'm very, sort of not sure what, what I was going to do and, but when he let me hear Jean I was convinced that she was the person to, to do the job.  I never considered anyone else, no one else ever asked me about anyone else and I, you know so I was--as I said I was up in the air, but when I heard Jean Terrell's voice I knew she was the person that should, should do the job, and so Berry set it up where we'd meet each other and that and we started talking and for that entire year, we rehearsed with Jean Terrell while we were still going on the road performing with, with Diane.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that, that had--so, how was that year though?  You know, I wanna go back though, there's some--you had renegotiated your, your arrangement, right?  Somewhere in between you had, you were making more money, right?  Had you re- renegotiated your agreement because the, the--
Speaker 2: The--I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, I was just going to say contracts come up every four years or something like that, so you are constantly doing that and so I, I must have negotiated with those contracts, yes.
Speaker 1: So, who's representing you at that point then?  Still yourself?
Speaker 2: It was still was being done I think by, by Motown, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes when (unclear) they come up for re--
Speaker 1: Right, I forgot that's right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right, you made that point.  The other point is there--things are starting, I mean Mary Wells--that was an issue I mean with the company.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know because they lost their star.  Actually, you were, you were what, what they had wanted to do with her.  You know they had wanted to make (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Supremes you mean?
Speaker 1: The Supremes were, and then Holland, you talk about Holland Dozier Holland, though I think there was a lawsuit before that, but Holland Dozier Holland sued for you know--Berry Gordy, I mean Motown and for $25 million at the time, and that suit went on a long time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But the--you know the thing is that everybody's becoming so, you know--people are getting big or they're seeing that there are other ways to make money, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The, the children are leaving the, the farm.
Story_ID: 647609
Speaker 1: Basically I, I--if I'm hearing what you're asking, or saying, is that you reach a point when everyone now has gone to a certain level; and it's that time that you need to reevaluate or at least see what's going on, and that's what's happening, and so when it happens a lot of times you know people decide, "Well, I'd rather go someplace else and do something different." And that's kind of what's going on.  With The Supremes, you know I never thought about leaving Motown [Motown Records].  I never wanted to leave Motown, I loved being there, but there you know did come a time when, yeah it would be nice to have a, a lawyer, or whatever, but you know I'm still--I'm happy.  I'm getting what I'm thinking I'm supposed to get (laughter).  So, I, I just was happy doing what I was doing.  I, I wasn't ready to leave or go anywhere.
Speaker 2: So, in that year period, what happens in that year that you're rehearsing, 'cause I don't think--I mean 'cause that, that's a long time to have a transition in some respects.
Speaker 1: Well we just--like I said, we just basically were biding time 'til Diane [Diana Ross] left, and, I, I don't mean that in a bad way.  What I'm saying is that you know we didn't have any other plans other than just recording and working and Diane, basically I think for Diane though she was probably gearing towards her solo career, which we were just--really I basically was trying to train and teach Cindy Birdsong the whole situation, then of course Jean [Jean Terrell] comes in, so now we're revamping the group and, and pretty much that's what's going on, and working to you know we're still doing the gigs.
Speaker 2: Right, but you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I had a double life, that's what it was.  I said that before I had a double life, I was with The Supremes and I was also--
Speaker 2: With the new Supremes.
Speaker 1: With the new Supremes, so it was pretty--it was kind of like (gestures).
Speaker 2: You know before, I--there was one other thing I wanted to ask though and I'm wondering how--what role you played in this?  The Copacabona had--Copacabana [New York, New York], I'm sorry, had a, what they called a slave contract.  Are you, do you know what I'm--where they, they would--you were--they--you were, I think to get you in there was. It was some very low fee that you were getting paid, and I think--do you know what I'm talking about, Jules Podell?
Speaker 1: No, I don't.
Speaker 2: Okay, no, well we won't even bother that.
Speaker 1: You can give me a copy, it would be good to look into.
Speaker 2: Okay, (laughter) but no there--I'll show you, but there's this whole--I'll, I'll show it to you, but there's this whole, I'll show it to you, okay.
Speaker 1: Well, all the contracts they gave out in those days were called slave contracts just to clear that up.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, so you have this double life?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You're you know in both places.  Now, the other thing that happens though in '68 [1968], Suzanne de Passe comes in, you know, to Motown and she becomes, she sticks as Mr. Gordy's [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] assistant.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, so how is, tell, tell me from your vantage point, how is it to have, having that split existence?
Speaker 1: Just what I was talking about?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: For me, as I mentioned earlier in '68 [1968] when Florence [Florence Ballard] was no longer in the group, it for me it was the end of the group, period.  So, we're great, we're, we're the famous Supremes, but yet and still we're really not The Supremes at this point and we're going through as you mentioned the transition.  The problem being that you're, you're kind of like living a lie in a way (laughter) where you're on--you know when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] passed, we were working, I think I was the Copacabana or we were doing 'The Ed Sullivan Show,' I'm not quite sure which one. But we were in the city for a week, 'cause that's the, the time period you would do that, those two gigs, so I know we were there doing that, but so Mr. King was assassinated we were called in to sing you know the 'Someday We'll Be--,' no not 'Someday We'll Be Together,' what am I talking--we were singing 'Somewhere' I think it was on the show and it was a really you know that was a--god, it was a horrible time and we're singing this wonderful song and tribute to Mr. King whatever, and then but then you got that going on and you got, you gotta go back and record with Jean Terrell over here and then you're doing the show down here.  So, you know it was just one of those things you had do and, and being whatever like separated or divided or whatever is what you had to but, but it was not a happy time.  It wasn't one of the times when you would say, "Okay, now we're at the peak of our thing, and we're doing this and we're singing (unclear)." It was, "Wow, life sucks," (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 647610
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were you talking to, Mary [HistoryMaker Mary Wilson], at this time because I mean your best friends are, are gone?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I had--yes.  I didn't have any other friends really.  My friends were Florence [Florence Ballard] and Diane [Diana Ross], but I, I say that only because I had family, I always had family.  Family was always there, and I had a couple of other dear friends--one of my friends, Jackie Burkes, she and I grew up on Bassett [Bassett Street, Detroit, Michigan] together and I did have outside friends.  I was always the kind of person who always had friends.  So, I didn't have friends that I basically would go and run and talk to like I have now.  I didn't have those kinds of friends because we were, Supremes [The Supremes] are here, so you don't say a lot of--you know what I mean?  So, I didn't have that kind of thing.  Well, now I have friends I can go and talk to.  So, I really didn't have a lot and I was still pretty much doing everything myself.  So, I didn't have people to talk to.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean that's hard because you know that reminds me you know when we were talking about you being ten years old and looking out you know and it being internal.
Speaker 2: Always.
Speaker 1: Because you can't, even though you have friends you're up here you know.
Speaker 2: That's what I mean.
Speaker 1: You know and you have to, you have to maintain image, and.
Speaker 2: Image, yeah so, I didn't really and I couldn't talk to other people about Florence and Diane.  That was very difficult because they were really (unclear).  So, no, no I've always been pretty much my own whatever.  Now that I have my daughter [Turkessa Ferrer Babich], I can talk--okay I can't even tell her a lot of things (laughter), but I always--
Speaker 1: You can't tell her a lot of things 'cause you're her mother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, because I'm still who I am and they, you know it's (unclear).  But, I'm that way; I have handled most of my problems myself.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Always.
Story_ID: 647611
Speaker 1: Can you take me back, so this--I'm, so can you take me back to your final television appearance together [as The Supremes] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Which one was it?
Speaker 1: December 21, 1969 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was that?
Speaker 1: Ed, 'Ed Sullivan Show' ['The Ed Sullivan Show'].
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: You can't?
Speaker 2: What did we sing?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: You have to ask my fans.
Speaker 1: 'Someday We'll Be Together.'
Speaker 2: You ask my fans that, they can tell you everything, I can't remember that.  I can't remember what I was thinking.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay no, okay, I won't (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I'll tell, you if you want something, the final thing would be the--
Speaker 1: February 15th?
Speaker 2: Would be the Frontier Hotel [Last Frontier Hotel] in Las Vegas [Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about that.  I was gonna ask about that next.
Speaker 2: But a television show I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, so talk about that.
Speaker 2: Well, you know here we are, now at last, the last, and we've been building up to this time frame since Flo [Florence Ballard] left you know, so that's like two and a half years we've been building up for Diane [Diana Ross] to leave and I, I--that show was probably a show of freedom for me because it was a final.  It kind of finally put a thing, okay at last it's over.  Not that I was happy about it, I really hated to see us no longer be together.  I really thought in my mind we'd be together forever, but then after Flo left I realized that wasn't going to happen, and then you know Jean Terrell came in the group and that lasted for a little while, but then I got to--oh, we're past--I gotta go back, I'm sorry.  So, Jean Terrell's there and then finally we know that our record is coming out.  We know we recorded a good record and I also know now Diane is leaving.  So, we can start this new life, which I had begun to really like to be honest with you.  I really started saying, "Okay, maybe now we can have a little freedom and we can really be a vocal group again." And so that night at the Frontier Hotel was for me a moment of saying, "Wow, okay we're here now.  It's actually, it's over and I can start a new life." And it was--my best friend was there, Margie Haber, this Jewish girl, her and I were very dear friends.  So, she and I hung out the entire night and talked about it and I remember saying to her, "Wow, I never, ever thought that this moment--that I would see this moment."  Never, ever thought it and I was very, very I was very sad.  I was very--I, I probably--when I say sad I was probably at one of those points where I'm like, "What am I gonna do now?" But thank god, we had the new group going.  That was probably the only thing that saved me.  So, when Diane brought Jean Terrell on stage and it was the four of us on stage, you know I was probably saying, "Where is my champagne?" (Laughter) I was ready to get out and get me a drink (laughter).  It was like, "At last it's over." But it was, it was very frustrating because I didn't know--you can't be happy in a moment like that, you can't be sa- you know it was, it was just one of those human moments.
Story_ID: 647612
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it happened so qui- really, in the span of time between you, you know when you took off, and we're talking about what five, six years maybe?  You know I mean that--it happened quickly.
Speaker 2: Everyone says that but, and even now they try to talk about, well it's your fiftieth anniversary.  Well, it's not. We started singing in 1959, so for me it's 1959 to 1977.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Can't break it up.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's just, I don't know, I--
Speaker 1: So, so what happens after that?  Talk about that then?
Speaker 2: Well, that was per- that was the beginning and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You have this, you have this--
Speaker 2: We worked very hard, Cindy [Cindy Birdsong] was still very new, Jean Terrell came in and we had this whole new burst of energy, Motown [Motown Records] was, you know, kind of helping us [The Supremes] to move forward, putting out some records and we had a couple of number one's or a couple of top ten hits, and we were doing very well, but very soon I realized that, that really the dream is not the same dream.  It's not me, Flo [Florence Ballard] and Diane [Diana Ross].  Excellent singers and all that, but it was all about the dream, the daring to dream, to going forward to planning it to creating this whole thing and now it's just trying to keep it going and I realized very early on that it, it wasn't, it wasn't what I wanted but I still didn't know what to do because I didn't think I could sing anymore but I still enjoyed being on the stage.  So, I stuck with the group until '77 [1977], finally realized.
Speaker 1: Can I ask during that time period, I'm sorry, from '70 [1970] to '77 [1977] what support is the company putting behind you because they've moved.
Speaker 2: They've moved.
Speaker 1: What we're not talking about is that there was a move to California from Detroit [Michigan] and so?
Speaker 2: Well, you know in, in the '70s [1970s] this was also a new timeframe here we're talking about.  So, music is changing, you know, you're having the, the, now you're having the riots and it was all kind of stuff changed (laughter) you know.  Everything was new and so in the seven years before we disbanded--what happened?  The, Motown moved from Detroit to, to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada].  They went to movies.
Speaker 1: I mean to L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: L.A., sorry.  They went into L.A. and then you know they started movies, which was really, really cool, but the family had dissipated.  You know people had left and all these kinds of things and I don't know what else happened.  We just, we continued, we got another girl in the group Lynda Terrell--Lynda Laurence.
Speaker 1: Lynda Laurence.
Speaker 2: And the record company seemed to have just got the same feeling that I did that it just wasn't, it wasn't really happening, and so we really didn't get a lot of, of help from Motown; and that's when I really decided my--I started having children, and my husband [Pedro Ferrer] at the time--
Story_ID: 647613
Speaker 1: Your husband, give his name?
Speaker 2: Pe- Pedro Ferrer and I had three children; and so that's kind of what, where my happiness went, was in my children, but what happened was, and I realized, and my husband, Pedro said you know, "You need to get out, it's, it's not happening."  It's kind of like that thing where you know the boxer says, "Well, you need to learn to get out the ring." And at that time. And so I realized and it hurt me to have to do that.  That it was time for me to give up The Supremes you know.  I had put a lot into it, a lot of time and things and I thought I could make it work but it was not just up to me and it's not just a voice.  I had excellent singers with me, but the dream had died.  So, it's time for me to save myself and that's when I decided to you know, stop being a Supreme and disband the group.
Speaker 1: Now, how had you met Pedro?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: How had you met him?
Speaker 2: I met Pedro in, in Puerto Rico performing there.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (laughter), I'm just asking (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: I'm just answering.
Speaker 1: Okay, but in what year and what year did you get married?
Speaker 2: We met in '73 [1973] I think and '74 [1974], '75 [1975] and yes, we got married in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: It's hard to recreate magic.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's, it's almost impossible to recreate magic.  So, what you were thinking?  So, did you--what were you thinking at that point, 'cause are you decompressing?  But, you were, kids, that's the other thing.  You were a kid and you had almost missed your--I mean you had--twenty, you almost missed your twenties.
Speaker 2: Well, I, my daughter [Turkessa Ferrar Babich] was born when I was thirty-one and I perhaps was at the point where I really needed to have a family.  I had a--my career was already there, I had already done that, so I was really ready to get married at that point and so I met my, my husband Pedro just at that point when I really was really needing a family.  I'd lost my musical family and I was just ready then to--'cause I really always loved and wanted children.  I always wanted children, so I figured this was a good time, and I fell in love with my husband in '73 [1973] and we just got married right away and started having children.  So, that really helped me during this time of, of in the '70s [1970s] when the group was going down, and so it, it just kind of gave me another thing in life to pursue, but I still wanted to do well in singing.  I just didn't want to just give up singing.
Story_ID: 647614
Speaker 1: So, this is what I'm wondering.  So, Laurence [Lynda Laurence] and Terrell [Jean Terrell] left, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then where did [HistoryMaker] Scherrie Payne come in?
Speaker 2: So, so I, I wasn't prepared when, when Jean Terrell and the Lynda left in '74 [1974], something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: I wasn't prepared to, to--
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 2: I wasn't--'3 [1973].
Speaker 1: Oh, no '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: I wasn't prepared to go out on my own at that point, so I had to hire other people to come in, but I knew at that point I would be moving out soon.  So, I hired Scherrie Payne, excellent singer and then we came up, my--I think my ex-husband, Pedro [Pedro Ferrer], yes, he, he got Susaye Greene.  So, that was the last incarnation of The Supremes and we, we sang until '77 [1977].  We had our final performance in London, England at the Drury Lane Theatre [Theatre Royal, Drury Lane] in 1977 and that was the end of The Supremes.  Now, it was said that the other two ladies would carry on, but they, they didn't, and I was kind of glad that they didn't, but I did that because Scherrie had been such a good person coming in, I just didn't want to disband and leave her stranded, but I was so happy when they decided not to.  And no I really was, you know when (unclear) think it needed to end you know, but I was trying to be fair.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  (Laughter) Okay.  And why did they, they decide?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Story_ID: 647615
Speaker 1: But now I also want to talk about just Florence [Florence Ballard], one more time you know about her funeral; and the suit, she had filed a suit.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know and so can you talk about, talk about that?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know much about the suit, I mean I, I know some, but I'd just not rather get into it because I don't know the facts.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay sure.
Speaker 2: But what else did you wanted to--?
Speaker 1: No talk then about the funeral then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah okay.  I, I recall it was--actually it was, Susaye Greene was in the group 'cause it was '76 [1976], was in the group [The Supremes], Susaye and Scherrie [HistoryMaker Scherrie Payne] were in the group and we were trying on new outfits and whatever and we got a call and I remember Scherrie and Susaye came in and said, "Mary [HistoryMaker Mary Wilson], we got bad news, we just heard that Flo had passed."  And, so you know, got in touch with the family and went to Detroit [Michigan] as soon as possible.  Hung out with all the people and her children, her daughters, you know spent time with her daughters and I, I wasn't involved in the planning of the funeral, but I was asked to you know, of course to go.  So I did go and I was--I remember sitting there and just listening to everyone, and, but my mind and my heart and soul weren't there.  I was kind of like thinking about Flo.  I mean was just, I was in thought.  I remember that very clear, and she had a white fox stole that whenever we were going I would always ask her to, "Can I wear it, can I wear it?" You know.  I said, "Make sure you leave it to me you know." And I remember sitting there thinking about that stole and, and how I had asked her to leave me that stole.  I never got it by the way (laughter), but, but you know it was odd because here it is your best friend has died and you're thinking about a white stole.  I was just in that, and then, then all of a sudden I hear Diane [Diana Ross] say something from the stage.  I didn't even know she was there, up there and she said, "Mary and I would like to say something." And I'm saying to myself, "I don't want to say anything."  I mean I--the last thing I wanted to do was to get up and say something, but then I, I had to and I was really not happy about having to get up there at all, did not want to be up there, did not want to say anything.  So, I, I--after, I don't know we said something.  I don't know what I said and then we out to the, you know the hall there and I remember throwing a little dirt on there and said, "Florence, I'll take care of it."  And the reason I said that was that I knew that she, she had been dealt a bad hand in life, I mean a really bad hand.  No one to help her, no one to guide her, no one to help her through all that pain and I wanted to let people know, you know that she had been dealt that hand. So, I think I have done a lot of that.  I know a lot of people would not have preferred me to have talked about her rape, she definitely didn't want to ever say anything about it.  She was very embarrassed about that, but I said she's not here now, people need to know that, that wasn't who she was and who she became because this had been taken from her.
Story_ID: 647616
Speaker 1: --The kind of upbringing that Diane [Diana Ross] and I had.  They, they really--her, her family struggled.  There was like ten, twelve of them; I don't know and I don't--so, they struggled.  So, she didn't have a lot of, of back up you know home wise.  So, that's why I said she really, she learned it out on the street, you know how to handle, and so that was just taken away from her and then that was taken away then she just didn't know how to handle it.
Speaker 2: So, was--that funeral must've been hard for you in a lot of respects then, or was it?  I mean was it hard for you?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure I mean it was an awake (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You, you had also tried to.
Speaker 1: The funeral for me was an awakening to life, even though I had been to my father's [Sam Wilson] funeral, no, I had never, ever experienced anything like that, and especially with someone that, someone like Flo [Florence Ballard].  Flo was a real, she was a real character and to see her life being snatched way, and you see--I guess today you see a lot of that happening, but back then you know you had the community and you had the family and you had all these things that protected you so to see that happen out of that, it was really an eye awakening for me to, to see that this--now this is life.  First time I really experienced life that way.  So, yeah it was, it was hard.
Speaker 2: So, Mary [HistoryMaker Mary Wilson] at what point are you figuring out who you are and I'm gonna ask something because 1977 is your--you know Drury Lane [Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, Englas].  She, her funeral's in '76 [1976], '77 [1977] is Drury Lane and then in--you get in a tuggle with Motown [Motown Records] over management of The Supremes.  Is that when you're still trying--what does that mean?  I'm trying to understand.
Speaker 1: Well, there I was basically trying to get control and our name back.
Speaker 2: Oh, so, then that's--
Speaker 1: That's when--
Speaker 2: So then that's when you realized what the contract really--you don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With Florence, I found out with Florence because she was put out and could not, no longer use the name Supreme.  So, that's when all that started when I found out what it all meant, and that's when my search for you know getting the, the information and trying to get the name of The Supremes back.  So, I spent millions doing that.  I spent all my money doing that.
Story_ID: 647617
Speaker 1: Who are you negotiating with at that point at Motown [Motown Records] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got an outside lawyer, my ex-husband Pedro [Pedro Ferrer] was involved as well and we, you know we--that was the first time I actually had a lawyer and so that's when we started to going back through the contracts and trying to, to see if we could get the name Supreme.
Speaker 1: So you could continue in some respects (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, because they were trying to stop me from doing that, yes.
Speaker 1: I see, so was Motown was their plan at the time that they were going to keep the name so they could always have the group or?
Speaker 2: I don't know what their plans were, but that's what they were trying to keep it, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you ended up with the--so, that, that was not succ- was it succ- what, it was?
Speaker 2: It's very difficult, it wasn't successful because I never ended up with the name Supremes in that regards no, but we did do a settlement, which I don't know what it meant, but we did do a settlement and I was able then to go out yes, and call myself The Supremes.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you, so out of the settlement you could call yourself a Supreme, but you also were able to do individual work as a--
Speaker 2: Well, they never tried to stop me from doing work.  I think basically what they were doing was to just maintain ownership of it.  So, they did, when I was touring in Europe, they did, they being Motown, did send out cease and desist in using the name Supremes, yes did try.  They did do that.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: But after the settlement and everything then that was all resolved and I went on and I still used the name Supremes and, da, da, da, da, da.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, they never ever came out after that.

Speaker 1: How are you--so, you're raising your kids.  Are you thinking--are you going through some sort of decompression, like trying to--'cause first of all you, you've been singing as back up.  So, you even said that you were trying to find your voice again, you know how you even sounded.
Speaker 2: Well, I started training myself because I knew I'd have to at this point, so at '77 [1977] was when I said, "Okay, I now need to train myself as a singer 'cause I can't rely on other people to do it.  I'm gonna have to now do it myself."  So, I started taking, you know, voice lessons and acting classes and all that.  I did all of that.  Still doing it actually (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was there fear on your part?
Speaker 2: Fear?  If there was fear, oh it's always--you know if you--if I can't sing that would be fear, yeah, I guess so, but I think that my biggest thing was I could--I just have to train myself to do it.  Now, I don't know if people are gonna like it you know.  I mean I could fail there, so there's fear of failing, yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But I never stopped, I never, ever, ever, ever stopped pursuing doing this and doing it well.
Speaker 1: So this is the same time around that you start working on your memoirs, or do you during this period?
Speaker 2: I never stopped working on the memoirs.
Speaker 1: I know, but the idea of the book ['Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme,' Mary Wilson], how did the idea of the book come up?
Speaker 2: That was before.  That was, that was when I started working it.  It's, it's much sooner than that.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: It came out, it came in what?
Speaker 1: Eighty-five [1985], '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: Was it '85 [1985]?  Was it that long?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, eighty- it says '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: Yes, so I started working--well, see I was always keeping a diary so I think--see I'm very bad with numbers (laughter) and dates.  Keeping it chronological I can kind of do it, but the dates I can't.  It was probably--when did dad [Pedro Ferrer] and I divorce, '81 [1981]?
Speaker 1: (TURKESSA FERRER BABICH):  Eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 2: It was during that time, '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Oh, you started in '81 [1981] doing the book?  Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: After I, after my divorce--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is when I started writing, consciously writing it in the book form.
Story_ID: 647619
Speaker 1: And the divorce, what--why was the reason for the divorce?
Speaker 2: It was abuse, very abusive marriage; and you know it just--after the children--I didn't want to get a divorce because I wanted the children to have a family.  That was a big thing back in those--for a black family to have a family, mother, father, da, da and I--so, I stayed a little longer than I really should have, but the one thing that always kept me going was I could always go out and sing you see.  I, I remember going to Europe and performing and we did something with--oh, was it Bob Hope or somebody like that--I did was it was a Monterey Jazz Festival [Monterey, California] and I sang on there and I had to sing with a black eye and I remember saying to myself, "Okay, I gotta get out of this now, this guy [Pedro Ferrer] can't--I can no longer do it."  And so, you know eventually I just decided to go, okay I gotta save myself in order to save my family and so then I got the file for divorce when my son [Rafael Ferrer], my youngest son was just born.  He was born in '79 [1979], '80 [1980], '81 [1981] so it was just after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eighty [1980] I think.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you had '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: Eighty [1980], I think '80 [1980] I, I got out of it.  I divorced him.
Speaker 1: I see--you had three kids and three, three--you had them back, to back to back?
Speaker 2: They're two years apart.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but--
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975], '77 [1977], '79 [1979] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-seven [1977], oh, '79 [1979] okay, okay, okay, okay; and then '80 [1980], okay.
Story_ID: 647620
Speaker 1: Was the book ['Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme,' Mary Wilson]--so whose, whose idea was the book?
Speaker 2: Mr. Boone's [David Boone].
Speaker 1: Mr. Boone's, Mr. Boo- I know, I know, I know (laughter).  I know Mr. Boone planted the seed (laughter), I'm like, "Mr. Boone?"
Speaker 2: It was just a time for me to decide when I was gonna write it.
Speaker 1: Right, right, so Mr. Boone planted the seed, but who encouraged you 'cause writing a book.  One, it's cathartic.
Speaker 2: No, I always wanted--no one encouraged me on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I no, I mean I knew once I was writing, I was writing about history.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that was always, that was--once that was there that's what it was.  It was just a matter of when I would actually do it.
Speaker 1: And, okay.  So, when you--so, okay, so you, you know what, when is--I thought the--wait a minute.  The twenty-fifth anniversary, isn't that in '85 [1985]?
Speaker 2: You got dates, you guys have dates.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: The twenty- I'm positive, the Motown, the Motown.
Speaker 2: Twenty-fifth, the Motown twenty-fifth ['Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever'].
Speaker 1: Twenty-fifth, Motown twenty-fifth.
Speaker 2: Was what now you're asking?
Speaker 1: I thought that was in '85 [sic. 1983].  I don't--am I wrong, let's see.
Speaker 2: Maybe it was, I don't know.
Speaker 1: I'm almost--wait a minute.
Speaker 2: What, what meaning what for me, is what I know?
Speaker 1: Because you were there--I mean everybody was back.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about 'Motown 25' even though I may not have (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Motown twenty- okay, Motown twenty-fifth25th was absolutely a wonderful idea.  The only thing is that a lot of us weren't prepared for the idea because we didn't have a chance to come back together, together--how do you put that?  So, when the idea came up and I heard about it I was like, "Cool." But we never, we Supremes [The Supremes] never got a chance to be with Diane [Diana Ross], never.  Even when we were on stage that night.  We had not seen her, and so it was kind--it was, it, so it didn't make sense because and it was all built, based upon you, every PR [public relations] thing you heard was, "Supremes are gonna be together, 'Someday We'll Be Together.'" But we were not together.  So, for, for me I realized that you know it's a PR thing and I've gotta save myself.  I gotta you know.  So, I told Cindy [Cindy Birdsong], I said, "Well Cindy I don't know what's gonna happen.  We haven't rehearsed you know so just follow my lead." (Laughter) You know and so we go out there and we start singing and I'm singing 'Someday We'll Be Together' all the time.  So, I sing it every night.  I don't know if Diane was singing it every night, when she was singing and there was a certain part in it that wasn't really the way it was supposed to go.  So, I kind of stepped up and started singing in the part that should've been there and that's when everything fell apart.  So, from where I--next thing I knew somebody came out on stage.  So, our little piece was that small and it was over.
Speaker 1: Someone came out on stage?
Speaker 2: Well, the finale was called.
Speaker 1: So, called--
Speaker 2: So when our guest came out and let's get, let's move this along, let's whatever and they you know started the finale, but it was just--so we never even sang a full song.
Speaker 1: Because someone said or I read about her pushing you.
Speaker 2: Well, then afterwards when everybody was on stage, then Diane was to do a monologue or dialogue and say something about something and I, I think she said something and so I started to say something.  I guess I was not supposed to say anything, I--but I didn't know that there had been a plan.  No one told me there was a plan, so I'm speaking, yeah you know whatever, I'm speaking (laughter) and that's when you know whatever happened, happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But had they told me then, I would've kept my mouth shut (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, anyway to say this, to say that the Motown twenty-fifth for me was not a very pleasant thing.
Story_ID: 647621
Speaker 1: So, you released the first book ['Dreamgirls: My Life as a Supreme,' Mary Wilson], and what is the response to the first book?  How--?
Speaker 2: It was a, it was a best seller.  It was a best seller.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Immediately (snaps fingers) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Immediately.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so you know that was beginning of people really wanting to find out what was going on inside too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Not like now when it's--it's--
Speaker 1: It's all right.
Speaker 2: It's all over for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was the first time that some had, that had really been discussed.  I mean an inside view too, I mean to the audience.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And a company and people who are much loved behind it, so when you did that then what are you thinking you're gonna do next?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: What are you thinking you're--when you, when you had--so, you're going around telling your story.  Lots of people--you, you've said this several times, a lot of people were like, "Why would she do this?  We're angry about this." You know.  Why would--you know and I maybe probably even challenging the, the accuracy of either--you know of things that are in there.  So how do you respond to that?
Speaker 2: Well, I did a lot of TV on it, I mean I hit every program and my, my thought--I didn't have to respond to anybody, I just had to tell my story, but my thought was that it's my life.  This is what happened to me in my life.  This is the way I saw it.  Now, as, as people know, two people can see the same thing and your way of seeing it is totally different from mine. So, that's the way I looked at it.  You know I'm sure someone could say the same thing, they saw it and then at Motown [Motown Records] they said, "Well, that's not the way I remembered it." And that's true but that doesn't bother me so much.  I do hate the fact that a lot of people really stopped liking me or questioned why I said things.  I, I felt very hurt that they didn't understand well this is my life, I'm--you, you let other outsiders tell your story you know but here I am inside and I'm gonna tell my story because this is my story.  I lived it, I was there, I was keeping a journal every minute.  Not out of anger or anything, but because that's what I actually do.  Mr. Boone [David Boone] told me in, in the twelfth grade [at Northeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan] I should become a writer and I'm finding out that I do that well.  So, that's what I do.  So, you know it kind of hurt me that people ignored me for a long time from Motown, a lot of them ignored me.  Probably even still now.  I get a little cold shoulder from a lot of people, but you know I really don't care because I did something that I wanted to do and I did it well and I didn't do it for money.  I did it because that's what I do.  Even now I'm a historian for The Supremes, and I'm the only one who's doing it.
Speaker 1: So when you--in 1990 when you released your second memoir ['Supreme Faith: Someday We'll Be Together,' Mary Wilson and Patricia Romanowski] what were you wanting to do at that point?
Speaker 2: You know my second (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because the first one ends at the, you know?
Speaker 2: My, my books are really one story, but I realized very early on that people at that point only wanted to hear about the, the original Supremes.  So, I cut the book off at the end of The Supremes because that's one book.  Now, I've already written the second one.  So now it, there will come a time when I have a second book.  I thought it was pretty brilliant on my part, and then what I did was from that time on 'til the time I released it, I updated some of the current chapters.  So, I thought it was pretty--a brilliant idea--kind of smart on my part to get two books out of one story.  The first book is about The Supremes, the second book is more about me.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But it is one story.
Speaker 1: And, so you're saying that the only problem with the second story is personal because what happened?
Speaker 2: The second book came out--what was the war, I keep saying quiet storm.  I don't know why I'm saying quiet storm.  The war in the '90s [1990]?
Speaker 1: (TURKESSA FERRER BABICH):  Desert Storm [Operation Desert Storm].
Speaker 2: Desert Storm.
Speaker 1: Desert Storm, see I'm getting Desert Storm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you got the storm you got it right (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm getting it mixed up (unclear).  So, the Desert Storm was the war and it hit the same time my book was released.  So, I had already had all of the, the PR [public relations], the, the for you know TV shows listings, and I had to do them but no one was interested in my book--I say no one but the TV shows weren't--because the War was the most important thing.  So, no one really, the public never really heard about my second book, but to me, to me it's as a great of a story as the first because it's really a story of what happens when a Cinderella story is over.  You know what, what, what happens to Cinderella?  To me what was my second book; and it's a book about a woman's struggling to, to, to work her life, do her life the best she can.
Story_ID: 647622
Speaker 1: And in there ['Supreme Faith: Someday We'll Be Together,' Mary Wilson and Patricia Romanowski] you talk about the ch- you know trying to keep The Supremes together, being the (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I did this whole '70s [1970s], '70s [1970s] on--
Speaker 1: The '70s [1970s]; you talk about your marriage [to Pedro Ferrer].
Speaker 2: Right, so I still get some of the--you know it's not just personal stuff, it's still about the, the music industry and what happened, and you know I, I realized one thing about the '70s [1970s] was that I did, I had some excellent singers in there, excellent girls in there, but, but really The Supremes were not just about singers, you know we were more, we, we dared to dream.  We made our dreams come true you know at a time when it was almost an impossible dream.  We made those dreams come true.  So, you know that's what happened in the '70s [1970s], it just you know that dream had died.
Speaker 1: And what are you--so there had always been this talk of a reunion tour, you know as with any group that is relatively--extremely popular?  Can you talk about the tour, the reunion tour that ended up you know having to be--
Speaker 2: The--
Speaker 1: Because it wasn't successful?
Speaker 2: The reunion tour, and as you said most groups if they have that kind of viability where they're so popular and strong people do want them to get back together.  A lot of groups don't have that opportunity.  We did, we had the opportunity. We were so strong that people loved to see us back together.  Obviously, it can't happen with the three because Florence [Florence Ballard] you know passed away, but Cindy [Cindy Birdsong] was such a great part of, of the latter part of The Supremes that it, it still made sense, so when they started talking about it.  It--this talk had been going on for a number of years that this could happen and people always asked me, "Well when is gonna happen?"  And I said, "Well I don't know." You know and then one day I got a call that you know perhaps this could happen.  Would I be interested?  I'm like, "Yeah." And so you know it, it--I think what happened, the reason why it really never happened the way it should've happened is that it wasn't [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy doing it.  It wasn't Motown [Motown Records], it was outsiders who had no idea about our history and all those kind of things so when they approached--they--Diane [Diana Ross], they approached Diane's camp, obviously not mine and, and then when she--I guess when she finally decided that it was something that they could do, someone else called me and tried to negotiate.  I remember Diane and I had one talk and I said, "Well, when can we get together on that?"  And she and I didn't disagree.  She said it was me, I said it was her (laughter), but.
Speaker 1: Exactly. The audience.
Speaker 2: But, the thing is I really felt that she and I should at least have a one-on-one and, and she just felt that it wasn't--she didn't want to do that.  She'd rather have them handle it, and I'm like, "Okay, great."  And when they did they came at me in a very--I was very hurt the way they came to me.  They did not put as if I was an original member.  It was like I was one of the '70 [1970] members, not part of the building of The Supremes and they offered me something that I thought was extremely low and they put Cindy and I together on that and I thought that was very--I'm like, "Whoa." So these people are not dealing with me as a Supreme.  So, I, I said, "That's not good enough." And they said, "Take it."  I said, "I can't." And that was it.
Speaker 1: So this was FSFX [sic. SFX Entertainment; Live Nation]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay. I do remember that, that did that.  I see.  So, the reunion tour.
Speaker 2: So they didn't come at me the right way.  I felt that they were really--I would have no, no control over saying what gowns, what choreography or whatever.  I'd just have to go in and just show up.  I'm like well that doesn't sound like a reunion to me, plus the money wasn't good.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  Did Motown do any reunion tours like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Only the TV things.
Speaker 1: I see, okay but Motown was struggling at this point too, though?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's--not part of my expertise.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 647623
Speaker 1: Now your son [Rafael Ferrer] passed away.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In what year?
Speaker 2: What was that?
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994]. Wow.  Can you talk about that 'cause you've, you've written about that?
Speaker 2: That was, my son passing and I wrote about it in my second book ['Supreme Faith: Someday We'll Be Together,' Mary Wilson and Patricia Romanowski], but that was one of the updated chapters that I added to the, to the story.  My daughter [Turkessa Ferrer Babich] and her husband [Anthony Babich] had just gotten married.  Had you gotten married?  No, they hadn't got married yet but they were--we, we had all moved to Las Vegas [Nevada] and so my--then the boys and I moved to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and I was bringing some things back to help my daughter--house, you know to kind of get ready, set up housekeeping here in Vegas on, on her own.  And so I was driving back to Vegas with a lot of things for her and so what happened was I was driving the car and I think I should have--I think I had gotten to a point where maybe I should've stopped you know like one of those times you stopped earlier and I'm saying well I can probably go to the next stop and somehow or another I, I went off the road and the, the our--we had this Cherokee [Jeep Grand Cherokee] that was tall and they always had problem with these things tipping, right?  So, I mean I remember, and that was before Vegas had the, the paved the (unclear), it was still very rough on the (unclear).  So, went a little bit here and tried to veer back, I couldn't and it, it immediately tipped, and went all the way over to the other side, and I remember I had my little puppy with me and Rafi was sitting in the driver's seat.  He has his seat belt fastened, seat belt didn't hold him when he tumbled.  I--mine held, you said it didn't?  It held?  What?
Speaker 1: (TURKESSA FERRER BABICH):  The door opened.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: (TURKESSA FERRER BABICH):  The door opened.
Speaker 2: The door, and so, it was one of the, it was one of the things on the car that threw him out.  He hit--what happened?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So we, when we, trip--I was--I didn't fall out.  I think his little body was so frail because it was a very little, frail little thing; and so he didn't, he didn't get through it.
Speaker 1: He was how old?
Speaker 2: Fourteen.
Speaker 1: Fourteen.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  He was, he was the baby.
Story_ID: 647624
Speaker 1: So Mar- let me ask you, Ms. Wilson [HistoryMaker Mary Wilson], where are you in your life right now?
Speaker 2: Where am I?  Well, you know I'm sixty-nine and a half and only just, only just do I feel like I have matured and gotten the answers in life that I've been searching for all my life.  But I've been a, a kid most of my life but full of responsibility, always full of responsibility. Always trying to do what I need to do and I think I'm---at this point in my life I'm right where I've gotten it all, but now I'm seventy (laughter).  You know what I mean, I've gotten answers that I've been searching for.  I don't so feel so in the dark or so everything is so mysterious out there.  I really feel I understand life.  I feel that I have actually accomplished everything in life that one would want to accomplish and so I'm, I'm very clear right now where I am, whereas before maybe I wasn't clear but I was always searching for clarity in it.
Speaker 1: So, so what is clear now for you?
Speaker 2: It' not--it's that life is not a mystery as it was before and other people didn't know more than I know.  And in fact, probably what I knew was maybe more than they knew but in a different area.  I'm pretty much like my mother [Johnnie Lewis Wilson] in terms of being very intuitive.  So, life has really taken care of me even when I didn't know (laughter).  So yeah, I feel very, very clear in terms of life. I know what's important, what's not important and I'm very--I look back and I'm very happy about say major decisions.  I understand that I've made some bad ones.  I also understand that I made some good ones.  I also understand that when I didn't know certain things, I knew I didn't know it and I wasn't ashamed to say I didn't know it either.  I understand all that now and it's kind of helped me to be really balanced, which I've always been balanced, but now I'm balanced with the, the answers; and that's a good place to be.
Story_ID: 647625
Speaker 1: So where are you now?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: In your life, where are you now?  What, or what things would you do that you haven't done that you still would want to do?
Speaker 2: If I were just an ordinary person living a life, I would say I would probably do, would like to be on an island having somebody feed me grapes and da, da, or all that stuff, but I totally enjoy still performing.  I mean I, I don't think I would want to retire at all.  So, where I am right now in my life is more of reaching more goals.  I'm always about reaching goals and I'm known, yes, as one of The Supremes, but I'm not really known as [HistoryMaker] Mary Wilson the singer so, that's one of my goals right now I would like to do.  How? When that's very difficult because there's no more radio stations (laughter), there are no more record shops, so I don't know how that's gonna work, but I am recording and I've recorded a, a very wonder little CD [compact disc], so I hope to have that out.  So, that's one of my goals for right now.  That's kind of a more of a personal thing.  I don't have to do this.  I mean I got laurels, you know but I still just wanna do this.  Have my people know who I am as a vocalist, so, that's one of the areas.  I've always wanted to act, my, my very dear friend Margie Haber, the Jewish girl I told you about has, an acting school in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].  So, she's invited me to come back and study there, which I wanna do 'cause I've always loved acting and I think I would--right now they're allowing black folks on TV.  I'm gonna be there as, as a grandma (laugher), 'cause all my friends are grandmas now.  I see 'em on TV and they all are grandmas.  I'm like okay, I'll do that too.  So, that's another thing that I would like to do, but it's more of just an expression of who I really am as Mary Wilson and do more things other than what I'm known for, and I'm very lucky to have this opportunity to still learn and grow.  So, those are the two things I'd like to do and I'd just like to be here to see all my grandchildren, my eight grandchildren graduate from school, so I wanna do that.
Speaker 1: So that's why everybody's moving then.
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Is that the reason for the move, back to L.A.?
Speaker 2: The reason for the move back to L.A. is probably because yeah, there's a--see, Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] is one animal, but it's not really a career kind of thing and I'm still into the career, so L.A., Los Angeles [California], Hollywood is--yeah, or New York [New York].  Like I could go to New York or London [England] too.  Those are my three favorite places, but for growth and, and for doing the things I would like to do.  So, those things I would like to still do and I would like to probably find romance at this stage in my life, a companion that would be really cool.  Those are the main things that I'd like to do now at this big spa- because you know I find it everyone works so hard.  You worked hard then people die (laughter).  You know what I would--I would like to be able now to still have a life and still have goals, still have you know a, a companion and all of that, enjoy life instead of having to work so hard.  I've worked hard all my life for fifty-four years.  Tired of working hard, I just want to enjoy it now and still pursue.
Story_ID: 647626
Speaker 1: What have you--I wanna ask about the Motown [Motown Records]--Motown legacy, but I wanna re-ask the question about what you have learned about yourself that you're gonna take into this new, this new, new career?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanna write my, my book, see that--I have a book that I really want to write and it's, it would encompass all of that.  What I have learned in life is that this is a real precious gift we've all been given, and I think so often and if you look in prison you'll see all the people in prison.  You look at all the drug--you see all these things and you wonder how did we miss what life is all about?  Why is it we have such of the wrong information in terms of our goals and what we go towards and what we make of 'em, why have we all missed all of this?  And, and we must've missed it if there's still wars and all these things going on.  Once you go--going, who know what's going on?  I mean to me I'm in awe of this beautiful experience that we have been given.  So, that's kind of what I have learned up to this point, is that there has to be a real and honest truth and why is it that so many of us miss the truth?  Why is that not the important thing?  And then you're gone, you know, and so, that's to me, that's what I've learned and that's what I'd like to write about to kind of put out there to people that it's more than just this moment; and this moment should have a meaning.  It's gotta be.

Speaker 1: So, I mean, but you're also in a very important part of our history as a time period.  Now, a lot of people are looking back right now as they sort of look forward, although, there're a lot of people are looking back and the, so I wanna ask some legacy questions and questions about what you consider really the legacy of, of Motown [Motown Records], and then I want to understand the legacy of the, The Supremes.
Speaker 2: Well, maybe I should probably--let me start with The Supremes first, the legacy of The Supremes.  That I can really know about.  I think that our legacy should be, especially for women, is that we are beautiful, powerful human beings.  In terms of being black women, I think we, The Supremes, the legacy is that we inspired a whole community of people.  Inspired in the way of giving them the knowledge of music, intellect--how can I say the other thing is that women can pursue their dreams and make those dreams come true.  I think The Supremes' legacy is all of that and not just for black women.  I mean for women, because you know there was a time when the world was, it was a man's world and so when people saw The Supremes, up there, three beautiful black women, it inspired women.  "Whoa!  We can be powerful and beautiful and, and all that too."  So I think that's our legacy, and, and I'm speaking at a time when it was really needed because you know it had been, the world had been run by men up to that point and, and of course the, the--I think we Supremes had something to do with, from the '60s [1960s] on, where woman because we had the suffrage rights, moving all that early on which definitely started something and now in the '60s [1960s] this whole new generation of women, I think we had a lot do with inspiring them.  So, now about Motown, I don't know, I'm not quite sure if I can answer that question.  I'd, I'd just rather leave it with the, with--
Speaker 1: But you were such an important part of it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean and, and there will never be another Motown.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And.
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I just can't seem to get my mind set to wrap around.  I mean that, I know that again, that the music and [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy and Motown, the artists all inspired music, but I couldn't go any more in depth into that.  I mean The Supremes I can 'cause I know that we, we hit more than music.  You know, we hit a, we hit human beings in terms of their growth, in terms of being human beings.  Women, power, ambition, you know because women were really--I remember when we The Supremes started traveling around the world, women were just still bringing coffee to men, and this was around the world.  Now, we have women who are the CEOs of companies, all those kinds of things.  So, I'm saying about in terms of instilling, like Mrs. Powell [HistoryMaker Maxine Powell] instilled in us, instilling inside that you can move forward as a human being--that's different than just making music.  That's a different subject matter to me.

Speaker 1: What are your thoughts or hopes or concerns about the black community?
Speaker 2: Black community, my concerns and thoughts?  I would think that people need to--people need to move from their state of being in terms of--I, I remember going to college and they said, "What do you think and what influence--is it the community, is it the family, is it this?" da, da, da.  I'm thinking we are, we're--if we're born poor, it's hard to get beyond what happens when you're poor.  So, we stay in this area here, so I think for, for black people we need to kind of get beyond having been slaves.  I know we've--you know our parents were and all and grandparents, I know that's there and I also know that sometimes it takes a long time to get those things out of your cells, out of your DNA (laughter), you know.  It's not even a mindset you know, sometimes it's things that are just there that--I don't know they get there somehow or another.  So for me I think that we as black people need to be able to remove ourselves from some of the pain and sufferings of our you know great grandparents and things, and so that we can--if you would take a--one person and put him in a you know in, in an aristocratic area, to me they have a better chance of moving beyond because they have all this new, the new tools to work with as opposed to the same old tools.  So, I think we just need to get rid some of the old tools that we have in our aura, (laughter) you know and, and see what's going on now, you know just kind of look now and I think this happening.  I see other younger generations in terms of the, the movie actors and the singers.  They are, they are powerful people because they are not allowing that old mindset to stop them or to keep them in that area.  So, I don't know how to say it 'cause I've never put it into words, but I really feel that we need to kind really like to get beyond what has gone on now.  It's good to hear it, it's good to know it, people need to know it.  In fact, some of our young people don't know it, they need to know it, but you need to know that, that's now how you should operate today.  It's--that didn't come out right, but anyway, that's it.

Speaker 1: What, I wanna go back to one more Motown [Motown Records] question; then I'm gonna ask you your legacy question.  What--are there any other memories of the Motown experience that you would like to share?
Speaker 2: Oh, we got loads of them, I mean one thing that was great at Christmas times, we--they always had huge Christmas parties and we got gifts and we were all there singing and, and celebrating together.  That was one of the best times of, of my life outside of the family, was being able to celebrate with the Motown family and, and see real kind of happiness and people celebrating their uniqueness and, and just really be in the moment of saying, "We all have achieved and look at us having such a great time."  So, it was really a great Christmas, you know really great in terms of happiness and sharing gifts and it was real.  How can I put it, it was real and probably if you ask any one from Motown they would all say that same thing about the Christmas parties there: they were always so, so good, so warm.

Speaker 1: And then you know you had a nickname, sweet pea?
Speaker 2: I got several.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Sweet pea and, yes--that was my nickname at Motown [Motown Records].  But when I was a child, my nickname was May-May.
Speaker 1: So what does May-May and Sweet Pea and Mary [HistoryMaker Mary Wilson] all want to, want to have as their legacy?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: What do you want to have as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I, you now if I could be remembered like my mom [Johnnie Lewis Wilson], someone who's like a real angel, but I' know I've done so many things, I can't be an angel (laughter).  But I would like for people to know that my heart has always been wanting to do good, even though I've stumbled many times, but that, that I really---my intentions have always to be good and to search for the truth.  I've never, ever want anyone to think that I've, I'm, I'm like--I don't know, I just wanna be known--the way I think I am is that I'm really a seeker of like the truth.
