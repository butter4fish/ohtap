Speaker 1: Okay.  Today we're interviewing Mr. Robert Hooks.  The videographer is Matthew Hickey and I'm [HM] Paul Brock.  I'm going to start Mr. Hooks if you would allow me, to ask for your full name and if you would please spell it for me.
Speaker 2: Sure.  My, my full name at birth, which is different than my name now.  I was born Bobby Dean Hooks, B-O-B-B-Y, D-E-A-N, H-O-O-K-S.  During my acting career I changed my name to Robert Hooks, R-O-B-E-R-T, H-O-O-K-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dropping the Dean and dropping the Bobby.  So now it's Robert Hooks.
Speaker 1: Everyone knows you as Robert Hooks.
Speaker 2: Indeed.  If I hear Bobby, I know it's somebody that knew me when.
Speaker 1: The, the--and, and where are we today?
Speaker 2: We're in Toluca Lake, California, which is a little village in Burbank [California], which I, I guess I've been living here for about twenty years now.  Wonderful, cozy little house here in Toluca Lake, California.
Speaker 1: And today's date.
Speaker 2: Today is October the 4th, it will be Tuesday, October 4th, 2005.
Speaker 1: You get an A for that because I can't tell you the number of people who get that wrong, the date.
Story_ID: 154225
Speaker 1: Okay I'm going to ask you four or five simple, very simple questions.  And they say it's to make you comfortable and to make me comfortable.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And I'll begin by asking you--they only require very simple answer.  What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color would be green and gray.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your favorite food.
Speaker 2: My favorite food, that would be fruit, vegetables and a little fish and a little chicken.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Very little red meat.
Speaker 1: Very little, okay.  And your favorite time of year or season?
Speaker 2: I would say the fall.  I live in California and it's very hot in the summer.  The fall, it cools off and reminds me of the East Coast, which is where I was born.  So I'd say the fall is my favorite at this point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: but I remember when it used to be winter.  I loved the snow and, and I loved the snow, not anymore.  So fall would be the answer to that question.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  And your favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: Oddly enough, it's right here in California.  It's a place called Laguna Beach [California].  I fell in love with Hawaii a long time ago but couldn't get there as much as I wanted to.  And somebody mentioned there was a place in California.  You get into your car and you drive for one hour and you're at the beach.  And you're in a wonderful spot off of the Pacific Coast Highway.  It's called Laguna Beach, and that's where I, that's where I vacation.  I don't have to get on a plane a fly-- (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)-- very--
Speaker 2: --just get in the car.
Speaker 1: Very short distance from here.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And finally, your favorite saying or phrase.
Speaker 2: If I had to pick a saying or a phrase, I would have to say it's something like, what's up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Very, very simple.
Speaker 2: That covers a spectrum.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 154226
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to begin, if you would, with your date of birth.
Speaker 2: Sure.  I was born April the 18th, 1937 in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and you answered the second question, Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: Right.  'Cause I knew that was gonna be the second question-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) second question.  The, the--what I'm going to do is just explore your knowledge on your family, how far back you can take us on your mother's side and then on your father's side.  So let's start with your mother's side, and let's start with your mother name, her full name.
Speaker 2: Right.  My mother's name was Mae Bertha Ward.
Speaker 1: M-A-E?
Speaker 2: M-A-E, B-E-R-T-H-A, W-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And her place of birth and, and date of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born September the 27th, 1911.  I believe, I believe that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: In, in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember the place?
Speaker 2: I believe it was Rocky Mount, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was either Rocky Mount or Wilson [North Carolina].  I believe Rocky Mount.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Something else we share in common.  The, the--now how far back do you have knowledge of her family?  How many generations can you go back?
Speaker 2: I can't go back too far, I have it written down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's a partial family tree that I did, but at this juncture, I cannot, I cannot--I can take you back--I'm just not going to try to guess at it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We can do this at another time, because I do have a partial family tree that deals with my mother and my father's side.  Not very extensive because the, the griots just didn't exist on my side of the family that could carry me back.  So we'll have to, we'll have to just leave that at this point.
Speaker 1: That's, that's fine.  Do you have knowledge of, say your grandfather, your mother's father?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I don't-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) then we can get that later.
Speaker 2: I know the, I know the name was Finch [ph.].  My grandfather's on my, my--my grandfather on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother.  I believe that was Finch.  But let's leave that.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Because I don't wanna, I don't wanna confuse the issue here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm just not that knowledgeable and I cannot go back--the Alex Haley's not in me.
Story_ID: 154227
Speaker 1: Let me ask this, this question.  On your father's full, full name.
Speaker 2: My father's name was Edward Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay. And.
Speaker 2: Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me.  My father's name was Edward Hooks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother's [Mae Bertha Ward's] maiden name was Ward before it was Hooks.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: So it would be Edward Hooks.
Speaker 1: And your father's date of birth, if you, if you know it.
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He died when I was two years old and I know very little about my father's background that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except that he was I understand a great a great father to my siblings-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and you don't have any knowledge as to his place of birth.
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, as a matter of fact- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) okay.
Speaker 2: He was born in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then moved to North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  You don't have a place in Virginia, though.
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Good to know--
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 154228
Speaker 1: Let's go back now to, to your mother [Mae Bertha Ward].  What are your earliest memories of, of your mom there?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory, it's amazing that I can remember this.  One of the most vivid, and I was a baby.  I remember being in my mother's arms, sitting in the living room on Newport Place in Washington, D.C.  My mother was holding me and there was a knock at the door.  And my mother got up with me in her arms, and I remember seeing a very red faced Irish policeman.  And I don't remember any of the dialogue because I was a baby, but I, I--it's amazing how I can remember this.  And I remember it because--anyway the policeman told my mother obviously and she told me later that that's what it was, that my father [Edward Ward] had died on the railroad.  And I felt her squeeze me, I felt her shake me.  I'll never forget this.  Glen Miller's 'Moonlight Serenade' was playing in the background.  And she sat down and she was just holding me and shaking.  I assume crying.  That's the earliest I remember about my mother and me.  And I'll never forget that.  And it's amazing, I can't remember yesterday, but I can remember that time, seeing that face of that man.  And he had a police cap on and he was a very red faced, I assume Irishman.  And I'll never forget that.
Speaker 1: Well obviously if you were in your mother's arms, that--that was very traumatic.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Do you have any details of your father's death, how it occurred?
Speaker 2: He was working on the railroad, and he, he had a heart attack I guess.  I, I don't know too much about it.  He was working on the railroad, he was away a lot.  He was on the railroad working and I believe he died somewhere in the South, and I'm not sure where.  But it was actually on the tracks, working, building I guess railroad trac-- tracks or piles or something.  And he worked himself to death.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a young man, he wasn't old.
Story_ID: 154229
Speaker 1: Let's try to capture the--your siblings.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: How many children?
Speaker 2: There were five of us.
Speaker 1: Five.  Can you start with the oldest and--
Speaker 2: Yes I can.  The oldest was my sister Bernice.  Bernice was very attractive, big boned, just glorious and joyful woman, girl.  And she was, she was a second mother to me.  We were all two years apart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Bernice was the oldest.  And then there was my brother Charles Edward was the next oldest.  He was the only real father that I really knew, really knew because we grew up together and he was always the father figure in the house because my father [Edward Hooks] had died.  So Charles Edward.  And then there's Caroleigh, that's spelled C-A-R-O, C-A-R-O-L-E-I-G-H.
Speaker 1: E-I-G-H, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, Caroleigh, one word.  Caroleigh was the next oldest.  And then, then James Walter was my--the brother next to me, and then there was Bobby Dean.
Speaker 1: The youngest.
Speaker 2: The youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there were five of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm going to sort of try to go back and see if I can come up with Bernice's date of birth.
Speaker 2: Geesh, I, I, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: You were '37 [1937].  In 19, 19--0
Speaker 2: I was born in '37 [1937].
Speaker 1: In 1937.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So James Walter would be '35 [1935]?
Speaker 2: Thirty-five [1935].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Caroleigh would be '33 [1933].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Charles Edward would be '31 [1931].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So Bernice had to have been 1929.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we get a good sense of, of that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 154230
Speaker 1: And you lived up on Newport [Place, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: We lived on Newport Place in Washington, D.C.  And for most of my childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then after my brothers and sisters married off, then my mother [Mae Bertha Ward] remarried and we moved to N Street, which is not far from Newport Place.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right behind Francis Junior High School [now School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.], which is where I went to junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if you know that area, there's a playground, a big playground.  There's a tennis court and--well N Street is the next street over and that we moved to N Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then after N Street, then that's when I moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay let's--
Speaker 2: But most of my childhood was spent on Newport Place in Washington, D.C.-(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On Newport Place. Okay.
Story_ID: 154231
Speaker 1: Any other childhood memories that you can give us about your mother.  Was she--did she work, or--
Speaker 2: My mother [Mae Bertha Ward] was a seamstress.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she would, she would get a lot of work given to her by the different merchants and she would bring it home and she would sew.  I remember the Singer sewing machine buzzing in, in the house and, and my mother saying to us "don't, don't, don't play with the machine."  Because those were some dangerous little machines.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Those Singer sewing machines, the ones with the wheels that you--and the pedal.
Speaker 1: I was getting ready to say it wasn't electric, it was the pedal type.
Speaker 2: No, no, right, right, right.  It was great--they're great old machines.  I still see 'em every once in a while.  But she was a seamstress and she worked to, to make money to kind of keep the family.  And then of course the work was--became sparse and, and she didn't make as much.  And then of course we all had to chip-in.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I remember all of us having to work.  I mean I started delivering papers when I was like nine years old.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: Just to help make money to, to bring into the house.
Story_ID: 154232
Speaker 1: During those early period, you know, you would say 1939, we were in a [Great] Depression during that period.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so things were kind of tough.
Speaker 2: Things were tough, very tough.  Newport Place [Washington, D.C.], I mean it was, it was the ghetto, first of all.  It was a tremendously poverty stricken area.  It's not anymore.
Speaker 1: No, it's not.
Speaker 2: The houses are going for million dollars or more now, but where we lived in a railroad flat, rat infested.  As a matter of fact, there was a story written in one of the newspapers in Washington, D.C.  I have the article somewhere.  About these two little boys being bitten by rats in their house, in their bed in the middle of the night.  That was myself and my brother James Walter.  And there's an article in, in the paper, in I believe the Washington Star or the Times Herald, one of those papers, it's around.  And an article about the situation of these rat infested ghettos that we lived in.
Speaker 1: And I can remember those.  But let, let me ask you this.  How old were you when--
Speaker 2: Seven.
Speaker 1: Seven.
Speaker 2: I was seven years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And I was bitten actually twice in my hand.  And I was bitten, we were rushed to the hospital.  Given shots and whatever.  Bandaged my hand up.  My brother was bandaged as well, I don't know where he was bitten.  But came back, went to sleep the next night.  The rat bites through the--again.  So I was bitten twice by rats.  It was a terrible, terrible ghetto that we, we lived in when we were coming up.  And it's amazing what has happened, the transformation of those areas in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] now.  It was the Foggy Bottom [Washington, D.C.].  It was called the Foggy Bottom.  Now the Foggy Bottom is chic.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Not then.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  The--many of us knew the Foggy Bottom homes and so, so forth.  The, the--just going back to, to that period, let's see '39 [1939], '40 [1940], the beginning.  Do, do you remember the beginning of World War II during that period?
Speaker 2: Only in that there were relatives, cousins who used to come around in uniform.  I was too young to remember too much about it, and I don't, I can't remember the dialogue.  I'm sure there was a lot of dialogue about the war.  But I don't remember.  I was a kid; I was, you know I was too young to remember that--the specifics of what was happening.  But I do recall relatives, in fact I lost a cousin in the war.  And, and I just, I know that I can remember not seeing him anymore, wondering what happened to him because he used to come around on furloughs and things.  And then because he was a cousin, he would spend a lot of time in our house.  And I remember him putting his cap on me, you know, on my little head, which was full of curls, you know.  And I remember him being the nicest man.  And then I didn't see him anymore and then I realized that, I found out later that he was killed in the war. Yeah.
Story_ID: 154233
Speaker 1: Now your elementary school days.  Do you remember very much about that, starting elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  I went to Stevens Elementary School [now Schools Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.], which is right at 21st and L Streets, not far from Newport Place.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we would walk to school every morning.  It is--as a matter of fact, it still sits there.  It is now a national historical landmark.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's where Jimmy, President Jimmy Carter's daughter went to that same school.  But--and, and, and the legend, Petey Greene also went to that school.  We all went to, to Stevens Elementary School.  I was on the patrol, and there's a picture floating somewhere around with me in my patrol belt with my badge.  I was a good student.  We had, we had wonderful teachers.  Needless to say, it was an all black school in the nation's capital.  And I went to all black schools until I moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in high school.  So it was all segregated in Washington, D.C. at the time.
Speaker 1: Any particular teacher stands out for you?
Speaker 2: Well a couple teachers in elementary school, actually three teachers in elementary school.  Mr. Cole who was a history teacher I believe.  Mrs. Hopkins, I can't remember what she taught, and Mrs. Chase.  And I believe it was Ms. Hayes too, but I, I know those three, Cole, Hopkins and Chase were three of my favorite teachers in elementary school.  And I remember one of the wonderful things that we used to do was wrap the maypole on, on the beginning of, of May.  We'd all dress in white of course.  I think they probably still do it.  And we wrapped the maypole and we'd have maypole contests on the playground at school.  And I remember that vividly.  I also remember a lot of negatives in the school, you know like, you know like kids taking my lunch, my lunch, not my lunch money, but my lunch.  'Cause my mother [Mae Bertha Ward] used to make sandwiches and the guys that were less fortunate would, you know would come and kind of con me out of some of my food.  They would not take it.  I was such a nice guy, I'd give it, I'd share it with 'em.  But they wouldn't take it, you know because my brothers were there.  But I remember the, the, the bullies in, in elementary school and junior high school as well.  But Stevens Elementary was the, was the classic elementary school, just a wonderful school.  And I'm still, as a matter of fact, kind of connected with the alumni association with the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Any--can you think of any names of, of people who went on to greater things as you did from the elementary school?
Speaker 2: From the elementary school, I mean except for [Ralph] Petey Greene who was, who was you know a radio personality and comic, a legendary humorous.  But he was a wino at one point.  He was a thief at one point.  A great story.  As a matter of fact, I am in the process of, of preparing to do his story on film.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's from a book called 'Laugh if You Like, Ain't a Damn Thing Funny [the Life Story of Ralph "Petey" Greene As Told to Lurma Rackley]' by Lurma Rackley who's a wonderful young writer.  You may know Lurma.
Speaker 1: I've worked with Lurma.
Speaker 2: Yeah, out of Atlanta [Georgia] now.  But she's written a book.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I just optioned the book from her and I think Steve Harvey the comic, the very successful comic here, who reminds everybody of Petey Greene, loves the project and I think might play Petey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 154234
Speaker 1: Now from there you went on to Francis Junior High [School, now Schools Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Francis Junior High was the first, was my first junior high school, and was, was a shorter distance to walk because it was right through the alley, across 22nd Street through the alley and you're right there after you cross 23rd Street, which is a, you know right behind the row of houses on 22nd.  And then you're right at Francis's [Francis Junior High School's, Washington, D.C.] property.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we went to school, junior high school there.  A wonderful time, wonderful period of my life, junior high school.  I did my first play in junior high school, as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well my sister Bernice was a recreational counselor.  And she--this was in the summer when we were out of school, but we were doing the--Bernice was working in the school as a recreational counselor.  And she would put on these plays, and she would do a lot of other things with the kids too, but she'd put on these plays.  And she approached me one day to ask me if I'd be in a play and I said you must be crazy; I'm not gonna get up on the stage.  To me running around with my guys on the street, it was a sissy thing to do.  And she coerced me into saying yes by, and I write about this in my book, we all slept in the same bed together.  The two girls up front, up top and the three guys down at the bottom.  And it was just that we had to do that, there was only one bed for five children.  And my sister Bernice had these big toes, we all have big toes, the Hooks family, we have big, big toes.  But Bernice's were big, big toes.  She could pick up things with it, she could write with them, she could do all kinds--and she could also pinch with them.  And she would in the middle of the night, she would put her toe up and grab the very tender part of my thigh and she'd give it a pinch that you, I mean it was--brought tears to my eyes.  And she did that a couple of nights until I said yes I'll be in the play.  And that's how she coerced me to be--to say yes I'll do the play.  She knew she saw something there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean I may have seen it too, but I certainly wasn't about to, you know, act on it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was with my guys running up and down the street, doing street things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154235
Speaker 1: And there I was in this play.  And I remember we did it one evening.  It was called- Oh! It was 'The Pirates of Penzance' [Arthur Sullivan and W.S. Gilbert], the Gilbert [and] Sullivan thing.
Speaker 2: What year are we approximately would you say?
Speaker 1: We are talking about--
Speaker 2: You're in junior high.
Speaker 1: I'm no, no actually I wasn't in junior high, forgive me.  I was not in junior high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just that Bernice was working in the junior high school and I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no I was nine years old.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was nine years old when this happened.
Speaker 2: So you were still in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was nine years old, I was at Stevens [Elementary School, now Schools Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.].  But it was summer and Bernice was doing this thing at Francis [Junior High School, now Schools Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that's where I started acting.  And, and I remember vividly we performed at night for all of the people in the, in the community because it was recreation time at Francis.  Whether you played football, basketball, baseball, whatever.  But there was--Bernice had this thing going with the dance classes and whatever, and she had this drama group.  So there I was, and I remember doing 'Pirates of Penzance' [Arthur Sullivan and W.S. Gilbert] and the curtain went down and we all--Bernice had us all come out, and the people just loved this play.  I can't remember too much about the play.  And the applause was amazing.  So there I was standing there listening to this applause and I'm saying wait, I like this.  This is good.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And form that point on when I went back to school, I would get into the little drama clubs and things and I started acting at nine.
Speaker 2: So, at nine.
Speaker 1: At nine years old.
Speaker 2: You knew you wanted to be an actor.
Speaker 1: I was doing it, yeah.
Speaker 2: You loved that applause and everything.
Speaker 1: Yes, I was doing it.  So whenever I, so whenever I--when I, when school started again, the first thing I did was I found out who--where's the drama club here at Stevens. And--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: -- there was a drama club.  Yeah, there was a--and I don't know if it was called the drama club, but we, we were on stage doing our thing--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --at Stevens.  So that's when it started.
Story_ID: 154488
Speaker 1: So you've just discovered that bug now to be an actor, you're still in elementary school [at Stevens Elementary School, later Schools Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Still in elementary school, but there was something about being on that stage and it was just, it was another world for me.  And, and, and I thought that my buddies who ran the streets with me, would be on my case.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean I thought I would never live this down.  Just the opposite.  They saw what they saw and they thought you know, Bobby's got something going here.  So they supported me.  And I thought they wouldn't.  I thought that they would laugh at me, I thought they'd do the whole sissy thing and I'd have to start fighting 'cause we did a lot of that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But no, not at all.  So I really fell in love with, with the stage at nine years old, and it wasn't even a legitimate stage.  It was just a stage.
Story_ID: 154489
Speaker 1: Now were there any other loves, reading or--
Speaker 2: I didn't read much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My brother Charles would lay across the bed and read a novel in three hours.  He had books like crazy and he would always say to me, you gotta read these books.  And he had these great books, all these great authors, not just novels but--and I only, only later in life I started reading.  But not then.  Then I, I did very little reading.  But Char--my brother Charles was a great reader, and--
Speaker 1: What were some of your other interests then with your running buddies, besides the, the acting bug that you had discovered?
Speaker 2: Let me see, there was craps, there were girls.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There was all the, all the sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And games, just running the street games.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But mainly, mainly shooting a little crap in the back alley.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Never--well I did smoke.  Once, once I had a friend whose name was Babe Wages [ph.].  And Babe would go--wonderful young guy, we, we were very close.  He would go--there was a bus stop on Twenty-third Street where the white folk from O Street and, and Twenty-first Street would come, take the bus to go to work and go mostly to the, you know the museums and the federal buildings and all.  But there was a bus stop, and they'd start smoking a cigarette and the bus would come and they'd put the cig--throw the cigarette out.  So my friend Babe would go down to the bus stop and get little bags of cigarettes.  And I would say you shouldn't be doing that.  He said no, you gotta try this.  So once we went out back of my house, 2133 Newport Place in the back, and I lit this cigarette.  And I had never tasted anything so terrible in all my life.  How could anybody fall in love with a burning, taste of burning tobacco?  But I was choking like crazy.  And my Aunt Elizabeth at the time was living with us.  And she came out and she caught me smoking this cigarette.  And there was a crate, an orange crate.  And she was livid.  She pulled a piece of wood off of the orange crate and she started tearing into my behind.  She whipped my behind through the house, talking to me at the same time.  "You never,"--you know how they do, they whip and they talk to you at the same time.  And I never smoked again in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never did, never did.  But any way just street games for the most part.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  And now we are toward the end of, what 1946, '47 [1947]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I would be ten years old in '47 [1947] and, and yeah, I, I would think that it was in the summer, Fra--there was Francis [Junior High School, now the School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens], there was a swimming pool, public swimming pool at Francis.  And we would go swimming every day.  We would swim every day.  And I was a pretty good swimmer and, and we spent a lot of time in the summer at Francis's pool.  And then as I got a little older, on Friday nights they used to have dances at Francis's pool, but only in the locker room area, where they'd change, that would turn into a dance hall.  And with the dark, you know, red lights and the dance hall and, and all kinds of craziness would happen in there, you know, in the stalls.  And I remember just having a lot of fun kissing the girls and things like that at a young age.  But yeah, from the point of ten, and then you know, you know it was, it was all Newport Place.  It was all Georgetown [Washington, D.C.], Newport Place.
Speaker 1: Okay. And--
Speaker 2: Go, we would go fishing down at the Creek, Rock Creek Park.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that was right behind us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we'd fish, snagging herrings and fishing for eel and you know, and stuff like that.  But a lot of time spent doing that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 154490
Speaker 1: But you were still pursuing this love of acting. I mean-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but sporadically.
Speaker 1: Sporadically.
Speaker 2: Not, yes sporadically.  Only in school and I didn't get serious about it until high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't get serious about it.  But in junior high school, actually in junior high school I remember doing--somebody wrote a play.  One of the teachers wrote a play, it was called 'The School is Born.'  And I had my first lead role in this play.  And this was when I was at Francis Junior High [School, now the School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens].  So I was, I must have been thirteen, fourteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somewhere in there.  And then from that point on, I would, I would really pursue it in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then of course that, that was all of the acting that I, I didn't do anything outside of the school plays and things like that until I graduated from jun--from high school.
Speaker 1: From high school, okay.
Speaker 2: And then of course when I graduated from high school, I moved to, to New York.  And now I'm, you know now I'm a little older and--but there's a period to cover before that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: When I moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's--you graduated from Francis [Junior School, now the School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens] and, and you went to high school in Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I went to high school in Washington.  I went to Armstrong High School [Armstrong Technical High School, Washington, D.C.] in Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Which is right across the street from [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Which I'm sure you know.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Which is where all the fine young girls who were--I mean Armstrong was, you know they had nice girls too, but--
Speaker 1: Not like Dunbar.
Speaker 2: We used to look across the street and Dunbar was something else.  But there are all kinds of wonderful stories about Dunbar and the, and the paper bag theory about color.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: If you were dark-
Speaker 1: Now what, what year did you start at Armstrong?
Speaker 2: Geesh, what year.  Okay let's go back.
Speaker 1: Just want to get a chronology.
Speaker 2: Right.  I started at Armstrong, had to have been '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950], '51 [1951] or two [1952], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but I didn't finish Armstrong because my mother [Mae Bertha Ward] then remarried and we moved to Phila--she moved to Philadelphia.  I stayed in Washington for a while, but then got into some trouble--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: -- and my mother came down and got me, brought me up to Philadelphia, which is where I went to my first integrated school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In my-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: -- I guess it was senior year in high school.
Story_ID: 154491
Speaker 1: Do you wanna describe that trouble to us that you got into?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a matter of fact, it's, you know, I write about it in my autobiography, which incidentally I'm writing now and will be published hopefully, knock on wood, sometime soon.  It's called 'Life for Me: At the Crossroads of Culture, Politics and the Civil Rights Movement.'  That was my, that's my story.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And what happened was I was, I was washing cars on Saturdays.  And there was a man named Mr. Smith [ph.].  I always thought he worked for the C.I.A. [Central Intelligence Agency] or one of those federal organizations.  But he would--I would wash his car on Saturday mornings for him.  And he'd give me the keys so I could back it up.  He had skirts on his--one of those Chevys with the skirts.  And so I'd back the car up, I'd wash the wheels.  So I backed the car up, started the car.  Well one day I thought I would take a stroll in the car, take a spin.  And I started down the street and I saw Babe Wages [ph.] sitting on the stoop and I saw Bo Peterson [ph.] sitting on the stoop.  I said jump in, guys.  And I saw Kenny Woodruff [ph.] and I saw his brother Neal Woodruff [ph.].  So here I am driving this car with all these kids in the car and I'm driving around the neighborhood, right.  Well Mr. Smith of course came down and missed his car and called the police.  So now I'm driving for at least fifteen or twenty minutes, right.  And then I start--okay I better take this man's car back.  So I pulled in the alley, there's an alley right--there are two alleys.  One at one side--bottom of the street and one at the top of the street.  So I pull into the alley from O Street [Washington, D.C.].  I, I'm coming down O and I pull into the alley coming toward Newport Place [Washington, D.C.].  And you and Matthew [Hickey] know these two, these alleys.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So--but then in the Newport Place side of the alley, comes a police car.  So now I'm coming and I stop the car and I tell the guys to get out.  I mean I'm caught, I gotta, you know.  So they get out and they run back around O Street and they flee, right.  And there I am and Mr. Smith is in the police car.  And so they take me to the Third Precinct [sic] and, and I go to the receiving home, which is where they take little, bad little kids that do bad things.  I wasn't a bad kid, I just made a dumb mistake.  And so I was in the receiving home for three days as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Oh. Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother [Mae Bertha Ward] came down to get me from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], to get me--
Story_ID: 154492
Speaker 1: I remember in the, the night I went into the receiving home, it was a night 'cause I was in the Third Precinct [sic] and then they transported me to the receiving home, which is out in Northeast [Washington, D.C.].  So I go into the receiving home, it's night time and the guy gives me a blanket and a pillow and there are these locked doors.  And so--but there are guys in there.  And the guys saying "bring him in here, bring him in here."  I said no, no, no, you don't wanna take me in there, okay.  You do not wanna take me in there because they're gone be trouble.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So they put me into this--a calmer place.  And for three days I was in, in this receiving home.  And I remember waking up the next morning going to breakfast.  And breakfast, you sit in this room, this room with the rest of these bad guys.  And I'm sitting there and I'm eating my oatmeal and I got a couple pieces of toast.  So there's a guy sitting at the end of the table, he says, "gimme your slabs."  And I didn't pay him any--my--I didn't know what slabs were.  He said, "hey, hey you.  Gimme your slabs."  He was looking at me.  I said, "what?"  He said "toast, gimme your toast."  I said you--I'm gone eat my toast.  He said "I want the slabs."  I said "well you're not gonna get the slabs, okay."  He said "Well I'll deal with you."  I said "you can deal with me whenever", you know.  'Cause I knew that once I let these guys take advantage of me, then you know.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So after breakfast we'd go out into the playground, basketball playground kind of thing.  So this guy wants to deal with me.  So you know I wasn't gonna jump out.  I whipped his behind like you would not believe.  I whipped his butt.  And so for the three days that I was there, nobody bothered me anymore.
Speaker 2: After that.
Speaker 1: But I had to fight this guy.
Speaker 2: Had to.
Speaker 1: And it wasn't a long fight.  I just sucker punched him real quick 'cause I knew he was gonna hit me.  So I just hit him, knocked him back down and jumped on top of him.  And then somebody pulled me off of him.  But I had a--I took advantage of him.  He was a big guy too.  It happened to me later on in life too, when I moved to New York [New York], but that's another story.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 154493
Speaker 1: But at that time you were about in your first year of high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I was in my first year in high school, which makes me, what fourteen or fifteen, something like that, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: But, but anyway my mother [Mae Bertha Ward].
Speaker 1: Came down.
Speaker 2: Came from Philadelphia, [Pennsylvania] took me back up, you know, we took the train up to Philadelphia.  And that's when I moved in with my, my new family.  My brother, my stepbrothers and sisters and my stepfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was the, that was the, that was a great, wonderful time period in my life because I went to my first integrated school, West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And started getting to know and mixing with and befriending Italians, Jews, Irish, you know and blacks.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it was just a wonderful--I had never done it before.
Speaker 1: What was your stepfather's name?
Speaker 2: Joe, Joe Dickerson [ph.] was my stepfather's name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a little short guy, nice man.  Never knew what my mother saw in him, but anyway.
Speaker 1: And, and how many of--
Speaker 2: He had, he had--let me just name them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The oldest was Charles, ironically one of my brothers is Charles.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Then there was Annette [ph.], and then there was Margie [ph.], and then there was Robert, Bobby.  So there were--two, we had a Bobby and a Robert, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and so that would be four, so he had four kids.  And they were around my age, actually.  I guess Charles was around my age, he was the oldest.  And so, so we--so I moved in with them and then went to West Philadelphia High School.  I think they set me back a grade too when I went there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was an incredible experience for me.
Story_ID: 154494
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of the most outstanding experiences, both good or, or bad.
Speaker 2: Well I, you know, mostly they were--well they, they were good and bad.  But I remember, I remember meeting a guy, John--this white kid, can't remember his--for some reason his name escapes me.  But we're in class together and we kind of got to like each other.  And I spent time at his house and he'd come over, you know, occasionally to my house.  But I remember just socializing with these different people, the Jewish folk and they're, spending their high, holy holidays with, with my friends, Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah and going to the different Yiddish or Jewish events, which was really quite an interesting experience for me culturally.  It was a culture shock really because I mean all I knew was a black, segregated life in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now all of a sudden I'm hanging out with these wonderful people who, who had already been introduced to, to blacks.  And it was no big deal.  So it was a kind of a freedom that, that I felt, release.
Speaker 1: That neighborhood was thoroughly integrated that you were now living--
Speaker 2: Well actually the neighborhood that I lived in was not so--where I went to school, the neigh--the school, the neighborhood--West Philadelphia High [School, Philadelphia Pennsylvania] was integrated.  But no we all lived in our separate parts of the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: West Philadelphia High where I, I mean West Philadelphia where I lived was mainly a, a black area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, so it, you know, but the schools were integrated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we socialized together.  There was no such thing as, I mean you know we had our problems, you know.  But not, not, not any, any big deals.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was just a wonderful experience for me to finally you know, get this other cultural thing going and learning about other people's culture.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I'd learned to speak Yiddish.  I, I--they, they were mostly bad words, but it was fun, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Now I was going, going to ask was there anything that was giving a sort of a rebirth or re-interest in acting?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: There.
Speaker 2: Absolute.  When I, when I was, when I went to West Philadelphia High and signed up to continue my education in Philadelphia, one of the first things I did was I joined the drama club.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean by that time, and I gotta tell you that the fact that I was socializing with white kids of different backgrounds, ethnicities, mainly Irish, Italian and Jewish, and then in the drama clubs, working with not just black kids now, but white kids as well.  There was something, something about my talent that kind of opened up because I was doing this with different, the different ethnicities and different kids from different backgrounds.  And so I joined the drama club and, and whenever there was a play, I was in it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it started at West Philadelphia High.
Speaker 1: And but, but the plays now that you were enjoying had all these other different cultures in it.  And-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) exactly, exactly.  And we were doing plays by great playwrights, you know plays, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: -- we were doing [William] Shakespeare, right.  We were doing [Samuel] Beckett.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were doing--I mean plays by great playwrights.  So we weren't just doing little plays put together by, you know the schoolteachers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154495
Speaker 1: Now the--your drama club teacher, what was her name?  Do you remember it?
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any teachers-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was, she was a redhead.  She was a redhead, I know that.  And she was a redhead.  I thought she, I thought she was giving me the eye at one point.  So I made the dumbest mistake.  She would--when she talked to me, she would kind of look at me, right, you know.  I would think wow, this lady must like me or something.  And I was young and cocky.
Speaker 1: And you still had your curls.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no actually no I didn't.  No, by that time the curls were gone.  The curls were long gone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The curls were gone when I was nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I wrote this teacher a note you know.  And she called me up to the front of the class or call--had me stay after the class.  She said what is this?  I said well you know, I just thought maybe we could go--we could--she said no.  That's not what that--that's, that's not what's happening here.  She says I'm gonna forget that you did this, right.  I was so embarrassed.  I was so embarrassed because I thought I saw something there that maybe perhaps--and I must confess to you at that point in my life, I was, I was into the girls.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154496
Speaker 1: I was really into the girls.  To the point where soon after that, I was going out with a young classmate, gorgeous young girl, and, and you know, we, we, we, we had a child.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: We had a child.
Speaker 2: Now you're fifteen, sixteen.
Speaker 1: Sixteen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Actually before that, before I left Washington, D.C. the very first girlfriend I had, the very first sexual relation I had, intercourse, she became pregnant.  The very first time I--she became pregnant.
Speaker 2: You were loaded.
Speaker 1: Now you know we, we knew nothing about protection and you know I mean--so that's when my first daughter was born.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When I was sixteen years old.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What is, what is that daughter's--
Speaker 1: Cecelia Ann.
Speaker 2: Cecelia Ann, okay.
Speaker 1: And she's now married to an African prince.  She lives in Texas and she has three kids of her own.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and Cecelia and I have been like that since she was born.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: Amazing, amazing young girl.  Her mother's an evangelist who lives in Atlanta [Georgia].  And, and that was my first girlfriend.  Her name was--
Speaker 2: Okay, and she lived in that Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] area.
Speaker 1: She lived on O, as a matter of fact, she lived on O Street.  That alley I told you I'd pulled into when I got busted.  There's an apartment building.  Her father was the janitor of the apartment building on O Street and the alley, right at Twenty-Second Street.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and she was my first girlfriend.  And, and you know the old man threatened my life and, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but we had the child and, and then soon after that I, I moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But we've always been close, through the years we've been very, very close, very close.  And she's just the most incredible young woman, not young anymore.  She's well-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Yeah, right but, no that, that--
Speaker 1: Cecelia.
Speaker 2: Cecelia Ann-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cecelia, yes. And then of course the daughter after that one I moved to Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Phil-right.
Story_ID: 154497
Speaker 1: One of the sad stories of my life is that when Michelle [ph.] was born, there was a young, young wonderful, beautiful young girl that I went out with that I met in West [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], at West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] named Joy Thomas [ph.].  And Joy was a daughter of a doctor, very, very prominent black doctor in Philadelphia, in West Philadelphia.  And didn't particularly like the fact that I was going out with his daughter because, you know, I was still kind of a--had rough edges, you know.  I had not probably gotten too much polish, I still don't.  But anyway, so we, we had a child.  And--
Speaker 2: And her name was Michelle.
Speaker 1: Michelle.
Speaker 2: And one of the most, one of the saddest parts of my life even to this very day, I that I don't know where she is.  I don't know--I saw her when--I couldn't go to see her, I couldn't--the father just didn't, didn't want me to exist.  And so I was walking down the street.  I'd go just purposely walk, hoping that I would see her with the baby.  And one day I did, I saw her.  And I went and she said you shouldn't be here.  I said I just wanted to see my daughter.  And so, so I held her.  And (crying) that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know where she is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you don't know where Michelle is, but you don't know where Joy is either.
Speaker 2: Can't find her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sorry about that.
Speaker 1: Go right ahead.
Speaker 2: I got a chance to see her and that was the last time I saw her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know where she is and I don't know if she's still alive, I don't know--she's probably, you know--
Speaker 1: Do you think she has any idea that you are her father?
Speaker 2: No I think probably what happened, I just, you know I've had a lot of years to think about this.  They never told her, you know and I think Joy married, Joy married a guy and I knew the guy that she married.  And I think they just--he adopted her and she never--the, the baby never knew.  That's really what hurts.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know and you know I'm still just a big softie when it comes to that because I have, you know I have, I have six kids, you know.  You know I have kids, I have grandkids, happy as a father and a grandfather.  But that one, that one part of my life just haunts me.  So anyway.
Speaker 1: And because you, you know, have an international, national, international name, they would, if they wanted to, they, they could find you.
Speaker 2: Sure.  You know and I tried.  I had my ex-wife try to find out where Joy was so I could find out where, you know what--how the child was and how she was doing.  Nobody can find her.  Nobody can find Joy and nobody can, can tell me anything.  So you know I guess that's the way they wanted and that's, you know--and that's, that's the only part of my life that you know--
Speaker 1: Haunts you still, I understand.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so anyway, so there was Michelle and whether she knows it or not, she knows it now if she ever sees this, but she won't, but you know I write about it in my autobiography, I write about it.  So she'll, she'll know.
Speaker 1: She will know.
Speaker 2: She'll eventually know, whether they told her or not, she will know and hopefully it could happen in my lifetime, that would be great--
Story_ID: 154591
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're in Boys High there in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: West Philadelphia High.
Speaker 1: West Philadelphia High [School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And what is some of the outstanding teachers that you remember and who further--
Speaker 2: You know, I can't remember too much about it except that one teacher that kind of called me on the carpet for writing her a note.
Speaker 1: Right.  You never did tell us what that note said, but--
Speaker 2: It's, it's not important.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, you know something about her hair and, and her mouth, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It wasn't, it wasn't what I was supposed to do, she reminded me of that.  She, she threw me a curve, you know.  I thought I was seeing something else.  I mean I'm sure that's happened to many men when they, you know you see a woman and you think that woman is trying to say something to you with her eyes or you know, and you know bottom line is she was just having problems with her eyes that day.  So anyway I can't remember too much about the teachers, except that it was a Mr. Montgomery who was, he was a long, lanky guy.  And, and I think he was English, an English teacher at West Philadelphia High, I'm not sure.  Mrs. Malone I think was the principal.  Yeah, there were, there was some very interesting teachers--the, the physical ed [education] teacher whose name I can't remember.  I'm very bad with names when it comes to that, that part of my life.  But we had a great basketball team-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any of them have a great impact on, on you though?
Speaker 2: Not, not necessarily--
Story_ID: 154592
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean it was the, it wasn't the teachers as much as the, the people, the, the--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --my classmates had a tremendous effect on me.  I mean my love for jazz came out of my years at West Philadelphia High [School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with one of my best friends in high school was named Sam Fann, F-A-N-N.  And Sam Fann was a very sharp, slight, smallish guy, but very handsome, very well dressed, very bohemian in, in his manner.  But he was a jazz fan and he and I used to--I used to go to his place and listen to Thelonious Monk and [Earl Randolph] Bud Powell and, and, and you know, people like that, Miles [Davis] and--
Speaker 2: Lester Young.
Speaker 1: Lester Young and, and [Benjamin Francis "Ben"] Webster, all of the greats, right.  And that's--and, and I thought this music was a part of me.  I mean and I, and I've always felt that way about jazz.  It was something--it's almost like I was there in the Renaissance, I was there when Duke Ellington and those guys were playing in, in those clubs, I was right there.  I mean I always felt that way about that, that period when jazz was being recreated into the bebop era from the big band era when Charlie Parker and guys like that, and then [John] Coltrane and I just felt that I was a musician maybe and, and a singer.  I always wanted to sing.  As a matter of fact I, you know I did a couple of Broadway plays where I sang.  There's an album that I made too.  But so the--so I--Sam Fann and I were very close and we'd go to the different clubs, you know, in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Even as high school students?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Especially with him.  And then there was also Sam Fann, there was a guy named Booker Quattlebaum.  Booker Quattlebaum, Sam Fann, and--
Speaker 2: Could you spell Booker's last name?
Speaker 1: Qauttlebaum, Q-U-A, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Q-U-A-T-T-L-E-B-A-U-M or something like that, Quattlebaum.  Booker Quattlebaum, Sam Fann and I, we hung out together.  And, and also we didn't hang out with him, but in our school, in my graduating class, in my classes, was a fantastic, and now a jazz great,  [HM] McCoy Tyner.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: McCoy Tyner was a classmate of mine over the years.  And well in Philadelphia.  And then over the years with his success, I'd occasionally go to see him when he comes to town.  Not as much as I, I want to.  Whenever he's in town, I'm out of town, but I do catch him occasionally and we kind of rehash the old days.  But he's very successful.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: He played with John Coltrane.  Now he's one of the most successful piano players, and, and arrangers and, and has his own orchestra and so McCoy went to school with us and we were not the closest of friends, not like Sam and Booker.  But, but we, we knew each other in school and then we had no idea that--I remember him playing.  I remember him, you know, playing in school, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I never thought that he would be the great jazz pianist that he turned out to be.  So yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: McCoy Tyner's classmate out of West Philadelphia High.

Speaker 1: Were there any incidents in, in high school [at West Philadelphia High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] that impacted on the career you were eventually to have, that you look back on now that you could say?
Speaker 2: No, not really in high school.  But I do remember as I was working outside of high school and, and I remember going to--I thought Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] would be the school to go to.  I'd heard that they had a great drama school.  So when I graduated, I was--I would do that, except that I didn't.  I was--I found the Bessie V. Hicks School of the Theater [sic, Bessie V. Hicks School of Drama, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was, which was the, the acting school that I ended up going to with the likes of Bruce Dern and--
Speaker 1: Now you say you were one of the founders or you were the founder?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  That was just--
Speaker 1: You found it, okay.
Speaker 2: I found it, I found it as opposed to Temple University.
Speaker 1: Okay, Bessie V. Hicks--
Speaker 2: Bessie V. Hicks School of the Theater.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Was the name of that theater company.  And it was a, it was a fantastic experience in my life.  Only lasted a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Bruce Dern was one of the--
Speaker 2: Bruce Dern was one of the students and, and graduates of it.  And [Charles] Charlie Dierkop who you may not have heard of, but he's also an actor that has gone on to do wonderful things, I see him occasionally.  But it was in that school--this is after I had graduated from high school.  In 1956 I graduated.  And so this would be '57 [1957], '58 [1958], my time at Bessie V. Hicks.
Story_ID: 154594
Speaker 1: And I was also working as a will-call clerk just to make a living, at a clothing store called the Browning King and Company [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And some of the students, not Bruce [Dern] and Charlie [Charles Dierkop], but some of the other people whose names I can't remember, couple of nice young girls who were very talented actresses.  We used to go see the plays that would come through town because Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] was a pre-Broadway tryout town.  So all of the plays that were coming through Chicago [Illinois], Philadelphia, then to Broadway.  So we would see these plays and so we would go and we would second act a lot of the plays.  And if you don't know what second acting means, that's when you can't afford to go buy a ticket to the theater, what you do is at intermission, the people would come out and smoke and talk and then they'd go back in for the second act.  Well we would go back in with them for the second act.  And we would see our plays, right.  Well one--so we saw a lot of plays.  And we did see a lot of plays where we bought tickets as well, but, but we second acted a lot.  I second acted a lot in New York [New York] when I moved to New York too.  But what happened was I saw in the paper that this play was coming to town.  And it was like an all black cast, right.  And I thought wow, that would be something to see.  I've never see anything like that in my life.  I had seen a lot of plays, but no all black cast.  I mean it wasn't thought of.  So I went and I saw this play.  And I sat there in tears because I had--it was so brilliant and so wonderful, and I thought Jesus, I can do this.  You know.  And I, I, I--and it was 'A Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry].  There was Sidney Poitier, Claudia McNeil, Diana Sands, [HM] Ruby Dee, Ivan Dixon, [HM Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.]Lou Gossett, Jr., and Ed Hall and [HM] Douglas Turner Ward and Lonne Elder [III] were in that.  And Lonne Elder was actually in the play, the original.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Doug was Sidney's understudy.  So the two of them were with the play.  Well I sat there and I just didn't believe my eyes, it was so wonderful.  So after the play was over, I write about this in my book, of course.  I write about it because it was the turning point in my life.  I, I stood there under the marquee of the Walnut Street Theater in downtown Philadelphia.  And the people were spilling out into the street after the play.  And I stood there and flashbacked to when I did my first play and how I felt and, and then this experience sitting in that theater watching all these black actors.  There was a lone, white character in the play that comes at the end of the play.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it was an all black play, written by a black woman, directed by a black director.  And acted by these incredible actors, all of whom went off into fame and, and then were very famous too.  So I went backstage and I wanted to go right to Sidney's dressing room 'cause I wanted to just--I was just--didn't believe what I had just seen.  But the line was too long.  I mean people were standing in line.  So I said well I'll go to Claudia McNeil's dressing room, right.  The line was too long.  So now there's this door opened down there, and it was a dressing room, so I just thought I don't know--it's gotta be somebody.  So I went in and it was a, kind of a--it was a dressing room where all of the guys were, you know like Ivan and Lou, Doug, Lonnie, Ed Hall who was understudying--
Speaker 2: Sidney.
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  Doug was understudying Sidney.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ed Hall was understudying Lou and Ivan.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So all of these guys who were in this one room.  So walked in and I say, "hey man, you know, you guys don't know what you did out there; it was incredible.  I'm an actor, I'm an actor here in Philadelphia.  And man I, I, I just was so"--and you know I think there was either Lonne or--I think it was Ed Hall that said to me look, you, you know why don't, why don't you come to New York?  You know, I mean you got the looks, I'm sure you're a good actor.  And those words just rang in my ears, why don't you come to New York?  After seeing 'A Raisin in the Sun,' I decided okay, save up your money and get out of town and go to New York; you can do this.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they encouraged me to do it.  Doug, Lonne, Ed Hall, Lou, Ivan, encouraged me.  Hey come on, man, you know, you can do it, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 154595
Speaker 1: Nothing here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you know.  So six months later I was in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Had my two suitcases, my sister Caroleigh forced her husband to drive me to New York.  He didn't wanna do it.  She said drive him, drive Bobby Dean to New York.  So I don't even think he stopped the car, I think I just jumped out and he went right back down the Lincoln Tunnel.  So there I was standing on thirty--I had booked a room in the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] on 34th Street.
Speaker 2: Thirty-fifth--
Speaker 1: No, on 34th StreetStreet.
Speaker 2: Thirty-fourth, okay.
Speaker 1: Right, Manhattan.
Speaker 2: How much money did you have at that time?
Speaker 1: I had 300, a little over 300 dollars in my pocket.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right, and I had booked the room.  I had booked a room at the Y, right.
Speaker 2: This is 1957.
Speaker 1: No this was, no this was 1959.
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was 1959.  So I'm standing there with these two bags, two suitcases of my worldly possessions, and I'm looking up and I see this Empire State Building.  I mean this goes through the clouds, right.  I've seen pictures of it, but there it is, I'm here, right.  So I go across the street and I check into the Y.  I think it's probably--I don't know if it's still there, but it was Thirty-Fourth and like Tenth or something.  I don't know, Ninth, Tenth.  Check in, so now I'm in New York.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm in New York.  I'm gonna shower and I'm gonna walk down to Birdland because I had been Sam Fann and I had come up to New York and gone to Birdland.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I had been to Birdland, but that's just I was in Birdland, we got in the car and we drove back to Philadelphia.  Now I'm living in New York, I'm here, I got a place right here, I'm living, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I go up and I go into the little room, small little room, one bed and a desk and window, right.  Out, looking out on Thirty-fourth Street.
Speaker 2: Twenty two years old.
Speaker 1: Something like that.
Speaker 2: Ready to face the world.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So now I'm gonna go and I'm gonna shower.  I'm gonna get dressed, I'm gonna walk out to Birdland, walk up Broadway to Fifty-Second Street.  Well that's what you do in New York.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You walk.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I'm rocking, I should be rocking.  Said I wouldn't rock.  I mean I'm rocking in the chair.  So anyway, so I go in the shower.  I go and grab a towel, robe, whatever and I go in the shower.  And I see this guy, big guy, big guy, down at the other end.  I'm a nice person.  I speak to everybody.  So I say hey, how you doing?  You know.  He says hi.  So I'm showering and I'm washing.  All of a sudden, somebody grabs my behind.  Wait a minute, hold it.  This guy gabs my behind.  I go what?  And then he turns--and then he grabs me in the front and he says gimme some of that black meat or something like that.  He used the term black.  I whipped this guy's ass up and down--he was squealing like a pig.  He was a big old gay guy.  I have nothing against gay guys, some of my best friends are gay guys, but at that point I wasn't playing that.  I beat him up against the wall, there was blood all over the place.  Said I was--and I was talking to him while I was beating on him, right.  And he was squealing.  And so somebody came and dragged me off this guy and then the manager came up to my room and I told him what happened.  Well I, I dressed and walked up to Birdland.  And Sonny Rollins was there.  And Sonny Rollins blew me back to black, right.  The next day I got out of that YMCA and I moved to Harlem [New York, New York].  I moved up to 151st and Amster--and St. Nicholas.
Speaker 2: Oh. Okay.
Speaker 1: And got a room up there, and that started my whole New York experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But yeah, that was my first night in New York.
Story_ID: 154596
Speaker 1: Okay now we are at a place where you've just come to New York [New York], staying at the Y [YMCA Young Men's Christian Association] for one evening and then moving up to Sugar Hill.
Speaker 2: Moving up to Sugar Hill, and in Harlem [New York, New York].  And really getting my feet wet in, in learning the whole Harlem-isms.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there are Harlem-isms.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us--
Speaker 2: Well one time I was walking down Lenox Avenue and around 126th, twenty-sevneth Street, walking down, just walking, you know, getting the flavor, which is what I did every day.  And this guy came over to me, he says Hey brother.  He says you wanna make some money?  Well my money was running out, probably had run out by now.  And I'm from the streets, you know I figure okay, what's the deal here?  He says--I says yeah, you know, what you talking about?  He says well there's this guy, this guy across the street and the three for one, and he just got off the boat from Africa and he's got a wad of money in his pocket and you know, he's over there drinking.  And he wants to go out and get some girls, you know.  And I thought you know, you know you and I could--I said okay.  So we go over and we go on--go into the bar and there's this blues is playing, Muddy Waters or something.  This really great blues place.  And this guy was sitting at the thing and we started talking to this guy.  He had just worked at some rubber, some rubber plantation in Africa or something.  This is his story.  And so I said well yeah, you know I'm, I wanna get laid too, you know.  So, so we walk around to where this guy says this, these women are, these two incredible women.  You won't believe this.  I don't wanna get into the--on, on, on this video, the dialogue.  But this guy wanted to get laid, right.  And I said well I wanna get laid too.  So we go around to this place and the guy says look, you can't take that money up there.  You can't take the money.  He says, he says well you know--he said look, and he asked me if I had some money, and I had some money.  I didn't know how much it was, might have been thirty-five, forty dollars or something.  He says--no actually it was seventy dollars, I remember.
Speaker 1: That you had.
Speaker 2: That I had in my pocket.  So now he says look, I, I'll, you know, he'll put his money in here and you put your money in here.  I'll take you up, take the guy upstairs to this girl, right.  So I gave him my money and he put it in the bag, and the guy put his money in the bag.  And then he went over, and as he was going over, he says I'm gonna put it in the can, or the trash can right there, right.  So I'm watching the guy and he go, takes him over there and I'm thinking well we gonna--you know, 'cause this guy had a big wad of money.  So they go in the building and I'm standing there and I'm waiting, waiting.  And the guy--I'm thinking now he put it in this can and there's a basement thing.  He could very well come and take the money without me seeing him.  So I went across the street--I got--finally a, a light went on.  These guys are trying to take me to the cleaners, right.  I'm gonna take them to the cleaners.  So I went and I got the money out as--took off down the street and opened the bag, and of course it was all--the guy had like a ten dollar bill and the rest was play money.  And my money was in there.  So I thought okay, a little Murphy game they were trying to play on me.  I went back to the bar and the guys were there.  And I walked--I said pretty good, pretty good, pretty good.  And I gave him his play money back in the bag.  He said where's my, my ten dollars?  I said no, no, no, that's mine now, that's mine.  That was one of the Harlem Murphy games that I learned real quick.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And there were other things that happened.  But I, I remember that was the christening factor of my being in Harlem and understanding a little bit.  But I would meet a lot of people in Harlem that knew--that older guys, older people.  Because I was--I had always been fascinated by Harlem Renaissance, always.  And people that lived through the Harlem Renaissance.  And I would go and I'd sit on the stoop and talk to an old guy on the, on 137th Street, on St. Nicholas Avenue where I was living, 151st and St. Nicholas where I had my room.  The people would be just sitting in the streets.  And I just--I mean a wealth of knowledge about things that concerned me, that cultural period in Harlem, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then of course later on I met Langston [Hughes]-
Story_ID: 154597
Speaker 1: Now were you also trying to find work as an actor during that period?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh no, I was.  But I was working during that period too.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: I had gotten a job by that time.  I had gotten a job by the time I had that experience with the guy on the street, I was working at Grayson Robinson, which was a sweater factory in Manhattan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Down--Fifty--in the fifties around Tenth Avenue.  Factory, sweater factory, ladies sweaters.  And that's where I got my first political christening.  Where I really got into poli--the politics of the United States and around the world, Cuba.  So, so, so yes I was working at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Working at night, on the night shift at Grayson Robinson's and I.B.M. [International Business Machines].  'Cause I had worked a little bit at I.B.M. at the Insurance Company of North America when I was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, before I went to Grayson Robin--I mean before I went to Browning King, the clothing company.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Where I was a will-call clerk.  But I had also worked at the Insurance Company of North America and I.B.M., programming I.B.M. machines, right.  So that's what I was doing at Grayson Robinson while I was pounding the pavements trying to get a job as an actor in New York.  And also going to several acting schools in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One was Roberta Bailey's--I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I was asking 'cause I don't want you to forget about the--that political experience either.  Want you to tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: But go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, I was, I was working at Grayson Robinson at night and I was trying to find work as an actor during the day, which was a great setup for me because I had a chance to just audition during the day, pound the pavements during the day and then work at night.  And at Grayson Robinson there was a whole political--the, the, the, the people were working, it was a sweat shop.  I said a sweater shop, it was a sweater shop, but it was also a sweat shop, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 154598
Speaker 1: People that were working there were not being paid the right--they were being treated wrong.  But there was a woman, a little Japanese woman that would be the vocal force trying to get the management to do right by these people.  And her name was Yuri Kochiyama, well then, then I knew her as Mary Kochiyama.  I found out later her real name is Yuri Kochiyama.  If you look up Yuri Kochiyama's name, she is--she was there and it was an Asian woman when Malcolm X was shot, there was an Asian woman that was holding him.  She was a very good friend of Malcolm's.  She was into all kinds of political things, and, and so I met Mary at the time, who worked at Grayson Robinson with me.  And on Friday and Saturday Mary would have in her apartment up in Harlem [New York, New York], she lived in Harlem with her husband Bill [Kochiyama] and their kids, they had maybe five kids, wonderful little kids.  The kids are still around.  I don't know, I think Bill died, I think Mary's still around.  But anyway, so Fridays and--Friday--during, over the weekend, we would have political little, you know I'd go to her--we'd go to her place.  There were several of us.  And we would talk about civil rights movement, we'd talk about the things that were happening at the company, things that were happening in the city and the things that were happening nationally with the--it was really wonderful for me because I hadn't been introduced to that.  So we would have our little confabs, you know we would talk about what was going on and I would learn a lot.  And she would always have guest people come in.  One Friday night we're sitting there and in walks Malcolm X, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Who at the time was just beginning to do his thing.  He was on the street corners doing his thing.  So Malcolm--I'm sitting there as close as I am to you, talking with Malcolm X.  And now I mean not really knowing at that time what an incredible human being this, this man was and how dedicated he was.  But what he was saying, the kinds of things he was saying about us as black people in a country like America.  So there I was sitting, talking with Malcolm X.  All because I befriended Mary Kochiyama.  And so I met Malcolm, got to know Malcolm.  Whenever Malcolm was on the street corner talk--I was out there listening to Malcolm, right.  And one day--so anyway that's, that, that got me into my political thing with Mary Kochiyama.
Speaker 2: It's fair to say you became some, somewhat of a disciple?
Speaker 1: I--not necessarily a disciple.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not necessarily disciple.  I would--I believed in him.  And I would go and I would--he was just so wonderful to listen to.  The things he was saying, I knew most of the things he was saying.  Some of the things I didn't quite understand because I wasn't as worldly as, as you know I should have been at that period.  But I was, I was taken by this guy.  He was really quite, quite wonderful and I liked him, right.
Speaker 2: This was an awakening period for, for you.
Speaker 1: Very, very much so, politically.
Speaker 2: And we are--are we still in '59 [1959] or early '60 [1960]?
Speaker 1: No, now we're in, we're in '60 [1960].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We're in 1960.
Speaker 2: Okay, we're going--
Speaker 1: I'm about to do something now that would change my life forever.
Story_ID: 154254
Speaker 1: Okay here we are, you're living in, in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Working at night, auditioning during the day.
Speaker 2: Right, I'm, I'm walking down, down--I'm in Manhattan [New York, New York] 'cause that's where all the action is.  And I'm walking down Forty-Seventh Street.  And I run into Ed Hall who is now 'Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] is a big hit on Broadway, big hit.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The biggest hit ever for a black play.  But it's a big hit and I had gone to see the play several times since I was--I had second acted it several times and I also had seen it throughout several times because Ed Hall, Lonne Elder [III], [HM] Douglas Turner Ward, all those people I met in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] of course I had re-met since the play was a big hit.  And so Doug and Lonne and I became very close friends.  So now Doug and Lonne and I are friends, but I'm not in the play or anything.  I'm just hanging out with them.  So I'm walking down Forty-Seventh Street and I run into Ed Hall.  Ed Hall says Lou Gossett [HM Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] is leaving the show, going out to Hollywood [California] to do the movie.  And they're auditioning for his replacement.  And get on over to Phil Rose's office you know, and, and, and audition.  So I know Phil Rose's office is on Fifty-Seventh Street and I'm on Forty-Seventh Street.  And I say okay fine.  So I start walking up Broadway and I realize somebody's gone beat me to the office if I don't get--so I start running up Broadway.  Now people seeing this black guy running up Broadway, they think what's going on?
Speaker 1: He stole something.
Speaker 2: They thought I stole something, and I'm running from the cops or something.  But I'm running up to Fifty-Seventh Street.  So I run to Fifty-Seventh Street, I know where Phil's office is.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I get on the elevator and there's this little guy coming off the elevator and I almost knock this guy down.  And I apologize to him and I say I'm, I'm looking for Phil Rose's office.  He says it's right over there.  So I go in the door, he comes in behind me, it's Phil Rose.  Now I hadn't met him personally, I didn't know even what he looked like.  But I knew that that was where the office was 'cause I was told, right.  So I come into the office and, and it's him.  So I say my God, I'm so embarrassed, I'm sorry.  But I, I'm, you know I'm Robert Hooks, or Bobby Dean Hooks at the time.  I'm Bobby Dean Hooks and, and I saw the play in Philadelphia and I, I was even prompted to come to Philadelphia because I talked to Doug, I started running down them, and I met Doug and I know Doug and Lonne and Ivan.  He says well you know, the script, get the script and whatever.  So I audition for him.  And he got on the phone and he called the theater.  And he said to the, to the stage manager, whoever, he asked if Lloyd was there.  And Lloyd was at the theater.  So he got Lloyd on the phone and he says I'm sending over a guy, Bobby Dean Hooks, right.  So I go over to the theater and I audition for Lloyd Richards, and I get the role.  I replace Lou Gossett in 'A Raisin in the Sun.' The play that prompted me to move to New York [New York] in the first place.  My first Broadway play is that play.
Story_ID: 154255
Speaker 1: Not off Broadway, it's on Broadway.
Speaker 2: On Broadway.  Now I start rehearsals with the understudy, Ja'net Dubois, or Jene-- Janet Dubois at the time.  Ja'net Dubois, Frances Williams, the great old actress who was Claudia McNeil's understudy.  Ja'net was understudying Ruby and Diana Sands.  Frances Williams was understudying Claudia McNeil, and Ed Hall was understudying the other two guys.  And Ed was I guess just happy being an understudy 'cause he should have taken over that role when Lou [HM Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.]  left.  I don't know why, but I was happy that he didn't.  So now all of a sudden I look in the case in front of the Booth Theater on Forty-Seventh Street, 'A Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] starring Claudia McNeil, 'cause Sidney [Poitier] had gone.  And [HM] Ossie Davis was playing the role that Sidney played.  So now here I am up there with Claudia McNeil, Ossie Davis, [HM] Ruby Dee, Diana Sands, Ivan Dixon.  Ivan had gone, so I guess Ed was in the show.  Ed had taken over Ivan's role.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so there I am, Bobby Dean Hooks on the card at the Booth Theater.  I'm in heaven, I'm in heaven.  That was my first Broadway play and now I'm on Broadway and now I'm in the mix.  Now [James] Jimmy Baldwin throws a party for Diana Sands who's going with a friend of Jimmy's [James Baldwin] and the play is a big hit.  Lorraine Hansberry comes to the rehearsal and we get to talk and she--I get to talk to her about this character that I'm playing that she created.  And so now I'm in the mix with Lorraine Hansberry.  And then Jimmy Baldwin, I'm over at Jimmy's house for a party and for dinner.  And Jimmy Baldwin and I become good buddies.  It's just I'm in heaven, I'm in absolute heaven.  And the play is selling to sell-out--is playing to sell-out audiences, standing room only.  And we're actually you know, it's--the play is only gonna be on Broadway for another five or six months.  Then it's gonna be over.  But we're still playing to, to standing room only houses; amazing.  Now I'm on--I'm in the play and I'm playing every night on Broadway.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154256
Speaker 1: Are you still working at night?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  The jobs are over now.  I'm still involved with Mary Kochiyama, with Yuri Kochiyama, however.  Because now not only am a I successful actor, having now being in my first Broadway play.  But now I'm, I'm, I'm concerned about what's happening in the Civil Rights Movement.  I'm concerned about what's happening in the country overall, in the White House and the government, in the state house.  I'm just into politics.  I mean it's amazing.  Now I got not only--and that being helped by my two buddies who are [HM] Douglas Turner Ward and Lonne Elder [III], socialists.  In a sense Communist sympathizers.  So I'm learning the ropes.  Never became a Communist, but certainly was a Communist sympathizer because a lot of the things espoused by the American Communist Movement were things that I believed in, you know.  Never could and wanted to be a card holder, but listening to Paul Robeson, having gone to concerns with Paul with Lonne and Doug, I missed the New York riot [sic, Peekskill Riot, Peekskill, New York, 1949] that was happening, that Doug and Lonne went to with Paul when Paul came back.  And, and there was a big riot up in New York.  I can't remember the part of New York it was.  But anyway, so I'm in the mix now.  I'm an actor on Broadway and I'm into politics.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154257
Speaker 1: I'm in--I mean it was just a--you couldn't ask for anything more exciting in my life.  In the meantime, I have kids to deal with, right.  I have a daughter Cecelia by this time, Kevin [Hooks] is born.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my wife who never moved from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], was still in Philadelphia.  My wife Yvonne.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Was still in Philadelphia and Kevin was born.  So I got a, I got a family in Philadelphia and I'm doing the New York [New York] thing on Broadway.  Unfortunately, Yvonne my first wife, wouldn't move to New York because she just didn't think that theater acting was a profession.  It was like something you just did, get a real job.  Well it was a real job.  She didn't understand it, but it was a real job.  And it was what I wanted to do.  It was what I wanted to do with my life.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's what I did with my life.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I would spend time going back to Philadelphia to see Kevin.  Kevin would be--would come up on the weekends sometimes and spend the weekend with me.  She'd put him on the Greyhound bus in Philadelphia and send him to New York.  I'd put him back on the Greyhound bus and send him back to Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: And when was Kevin born?
Speaker 1: Kevin was born in 1958.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So he was a youngster by then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kevin was a little guy.  And he was just a wonderful little guy too.
Speaker 2: Okay we had, we had skipped over that part, that--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You, you married Yvonne.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What year was, was that?
Speaker 1: Well it gets a little murky.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It gets a little murky.  Kevin was born in 1958.  Yvonne and I did not get married until 1961, I was on the road with 'A Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry]
Speaker 2: And you were in New York, okay.
Speaker 1: I was in New York.  And when I went on the road with 'A Raisin in the Sun,' we played Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 2: The first, one of the first cities we played when we went on the road with 'A Raisin in the Sun' after we closed on Broadway, was Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was in Baltimore that Yvonne and I got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't have a suit, I had borrowed [HM] Douglas Turner Ward's suit to get married in.  So Yvonne and I got married and, and she actually spent the next few weeks on the road with us.  That was fun.
Speaker 1: I'm sure.
Speaker 2: That was fun.  She and Claudia McNeil had a few clashes.  Claudia McNeil was not the nicest person in the world, God rest her soul.  She was a beautiful actress, but she was not the nicest person in the world with the other actors that she worked with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and other people that those actors that she worked with knew, you know, like my wife.  But my wife is a hardnosed lady from Philadelphia and she didn't care whether Claudia McNeil was a big Broadway star.  And Claudia McNeil was used to being treated like a big Broadway star.  And Yvonne didn't care about that.  So she and Claudia McNeil did not get along.
Speaker 1: Now, now did she bring Kevin along?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were--when we, after we married, you know we, we toured the--well she was on the road with us for a few weeks with, with Kevin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then soon after that, we had Eric.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1963 Eric was born.  But that's how that worked.  And you know these are the kinds of things that I don't necessarily like to, to talk about and, but since this is The HistoryMakers, it's not gonna be broadcast.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Till later or it's gonna go in the archives.  But personally I don't particularly like to tell that story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because it's--I don't even think it's something that Kevin even knows, so you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I have to tell it because we're--
Speaker 1: It, it goes into a context, but as--it's not for public consumption.
Speaker 2: And eventually he'll find that out because it's in the book so you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right. Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's why I was reluctant to even, you know--but we, we, we can talk about anything you wanna talk about.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: That I can remember--
Story_ID: 154258
Speaker 1: You, you're going on the road.
Speaker 2: Right, we're on the road [as a member of the cast of 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry].
Speaker 1: Yvonne, Yvonne is with you.
Speaker 2: Only for a few weeks and then she goes back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Then she goes back to Phila--Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: And I'm on the road, we're on the road for a whole year and that was an eye opening experience for me.  Traveling around the country for the first time, I had never been anywhere.  I mean I was in Philadelphia, Washington [D.C], then Philadelphia, and then New York [New York].  But traveling around the sho--around the country in a, a hit play.  When you go into each city, the city is welcoming you with open arms.  The black community is throwing parties and giving awards and I mean it's just--it was a wonderful experience.  And you know--
Speaker 1: And [HM] Douglas Turner Ward is now in the--
Speaker 2: Douglas is now in, in the play.  Well of course he was always in the play.  But Douglas, no, Douglas was still understudying.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [HM] Ossie Davis started, but Ossie couldn't go on the road.  So they cast an actor, brilliant actor named--jeez I just drew a blank, Smith, Smith.  Elwood, Elwood Smith.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What a brilliant actor, but he had an alcohol problem.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But he was the--in my mind, he was one of the most incredible Walter Lees ever.  So--and Doug, but Doug still would understudy him.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And because he had an alcohol problem in one of the cities on--early cities on the tour, he just burned out and could not do it anymore, and then Doug took over the role.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of Walter Lee [Younger].  And from that point on, played Walter Lee and was just brilliant in the role.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I was getting Elwood Smith I think mixed up with Ed Hall.  Okay now, now, now we got it straightened out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, Elwood Smith, yeah--
Story_ID: 154259
Speaker 1: The, the way--one, one little incident happened on the road with El-Elwood [Smith] and I were very good buddies.  I knew he had an alcohol problem.  He drank vodka like crazy.  But he could go on stage drunk and, and you'd--I mean it was brilliant.  You, you'd never know the guy had that to drink, right.  One day Jimmy Wall who was the, Jimmy Wall was the Stage Manager for 'A Raisin the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] on the road.  And Jimmy came to me 'cause he knew that Elwood and I were buddies.  And he said, "Elwood, you know he's, he's up in his room in the hotel and he's just drinking.  And could you go up and talk to him?"  So I said, "yeah, I'll go up and talk" 'cause he's a--he had a show to do, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this was like dinner time, six o'clock, it was an eight o'clock curtain, eight o'clock, half hour, eight thirty curtain.  So I go up to the hotel, I take Lonne [Elder III] and Doug [HM Douglas Turner Ward] with me.  I said you guys gotta come up and we gotta get this guy ready to go on stage, right.  So we go up there and he's drinking a bottle, he's got a bottle and he's, he's-"who is it?"  I says, "it's Robert."  "What do you want?"  I said, "Elwood, just let me in, okay?"  So he opens the door and he--there I am, but I, I got Lonne and Doug with me.  "What the hell y'all want?  Leave me alone."  I said, "Elwood come on, get out here, you gotta show to do.  You know, we got a show to do so you know, yeah give me a drink."  So I thought if we drink this stuff, he can't drink it, right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So I drink, take a shot of this vodka and I pour a little more and I tell Doug, he takes a shot, and Lonne, he takes a shot.  So we're gonna drink all this guy's booze up so he won't--
Speaker 2: So he can't drink it.
Speaker 1: So he can't drink it and you know, he'll then he'll be ready to come to work.  Now the bottle is gone, the three of us are lit, right, and Elwood's sitting there looking at us.  So I said well look, you know, you know we'll see you at the theater.  And he just kind of shook his head, right.  I thought okay, now we got this guy, now we're drunk.  But we don't have to worry too much.  You know, Doug doesn't have to go on at all, he's an understudy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Lonne's got two little scenes, we can do those scenes with a little booze, you know.  So we get to the theater and half hour comes, no Elwood.  Fifteen minutes comes, no Elwood.  Five minutes, no Elwood, said what's going on?  Where the hell is Elwood?  Elwood is--doesn't make it.  Now Doug is drunk, but he's gotta go on in the lead role.  So Lonne and I are cracking up because now Doug has got to go on.  Elwood, we don't know where Elwood is.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So we--in this theater we would go up into the flies and look down on the stage.  We could see the performance from up there, the scaffold and the flies, whatever they call 'em.  So we were watching Doug stumble through this play.  At one point he's dancing around and he gets a record.  He's supposed to get the record, take it out of the jacket and put it on--78.  He takes the record, he's so nervous and he's so drunk, he puts the record on, he puts the record on, it's still in the jacket.  You know the jackets that the record go in.  And the record, you know the jack--not a folding jacket, but a jacket that's got a hole in it.  So he puts the whole thing on.  Well he's stumbling around and we're cracking up, up there.  We go on, we barely get through our performance 'cause we've been, you know, drinking too.  So anyway, it was the funniest night, one of the funniest nights.  Now after the show, I go to the hotel and I'm concerned about Elwood.  I go upstairs, knock on Elwood's door in the, in the hotel, he comes to the door and he is blind drunk.  He says, "You guys, you think you're smart, don't you?"  He said, "I had another bottle under the bed.  You think you so smart."  I said, "Elwood, what did you do, man?"  I said, "What are you doing?"  Anyway, bottom line, he had to--they had to replace him.  He died a few months after that, of alcohol.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But anyway, that was one of the funny stories about Doug.  And then from that point on, Doug was playing the role, sober.
Story_ID: 154260
Speaker 1: Being on the road is not easy.  But perhaps for first timer, it, it's, it's a little bit different.  Did you have any personal problems there traveling and you know, your part says you moved around for a whole year in, in your role.
Speaker 2: I didn't have any trouble with the play ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] itself, except for my occasional run-ins with Claudia McNeil.  But after a while that cooled out and you know, we had a couple of horror stories with Claudia and the play.  But for the most part--
Speaker 1: Would you care to, you know, relate them, or one?
Speaker 2: Well there was one, there was on instance where--this was even before we went on the road.  This is what really kind of got the Claudia McNeil and, and, and my thing going.  I was going on for the first time and I had not auditioned, I mean I had not rehearsed with the main cast.  I had been rehearsing with understudies, which is what you did.  And then you just went on and you play with the main players without necessarily having rehearsed with them.  So I had met everybody, know, knew everybody in the play, this is when I first joined the play after I got the play.  And I knew Doug [HM Douglas Turner Ward] and Lonne [Elder III] and I knew, actually knew most of the people, but I hadn't met Claudia.  So Claudia's sitting off in the wings, this is right before the show.  So I went to her dressing room, she wasn't there and then somebody said she was in--and I saw her sitting over on the stool, right.  She was a big woman sitting on the stool.  So I walked over to her and I said excuse me Ms. McNeil, my name is Bobby Dean Hooks and I'm, you know I'm the new member of the cast.  She kept her eyes closed, didn't say a word.  I didn't quite understand what was happening.  So she didn't say anything to me and I just, you know, okay fine.  I introduced myself and I just walked away.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I go to my dressing room and the play's about to start and Jimmy Wall comes in the door, he said what did you do?  What, what are you doing?  He says you can't do that.  You can't--he says Claudia McNeil said that you came up to her and you swaggered up to her and you said I'm Bobby Dean Hooks and who are you?  And this kind of--I said what?  I said I wouldn't do that, I said that's crazy.  I said I, I went up to her and--he says yeah and she was preparing to go on stage.  And, and she says you interrupted her and you swaggered and you were--I said well she had her eyes closed, how does she know I was swaggering?  'Cause he said you know she was meditating, whatever.  And I said I didn't do that.  I said that's not what I did at all, right.  He says well you owe her an apology, you gotta go to her dressing room before the show and apologize to her.  I said Jimmy, I did not do that and I am not going to apologize.  I'm just getting in the show, I just got in the show.  I could have gotten fired, right.  But I just couldn't do it.  I knew she lied on me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She told him that I did something that I did not do.  I said I didn't do that, I would never do that.  I respect this woman too much to do that.  She didn't say anything to me, so I just walked away.  Well anyway from that point on, and I didn't apologize to her.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And from that point on she would--just made life miserable for me.  But she made life miserable for a, for a lot of people.  But eventually you know, we kind of ironed things out.  We were on the road for a whole year.  So when we went on the road, there was a little incident on the road where Yvonne was with us and we were on the train.  And Yvonne was walking down--coming back, she was with Frances Foster and Diane, Diana Sands.  And she was--had left their berth and she was coming through and Claudia was in the aisle and Claudia was waiting for her to move and she was waiting for Claudia to move.  And so they were standing there.  So Claudia said something to her and Yvonne just said something to her back.  And she felt insulted and so she went to Jimmy again and she says you tell him to tell his wife and that kind of stuff.  So it was, it was kind of touch and go on the ugly side for a while.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And then it kind of smoothed out and Claudia and I became, you know, you know at least I thought friends, you know.
Story_ID: 154261
Speaker 1: So we did that whole year [touring with 'A Raisin in the Sun'] and you know the road was, was very good for me.  You know I must confess that, that it was challenging being in those cities with all those young girls coming back stage after the show, wanting to go out and you know, and we went out with 'em and wanting to do a lot of things that I guess, you know, it wasn't the right thing for a newly married man to do, but I was newly married and had--
Speaker 2: And young.
Speaker 1: And young and very, very feisty.  I had a thing for the girls.  I must confess that was one of my weaknesses coming up.  And now I can say it.  It was a weakness and they were, they were all over the place.  They were all over the place.  You know what we would do?  Doug [HM Douglas Turner Ward] and Lonne [Elder III] and I when we went to town, went to these different cities, all major cities across the country.  We would go to the black community and find the popular bars in the black community.  And of course everybody knew we were in town because it was 'A Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] and you know we were the actors in 'A Raisin in the Sun.'  And so that's where we would go, we would go to the popular bars in town and we were famous for just finding where the action was.  And it was a lot of fun.  It was a lot of fun and an education for me finding out what the black communities were all about across the country.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't mean the women, but just me, just getting to--because I, I never could shake, and I'm glad I never could, and I never have, shake the fact that I'm from the community, I'm from the streets and, and I know how to deal with, with it because I'm from it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I always was proud to be from it.  And even though I pulled myself up out of the ghetto and I, you know, went on to do wonderful and great things and important things because I know I have.  I still am the same Bobby Dean, you know, except I know people a little better.  I like people, I think it helps me as a human being.  It certainly has helped me as an actor.  I'm kind to people and I know people and I understand.  I like 'em.  So I'm a people person.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it has helped me in my life, in all aspects of my life.
Story_ID: 154262
Speaker 1: So at the end of a year, you return to New York [New York].  What, what, what year are we talking about, what month?
Speaker 2: We're talking about nine--we're talking about the end of 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, returned to New York from the road.  We save a little money, but we didn't save a lot of money.  Doug [HM Douglas Turner Ward] saved a lot of money, Lonne [Elder III] and I didn't.  Doug already had an apartment uptown in New York that he kept.  So we would hang out with Doug and Lonne and I were basically--we had spent our money and I had sent a lot of money back home and so we were still not, you know even though we did a year on the road, we didn't make a whole lot of money.  And so we were always uptight.  So together we would you know, find places to--we would hang out at Doug's.  At one point we, we, we didn't have--neither one of us had a place to live.  So Chuck Gordon was an actor, wonderful actor and a crazy man but a wonderful actor and a nice guy, invited Lonne and I to come live with--in his basement.  And Lonne and I would share the couch and a chair.  One night I'd sleep on the couch and one night Lonne would sleep on the couch and I'd sleep in the chair and so we--and eventually what happened was I, I--Billy Dee Williams was starring in a play on Broadway, a new play that was also a hit play.  It was called 'A Taste of Honey' [Shelagh Delaney]. And Billy was leaving the show to do some, to do a film.  And I auditioned for the role.  And this is in--not, not, not--I would think maybe six months after 'Raisin' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] had closed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I got the role of 'A Taste of Honey.'  I finished that play on Broadway and I guess--
Speaker 1: How long did it run?
Speaker 2: I think it ran for another six months on Broadway.  And then after it closed, it toured, the same itinerary that I had played with 'A Raisin in the Sun.'  It toured for I think maybe ten months or something like that.  So I was going back to the same towns that I had gone with 'A Raisin in the Sun.'
Story_ID: 154263
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: [HM] Denise Nicholas, [HM] Janet [Angel] MacLachlan, Brock Peters, [HM] Charles Floyd Johnson, Tracy Lyles and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's poetry, all the great poetry from you know, Langston [Hughes] and Sterling Brown.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Voices of Our People.'  And it is--and Charles [F. Johnson] sent a copy.  I had never had a copy of it.  We did it back in, I don't know--
Speaker 1: I think I remember Tracy talking to me at the time.
Speaker 2: And as a matter of fact that picture on the wall there is a picture of all of us together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Charles sent me the video of it, and I hadn't even seen the thing.  I mean when we did it, we did it and it was on, but I never saw it 'cause I don't like watching myself.  It's wonderful.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have to call Charles and see if I can get a copy.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna give you a copy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because Laurie made some V.H.Ss [Video Home System] for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'm gonna give you a copy just so you can have it.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: It's wonderful.  And the poetry in it--and everybody was right on it.  Everybody was right on it.  It was just wonderful, just wonderful, 'Voices of Our People.'
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: And we won the, the Emmy, Emmy for, for it--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --several Emmys that year for it.
Speaker 1: Boy, yeah, I wan--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I'll give you a copy, 'cause you should have it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I appreciate that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you should have it.
Speaker 1: I really appreciate it.
Story_ID: 154264
Speaker 1: You are in New York [New York].  Billy Dee Williams has just decided to leave 'A Taste of Honey' [Shelagh Delaney], which is a play on Broadway, and you've gone over to apply for the job.  And you are hired for that job.  And you spend six months on Broadway.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then you go on the road for about ten months.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's, let's talk about what it was like on the road for that second time because you had also been on the road for 'Raisin' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry].
Speaker 2: I had come off, just come off the road for a year's tour with 'A Raisin in the Sun.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Which I did on Broadway.  I took over from Lou Gossett [HM Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] on Broadway and we toured the country with 'A Raisin in the Sun.'  Wonderful tour.  Came back to New [York, New York] and it just so happens that Billy Dee-'A Taste of Honey' was a big hit on Broadway and Billy Dee Williams was starring in the play and he was leaving the play.  And I went down for the role and I got the role.  And so I closed it on Broadway after six months, and we toured the road, toured on the road.  And it was really the exact same itinerary that I had just come off of with 'A Raisin in the Sun.'  So I knew a lot of people in the different cities that we went to, including Washington, D.C., which of course is my hometown.  And it was--this was my second Broadway play.  And it was amazing, the people that would come down to the National Theater to see 'A Taste of Honey' and see Bobby Dean Hooks in 'A Taste of Honey.'  Hadn't changed my name, it was still Bobby Dean Hooks.  And my old schoolmates, my old schoolteachers, everybody was so proud, my family, to see that I wasn't kidding when I said I wanted to be an actor and I was going to be successful at it.
Speaker 1: Let's, let's establish a timeline for this.  What year was that?
Speaker 2: This would have been 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-one (1961), thereabouts.  And it was--it, it was just an amazing time because I really had not been in New York that long, and I was in my second Broadway play.  So I was very fortunate because there were actors in New York, you know, especially the, the African American actors, that had never been on Broadway and had been--their chops were certainly longer and better than mine.  I was a certain type, and I had, you know I was, I suited a lot of the young leading man kind of thing, so I was very fortunate early on.  So we toured with 'A Raisin in the Sun' and it was, it was just a fascinating experience being, being in those same cities with another play--
Story_ID: 154265
Speaker 1: Some of the people that were in 'A Taste of Honey' [Shelagh Delaney] with you, do you remember some of the names?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As a matter of fact, well Shelagh Delaney wrote the play.  She would be there in New York occasionally.  But Frances Cuka who was a wonderful actress.  Not big, a big name in America, but in England she did a lot of stage.  Hermione Baddeley was a fabulous older actress who played the mother.  So Frances Cuka played the love interest, my love interest, and Hermione Baddeley played the mother, and Roy Shuman, who was also--he's gone now, but a wonderful American actor, played one of the roles in it.  And who else was in that play?  Well it was a small cast, first of all.  But Russ Yuman, Frances Cuka, and, and Hermione Baddeley were the actors, a small cast.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But a wonderful play.  A classic song came out of it too, that I sang.  I sang in the production, in the play itself when I, before I make my entrance, I sing this song offstage.
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: It was, it was, it was a wonderful song, goes something like "Cold winds may blow, o're the icy sea.  I'll take with me my love for thee a taste of honey, a taste much sweeter than win."(singing)  That was--and then I think one of the top singers recorded it, and jazz, jazz musicians have done renditions of it.
Speaker 1: It's a legendary song.
Speaker 2: Right, so that as the first time I got to sing on Broadway.
Speaker 1: Right, and I think a lot of people were surprised that you were such a good singer.
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right.  A lot of it was offstage, however, but still it was my voice.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But yeah, it was a, a great experience for me.  And then I came back to New York after we closed on the road, and I was right back in another show and right back in another show.  And I just kept doing show after show.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 154266
Speaker 1: Let's not skip over 'em.  So when you came back.
Speaker 2: I came back to New York [New York] and joined a, a-- 'The Blacks' ['The Blacks: A Clown Show,' Jean Genet] which was a big hit off-Broadway, big hit.  One of the biggest hits in the history of off-Broadway.  And, it was a Jean Genet play that was-[HM] Roscoe Lee Brown, Lou, Lou Gossett [HM Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.].  I replaced Lou in that one as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But [HM] Maya Angelou, Cicely Tyson, Lex Monson, Char--Chuck Gordon, just a, just an array of wonderful actors in 'The Blacks.'  So I joined 'The Blacks,' did 'The Blacks' for a while, and that was probably--if I had to say it, it probably before I did 'Dutchman,' [Amiri Baraka] was my best work on stage as Village in 'The Blacks.'  Then I went on, and then I was cast in--I don't know, chronology gets a little mixed up, but we can straighten that out.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I'll just run down the list of the plays.  I then left 'The Blacks.'  'The Blacks' was a play that most of the actors worked in, and you would work in the play and then you'd get another job, you'd go do the other job.  And then when that was over, you'd come back to 'The Blacks.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause 'The Blacks' ran for four years off-Broadway.  So then, then there was--let me see, 'The Blacks,' 'Dutchman,' LeRoi Jones's [Amiri Baraka] classic play that I originated off-Broadway.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it was, that was probably my best work.
Story_ID: 154267
Speaker 1: Let's tell the audience a little bit about 'The Blacks' ['The Blacks: A Clown Show,' Jean Genet].
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Younger people--
Speaker 2: Right.  'The Blacks' was a, was a play that--it was about colonialism.  It was written by a, a Frenchman named Jean Genet, classic playwright in France.  Wrote a play about Colonialism, and it was about a group of black performers re-enacting the murder of a white woman.  And in the cast, the cast was in two parts.  The white court, which was [HM] Maya Angelou and, and Ethel Ayler and Chuck Gordon and Lex Monson and, and J. Riley, J. J. Riley and several other people in the--wearing white masks in the court, pretending to be the court.  And then on this--down on--this is up on the ramp, up on the platform.  Down the ramp on the floor of the theater was the black company re-enacting the murder of this black woman.  And it was anti-Colonialist, an anti-Colonialist piece that was very controversial at the time.  The playwright was very controversial.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was a very, you know, outspoken, gay, extremely gay playwright.  And so there was a big controversy about this gay, white Frenchman writing this classic play with all black performers, half of the cast playing white characters in these masks that were done in all kinds of different designs, it's just fabulous.  And the white queen was Maya Angelou.  And just a classic--and that was the play that most of the actors would come through and go off and do a movie, go off and do whatever, and come back to 'The Blacks.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154268
Speaker 1: So I got a chance to, to, to come, come back three or four times in 'The Blacks' ['The Blacks: A Clown Show,' Jean Genet].  Classic play, never be another 'Blacks.'  From there I went, I did 'Dutchman' [Amiri Baraka], the Leroi Jones [Amiri Baraka] play.  That was the, as I said, that was probably the most important play in my career, character, for the turning point for me as an actor.
Speaker 2: And the--what was the 'Dutchman?'
Speaker 1: The play was written by LeRoi Jones, who, who eventually became Imamu Amiri Baraka [sic, Imamu Amear Barak, then Amiri Baraka], a very controversial African American poet, playwright, essayist, a brilliant man.  Made a lot of enemies because he was very, very hard on, on white people at the time.  The play was about this white, crazy white woman who goes off on this black middle class student on the train, on the subway train in New York.  The confrontation and the fight and the end, tragic ending.  But it put LeRoi Jones on the map, and then he became Imamu Amiri Baraka.
Speaker 2: Tell us what that tragic ending was.
Speaker 1: She eventually stabs the black guy, Clay.  They have this confrontation and she's really just twisted and she's a basket case.  And she comes on to him and he, you know, doesn't quite come back to her satisfaction.  And the dialogue escapes me because it was many, many years ago when I was a young man, but she stabs him.  She stabs him there on the stage and you know, the audience would go aah, you know because it was done very well.  It was a very shocking piece, very controversial.  She kills him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that play, you know has been done--I've been asked to, to do it several, several times throughout my career.  I never did it again, but I, you know I have coached actors on the play and on--and, and, and on the characters.  But again, another classic, 'Dutchman.'
Speaker 2: Is there a reason why you turned down those offers to recreate it?
Speaker 1: Well you know when you create a role originally on the New York [New York] stage, it's hard to go back and do it in regional theater.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Even for good money.  I just, I could not--I just wanted to move on and just leave it, leave it like, like I left it, you know.  But so I never did that.  I never did any of the plays that I did on Broadway or off-Broadway for that matter, except 'The Blacks.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I did recreate 'The Blacks' when I moved to Washington, D.C.--
Story_ID: 154269
Speaker 1: During this period now, ['The Blacks: A Clown Show,' Jean Genet] and then the 'Dutchman' [Amiri Baraka], you also had a Civil Rights activist role that you continued to pursue?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I had--before I even did my first Broadway play, I, I, I was introduced to the whole political scene, the Civil Rights scene by a, oddly enough, a Japanese American woman, Yuri, or Mary Kochiyama, who just one of the--one of my heroes, really got me involved in politics.  This was before I even joined 'A Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: From that point on, I was involved in the movement.  I was involved in different Civil Rights, Civil Rights events.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Events throughout the city.  Always, even when I was doing my plays, I would, you know I would find time to, to be involved in, in the movement.  I always was involved in it throughout my professional career.
Speaker 1: Any one of particular note that during the period of '91, '92 [sic, 1961 or 1962] that you can think of?
Speaker 2: Gee, I wish I could remember back that far.
Speaker 1: Okay, not a problem.
Speaker 2: There were, there were a lot.  I mean it was the middle of--it was the beginning, the real beginning of the Civil Rights movement.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And things were heating up and New York was a hotbed.  And because we were working actors involved in bringing people into theaters, we were always called on to be a part of the seminars and the events that were fundraisers and things like that for SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] and SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and, and, and organizations like that.  So I was always involved in, in events because we were "celebrities" and you know, we, we would bring people in and that's how they raised money to send down south to [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] and, and the people that needed--organizations of course were, you know, were responsible for what was happening; voter registration and, and stuff in, in the South.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 154270
Speaker 1: Following the 'Dutchman' [Amiri Baraka].
Speaker 2: 'Dutchman,' not 'The Dutchman.'
Speaker 1: Right, right, Dutch, Dutch--
Speaker 2: It's just 'Dutchman,' right.
Speaker 1: Right.  The--what, what were your activities in theater following that?
Speaker 2: Well, actually that's when I got involved in being theater companies.  I was doing 'Dutchman,' it was a big success.  I was living in Chelsea [New York, New York] and that's--
Speaker 1: Now the year we're talking about.
Speaker 2: Year we're talking about was 196--now.
Speaker 1: Four, five.
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963], '-4 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963], '-4 [1964].  Probably off a year or two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But early '60s [1960s], early '60s [1960s], '62 [1962], '63 [1963] I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was asked to come and speak at the civil rights, at the Chelsea Community Center, Chelsea Civil Rights Comm--Committee or whatever.  And I was doing this hit play off Broadway, it was a big hit, 'Dutchman.'  And I was living right across the street from the Hudson Gill, which is right there in Chelsea, dear friend of yours--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Who was a part of this organization that I started.  So I was asked to come and speak about theater, blacks in theater and theater in general.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I went to this Hudson Gill one evening and it was a, a--all the people from the community because it was a big community organization, came and I spoke about--it was the first time I ever spoke really to, to a big audience like that, and talked about theater.  How important it was to the movement, the Civil Rights movement, and how important it was for the young people to learn everything they could about what theater had to offer for them, which would eventually get them off the streets.  The kids that were dropping out of school and getting involved in riots and drugs and things like that because that was happening at the time.  And after--and it was a successful speech I thought.  And the people enjoyed it.  And I was--now it's over and I'm walking out and because I knew all of the kids, the youngsters, or most of the youngsters because I lived on that street, they, you know, were asking questions about, you know, whether they could be involved.  This one wanted to write poetry, this one wanted to direct, this one wanted to be an actor, this one wanted to be a dancer.  So there I am standing there, holding court with I guess about twenty youngsters.  And I suggested, I said look, I'm--I get Mondays off, off-Broadway's day off is Monday.  So why don't we just next Monday, why don't we all come over my house, which is ri--you could see it from where we were standing.  It was a railroad kind of flat on the, on the ground floor in this building.  I said why don't you all just come on over to the house and let's just throw it around and I'll talk to you about it and I'll--you know.  So the next Monday, not only did those kids come, but I guess there must have been thirty kids coming into my living room.  So we started talking about--and so I had them each get up and talk a little bit about themselves and, you know and they really enjoyed that.  You can tell the ones that had a little ham in them and they--you could tell the ones that were shy and--but it was wonderful seeing these youngsters talk about themselves and about their families and all.  Some of the stories were sad, some of them were really sad.  Some of them were really quite wonderful and you said wow, I didn't know that about this young person.  So that was the first Monday.  So then we said okay why don't we just meet next Monday?  And next Monday they came, a few more people came, not just from Chelsea, but from Harlem [New York, New York], Bed-Stuy [New York, New York], Jamaica [New York, New York].  So all of a sudden there we were in my living room, jam packed with pe--youngsters talking about theater and all I--we--I got this idea.  Why don't we just do this?  Why don't we just start a workshop and because I saw the talent, I saw the talent.  One of the, one of the key people that were there, that was there was [HM] Hattie Winston--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who lived right next door to me, and had just come in from--she had gone to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  She was just in town.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154271
Speaker 1: And she [HM Hattie Winston] became--so she was there and she was all--like the coordinator, right.  And we--she and I worked very, very well together, so she was indeed the workshop coordinator.  We started a theater company right in my living room.  We, we--the kids and I knocked out a wall, we built a stage.  I was renting this thing.  It was like a loft.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well not a loft, but we made it a loft.  We knocked out the wall, we built a stage, and there we were.  I happened to have been very, very close with a lot of very talented people, writers like [HM] Douglas Turner Ward and Lonne Elder [III].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: People like [HM] Barbara Ann Teer, Ron Mack, Peter D'Andus [ph.], some wonderful people that were friends, that I brought in to teach these kids.  Lonne taught writing, [HM] Barbara Ann [Teer] taught acting and dance, Ron Mack taught acting.  Doug was teaching writing and producing.  So I had all my friends working for me and with these kids.  So we decided--
Speaker 2: In your--
Speaker 1: In my living room.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Still in my living room, right, every Monday night, right.  Well we decided after we had our meeting that [HM] Hattie Winston kind of coordinated and we--there we were sitting--what are we gonna call ourselves, right?  Well one of my, one of my favorite theater groups in life that I read about and I admired the people involved, was the Group Theater.  And the Group Theater was, you know, started by Harold Clurman and people like that.  And I said why don't we just call ourselves--we are a workshop--The Group Theater Workshop?  And G.T.W. [Group Theater Workshop] came into existence and that's how the Group Theater Workshop started in my living room.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now I'm doing 'Dutchman' [Amiri Baraka] and I'm working with these kids with my colleagues, and it's--I mean we're doing wonderful things.  We're doing--we're taking poetry to the stage, we're doing scene study.  And it's looking good and these kids were--so I decided--the people in the neighborhood, their parents and other people in the neighborhood, would see all these kids spilling out of my, my apartment into the street, you know, when we'd have our sessions.  And they were what's going on over there?  What is this actor Robert Hooks doing with all these kids, right.  So I decided that after a few months of doing this and seeing the incredible talent, I decided let's show these people in the neighborhood what we're doing.  I got Edward Albee, the great Edward Albee and Clinton Wilder and people that were producing 'Dutchman' at the Cherry Lane Theater, which is where we were doing it.  I got them to lend me--I told them what we were doing and they were of course very, very happy that, you know, the community, the kids in the community because I mean this was a time when the kids were rioting in the streets for crying out loud.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So they allowed me to have--to take a Monday night, use that Monday night for a showcase.  The Group Theater Workshop, this young group of actors--to do a showcase for the community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So we did.  We put on this showcase where we would take--we'd do scenes, we'd take stage poetry and Barbara Ann Teer was very, very instrumental.  Well she was co-founder of the organization, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so now we're presenting this evening showcase of the Group Theater Workshop.  I didn't invite critics, I didn't want critics to be there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I just wanted it to be for the people.  So we had this wonderful evening.  The next day in the New York Post, Jerry Tallmer, who is one of the great writers, great theater critics.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I think he's still around.  I don't think he's at the [Washington] Post anymore, but Jerry Tallmer--and somebody brought this paper to me 'cause I read the [New York] Times, I didn't read the Post that much, brought this thing and there was a, a, a review of this evening in the theater.  Robert Hooks' theater group, youngsters, whatever.  And it was a fantastic review.
Speaker 2: So he had been there then.
Speaker 1: He was there that night.  I didn't see him, but he was there, he wrote about it.  He reviewed the evening.
Story_ID: 154272
Speaker 1: Well one of the, one of the pieces that we [Group Theater Workshop] did was a one act play written by [HM] Douglas Turner Ward.  It was called 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward], right.  And it was a four character play.  I used the youngsters playing the older folk, [HM] Hattie Winston was in it, Maxine, I think Maxine Griffith, either she--she wasn't--yes she--no she wasn't in that; she came later when we, when we produced the plays.
Speaker 2: Right, I think so.
Speaker 1: But Hattie Winston and, and I'm trying to think of who else was in the--Tina Nurse and Bostick (ph.)--well I don't know if Bostick was in it, but anyway I directed this one act play.
Speaker 2: 'Happy Ending.'
Speaker 1: 'Happy Ending.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now the one act play was half of the review that Jerry Tallmer wrote.  He says and the, the second half of the, of the evening was this play by Douglas Turner Ward.  He reviewed the play like it was already a professional production.  So now we had been--we--Douglas, Lonne [Elder III], and a few other, Esther Rolle, Frances Foster.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Moses Gunn, a lot of people were reading the play for backers because we were trying to get the plays--this was a one--this, this one act 'Happy Ending,' was a companion piece to 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So we were trying to get these plays produced because they were just brilliant satires, very, very funny plays.  But we could not raise the money to get them done.
Story_ID: 154273
Speaker 1: Okay now the New York Post has done this interview.
Speaker 2: To everybody's surprise.  It wasn't an interview, it was a review.
Speaker 1: It was a review.
Speaker 2: It was a review of the evening.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The, the showcase that was--I just was doing, I was doing it for the community.  I was doing it to get the parents off my back because people were concerned about well what is--what's happening?  What are my kids doing over in that guy's apartment over there, he's an actor for crying out loud.  And so I wanted them to see what we were doing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So [HM] Barbara Ann [Teer] and I came up with this concept of the showcase.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And she directed a lot of it, I directed the play.  And the play that we did, the one act play, was, was just a brilliant review.  And I said to--and then--and we couldn't raise the money 'cause we were doing backer's auditions for [HM]Douglas' [Turner Ward] two one act plays.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In between my acting and, and Doug's and Lonne's [Elder III] writing and all, we were trying to sell his play.  So this, this producer, a friend of Doug's named Sam Engle was trying to raise the money and produce the plays, but he couldn't do it.  Nobody would, you know, and we would go and we'd read the play for backers to, to, you know but nobody would buy.  So when I--
Speaker 1: This was 1964, '65 [1965], even though there was a Civil Rights awakening, blacks were still getting sort of second shift I guess.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  Well the whole idea of Douglas's play, especially the second play which was 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Was based on the Montgomery [Alabama] [bus] boycott [1955].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so--but I couldn't do that play because there were too many characters and we were talk--we were working with kids, youngsters, not kids.  So I chose the second play, which was in the first play--it was the first play in the, in the two plays.  I chose 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it's funny, it was funny.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I'll tell you a little bit about what it was about.  But anyway, so I went to Douglas and I said, "Doug, this is Jerry Tallmer writing about your play and these are kids doing it.  These are not even reg--regular adult actors playing these roles.  Let me do this play."  I had no idea what I was getting myself into; glad that I did.  But I said I can do this.  So he said--so I went to Sam Engle, long story short here, I went to Sam and I said Sam, you know, we've been reading this play, reading this play.  We can't get the--let me try to raise the money to do this thing because you know I'm almost certain I can do it.  By that time I had met a lot of people and I had some, you know, some financial connections; I had met some black entrepreneurs that I wanted to go to.  And he said fine, go ahead, you know.  They're wonderful plays and here, it's yours.  If you can make it happen, do it, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well it didn't take me long.  There were two black entrepreneurs that were--that had started a record company, Stax Records.  [HM] Clarence Avant and Al Bell were the two gentlemen and I had met them.  And met them through I think Jimmy [James] Baldwin had introduced me to them.  So I went to them with these plays and they just laughed until they were silly.  And I said all I need is thirty-five thousand dollars to put these plays on.  The next day I had the money in the bank from these two incredible men.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I produced the plays, of course things, a lot of things happened in between then.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154274
Speaker 1: But the play, just to tell you a little bit about the 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward] play.  Two domestics in New York [New York], they're Doug's [HM Douglas Turner Ward] aunts.  He wrote this play about his aunts right.  Two domestics, curtain goes up or lights come up, and the, they, they're coming in from work and they're crying.  Vie and Ellie are these two characters.  "Vie, what are gone do, Vie?  Oh, my lord, what we gone do?  Jesus, Jesus."  And they're crying like crazy.  And the audience is going "what's going on?" you know.  So they come in and they sit at the kitchen table.  And "Vie, pass me the handkerchief, pass me the handkerchief."  And "oh lord, what we gone do?  I don't understand why they did what they did."  Now Juney comes in, Juney I a young, hip, you know, I played the role.  He comes in, "Hey everybody, hey."  You know come in and get dressed and go out on the street and do his thing.  "Hey, what's up?  Come on".  And, and then he looks, he said "what's the matter?"  He said "somebody die or something?  Something wrong with Mama?"  'Cause he's, he's up from the south living with his aunts, his mother's in--down south.  He says "nothing wrong with Mama, right?"  "No Juney, it ain't yo mama.  No Juney."  He said "well what's wrong, what you crying for?"  "Lord, it's the Harrisons Juney."  "The Harrisons.  What you crying for the Harr--them white people y'all work for.  What you crying about the Harrisons?  Ain't nothing to be crying for."  She said "boy, you don't know what--you just don't know."  So anyway, it goes on like that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So they said--he said "I don't understand it.  My aunts, daughters of my grandfather."  Whatever, whatever.  "Sitting here crying about the white man.  How you gone be crying like that over the white man?  Just because they getting a divorce."  That's what's happening.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Mr. Harrison is divorcing her, he caught her in bed with somebody and they--it's over.  So she--so now they gotta educate this boy.  So they said "sit down, boy."  "I don't wanna be sitting down."  "Sit down boy."  So he sits.  They say "you, you know them clothes you been wearing" whatever, whatever.  "You know where they come from?"  Vie said "the Harrisons".  "You see that refrigerator over there?  All stocked with all kinds of--you know where that come from?  The Harrison.  Go over there boy, go open that freezer."  "I don't want--" "Go open the freezer Juney."  He goes over, he opens the free--"you see all them steaks and all that turkey and chickens up in there.  Where do you think they come from?"  "The Harrisons."  Now by the time they finish educating Juney, Juney's "Vie, pass me the handkerchief."  So he starts crying.  Now Arthur comes in.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Douglas Turner Ward plays the role, he's my uncle.  He comes in, he's gotta go to the bathroom, so he comes in.  He running to the bathroom.  So he said "What's the matter?"  "The Harrisons."  "Not again."  "No this time it's for real Arthur, this time it's for real.  Oh my god, you should have seen him, this was awful.  Now we out of work."  So now they run it down to him, and then he goes "pass me the handkerchief."  So he starts.  Now the four of them are sitting there and the phone rings and turns out that the Harrisons are getting back together.  And so Vie says "Oh my god, they getting back together."  So she says "Arthur, go get a bottle of the champagne, the 1937, that was a good year."  So Arthur goes, gets the champagne and they toast the Harrisons and that's the happy ending.  But that was the play that we did that really got Jerry Tallmer's juices going.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 154275
Speaker 1: And got my juices going because I realized I can produce these plays.  So I became a, a producer.  I produced the plays.  We opened the plays with a great cast of characters.  Moses Gunn, Lonne Elder [III], Esther Rolle, Frances Foster, Maxine [Griffith], [HM] Hattie Winston, just a great, great cast.  And the plays were big, big hits.  [HM] Douglas Turner Ward became the, the darling.  This was after LeRoi Jones [sic, Amiri Baraka] was the darling.  Douglas came, came along with a, with a play with a different twist.  Douglas used humor, satire to make his point.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Roy Jones or Imamu Baraka [Amiri Baraka]--
Speaker 2: Straight at you.
Speaker 1: Came straight at you with a sledgehammer.  Douglas used a switchblade.  And Douglas, where Imamau hit you over the head with a sledgehammer and gave you a big headache if you were white.  Douglas--and your head rolled down the--you didn't even know your head was off and it rolled down the aisle.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That was the effect of those two writers, those two incredible writers.  People tried to compare them, who was better.  I worked with both of them.  They're both extremely talented with different approaches to dealing with the issues of blacks in America.
Story_ID: 154276
Speaker 1: Now the--during that transition from the kids doing that 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward], to professional actors doing it, the name, the Negro Ensemble was created.
Speaker 2: The N.E.C. [Negro Ensemble Company].
Speaker 1: NEC.
Speaker 2: Right.  What happened was the plays opened, big success, big hit, selling out, constantly selling out.  The biggest hit, you know, since 'The Blacks' [Jean Genet].  The biggest hit since 'The Blacks'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well so now Douglas [HM Douglas Turner Ward] got the great reviews.  Douglas was asked to write an article.  Now he's the fair haired playwright, you know.  The New York Times asked him to write an article about theater, black theater.  Well Douglas wrote the article and it was scathing.  It was called 'Theater in American for Whites Only.'  Big, big article in the Sunday Times.  And because of that article, now we're in the plays, we're doing the play, eight performances a week and we get a call.  I'm producing the play, Gerry Krone, Gerald Krone is the company manager, he and his wife Dorothy Olim were company managers for me.  I had brought them on because I had met them when we did 'Dutchman' [Amiri Baraka].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They were handling 'Dutchman' as well.  We became friends.  So when I produced the play, naturally I went to Dorothy and Gerry.  So they came on as the production managers, right.  And now Douglas Turner Ward writes the article for the Times.  And the Ford Foundation, now remember at the time the streets were--I mean the youngsters and the streets--blacks were just creating havoc.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you know it was right after the riots.  It still was unsettled.  Harlem was, you know, half burned down.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, the--they were trying to find some way to kind of quell this situation.  So the Ford Foundation called Douglas, Gerry and myself in to talk about doing something, creating something to you know, 'cause Douglas's article spoke to the urgency of a autonomous black theater company.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they said give us, bring us a proposal and we'll fund it.  So Douglas and Gerry and I sat in the Orquidea, which was a very popular restaurant one block from the St. Mark's playhouse, which is where we were housed.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's where 'The Blacks' was, and that's where now we were doing 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward].  So it was home to us.  The, the Orquidea was our restaurant.  It was a wonderful Russian owned restaurant, Russian lady named Mushka [ph.] owned it.  Well we would go there after the shows and people would go there after the shows.  The N.Y.U. [New York University, New York, New York] theater people would come in.  It was a theater crowd kind of thing.  We sat there and on a tablecloth in the Orquidea, we designed what we thought would be the perfect theater company.  It had to have longevity, it had to--we had to have a three year space in order to make it work.  It just couldn't throw some money in there and try to build a theater company.  We had to plan it for some kind of longevity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we put together a three year program of theater, of actor, of, of a theater company, a resident theater company for the first time ever.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Where we would pay them, actors, equity salaries.  A company of fifteen actors.  We would have workshops for all aspects of theater, producing, acting, directing, choreography, dancers, we had a dance company.  And we presented this proposal to the Ford Foundation.  We called it The Negro Ensemble Company.  And they loved the proposal.  And volia!  A million and a half dollars for that three year program.
Story_ID: 154277
Speaker 1: Was the beginning--
Speaker 2: Which was a lot of money in those days.
Speaker 1: A lot of money in those days.  And we used it wisely.  We put together a dynamite company [Negro Ensemble Company].  Because [Gerald] Gerry Krone was working with us already, we brought him as the administrative director for this new company.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: [HM] Douglas Turner Ward of course would be the artistic director because he's probably the most knowledgeable art, artist, artistic director ever in theater as far as I was concerned.  And of course I had the ability and the kind of talent to bring creative elements together and to stay there with it until it was what it was supposed to be.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Overseeing, if you will.  I became the executive director.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you had Douglas artistic director, Gerry administrative director, and me as the--
Speaker 2: Executive.
Speaker 1: Executive director.  And that was the triumvirate that it--we became.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then the N.E.C. [Negro Ensemble Company] was born.  We brought in, we auditioned the best actors.  A lot of them we had already--we were already working with because we used them when we went professional with 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward] and 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so we built the N.E.C.  And our home became the St. Mark's Playhouse.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which is where we were housed, and 'The Blacks' [Jean Genet], 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence,' now the N.E.C.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because it was a--not just a theater, small theater, wonderful, small theater, very intimate.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We loved it.  One of the best theaters I've ever played in.  And then there were two stories of office space, workshop space.  It was upstairs in this wonderful old theater, used to be a movie house.  Now--no as a matter of fact, there was a movie house downstairs on the ground floor, yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: There was a movie house on the ground floor.  We had our play house on this second floor, and the third and the fourth floor were workshops and offices and all that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was perfect for us.  That was the beginning of what now is history and the most productive black theater company in the world.
Speaker 2: And you bought in other people as directors and playwrights and so forth.
Speaker 1: Well because we were, we were a professional company.  We were doing five plays a season.  We had to bring in the best people.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now African American artists had a place of permanency.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that's what we wanted it to be, and that's what it was for thirty years.
Story_ID: 154278
Speaker 1: This was when you got the grant from the Ford Foundation.  Are we talking about '45 [1945], '40 [1940]--I mean, I'm sorry '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Sixty five [1965]
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty seven [1967] we opened the company.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Sixty Five [1965] and '66 [1966] we were in the preparation for it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Building it, you know we had gotten the money from the Ford Foundation.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Who were really very, very gracious and you know it was the first time they had ever done that too.
Speaker 1: And eve--
Speaker 2: McNeil, [Wilson] McNeil Lowry was the head [sic, vice president at the Ford Foundation, 1964-1974] and he was the person that made this happen for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They--the initial proposal was for a three year grant.  How long after that did they continue to fund?
Speaker 1: They funded us for several years after that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they, they, they, you know, the, the, the funding each year.  We wanted them--we didn't want them to fund us forever.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We wanted to build an audience.  We wanted our box office, our patronage, to take care of our nut, If you will.
Speaker 2: I got you.  To support the whole project, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  We did not want the Ford Foundation to be the, you know the big, you know "great white father on the hill."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Just throwing money down to the, you know, to, to the black artists.  It was great that they did what they did to get us started.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it was up to us to build the autonomy, and we did.
Speaker 2: Right.  And of course you spurned a lot of the [HM] Michael [A.] Schultz's of the world.
Speaker 1: I mean it goes on.  The list of the N.E.C. [Negro Ensemble Company]--
Speaker 2: Sam Art Williamses.
Speaker 1: Yes, Denzel Washington, Samm-Art Williams, Samuel L. Jackson, Debbie Allen, Phylicia Rashad, Esther Frances.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The list goes on and on and on and on.  I mean you know thousands of artists, not just actors.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But directors, choreographers, set designers, costume designers, the whole thing, N.E.C.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Negro Ensemble Company was the most productive black theater company in the world.
Speaker 2: And now it was going and it was getting up to speed--
Speaker 1: Big success, big success.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: We went to Europe, we toured Europe, did the festivals in Europe.  And we had the great acting company.  I mean some of the best actors, [HM] Arthur [Wellesley] French, Norman Bush, Adolph Caesar, you know [HM] Hattie Winston, [HM] Denise Nicholas.
Speaker 2: Right, and let's--during that period and I just wanna be sure that I'm not leaving out anything, you're executive producer, executive director.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Of the Negro Ensemble Theater.
Speaker 1: Company.
Speaker 2: Company.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Negro Ensemble Company.
Speaker 1: Right, N.E.C.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154279
Speaker 1: What about your civil activist role.
Speaker 2: What about my acting career?
Speaker 1: And your acting career.
Speaker 2: They all went hand-in-hand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never stopped.  I still would go out to Hollywood [California] and do movies.  I had a television series, very successful television series, 'N.Y.P.D.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That happened right, you know--
Speaker 1: How, how did that happen?  And are, are we skipping anything?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because I wanna get it go in chronological order.  Should we cover anything before that offer comes for 'N.Y.P.D.'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we, we can, we can.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We can first start with the Civil Rights activities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were, you know there were as I said earlier, there were all kinds of events that we were a part of because we had to raise money for, you know for the, for the voters registration and for all the things that were happening on the Civil Rights front with the different organizations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [HM Harry] Belafonte, James Baldwin, all these people were friends and we worked together to help these different organizations.
Speaker 1: So you were doing voter registration.
Speaker 2: I wasn't doing voter registration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was doing benefits to raise money to support what was happening in the south.
Speaker 1: Voter registration.
Speaker 2: The voter registration was happening down south.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they needed, of course they needed funds.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We were responsible in New York [New York] and around the country, but mainly in New York because we could raise money; we were celebrities.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The people, the big celebrities lived in New York.  I mean the Belafontes, the [HM] Diahann Carrolls, you know and all of the great artists, Sidney Poitier, all these people lived in New York.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they depended on us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To be responsible for helping them raise money to do the things that they had to do in the South--
Story_ID: 154280
Speaker 1: Let's set this scene for instance during that early period, '67 [1967], '68 [1968].  You knew [HM] Harry Belafonte and what was Belafonte doing in relation to what you were doing at that time?
Speaker 2: Well Harry of course was a big star.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was, he was, you know performing.  He's a singer and he was performing all over the country, and of course he was one of the, one of the leaders in the Civil Rights Movement.  He and [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] were very, very close.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He and I became friends when I started the Negro Ensemble Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He and Sidney Poitier and I, because they of course were, were you know, in support of this group, this organization.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That this young actor from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and Washington, D.C. came to New York [New York] and all of a sudden is involved in creating these outlets for all of these performers that didn't have any place to go to work.  I mean there was no steady work.  It was work occasionally for actors, you know but, but we created a permanency.  We were doing five plays a season.  And so anyway Sidney and Harry and a few other people as well, lot of artists, James Baldwin, James Baldwin was on the board of directors for the Group Theater Workshop.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was before the N.E.C. [Negro Ensemble Company]
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Group Theater Workshop was the, you know was, was the catalyst.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That was the seed.
Speaker 2: That was the seed.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I went and got some of the most influential friends that I knew, and James Baldwin was one of them.  Judy Peabody was also one of them.  Dr. Stanley Nelson, a dentist whose daughter is a, is a wonderful--Jill Nelson is a great author herself.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But her father and I were close.  He was on my board.  So I had these great people on my board, wonderful patrons.  This was again before the N.E.C.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause the Group Theater Workshop was the seed that created the N.E.C. after I produced 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward] and 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward].  And then, you know, so the produc--it's all those youngsters that were in the Group Theater Workshop moved over to the training program of the N.E.C.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it was a natural progression.  But yeah, that was--so the Belafonte and Sidney Poitier, the friendship was a, was a very, very healthy friendship; they supported me.
Speaker 1: Right.  And that's where I was going.  What their contribution was to all of that in that pe--that period.
Speaker 2: Well you know Sidney, Sidney and Harry were both very, very supportive.  They gave moral support.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They were not involved in the theater itself.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But we did a lot of other things outside of the theater that contributed to the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they I'm sure were very proud of the things that I was doing and they supported me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they were both just giants of individuals.  I mean Sidney and Harry and I were--did a lot of things together, you know.  We, we, we were buddies.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Didn't always last but, but you know that--Sidney and I have always been buddies.  I got--Harry's relationship with mine kind of soured on some personal things that were silly, basically and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Were never, never happened.  He thought things happened that didn't happen.  I think he was probably told that some things happened.
Speaker 1: Which is usually the case.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and, and they never really did happen.  I had great respect for him.  I loved him and I still love him.  I still love Harry Belafonte, although he doesn't speak to me anymore.  But that's okay; I understand that, that's human nature.  He was angry for me--he was angry with me thinking that I had done something that I, that I never really did.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Always respected him.  But that's, you know, I'll probably go to my grave and he'll go to his not liking me as much as I thought we would end up being.  But you know that's, that's life.
Story_ID: 154281
Speaker 1: Now, we're at 1968 let's say.
Speaker 2: Okay, NEC's [Negro Ensemble Company] flourishing.
Speaker 1: NEC is flourishing.
Speaker 2: My acting career is flourishing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm making movies, I'm in television shows.
Speaker 1: Tell us, tell us about some of the movies.  What's your first movie, first of all, we haven't--
Speaker 2: My first movie, my first movie was a film called 'Sweet Love Bitter.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was from a novel by John Williams, wonderful black author.  The, the novel was called 'Night Song' [John Williams], which I always loved the title, and for some reason they couldn't use the title, I don't know why.  But [HM] Dick Gregory was--the story was about Charlie Parker and the Miles Davis and Charlie Parker relationship, fictionalized.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Dick Gregory, [Herbert] Herb Danska was a brilliant young independent filmmaker, produced it and directed it.  Well he directed, he didn't produce it.  And brought Dick Gregory on to play the Charlie Parker role.  Asked me to do the Miles Davis character.  And a wonderful actress who's not with us any longer, but just a gorgeous, wonderful woman, Diane Varsi was her name.  And, and Don Murray, the wonderful actor Don Murray.  Don and I played like the leads to Dick's Charlie Parker.  That was the first film, 'Sweet Love Bitter.'  Interracial love affair.  So it be--and it was black and white film.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: It was black and white, it was my first film.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Gee, I wish I could tell you the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to find out the year.  But that was my first film.  If I had to guess, I would say '66 [sic, film came out in January, 1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: So you're still working to pull NEC together.
Speaker 2: Right and I was using, I was using--
Speaker 1: And running out here to shoot.
Speaker 2: I was using my influence as an actor, a working actor and a celebrity, if you will.  Making little, little money here and there, taking care of my family and also throwing a little bit at the NEC when we needed a little bit here and there-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 154282
Speaker 1: 1966.  You're in your first film, 'Sweet Love Bitter,' and with [HM] Dick Gregory, Don Murray.
Speaker 2: And Diane Varsi.
Speaker 1: And Diane Varsi.
Speaker 2: We must not forget that wonderful actress Diane Varsi.
Speaker 1: And how is this movie received?
Speaker 2: It was, you know it was an independent film.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It didn't get a--it didn't get big distribution.  It wasn't studio film.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although one of the studios picked it up for a minute.  It was controversial because it was a black/white relationship.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And it was a story about a drug addict genius of a musician happened to have been a drug addict.  So it didn't get the established critics' reviews.  But it was a cult film.  I mean it did very well with the jazz fans and the black community because it was a first in many, many ways.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that was my first film.  A black and white film.
Speaker 1: And, but your reviews must have been very good because the second film followed, didn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, then my film career took off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't--I can't remember what my reviews were like, but I'm never bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Joking.
Speaker 1: No, that's true.
Speaker 2: The reviews were, were, were good for the movie and it just didn't make a whole lot of money because back in that, back in '66 [1966] you don't do movies about interracial love affairs.
Speaker 1: Right, and expect to make money.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And it was a very daring venture for [Herbert] Herb Danska and I wish I could remember the, the producer's names, and I'm sorry I can't.  But it was a long time ago.  But Herb Danska was the director and he's still around and very, very active around today.
Story_ID: 154283
Speaker 1: Then the second film I did was 'Hurry Sundown.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was doing a play on Broadway, NEC's [Negro Ensemble Company] going strong.  I'm now on Broadway in a play, in a play called 'Where's Daddy?' [William Inge].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was a William Inge play directed by Harold Clurman, one of the Group Theatre, one of the Group Theatre's founders.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Remember now the group theater is one of my favorite organizations that I kind of built my whole idea for theater companies.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: With this Group Theatre.  Elia Kazan, people like that.  So Harold Clurman, I auditioned for this role.  So Harold Clurman calls--my agent says Harold Clurman wants to be with you in the morning, and I thought well maybe I didn't get the role, maybe he wants me to audition again.  So I go and I meet with Harold Clurman, who's, who's now using somebody else's office.
Speaker 2: Let's establish the year if we could.  Would we be in '70 [1970]--'67 [1967]?
Speaker 1: Sixty seven [1967].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sixty seven [1967].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, or thereabouts.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I go to meet with Harold Clurman who's a real character.  Smokes a cigar, wears a fedora, carries a cane and wears a cape.  But just a classic, classic director and a classic theater person.  I mean he's famous, very famous.  One of the founders of the Group Theatre.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I go into his office and sit down and he says wonderful audition and I want you to tell me about this theater company of yours.  This Group Theater Workshop.  Well right away I'm looking--I'm in trouble.  Here's a guy that started the Group Theatre, and here's this little black actor over here taking the name and giving it to these young kids in this young actors' workshop.  So I started telling him how it came about, what I was doing.  By the time I finished working him over, right, he said to me, he said, "first of all, congratulations, you got the role.  And congratulations again.  I think it's a wonderful thing that you're doing with the Group Theater Workshop."  Please invite me to come to an event.  Because when I went in there, I don't think he was too happy about my using the Group Theatre in the title of this new company of mine.  But by the time I left there, he was all for the Group Theater Workshop, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 154284
Speaker 1: Then from that play ['Where's Daddy?'] we were sitting--we were at--usually we go to Sardi's restaurant after opening night, or on opening night and we wait for the reviews.  Wait for the early edition of the New York Times.  At the time the Tribune or Herald Tribune and you know, a couple of other papers, [New York] Post.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I'm sitting, we're having fun and we're drinking champagne and whatever.  And the phone rings and the phone didn't ring, Vincent Sardi brings the phone over to me.  Now I'm thinking, I mean, what is this?  I can sit at a table in a restaurant and talk on the telephone.  So he says telephone for you, Robert.  So I pick up the phone and there was this voice on the phone, very thick accent, right.  And I think somebody's playing a joke.  He says "Robert, this is Otto Preminger."  I said yeah, okay.  He says "I saw the play tonight and I want you to come to the office tomorrow and I want to talk to you about doing my movie.  I'm doing a movie in the South and I want you to come and I want you to be in my movie, but I want you to come and I want you to talk with me."  So the next day I go to the Paramount Building.  I'm flying, I'm on cloud nine.  I just opened in a Broadway play, I get a phone call from Otto Preminger.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I knew who Otto Preminger was.  I didn't believe it was him at first, but it was him, right.  Next day I go to his office.  Big office in the Paramount Building, I mean incredible office.  The desk was as big as this room.  Nothing was on it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there was Otto.  And sat down, told me he enjoyed my performance.  And he told me about this play, I mean this movie that he was doing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Michael Kane was in the movie and Jane Fonda was already signed to do it, and Faye Dunaway, this new brilliant star.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She was signed to do it.  And [HM] Diahann Carroll.  And I want you to play opposite Diahann Carroll in this movie.  Well come on, you know.  So anyway long story short after I--he picked me up off the floor, I got the part in 'Hurry Sundown.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which was a Preminger film.  We went to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and this is all while the N.E.C.'s [Negro Ensemble Company] going strong.
Speaker 2: And you're still the executive.
Speaker 1: I'm still the executive director, I'm going to the--you know--and I go to the theater and in my day time I'm at the office at Times Square with Dorothy and Gerald [Krone].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And taking care of business, you know.  And, and then I go to the theater at night.  Now eventually I have to leave the play and go do this movie.  So we go to Baton Rouge, Louisiana to do my second film, which was 'Hurry Sundown.'  That is another story, my friend.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 154285
Speaker 1: Well I think now is the time to tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well it ['Hurry Sundown'], it was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  And that's the Deep South.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's the Deep South.  The Ku Klux Klan were all over the different parishes.  Some of them--
Speaker 1: And this is 1967.
Speaker 2: It's 1967.
Speaker 1: So it's not unusual.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: They run things.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now simultaneous with that, the N.E.C.'s [Negro Ensemble Company] about to do its first season, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now I'm in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with this incredible class, and a wonderful story.
Speaker 1: And opportunity.
Speaker 2: And oppor--incredible opportunity.  Now this is a big Hollywood studio movie.  This is no little independent here, this is Paramount, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so we start shooting this movie in these little patches of real south, you know, Beah Richards, the brilliant actress Beah Richards.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: plays my mother in the film.  So Rex Ingram, the great, classic Rex Ingram.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Plays [HM] Diahann Carroll's father in the film.  So I'm, I'm with this incredible cast of characters, including three black characters that I've admired all my life.  Certainly Beah Richards and Rex Ingram, and now Diahann Carroll.  But we are faced with the Ku Klux Klan and this interactional ca--cast, staying at this Belmont Motor Hotel, which is gorgeous little motor hotel, gorgeous.  Whole cast was staying there.  There we are with a swimming pool, luxury, really great.  And the, the things that happened during the course of the shooting of this film.  I won't go into all the stuff, I'll just tell you about one time we're shooting--I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Before you start that, let me ask you--we're still talking '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So Otto Prem--Preminger, one of the leading directors, if not the leading director in the, in the country--
Speaker 2: Heavyweight.
Speaker 1: Heavyweight, is able to get you and Rex Ingram into the same hotel as all the rest of the cast?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and Diahann Carroll as well.
Speaker 1: And Diahann Carroll.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to--
Speaker 2: Well, we're talking Paramount, we're talking Hollywood.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now when they made the deal--I don't know if the people knew what, what they were getting into.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's hard to turn down Paramount Pictures when they call and reserve the hotel, 'cause everything was there; the production office.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Preminger was staying right above me.  I was downstairs, Preminger's room with his wife, I mean his suite.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Was right above me, and they were suites, fabulous place, brand new, brand new.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanted to visit that for a second.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there we were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm sure we were the first and the last for a long time.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Blacks, to stay in that hotel, but there we were.  Michael Caine and I became good buddies.  One of the incidents, well I'll, I'll talk about maybe two or three incidents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But a lot of incidents because we were, needless, to say, '67 [1967] in the Deep South.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We're shooting on location at our--Beah Richards and I had this kind of shack.  And I'm a farmer, right.  John Phillip Law and Faye Dunaway are the next door and they're farmers, right.  And the whole thing was about taking the land, big oil company buying up the land and I wouldn't sell.  Beah Richards and I wouldn't sell, we owned the property, we wouldn't sell.  And I'd just come out of the [U.S.] Army and I wasn't about to sell, you know.  So they were trying to get me out, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, so we're shooting and we finished shooting and we're all coming back.  And we, we're traveling in a caravan.  The cars for the actors, the trucks for the cameras, whatever, and we're traveling.  And all of a sudden we go--we're finished, it's a hard day, right.  And all of a sudden these shots ring out.  I mean shots, a lot of shots.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Bullets coming from somewhere off the road on both sides of the road.
Speaker 1: They got you in a crossfire.
Speaker 2: Right, and we're now speeding up and we're being shot at, bullet holes in, in the cars.  Fortunately, nobody was hurt, but we could have been killed, all of us could have been killed.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: They're shooting at us, they're shooting from this road at this caravan.  So from that point on, we had to make sure that we protected ourselves and you know, had people out and watching and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154286
Speaker 1: One of the things.  Second one was we're--the weekend--
Speaker 2: But you got back to the hotel.
Speaker 1: We got back to the hotel.
Speaker 2: Safely.
Speaker 1: Trucks and cars riddled with bullets.  Of course you know the sheriff comes and all that.  He may have been one of the shooters, who knows?  It--but nothing happened.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But we were afraid for our lives.  I had to go buy a gun.  I'd bought the gun, actually bought the gun.  My understudy was a very nice guy, a wonderful guy named Prince O. Whales was his name.  And I--he was my stand-in.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I asked him if he knew where I could get a gun.  He took me to a place, I bought a gun.  Never fired a gun in my life.  And I said no, no, no, you know, these people are shooting at me.
Speaker 2: You're not going down quietly.
Speaker 1: No, right.  So now we're, we're, we're--we--that incident.  Now we're on the weekend, the--Jane Fonda, Michael Caine. Faye Dunaway, John Phillip Law.  Burgess Meredith was also in the cast.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Madeline Sherwood was also in the cast, great cast.  Some of the white actors would go to New Orleans [Louisiana], which is right down the road from, you know, not far from Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  And one weekend, one week they came back, one Monday they started telling us what great--they went to this great restaurant, you know, Bourbon Street, this restaurant, Brennan's, was this great place.  So they said you guys gotta come.  So I said okay.  So the next weekend we all go together.  Michael Caine, Jane Fonda, Faye Dunaway, John Phillip Law, [HM] Diahann Carroll, myself went.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We walk up to Brennan's and they closed the door.  The guy comes out, we don't even get in the door.  We don't even get in the door.  Guy comes out, he says sorry, we're--so long story short, Michael and Jane who are very liberal and you know, they don't understand this.  They're Hollywood.  Michael's from England, he don't understand.  "Well we're making a movie and-"-"I don't care, we don't, don't allow no nigras up in here, no nigras.  I'm sorry, we don't do that."  Now they had just went to this restaurant the week before and had a wonderful time, great meal, food was great and all.  Well Diahann and, and I and just said look, you know guys, let's just go.  So we start back.  They didn't wanna leave.  Jane and them, they were adamant, they wanted to stand there and argue.  For what?  They're not gonna let us in.  So we go back, we're going back to the two cars, we had two cars.  So we're walking back and we're walking down Bourbon Street.  And the guys that stand out in front of the build--rest--places and bark for people to come in.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Come on in, whatever they, you know--they would just fade back into the--
Speaker 2: They knew better.
Speaker 1: All of a sudden there was this--these, these blacks and white movie stars walking down the street.  And no, no, we don't wanna 'em in here, kind of thing.  Get back to the, back--let's just go back to Baton Rouge.  So we go back to the Belmont.  Next day I tell Rex Ingram what, what went down.  And he's furious.  He didn't go with us, he didn't do it.  He was just--he stayed in his room.  I spent a lots of time with him.  Very strange, he would--he loved steak.  He would buy a steak, I'm digressing, he would buy steak and he would leave the steak out on the counter for like two or three days.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, covered, but he'd leave it out.  And he cooked, and I had steak with him one day.  I didn't believe the taste of this steak he cooked.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Amazing, right.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: But anyway Rex got on the phone when he heard about what happened in New Orleans.  And he called [Clinton Williams] Clint Murchison, who is the oil man.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In Texas somewhere, very good friend of Rex's.
Speaker 2: N.F.L. [National Football League] owner.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Clint Murchison flew to Baton Rouge the next week or a week, couple weeks, few days after that, took--I wasn't going back to New Orleans.  He took Rex Ingram back to New Orleans, went to the--to Brennan's, walked into Brennan's.  They tried to stop him.  He says I'm Clint Murchison and whatever--and I wanna see the manager or the owner or whatever.  Rex Ingram had dinner at Brennan's that day with Clint Murchison.
Speaker 1: That's what it takes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right--
Story_ID: 154287
Speaker 1: So that was another experience [while filming 'Hurry Sundown'].  One more was when they put, they put a bomb in the swimming pool, 'cause we would all swim in the pool.  As a matter of fact, [HM] Diahann Carroll's daughter Suzanne, I taught her how to swim.  I have a picture of, of all of us around the pool.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Rex Ingram, Diahann, little Suzanne who is not little anymore, big, gorgeous, beautiful Suzanne now.  But so one night Michael Caine is at the pool.  I don't know if he's swimming or not.  But all of a sudden there's this explosion.  Somebody put a bomb or threw a bomb or put a bomb next to the pool and blew a whole hole in the, in the pool.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  How dare these blacks, these whites swim in this pool, in this gorgeous, new hotel.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that was a, another one of the incidents.  There were many, many incidents like that in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: And how did Otto Preminger deal with, with this?  Course he had a affair with our friend--the black actress and singer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's her name, Carmen Jones--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Halle Berry played her, Dorothy Dandridge.
Speaker 2: Dandridge, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well no Otto, you know simply had the officials, you know try to give us some protection.  But it turned out there were Ku Klux Klan members in the cast, in the--as actors in the company.
Speaker 2: Right, extras.
Speaker 1: Extras.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah in the company, it's amazing.  And I mean you know they, they--and they were there for the whole shooting.  So they knew exactly where we were all the time, what we were doing.  And I'm sure were--I had an experience one night that was horrendous and I don't even wanna talk about it, where, where I was sleeping in my room.  I won't get into the--'cause it gets ugly, very ugly.  Where my door was kicked in.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And while I was sleeping.  And I ran out to find out what the noise was and the door was off the hinges, right.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And I saw these three idiots running away.  And on my door in human feces were--I said I wouldn't talk about it 'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's important for you talk about it.
Speaker 1: Nigger go home.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Nigger go home.  Now we've seen that in movies.  This happened to me.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And I, again the next day the sheriff--'cause I had to go get another room until they fixed this up.  And the sheriff came and we had reported it, but that was all, the report.
Speaker 2: Not--nothing beyond that.
Speaker 1: But anyway, that was an experience that I'll never forget and I write about that in my autobiography, incidentally.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 154288
Speaker 1: But that movie ['Hurry Sundown'], and then from that point on I was making movies in Hollywood [California] and the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] was going and going, you know, and I was on Broadway again in another Broadway play and then another one after that.  David Merrick hired me for, let's see-'Taste of Honey' [Shelagh Delaney] was a David Merrick play, '[The Resistible Rise of] Arturo Ui' [Bertolt Brecht] which was a kind of a takeoff on the, the whole Hitler thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I was in that, and then 'The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore' [Tennessee Williams].  I also costarred with Tula Bankhead in that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Tab Hunter and Ruth Ford and Conrad Mathire and I had, had opposite kind of kabuki type roles in that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I was doing Broadway play, movies, Broadway play, NEC, doing my thing.  But I was very buy during that--the decade of the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: I can remember 'Hurry Sundown' coming out and the acclaim that your part got.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And your performance got, got in that.  And--
Speaker 1: It was a good movie.  It was a good movie.  It was slow, but you know the story was slow.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it was a good movie, beautifully done.  Otto [Preminger] I thought did a wonderful job.
Speaker 2: Right--
Story_ID: 154289
Speaker 1: And for the first time we be--we were beginning to see blacks in costarring roles, meaningful, costarring roles with no production value cut out.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I think that was the important thing.  They were getting the--spending the same amount of money on the production.
Speaker 2: Well Sidney, Sidney [Poitier] did the breakthrough on that with his, with his wonderful films even before I did 'Hurry Sundown.'  So there was a great opening and I, I admire Sidney, I've always admired him.  And I still do, we're very, very good friends.  And watching Sidney--well first of all watching him on that stage when I first saw him in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], prompted me to move to New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: When I saw him.  I had never seen blacks on the stage, ever.  I saw a lot of plays when I was working, when I was studying in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But they were, there were no blacks.  I mean if there were blacks, they were maids or butlers or whatever.  But now all of a sudden I go to see this play that I had heard about, 'Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry], went to opening night of 'Raisin in the Sun.'  And saw these black actors on the stage.  I sat there and I cried.  I cried.  I said no, I gotta do this.
Speaker 1: [HM] Ossie Davis said that 'Raisin in the Sun' was the first Broadway play to allow a black to be assertive in that--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: The rest of them, the blacks, they had to play back to the white actors.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  But this was--and not only that, it was the first play, I mean the first serious drama that was written by a black, directed by a black, and all of the actors but one, the white actor who comes on and tries to get them to leave the community.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: A wonderful actor, Holland Chamberlain played the role.  John Fiedler played, who just passed away not long ago.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: John Fiedler was the original white gentleman from the, from the welcoming committee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The neighborhood welcoming committee.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: To--almost trying to bribe them to leave, you know.  And then Holland Chamberlain [ph.] came in and we--he toured with us on the road in that role.  But all these black actors blew me away.  And I went backstage afterwards and met people that would be my lifelong friends, two of whom were my--I mean they were just the dearest friends I've ever--like brothers to me, Lonne Elder [III].
Speaker 1: Lonne.
Speaker 2: And [HM] Douglas Turner Ward.  Now Sidney of course was--we weren't tight until later we became very good friends.  But, but that--seeing the play, this was before it even opened on Broadway, this was a tryout in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Lonne and Doug and I, I mean that's where I--we met backstage and they--
Speaker 1: They talked you into coming to New York.
Speaker 2: Talked me into coming to New York, I came to New York.  And what was the first play I did on Broadway?  'A Raisin in the Sun,' the play that prompted me to move.  It was an amazing story.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Just amazing, yeah--
Story_ID: 154290
Speaker 1: Following 'Hurry Sundown,' let's go where at 1967 you're trying to balance NEC [Negro Ensemble Company].
Speaker 2: It was a heck of a balancing act.
Speaker 1: And your film career.
Speaker 2: And plays.
Speaker 1: And, and your, and your play career.
Speaker 2: And my Broadway, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, did you go back to 'Where's Daddy?' [William Inge] or did you--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no 'Where's Daddy' had closed by that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was not a long run at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, 'Where's Daddy?' might have closed before I went to do--it might have closed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was one of those twenty-one performances, twenty-one and out I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, but I think, I know maybe three or four plays that I did on Broadway, including '[The Resistible Rise of] Arturo Ui' [Bertolt Brecht].  The--well 'The Milk Train [Doesn't Stop Here Anymore]' [Tennessee Williams] ran longer.  But 'Where's Daddy?' I think was a twenty-one performance thing and then they, they couldn't hang, so they, they gave, they gave it the pink slip.  But, but I was in and out of plays and going, doing television episodic out here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Coming out here to do episodic stuff.
Speaker 1: What was your first television appearance?
Speaker 2: My first television appearance was with Carroll O'Connor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In a, in a, in a, in a series that he did.  It wasn't really a series, I think it was Studio One, not Studio One, Playhouse 90.  It was one of those early Playhouse 90 type things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: With Carroll O'Connor and I can't remember who else, but his daughter was raped in Central Park or something.  I play, you know I play cops in it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my first television play I think.  It's just been so long ago.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But then, then there was a, a stint on 'East Side/West Side' with George C. Scott and Cicely Tyson.  I did a couple of those.  And then, and then I, I got my own series.  I got my own series and David Susskind saw me.  David Susskind saw me in a play and I can't remember which one it was.  It might--I can't remember which one it was, but I got a call from my, my agent saying that David Susskind wanted to, to see me.  But I was doing--David Susskind--I'm jumping ahead.  David Susskind saw me do, I think it was 'Hallelujah Baby' [Arthur Laurents].  This was the last play I did.  This was '69 [sic, 1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty, no, no this was in--this was earlier.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway, David Susskind saw me do something and, and cast me in, in my--in a television series called 'N.Y.P.D.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was--
Speaker 1: Okay, that's how we got up to N, 'N.Y.P.D.'  Up until that time though, you were doing plays and--
Speaker 2: Doing plays on Broadway.
Speaker 1: And running-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Running the NEC-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) N-- NEC.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 154291
Speaker 1: You, you're doing 'Hurry Sundown,' but you've been approached about a television series.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You, you had done some television, movie of the week type things and David Susskind had remembered what you had done.  So you are now approached about doing a pilot called 'N.Y.P.D.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How does that occur?  What, what leads up to that?
Speaker 2: Well New York Police Department, the New York Police Department had given David Susskind and ABC [American Broadcasting Company] the right to use all of their files, all of their stories, all of their cases and dramatize them for television.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was a first, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he, he wanted to have a black co-star in the film.  And--
Speaker 1: Did, did you ever find out why that was so important to them in this period?  It was a period of where people were trying to--
Speaker 2: It, it was the beginning of interracial, interracial couplings on all levels.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In the workplace, the [Greenwich] Village [New York, New York] was teeming with interracial relationships.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: ABC I think wanted to--David Susskind, not ABC, David Susskind sold the show to ABC.  But David wanted to create an interracial police team and, and so he--you know, that's, that's how it, it started.  And then ABC--I heard reluctantly said yes to David to make the pilot.  But once they saw the pilot, they agreed it's a wonderful concept, but we can't deal with you know, it's not being done right.  We gotta make it a half hour and not an hour.  We gotta bring in somebody that really understands production New York [New York] style, street, because eighty percent of our show, our show was shot on the streets of New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it had to be somebody with the artistic vision to use the New York streets, the real gritty New York stories, the, you know, the, the risque subject matter that they dealt with then that they don't even deal with now.
Speaker 1: Okay, such as?
Speaker 2: Well gay, gay, the gay, the whole gay relationships between men and women, actually.  You didn't do that on television.  So they brought in a guy, actually a, a brilliant producer and a, a artist, a painter, a sculptor, but a filmmaker named Robert Marquell, Bob Marquell.  And Bob Marquell who's still a friend to this day, was just brilliant.  And so, so, so we, we had our shows are gritty, hard hitting half hour drama that opened with that beat, that, that real beat and the stories just took over and, and we didn't think that we could do what we did in a half hour; tell the story in a half hour, and we did.  Very effective.
Speaker 1: Right, very effective because it was a hit show.
Speaker 2: And I loved it.  It was a hit show.  I loved it.  We got a lot of play, you know I mean I, you know I was received well by other television producers and film producers because of it-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 154292
Speaker 1: But starting that first series [N.Y.P.D.], they got rid of all of the leading actors except you.
Speaker 2: Right.  We did the pilot, and the pilot was done, there's an actor named Robert Viharo, Robert Viharo and I were the stars, the two stars.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we did the pilot, it was an hour pilot, color hour pilot.  And A.B.C. [American Broadcasting Company] loved the concept, but they didn't like the guy playing opposite me, who was really quite a wonderful actor and I'm very--but it wasn't working.  And he was kind of a rebel.  He didn't--the image wasn't there for them.  They wanted a blond, all American type guy.  So they fired--they picked up the pilot for a series, they said we'll keep Robert Hooks, but we're gonna get rid of everybody, the producers, the other actor and the other people, we're gonna get rid of them.  We're gonna bring this other people in, and that's when Marquell came in, Danny Melnick in.  Susskind brought in Danny Melnick and, and, and then Frank Converse.  And then they wanted--so Frank Converse and I, for the series, became the leads.  And then they brought in a veteran, they wanted a veteran to be in the, in the station house to give us our assignments and things.  And they brought in the brilliant actor, and the crazy, wonderful man, Jack Warden.  So Jack Warden was the lieutenant in the precinct.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it was Jack, Frank and I starring in the series.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how long did the series run?
Speaker 2: I think the series only ran about two big seasons, and I think we did a part of a third season, but they pulled the plug on us.
Speaker 1: Okay, I was thinking it was longer than that.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Any memorable incidents, negative or positive?
Speaker 2: No, I can't remem--I just that we--I--yeah there was one incident that was memorable.  I mean there were a lot of things that happened on this--we shot on the streets of New York [New York].  I mean we were all over the place.  But once we were on Twenty-third Street and we're shooting outside of a bank.  And Frank and I pull up in the car and we do whatever, whatever.  And you know there's always a crowd of people around.  So this little girl came up to me and she says, "you're Robert Hooks."  She said, "man, she said can I be in this?  Can I be in this movie?"  I said well you know that's not the way it works, but you know, what you can do is you can just work at--if you wanna be an actress, work at it, whatever, whatever.  I don't know what the conversation was, but her name was Caryn.  Caryn Johnson, Caryn was her first name, I think it was Caryn Johnson.  We'll have to check that.  So years later I--somebody tells me you gotta go see this comedian from San Francisco [California] who was up and working in San Francisco, but she's now performing in some club here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]  My manager wanted--'cause he was interested in trying to get to manager her, right.  So we went to see this comedian, it was Whoopi Goldberg.  It was Caryn from Twenty-Third Street, right.
Speaker 1: No kidding.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Caryn.  So I met Whoopi when she was Caryn on the streets of Chelsea [New York, New York], you know.  Now of course she, she was, she was a big--she, she heard--she went right through the roof.  I saw her before she became big, big, performing.  She had done San Francisco, she was down here performing.  And, and I went back stage and, and we talked about the fact that that's who she was.
Speaker 1: And she told you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause certainly you didn't remem--
Speaker 2: No, she said that's--I know you, right.  So anyway, that was one of the stories.  But I mean there are a lot of stories that happened in New York--
Story_ID: 154293
Speaker 1: Then I, I, I, I was asked-- [Joseph] Joe Papp cast me as Henry the Fifth in Shakespeare, New York Shakespeare Festival [later, Shakespeare in the Park, New York, New York].  And I had read the classics and studied the classics, but I had never done the classics.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So here I am, the first black Henry the Fifth ever on the New York Stage.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that was an experience.
Speaker 2: What--remember approximately guess at the year?
Speaker 1: I would say '68 [sic, 1965].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I would say '68 [1968].  But again these years--
Speaker 2: Right, not a problem.
Speaker 1: It was all in the decade of the '60s [1960s] I know for sure.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But unless I'm sitting down with my--you know--
Speaker 2: Not a problem.
Speaker 1: Manuscript.  But so I, I, I did--and this was all in the--Ellen Holly, the brilliant actress who also wrote a wonderful book about her life as well, she was on 'One Life to Live,' a series.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And her book was called 'One Life.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she was--she played opposite me.  She did a lot of Shakespeare in the park.  And she was the one that really told me that they were looking for a black actor to play Henry the Fifth.
Speaker 2: Joe Papp was willing to take that chance.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah he did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Joe Papp was extraordinary that way.  So I did it and it was a big success, and I, I was Henry the Fifth and it was--'cause it was really something special.
Speaker 2: And how long did it run?
Speaker 1: Well actually what we did, it's very interesting what we did with Henry the Fifth.  We didn't do it in the park.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We did it on that mobile unit that travels around the city.  Great idea, great concept.  Two big trailers, one opens out into this gorgeous stage, and the other truck was--had the lights and the sound.  And we'd just go to parks around the area and because Joe wanted to introduce Shakespeare.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: To the masses.
Story_ID: 154294
Speaker 1: Well at the same time we were doing--we were rehearsing to do 'Henry the Fifth' [William Shakespeare] on the mobile unit, it's called the Delacorte Mobile--well no, the Delacorte Theater is where they do Shakespeare, but this was a mobile unit, I can't remember the name.  But anyway it was the New York Shakespeare Festival.  I made a deal with Joe Papp.  I said you wanna get young people into the--into watch, into doing, to watching, to come to the park and see your Shakespeare.  I gotta group, he knew about the group.  The Group Theater Workshop.  And we have tons of material.  And what we can do is we can take this unit that we use at night, and we can go in the afternoons into the communities that we're gonna play at night, and we could put on the Group Theater Workshop on this stage, right.  He bought it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Not only did he buy it, I was able to get all of the actors, all of the members of my company paid because Joe Papp didn't do it any other way.  So now we're doing--so [HM] Barbara Ann Teer and I put together a whole afternoon of theater based on one poem, well actually the title of the thing was based on a Gwendolyn Brooks poem called 'We Real Cool' [Gwendolyn Brooks].  And We real cool, we left school, we--I can't remember the poem.  But it speaks right to the young people in the community.  So Joe Papp and [Bernard] Bernie Gersten is his administrator, thought it was a great idea.  I said, "but you gotta pay 'em, Joe, you gotta pay 'em, right."  And he was gonna pay 'em anyway.  So I was doing 'Henry the Fifth' at night with Ellen Holly and Roy Scheider and a lot of the people, and the kids were using the same stage to do 'We Real Cool' for the, for the kids in the community.  It was fabulous.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: It was fabulous.  So there I was playing Henry the Fifth at night, but directing and putting this thing on in the afternoon.
Speaker 2: Right, and we're talking about 1968 [sic, 1965].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, approximately.
Speaker 1: Around there-
Speaker 2: A--around there.
Story_ID: 154295
Speaker 1: That's, that's fine.  And Ellen Holly was, was in the play.
Speaker 2: Ellen Holly was, yeah we were doing--
Speaker 1: Opposite you.
Speaker 2: Right.  Ellen Holly was playing Katherine opp--opposite Henry [the Fifth].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was also playing 'Taming of the Shrew' 'cause we were alternating 'Henry [the Fifth]' [William Shakespeare] and 'Taming of the Shrew' [Williams Shakespeare]
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But Ellen, who turned out to be a lifelong friend, who is still a lifelong friend.  Who is just one of the, one of the most gracious and beautiful and talented people that I've ever met in my life.  She's just--
Speaker 1: Is she still in 'One Life to Live?'
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  She's retired from that a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: She's, she's now writing.
Speaker 1: I keep forgetting.
Speaker 2: She's writing, she's a brilliant writer.  She writes screenplays.
Speaker 1: We're talking about thirty-eight years ago.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: So we, we need to catch up I guess.
Speaker 2: No, and she's no longer doing soap operas, but she did it for a long time.  She did it for, you know she was one of the big, big stars, you know.  Just a gorgeous woman.
Speaker 1: I've never seen 'One Life to Live.'
Speaker 2: Right, right, but have you ever--do you know who I'm talking about?  Ellen?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: There's a book behind you on my bookshelf.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm gonna get it for you and I'm gonna show you who she is and you're gonna look at that picture and you're gonna say oh my gosh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's that gorgeous.  But anyway--
Story_ID: 154296
Speaker 1: The--now following in Joe Papp, which one of the--your varied roads did you travel?  Was it television--you're still obviously doing the administrative direction for--in fact the full direction for--
Speaker 2: For the N.E.C. [Negro Ensemble Company].
Speaker 1: NEC.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But which way did your career take you following Joe Papp?
Speaker 2: Well I, you know I, I just--that's the only play I did for Joe Papp.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the only play I--Joe and I became buddies.  He was very supportive of the Group Theater Workshop.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Even before, even before we--I made the deal with him to, to, to have them do this, the, the tour with us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was a fan of the concept.  They all respected me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's why [HM] Harry [Bellefonte] and Sidney [Poitier] became my friends because they respected what I had done; bringing these kids off the street, creating opportunities for these young kids who had no guidance.
Speaker 1: Opening an avenue for them.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly, and it all--it paid off.  I mean the kids that came--the young artists that came through the Group Theater Workshop into the Negro Ensemble Company and into the profession, it's, it's, it's fantastic and, and there are a lot of them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: A lot of them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But the Joe Papp thing was, you know Joe, and rest his beautiful soul, he's gone now.  But he was one of the pioneers, he was, he, he, he was one of the first casting blacks in non-black roles, called nontraditional casting.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was one of the first, and he did it all the time.  James Earl Jones and Ellen Holly were two of his favorite actors that worked a lot of Shakespeare with him.
Speaker 1: And later we're going to meet with another one by the name of [HM] Roscoe Lee Brown.
Speaker 2: My goodness, he's got a birthday coming up too.
Story_ID: 154297
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Let's, let's go on from, from there because we still are in 1968.
Speaker 2: Gosh, you believe we're just in '68 [1968] Scott?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My goodness.
Speaker 1: The, the--did you, you were running back and forth between Hollywood [California] doing films also.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you have a television series going?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I'll give you an example of how I did what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.
Speaker 2: I would do 'N.Y.' [N.Y.P.D.]--I'd get up early in the morning and go to the studio down in the East Village [New York, New York], now far from the St. Mark's Playhouse, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We'd shoot 'N.Y.P.D.' all over the city, whatever.  I'd go back to the studio, change my clothes.  I would then drive to the theater, the Martin Beck Theater where I was doing 'Hallelujah Baby' [Arthur Laurents], okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There would be a masseuse that I had hired waiting for me in my dressing room with his table all laid out.  And I would go in my dressing room, take off and get into my--before my costume things, and this guy would beat me up.  He would beat me up on that table, it was great.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And then he would leave, I'd put on my costume and I'd go out and play 'Hallelujah Baby' where I sang like crazy with Leslie Uggams.
Speaker 1: Okay, right I remember when she was in that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Leslie Uggams and I and Allen Case, and what's the wonderful actress whose name escapes me now, now.  Played the mother, played Leslie's mother.  But yeah, and there's an album that people don't know that I sing, there's an album.  It's called 'Hallelujah Baby.'
Speaker 1: Some of the songs that you sang in that because I wasn't aware of your singing career.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  One of the, one of the--my favorites was 'Watch my Dust.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a kind of an up-tempo tune that I sang.  "Watch my dust.  Gonna start in grooving.  Stoke the engine.  You've got a man in mind, I'm gonna be that kind of man (singing).  So stroke the," whatever, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But it--but that was one of the--my favorites.  But I--there were several songs that I sang.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Duos with Leslie and, but Leslie was brilliant.  I mean she was in top form singing in that play.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 154298
Speaker 1: You're, you're still a dad and you got your son coming up on weekends.
Speaker 2: Got Kevin [Hooks], Kevin with Yvonne--my first wife would put Kevin on a bus on like Friday in the middle of the day, maybe Friday morning.  And she--and he would--and she'd put him on the Greyhound and I would meet him at the Greyhound bus terminal and we would spend the weekends together.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And this is between all of the things I was doing.  So Kevin was right there.  He was right there backstage at the plays.
Speaker 1: Give us an example of those weekends with you and, you and Kevin together.
Speaker 2: I mean yeah, I mean I, I would--he would be on the set.
Speaker 1: Okay, Saturday morning you'd--
Speaker 2: Saturday morning, well Saturday morning we would--he would be either at the theater or we'd go to the park.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We'd do our little father/son thing.  But I--remember I got performances.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: On Saturday afternoon, more than likely Saturday afternoon and Saturday night.  He would be in my dressing room, he would be out in the theater, he'd be in the wings.  He would be at the N.E.C. [Negro Ensemble Company] in the office if I'm there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Sometimes when he's on vacation, he would spend the vacation with me from school, and he would do everything with me.  When we were planning the N.E.C. for instance, Kevin would be with me.  He would be sitting at a table with Lonne Elder [III], Frances Foster, [HM] Douglas Turner Ward, Gerald Krone, Moses Gunn, myself.  And we'd just be talking theater, talking theater.  And all of a sudden I look over and Kevin is, Kevin is sleep.  But he didn't sleep a lot, he took in a lot.  He was soaking it up.  That's why people, when people talk about Kevin being this phenomenal young actor, Kevin is a producer, Kevin is a director, Kevin understands actors, he works with actors, actors love to work with him and they respect him.  People on the set, they come and they look for the director, then they see Kevin, they don't think he's the director.  He looks like he's--still looks like he's twenty-five and he's like, you know forty-eight years old now.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: He still looks young because just, just Kevin, right.  And they wouldn't, wouldn't think until he opened his mouth.  When he opened his mouth, he knew exactly where he wanted his camera, he worked well with his camera people, his crew, everybody loves to work with him.  All of that is the stuff that he--the professionalism that he soaked up when he was coming with me, with me and I'd send him back and he couldn't wait to get back up there with me.  And then eventually he--we, when I moved to Washington, D.C., he moved, came up with--and to live with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], or came down to live with me 'cause I was at that time living in Washington.  But anyway you're--
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154299
Speaker 1: Let's fill in between '68 [1968] and your coming down to Washington [D.C.].  I say coming down because of course I was there at that time.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And is there anything we should fill in there?
Speaker 2: Well, well yeah because what happened was I was--there were riots in 1968 after, you know after the, you know the assassinations.  And I'd go back to Washington, D.C., which is my hometown.  I'd go back to Washington to see my folks.  And I--now the N.E.C. [Negro Ensemble Company] is very successful, tremendously successful.  We were successful bringing white audiences in, creating a black theater going audience that had never seen plays, are now continually coming to see plays.  So it was a great experience culturally that I saw us accomplish in New York [New York].  And I thought boy--I go back home to Washington, D.C. and I see the Fourteenth Street is burned out, U Street is half burned out.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My community is looking in shambles because of the riots.  Something needed to happen in Washington, D.C., and I thought why don't I build a theater company in the community?  Not downtown, in the black community.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Having an ability to bring white audiences in, but still have it in the black community so it would be their theater like the N.E.C. was our theater.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I talked to [HM] Douglas [Turner Ward] and told him what I wanted to do and he said hey, you know, like we got everything under control here.  So--'cause I told him I wanna make a move.  The N.E.C.'s going fine, you guys got it.  I mean it's wonderful.  You don't even need me.  I'm here because I wanna be here.  But I spent a lot of time in Hollywood [California] and I'm doing plays here and plays there anyway.  So I said I wanna go to Washington, D.C. and I wanna build something like this.  I wanna build a company in the community to create outlets for these young, talented people to move into the profession.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Actors, writers, designers, directors, choreographers, dancers.  But at the same time, do something for the community to help the community build itself back up after this, this terrible you know situation, racial, civil rights situation.  So I agreed with Doug that I would make this move and he said fine, I'm with you all the way.  So I moved back to Washington, D.C. in 1969, close to '70 [1970].
Story_ID: 154300
Speaker 1: And got to work building the foundation for a theater company very much like modeled on the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which meant first I had to get a board of directors that understood where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do, and that would be with me and back me all the time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I put together, I had met some wonderful people.  I was a "celebrity" and people knew that I-Nixon [Richard Nixon] invited me to the White House.  Jack Valenti threw a big party for me, hometown boy comes back to build cultural institution, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Right.  Can you remember some of the names of your initial board of directors?
Speaker 1: Sure, sure.  Jim Gibson.  I think you probably know Jim Gibson.  Jim Gibson, Marie Barksdale, Clifford Mason, Clifford, not Clifford Mason, Clifford, the great attorney, Alexander.
Speaker 2: Alexander.
Speaker 1: Clifford Alexander was on my board.  Owen Dotson was on my board at the time from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Several other people whose names escapes me right now.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 1: But I wanted to put together a group of people that were gonna help me build this company and sustain this company, not just let it be a flash in the pan, fly by night organization.  So what happened was I, I put together this, this group, this board.  I met--started meeting and I had to raise the money.  I'd put together the plan for this company.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I had to now go present this proposal to foundations in order to get some financing.  It wasn't like the Ford Foundation.  The Ford Foundation wouldn't even talk to me, you know, you should be back in New York [New York] with the Negro Ensemble Company.  So had to be local foundations.  It was an Agnes and Eugene Myer Foundation.
Speaker 2: Washington Post.
Speaker 1: Right.  Went to them, laid my proposal out.  They respected the fact that I came back home.  I gave a--my agent would call me, say "what are you doing in Washington, D.C.?"  Billy Dee Williams is getting all the work.  We need you out here, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I said hey, look, I gotta do what I gotta do and you know, I'm still working.  I mean I don't work as much as I--because of what I'm doing.  But I still was able to pop out and do a movie here, television show there.  But I had to do this.  This is my hometown, I had done it successfully in Washington [D.C.], in, in New York.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I saw how communities came together, black, white, brown, yellow, came together sharing black culture.  Sharing these black stories, these black plays that they would never see anywhere else.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Right.  So they're--so anyway long story short, I get a--the first grant of like 30,000 dollars.  And I go after my talent, right.  There was a guy in New York, in Washington that I was looking for a Douglas Turner Ward.  I was looking for an artistic director.  I could be an artistic director, but that's not my stick.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I, I'm a producer.  I, I'm a developer.  I, I, I'm a executive, you know, developer.  I can bring--
Speaker 2: Bring the parts together.
Speaker 1: I can bring 'em together and I can, can make 'em work.  But I, you know, so I know what I can do.  I know my, you know, my good attributes and my, my not so good attributes.  So I was looking and I, I was told that there was this guy.  And I had met this guy early on, but I didn't know.  He was working for the National Endowment for the Arts.  And he had started an organization, a part that is in the National Endowment to reach out to the community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so I met this guy, Vantile Whitfield was his name.
Story_ID: 154599
Speaker 1: Robert where we left off last time, you had come to [Washington] D.C., you wanted to get the D.C. [Black] Rep [Repertory] Theater going.  You had found some initial funding and you had met Vantile Whitfield.
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay so now we're in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The D.C. Black Repertory Company is on everybody's lips.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean hometown boy comes home to build a theater company, a cultural institution for the company, a la the New York [New York] trip.  I wanted to come back to do it because I had done it successfully in New York and I saw the results of having a cultural institution in the community, especially in Washington [D.C.] at this time because it was right after the riots.  And I had been, I had been coming back to Washington like on the weekends, seeing the devastation and realizing we can do something here to kind of help bring this community back.
Speaker 1: Just to remind our audience, what kind of things did you see might change in the Washington, D.C. area as a result of a successful D.C. black repertory theater?
Speaker 2: What I saw was in, was the--well first of all, the Fourteenth Street corridor was almost burned down.  I mean the, the, the riots just created such a, a terrible, terrible blight on, on the city.  And I thought that if we could come back and build something in the community, a cultural institution, a theater company like I had done in New York with [HM] Douglas [Turner Ward] and Gerry [Gerald Krone], then maybe we can lift the, the spirit of the people up, and indeed we did.
Story_ID: 154600
Speaker 1: So I'm now looking for, I had gotten some initial monies from the Eugene and Agnes Myer Foundation.  Nothing like the Ford Foundation grant that we got when we were, when we were in New York [New York] for the N.E.C. [Negro Ensemble Company], but this was like a 30,000 dollar grant to get me started and you know, start recruiting people.  One of the people that I wanted so desperately was a, an artistic director.  I was the executive director, and I'm good at doing that.  But artistic director, although I'm artistic and creative, I knew after working with [HM] Douglas Turner Ward at the Negro Ensemble Company, you had, I had to find me a Douglas Turner Ward in New--in Washington, D.C.  I had, I had known Vantile, but I didn't know what he was doing and somebody said why don't you talk to Vantile Whitfield, he's over at the N.E.A., the National Endowment for the Arts, and he's running a program over there for minorities and whatever.  So I call Vantile and we hooked up and I told him--well he of course knew what, what was happening.  And I asked him if he would entertain joining the [Washington] D.C. Black Repertory Company as the artistic director, serving the kind of purpose for us as Douglas did in New York.  And he was happy to do so.  He was happy that I was there.  He knew a lot of things about Washington that I didn't know at the time, culturally, artistically, 'cause he was at the N.E.A.  So he joined the D.C. Black Repertory Company as the artistic director.  And then we started recruiting a staff, artistic staff.  And we wanted a permanent company.  And Vantile and I and the rest of the people that we had brought on, started interviewing actors and, and the like, you know, dancers, choreographers, directors, writers, people that we wanted to be a part of this new company.  So that was how Vantile and I came together.  He was invaluable to the company.  He was the Douglas Turner Ward.  And I even called him that, and he didn't mind it at all.  I said what we had in New York, I know we can get here.  But I need a Douglas Turner Ward, and so I went after Vantile Whitfield.  And he understood where I was coming from and it turned out just great.  He worked out just fine as the artistic director.
Story_ID: 154601
Speaker 1: The funding, did you get additional funding before starting your first project, and what was your first project?
Speaker 2: Well yes, we had to, we had to raise more money.  I mean the first grant was thirty thousand dollars didn't, didn't do much.  We had to raise a lot more money.  And when I put the board together along with Vantile [Whitfield], people like Jim Gibson, there were some wonderful people on the board whose names escape me, but we can get the names of those people.  I think you know most of them too.  We were able to then start raising funds from other foundations, corporations, and just local organizations that wanted to be a part of seeing something like the D.C. Black Repertory Company work in this town, and we did.  And we created it.  The first production was--the first production at the, at the D.C. Black Repertory Company was--I'm drawing a blank.  I'm drawing--it was--most of the, the plays that we did in the season, original season, were original plays.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And 'Changes'[Vantile Whitfield] I believe was the name of it.  And Vantile wrote it as a matter of fact.  And a composer from Louisiana did the music.  It was a musical.  It was called 'Changes' and Vantile [Whitfield] wrote it and I got, I had done a movie down south in Louisiana called 'Hurry Sundown' with Otto Preminger.  And I had met this incredible musician--actually he was a dentist, that was his profession.  But he was also a composer and an arranger, and he had a group.  They did some work, some singing as a matter of fact in the, in the movie.  And his name was Valerian Smith.  And Valerian Smith wrote the music for this play that we opened with.  And his daughter was also in the company.  Now I had met his daughter when I did the movie, I guess it was three or four years before that, in Louisiana.  I had met his daughter, her name was Lynn Smith, right.  And Lynn had since come to Washington [D.C.], went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and we recruited her out of Howard University to be an actress in the company.  And she eventually married Vantile and became Lynn Whitfield, and that's the Lynn Whitfield that we know in movies today.  So she was out of the D.C. Black Repertory Company, out of the original company that I brought in from Howard University.  And she married Vantile and they were married for, for a while.
Story_ID: 154602
Speaker 1: So that's how the D.C. Black Repertory Company started.  We were very successful.  There's a key element in this that I have to mention because when I first came to Washington [D.C.], we had no place.  We didn't even have the grant yet.  And there was a man that I met there who became the heart and soul of what the D.C. Black Repertory Company was all about, and he knew nothing about theater.  He was an entrepreneur, he was a man, his name was Ed Murphy.  He's a very, very famous local hero, actually.  I met this man and I tell you, the, the D.C. Black Repertory Company would not have existed had he not been so gracious.  He gave me a building.  He had a building next to his nightclub, he had a club [Ed Murphy's Supper Club] up on Georgia Avenue.  And there was a building there.  He used it for storage or whatever.  And I--he said--I was in, in his restaurant one night and he got the keys and he said come here, I wanna show you something.  He took me next door and he opened this building.  It was just a little place.  It was a nice place, though, right.  And I said wow, this is fantastic.  He said it's yours.  Just like that, it's yours.  You don't have to give me anything.  This can be your office.  You're starting this company.  I know you need a place to have an office and a staff and recruit the talent from around the city.  He gave us a building next to him.  Ed Murphy.  And he did a lot else too.  We won't go into all the stuff, but he was one of the heroes for me as I started this Washington, D.C. venture, the D.C. Black Repertory Company.  So Ed Murphy, if I had to put a plaque on the wall, and I did put a plaque on the wall.  But it was a plaque of my brother Charles who always wanted to see a cultural institution in Washington, D.C.  So I put that plaque, I have the plaque here.  I put that plaque in the lobby.  If I would think about it at the time, I would have put another plaque up for Ed Murphy.  He was that important in the scheme of things.  So now we're in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 154603
Speaker 1: First year and the first year [of the D.C. Black Repertory Company] is very successful, right?
Speaker 2: Very successful first year in Washington, D.C.  We--our audiences were--we, we were hoping to get fifty-fifty black/white and you know.  It turned out that, it turned out to be far more than that, it was like seventy-five/twenty-five black, right.  Seventy five percent of our audiences were black.  People that had never been to the theater before in their lives.  We got those people out because we were now this black cultural institution in the community, their community.  And they supported it.  Unlike New York [New York], because in New York, it took us a while to build the black audience.  The white audiences were there because New York's a theater town and of course you know, if it's there, you can go get 'em.  It took us a while to build and after a while we were mainly a black audience.  It was mainly, turned out to be mainly like New, like Washington [D.C.] was, seventy-five/twenty-five.  So we built a wonderful audience and you know without going through season by season, we were a successful company.  We built an amazing audience in [Washington] D.C.  We ran into some financial problems.  The grants stopped coming in.  We lost a lot of our initial bourgeois supporters, the Sixteenth Street crowd that were happy to see this hometown movie star come back, this celebrity come back to build a theater company.  They were hoping it was gonna be downtown.  They were hoping it was gonna be in southwest.  I didn't want it there.  I put it in Georgia, on Georgia Avenue right in the community.  And unfortunately, a lot of those people ran away from us.  And that created--
Speaker 1: Let's explain to our audience when you say the Sixteenth Street crowd, you're talking about a group that live in an area called the Gold Coast.
Speaker 2: The Gold Coast, the Gold Coast is in the Sixteenth Street area, but it takes in more than Sixteenth Street.  And they're very successful for the most part, I say bourgeois, but a middle class or upper middle class black professionals who have, have done wonderful things for Washington, D.C. and were happy to see this happen.  But they were not the kind of crowd--they would get in their cars and they would drive past--they would drive real quick through that area to get downtown.  They would not stop on Georgia Avenue and Farragut Street where we were because they just didn't want to participate in that kind of, you know--I, you know, it just puzzled me to no end.
Speaker 1: So they never came or they came the first year and then they didn't come.
Speaker 2: Some of them came and some of them kept coming because they, you know, there were some people that just thought it was a wonderful thing.  But the support from that group, that crowd, died away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and they didn't support it.  Some of them are board members, some of whom were a part of the Sixteenth Street crowd.  Hate saying crowd because it's--but they were wonderful people, they supported us.  But they didn't support us the way they should have supported us.  And so we found ourselves in financial straits in the second, in the third--first and second year were okay.  We were able to--because it was new.  Then after the second season into the third, fourth season, we started running into financial trouble and we never really recuperated from it.  And after a while, even though we had tremendous success in the first two seasons, I found that I had other things I had to do and I, I had not planned to stay there forever anyway.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 154604
Speaker 1: So I had put together a good, strong group, including Vantile [Whitfield].  So I eventually in 1977, I had remarried and had a little baby boy and I was not going to raise that little baby boy on the East Coast.  I wanted to move out to the West Coast, and I'm in love with the west coast; I always was.  Los Angeles [California] just has something special for me.  So I left the D.C. Black Repertory Company in good hands, and they actually lasted for a few more seasons.
Speaker 2: When you left the D.C. Repertory Theater was what, five years old?
Speaker 1: When I left, I left in--I came in '70 [1970] and I left in '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: I built the company in '71 [1971] we were off the ground and so about six years.
Speaker 2: About six years.
Speaker 1: Six years.
Speaker 2: And during that period, you were going back and forth to Hollywood [California] doing various projects in Hollywood.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes I was still working as an actor, as I was in New York [New York] when I built the [Washington] D.C.--the New York, the N.E.C. [Negro Ensemble Company].  I always was working and unfortunately for my family, I had to go to work, make a movie, come back and spend some of the money I made trying to sustain this cultural institution, and I did.  We didn't go broke or anything like that, but I ended up putting money that I would make in the movies and in television, back into the company for the time that I was there.
Speaker 2: Okay, hoping that the community itself would eventually provide more support.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  And not, not necessarily the, the ticket buyers, because you didn't--the people that were coming and buying tickets were people that couldn't afford to make donations to the, to the health of the company itself.  So we, you know we, we, we couldn't get the kind of grants that we could anymore.  So you know I, I decided that I would come to Los Angeles and do my thing out here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Produce, film and television, which is what I wanted to do in making that move anyway.  So the D.C. Black Repertory Company was left in good hands and it's still going, as a matter of fact.  We're in 2006, and it's still going.  And the Negro Ensemble Company is still going.  I'm happy to say both those important cultural institutions that I started are still going and we're in 2006 right now.
Speaker 2: Right.  So 29 years later, that seed that you planted is still, still going.
Speaker 1: Yes, still going strong.  Well strong I don't know, still going.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now 1977 you come out to Hollywood [California].  You move your residence to Hollywood and what do you start doing?  What are some of the projects that you are now doing in 1977?
Speaker 1: Well I came out, when I came out '77 [1977] with Rosie Lee, my, my second wife and Robert Junior, the last edition of the Hooks tribe.  We moved out here and I was really basically acting in--mostly in television, still doing films as well.  My son Kevin [Hooks] was living out here already at the time.  And, and, and so mainly I, I came out to produce film and television.  I wanted to get into producing film and television.  So I started developing projects on my own as I would do a television here, a television movie there, a feature film here, a feature film there, my career was going pretty good as an actor.  And but I was concentrating a lot of my energies on building you know a, a good, strong what do you call it--base for a film and television producing career.  I started Robert Hooks Productions.  Well actually I'd already started Robert Hooks Productions in New York [New York].  That's, I mean that's how I produced the first play that ended up being a, being a, you know, the beginnings of the Negro Ensemble Company.  So Robert Hooks Productions out here, I was just developing and, and trying to get movies off the ground and things like that, but working as an actor in the meantime and raising Robert, Junior, who has turned out to be a filmmaker himself, and has graduated from the University of Northridge [California State University, Northridge, Los Angeles, California] in film and is doing fine.  And of course Kevin's doing fine.  So the kids are doing great.
Story_ID: 154605
Speaker 1: Right.  Let's just you know get, get into that a, a little bit.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Let's start with Kevin [Hooks] who obviously is one of the most prolific people in the business.  But he started as an actor as a kid.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  Well I'll talk a little bit about Kevin and his, and his career because Kevin, who started acting in New York [New York] when he was like eight years old, I think maybe nine years old.  Lonne Elder [III], the great writer and dear friend and colleague who's now gone, Lonne was writing an episode for 'N.Y.P.D.', which was the series that I was co-starring with Jack Warden and Frank Converse in for A.B.C. [American Broadcasting Company]  An Lonne wrote this screenplay, I mean this episode.  And he wrote a part in it for Robbie.  He liked Ro--I mean for Kevin.
Speaker 1: For Kevin.
Speaker 2: For Kevin.  He liked Kevin and Kevin showed that he had some talent.  So I convinced the, the suits at A.B.C. and Robert, Robert Marquell and Danny Melnick were the producers and, and dear friends.  So I said you know, let's let Kevin do this role.  Well Kevin got the role and he was playing opposite another actor who was doing his first acting job.  This actor's name was Al Pacino.  And so Kevin made his film debut opposite Al Pacino--a little scene.  And from that point on, Kevin's acting career took off.  He was hired to do a Christmas series for I believe C.B.S. [Columbia Broadcasting System] and it was a thing called 'JT' written by--
Speaker 1: Okay, this was still back in New York.
Speaker 2: This was in New York.  This was in New York, that's right.  So I'm just kind of moving him out here.  So he did 'JT,' and that was successful.  And then of course they cast him when Lonne wrote 'Sounder' for--can't remember the studio.  But anyway, when he wrote 'Sounder' it was Kevin who got the role with Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield and also my other son Eric.  Eric was also the brother.  So I had two kids, two of my sons in this movie.  So now Kevin is a movie star.  And he's living in Los Angeles.  He had actually come out and he was living with Lonne for a while, while I was still back in Washington, D.C.  And he was living with Lonne Elder, his wife Judyann, who was also a member of the Negro Ensemble Company.  And so Kevin was living out here and working as an actor.  So he started just getting role after role.  One of the key roles he got was a thing called the 'White Shadow.'  It was a, a television series about a basketball, high school basketball team.  And Kevin was one of the stars of that.  And that was a very successful series.  And at the end of--the last season of that series, Kevin wanted his--he had another interest.  He wanted to direct.  He wanted to become a director.  He wanted to act, but he also wanted to become a director.  So they, they meaning the two producers of that, of that show.
Speaker 1: 'The White Shadow.'
Speaker 2: Bruce Paltrow, whose daughter Gwyneth is now a big star, and, and one of the--can't think of the other guy's name, whose father was a big--but anyway they had a lot of confidence in Kevin.  So they allowed Kevin to come into editing, they allowed Kevin to observe other directors.  And after a while, they let him direct--actually he did not direct any of 'The White Shadow' because he was scheduled to direct like the fifteenth episode in the last season, but they cut it off at the thirteenth episode.  So Kevin was not allowed.  But those two producers also produced a show called 'St. Elsewhere,' which was a series starring Denzel Washington.  And they allowed Kevin to make his directorial debut in 'St. Elsewhere.'  And that's when he started directing for television.
Speaker 1: Now how old was Kevin at this time?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm, I'm not sure, but if I had to guess, I would say he was around twenty-one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Around twenty-one, yeah, he had--
Speaker 1: And he was entering his directorial--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That was his directorial debut.
Speaker 2: That was it. And once--
Speaker 1: 'St. Elsewhere.'
Speaker 2: 'St. Elsewhere' was his directorial debut.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 154606
Speaker 1: And once he [Robert Hooks' son, Kevin Hooks] directed his episode of 'St. Elsewhere,' then his agents were able to show his episode to all of the other shows.  So he started directing a lot of television at that time.  And then feature films also grabbed him to do--I think his first feature film was--they were doing a, a movie with Tommy Davidson and Halle Berry.  Halle Berry and Tommy Davidson were doing a movie called--can't remember the title of it.  Something about, about business, something business.  But anyway the director that was doing that, they saw the first two days of dailies and they didn't--they fired the guy and they wanted to bring a director in.  Well Kevin [Hooks] was hot, so they said well what about this Kevin Hooks guy?  So they brought Kevin Hooks in to direct this particular movie and that was the beginning of his feature film career.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then after that he did 'Passenger 57' with Wesley Snipes.  He did a thing called 'Fled' with Laurence Fishburne and Steven Baldwin.  And a couple of other features after that.  But anyway he became a--so he was the hot director in town.  And he started doing pilots for series.  Now we flash forward to today, because Kevin's career is Kevin's career; it's been very successful.  Needless to say, I'm happy and proud of him.  Now he is the Executive Producer of a television series called 'Prison Break' which is a big hit series on Fox Network, Fox Television.  And he is not just the Executive Producer of that show, but he also directs like every third or fourth episode of that.  He's been very successful as a director and now as a producer in television.  So he and I started a film company.  We decided that it's time for us to do something together.  So we started a film company, and the company was called Rock Creek Entertainment.  Rock Creek from Rock Creek Park, which is where I used to take him, snagging, fishing under the P Street Bridge.  We've not produced anything out of that yet, but we hope to.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that's, that's Kevin.  He's doing very, very well and I'm very proud of him, needless to say.  And Robert Junior [Robert Hooks, Jr.] who has now graduated from college.  Who's now like--they're all--I mean Kevin is--I won't tell you how old these guys are.  But they, you know they're no longer kids.  And Robert Junior is now developing his own projects.  He's working as a production assistant on commercials to make a living, but he's now writing movies and you know, one day soon I'm sure, he'll be produced as well.
Speaker 2: I just wanna briefly go back just to set the calendar on that.  And 'St. Elsewhere,' his first--Kevin's first directorial.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: What, what year was that and had you moved out here then?
Speaker 1: I was, I was living out-'St. Elsewhere,' no I--yeah, I was living out here.  I'm not sure of the year of 'St. Elsewhere.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure of the year, Paul.  We'll have to look that up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll have to look that up, I'm not sure.  I'm bad on years.  I'm bad on mem--my memory's not that great anyway.
Speaker 2: It's, it's okay.  I just wanted to set that calendar for, for the audience.  But, but that's, that's okay.  Not, not a problem.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  If I had to take a guess at it, it would be in the late '70s [1970's].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So right after you moved out here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I would say the late '70s [1970s] he started directing, and that's where we would go with 'St. Elsewhere.'  Now I could be off a year or two, or three or four, I'm not sure.  But yeah, I was living out here at the time.
Story_ID: 154309
Speaker 1: We're starting Rock Creek Productions.
Speaker 2: Rock Creek Entertainment.
Speaker 1: Enter--entertainment.
Speaker 2: (Pause) Yeah so you know Kevin [Hooks] and I decided we were gonna start this company and we did, Rock Creek Entertainment, and we have our own company now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We haven't done anything yet because I'm still working on projects with my Robert Hooks Productions and also with my fiance, Lorrie Marlow.  Lorrie Marlow is a writer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And she and I are working on several projects, two feature film projects, two books.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we're writing together.
Speaker 1: One of them is your autobiography.
Speaker 2: Is my autobiography, 'Life For Me: At the Crossroads of Politics, Culture, Civil Rights Movement.'  That's the subtitle.  But 'Life for Me' is the name of my autobiography.  And it is in the--right now it's in proposal form at the agents, we have an agent in New York and we're trying to sell the book.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the second book is a book called 'Blackbusters:  Hollywood, the Last Plantation.'  And it's my experience working in Hollywood with blacks and whites in the industry.  The problems that blacks and other minorities have getting over, mainly dealing in image, employment and distribution.  And image, employment, distribution are the three main themes, but then we write around that.  Based on my experiences working with the industry, working with the suits in the industry, working with the black successful people in the industry that we've been trying to do things together and--
Story_ID: 154310
Speaker 1: One of the major questions I wanted to ask you this morning was--and this leads right into it.  What do you see as the major problems of why the studios and major producers have frozen blacks and black lifestyles out of the industry?
Speaker 2: Well they haven't frozen black lifestyle out of the industry; they've only frozen the interesting black lifestyle, the more positive, the more dignified, the more prestigious im--images.  What they have done is, because now we have a new ilk of black entertainer.  And they're called the rap artists.  And I have nothing against the rap artists, I think that they're able to be successful, god bless 'em.  I don't particularly like the form of music myself, but those people have now, those blacks have now become green, green lighted by the industry to produce movies in their experience.  And their experience is a limited experience.  I mean you can't tell them that.  They feel they're speaking form the street.  Speaking, you know, we don't know what they're talking about.  If we object to them using the "N-word" and the MF word and the, the pimps and the hoes and, and you know all those things, that we don't know, you know, this is from their experience.  Well their experience is limited, let's face it.  So yes, the industry has isolated that ilk because it works for them.  They sell tickets to the young people who like rap and like that culture.  Young blacks and whites, you know, blacks, whites and other minorities.
Story_ID: 154311
Speaker 1: You and your son Kevin [Hooks] have started the Rock Creek Entertainment film business and is this because of the frustrations that you've met out here, and you've been out here a long time as, as Kevin, that you face when you go to pitch ideas to the studios and you don't get an understanding, any understanding from some of the suits that you meet?
Speaker 2: Well that's really not why Kevin and I started this company.  Kevin and I started Rock Creek Entertainment because we wanted to have a production company together.  He has his production company, Hooks Films Unlimited, or Limited rather, and I have my production company, Robert Hooks Productions.  But we wanted to do something together just father and son production team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But as it relates to the industry, so anyway we, we have that company and we're developing projects, but we haven't really tried to sell anything yet.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I did wanna get into the industry, so go ahead.
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay so but anyway, the industry itself is--I mean you know they--it's the tradition in the industry as it relates to the decision makers accepting projects related to African American lifestyle.  They've never really been that good at selecting material.  They select material, they meaning the executives, the creative executives in charge of selecting material for the independents, for the studios and for the networks.  They just don't know the culture.  So they rely on people to let 'em know what's right and what's wrong, and they're not getting good advice.  So we don't get the product out there that needs to be out there.
Story_ID: 154312
Speaker 1: The Hollywood industry has for years and years just failed to understand the stories that the black community feel is important for them to tell.  Some of it has been ignorance on, on their part and other has been deliberately not paying attention.  I would like to get your feelings on why this has been such a long struggle to get good black experience films to the public.
Speaker 2: Well first of all, the Hollywood machine, which includes the film companies, the studios, the television networks, now the cable companies, the industry we'll call it.
Speaker 1: (Off-Camera Conversation)
Speaker 2: The industry.  They're not interested in doing good, positive black material.  They're just not interested in doing it.  And I think I can say that safely because I've been in this business for a long time.
Speaker 1: Why do you think they're not interested?
Speaker 2: It's not their culture, it's ours.  They're in the majority, we're in the minority.  We look to them to create outlets for us.  They're the ones that green light the projects, so they green light what they want to green light.  So they're not going to go out of their way to look for good, strong, quality black material that can be as entertaining, as profit making as any of the others.  They're not going to go looking for that.  So the people that they look to to bring them product are the people that they are in bed with, so to speak.  So they're not going to get the kinds of quality product that I wanna do and that filmmakers and producers like myself who want to, to turn the page on the black image to show the other side of the African American experience.  Doing so not to bore people with you know, with just the other side.  We wanna do entertaining movies.  We know the movies that we wanna do are entertaining and are profit, and can be profit making.  So it's not about them accepting something that's going to lose money for them.  But they're not interested in the kinds of pro--projects that we bring to them, we the independent black producers, bring to them.  The real problem is not necessarily the industry itself, but the problem is that the, the black success stories that happen in our industry, and we know who they are.  There are a lot of success stories.  Let's just say there are twenty black success stories.  Twenty black artists that can get projects done at the studios and at the networks.  Let's say there are twenty of them.  I can't get my--and they're all looking for projects.  But because they know the kinds of things that the networks, that the industry wants, they, they don't want me to come to them either, you see.  I can't go to the studios and the networks, and I also can't go to them, them being the African American success stories.  I won't call any names, but they're out there.  And so I don't blame the industry itself for the lack of progress as it relates to black image and black employment and black distribution and all.  I blame also those black successful stars, celebrities, for not using their leverage to help move the project, the process along.  Help change the, the, the terrible images that are out there that we wanna change.  And even they might even wanna change.  But they're not going to accept my phone calls and my projects because they're afraid that they're gonna lose what they have.  And that's the problem.  The problem is I know a lot of these success stories.
Story_ID: 154313
Speaker 1: And now I'm gonna talk about them; I'm not gonna talk about the industry because we can change the industry if we ourselves understand and commit ourselves to changing.  But the people that are in a position to use their leverage, won't use their leverage.  I know a lot of people personally that I myself have helped in their careers, in the beginning of their careers.  I've helped them.  And they've said to the world at one point that I've helped them.  They don't say it anymore because I've gone to them and I've said would you read this screenplay, just read the screenplay.  Don't commit to it.  Would you read the screenplay and if you like the screenplay, maybe we can do it, maybe we can do something together because we're old friends, aren't we, right?  Okay.  I runt o this person and I tell 'em I have this project and I wanna get them to read it, just to read it.  If they hate it, fine.  If they like it, maybe we can talk.  Well I can't get that person to call me back anymore.  He won't call me.  You did say you were gonna read this project, didn't you?  Well yeah, you know. But I can't--now they know that when Robert Hooks calls them, he's not calling them to invite them to a party or to invite them to some function.  He's calling them because he wants to do business with them.  They don't wanna do business with me because who the hell am I?
Speaker 2: They are afraid to do business with you.
Speaker 1: Yes they are.  Who am I in their minds.  Now one of the real problems with that, let's just use a person, that particular actor who's successful.  He has a white manager and a white agent.  And those white agents and managers say to them you send the project to me.  Don't, don't have 'em send it to you.  Send the project to me and then you don't have to worry about dealing with that person, and that's what happens.  What happen is I ran into this person and I said I got this screenplay, would you read it?  And they say yeah, well you know so-and-so is over there.  You know, get the number and whatever, whatever.  So then I go over there, I talk to so-and-so.  And I said you know, he told me that I should get this project to you and he's gonna read it.  So he says fine, you know, send it over to the office, whatever, whatever.  So I bring it to the office, I don't send it, I bring it to the office because I know he said he was gonna read it.  All I want him to do is read it.  I don't want him to give me anything.  Just read the project.  If you like it, maybe we can do something, and if you don't like it, then I'll bring you another project some other time.  So now I, I, I don't hear from this person anymore, I don't hear from 'em, right.  And I'm--weeks go by and I'm saying well, you know he said he was gonna read it.  So now I call the office again and I talk to his office person, the person who runs the office.  And they say well you know he sent--I know he sent the project over to his agent, the white guy, right.  So I said okay, fine, you know, what are you gonna do?  The guy said he was gonna read it.  Now all of a sudden the script--he hasn't even seen the script, my friend.  He hasn't seen the script, but his agent has the script.  So now I get a call from his agent.  And his agent says hey Bob, wow, you know you're one of my best actor--I mean one of my favorite actors in the world.  You know you should really be in there with Sidney and all those guys.  I really admire your work.  This is his agent, right.  And I'm saying it's great, well thanks a lot.  But you know, you know I'm waiting for so-and-so to read the script.  He says no, no, no.  He doesn't have time to read the script, I read the script and you know we, we're just not ready to do something like this now, whatever, whatever.  So now my friend who said he would read the script has now palmed the script off onto his agent.  His agent doesn't wanna do business with me.  Now he's never read the script.  He hasn't even seen the script.  But his agent has it, right.  So now I get a rejection from his agent, not from him, from his agent.  And now I'm saying to myself well you know, here's a guy that I've known since he was like--since he started acting in the business.  Now he's a big movie star and every time I see him, I get the hug, you know, how you doing, how are the kids, how's the family?  That's fine.  And I say the kids are fine, how's your kids, you know, we do that and it's great.  He's got a wonderful family, they're all beautiful people.  But he is now too big to deal with me.  And so he palms me off to the manager and the agent who are white guys.  That's what they get paid for.  They say look, if your mother has a script, you send her to me.  You don't deal with it, you send her to me.  So that's what I'm stuck with.  I'm stuck with trying to deal with these people secondhand.  So the industry has moved to that.  I mean I know everybody.  I know because I've been in this business a long time.  I've created a lot of opportunities for a lot of people--
Story_ID: 154314
Speaker 1: Okay now what we have is an old friend who cannot read your script.
Speaker 2: Won't read my script.
Speaker 1: Won't read your script because that obviously puts him on the spot to give an honest opinion, or give an opinion.  So he passes it over to an agent.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now you can't get someone who's promised to read the script.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you can't give an ans--get an answer from him because they can't read the script.
Speaker 2: I can't even get a phone call returned from him.
Speaker 1: Again though, because if they read the script, then they, they are on, on the spot.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  And, and see that--the problem is that they're not on the spot because I'm not the kind of guy who's gonna pressure somebody.  If you read--now I know anybody can read a script.  I don't care how busy you are.  The agent will tell you look, he's, really he's doing two movies, he's got another movie, he's got this, he's got that.  Look, you can read a script.  Anybody can read a script, I don't care how busy you are.  So all I wanted him to do, and he said he would, was to read the script and if you like the script, then you can turn me on to whoever.  But I want you to read the script because that, you know we're, we're supposedly--you remember me.  Remember the guy back in the old days.  So the guy who--the, the manager who's usually ninety-nine point nine percent of the managers in this industry are white, right.  They're in, they're in business to say no to me.  They're, they're in business to say no to me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They say yes to the big studios that have offers for them.  Well you can understand that.  Guy gets offers, he makes twenty million dollars a movie, okay fine.  I can't make those kinds of offers, so the agent says to the, the, the client, "you don't wanna do business with this guy.  You know he's an actor, not even a producer, he's an actor, you know."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: "You don't wanna do business with him, send him to me.  I'll butter him up.  Hey Bob, love your movie, you're one of my favorite actors."  Then he's gonna say no to me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he's off the hook, he thinks.  So we're stuck, independent filmmakers, black, African American independent filmmakers, who even know these people that are big success stories.  That if they brought a project to a studio, you got a chance of getting it done.  But the way it's set up, they have these buffers, and the buffers are the managers and the agents.  They'll turn you on to them because they're too busy and they'll say call my agent, call my manager.  Well that's a death note right there, forget it.  'Cause they don't wanna do business with you.  They don't even care how brilliant the script that you send them is.  They don't read it anyway.  They'll have somebody read it and then they'll give 'em a report, and then they'll call me and say, "look, I read your script.  It's really quite wonderful, but we're not looking for that for him right now."  Okay, he could have told me that, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So anyway, we got a problem as blacks in this industry getting other blacks to commit to changing the way this industry works for us, for our people.
Speaker 1: Those blacks who have a step up to reach back.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: To those-
Speaker 2: Reach back, remember where they came from, reach back and if you wanna say no, that's fine.  You don't have to say yes to me.  But don't tell me that okay I'll read it, and then you never even see it, you know.  So anyway we're stuck with having to deal with that.  So what we have to do as independent filmmakers, is we have to find a way to do our projects without those people.
Story_ID: 154315
Speaker 1: And you know they're [independent African American filmmakers] beginning to do it.  Independent filmmakers are beginning to do it.  I haven't done it yet, but I will, but I will.  And then you don't have to worry about those guys.  Then you see--guys and girls, you know.  Then you--when you see them and they wanna hug and hug you and stuff, you know, you can take the hug or you don't have to take the hug, you know.  But anyway so, so--
Speaker 2: So you're optimistic then--or you're pessimistic that that situation will change and the answer you're suggesting is that the filmmakers have to just start relying upon themselves.
Speaker 1: Themselves and other alternative ways of getting their projects done.  And there are a lot of ways.  They're not easy to do, but you know if you, you know if you can't get it done that way, then you have to just find another way to do it.  And if you're committed to something, if you're passionate about your project, and I am very passionate about my projects, I'm gonna get them done one way or the other.  I'm gonna get them done.  But the--I was just talking to you about the problems that we have with people that we know.  I mean we know these people.  And, and, and a lot of 'em, a lot of us have done things to help these people in their careers.  Of course we're not responsible for their success, they're responsible for that.  Their talent makes--you know, but if somebody does something for you early on in your career, you gotta remember that.  You have to remember that.  You can't just not return my phone calls.  Then you know, that's a slap in the face, you know.  You can return my phone calls and just tell me that you're busy, you'll talk to me later.  Or I, I, I can't, whatever.  Say something to me.  But they don't do it because then you--then they feel they're on the spot.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Like you said.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They feel they're on the spot, so they palm you off to these white managers and white produce--white agents.  And the white agents and the white managers, it's over, it's over.  They're not gonna--you know.  So the industry is like--now that's just the black success stories that I wanna talk about.
Story_ID: 154316
Speaker 1: The book 'Blackbusters:  Hollywood, the Last Plantation,' is about the industry and how they have over the years manipulated our image.  It's their image, not ours, for the most part.  Employment, forget it.  I mean you know you go into any studio and you see a sea of white faces.  You won't see many people of color in there today, 2006.  We were fighting for this back in the '60s [1960s].  We were fighting to change it, and it hasn't changed.  And we're talking forty-some odd years, almost fifty years and it hasn't changed.  So the only way it's gonna change is, is if those people that we talked about, those black success stories, realize, commit themselves to change.  We're not losing anything.  See they're scared that if we, if we move over here to help so-and-so do whatever, I'm gonna lose what I have over here.  Not true, not true at all.  I put together a, a consortium, a concept where I would get ten of the major black success stories to join this consortium to build a studio in this town for people of color, right.  But including everybody, but being owned and run by people of color.  Now this was the deal.  You go to the first star and you say this is what we're doing, here's the proposal, here's the concept, and this is what it's going to do.  What we need for you to do, is we need for you to commit one film, commit to star in one film.  You can bring it to us, we can bring it to you, we can build it together, whatever.  But if you commit to the one film, then--and we'll pay you.  We're not gonna ask you to do this for nothing.  We can't give you the big, big salaries, but we can give you a nice salary, a nice fee for doing the film.  And give you a piece of the profits on not just the film that you do, but if I got the other nine people to do, to agree to do films, and these would be actors, directors, writers, whatever, whoever.  People that can green light pictures.  If I get those, not only do you share in the profits of the one you do, you share in the profits of all the other nine, all ten of them.  And the same goes for the other people that star in it.  That was the deal.  So you don't--I'm not coming to you with my hat in my hand.  I'm coming to you with a concept that's gonna change the image for black folk in this industry, and the opportunities for black folks in this industry, in this town.  This is the deal.  Now all I want you to do is commit to do one project.  You get paid.  I ain't asking you to do it for free, 'cause that's the first--they, "you know, no, I get twenty million dollars.  I can't be doing something for five million."  But I can get you five million and give you a piece of the profits of all of the other projects in the consortium.  Now that to me is a fairly decent deal.  But I can't even get two of those people in a room to talk about this consortium.  So because there's no commitment.  Because they're afraid.  They're afraid that if they get involved in something like this, they lose what they have.  And it's not true.  They will gain.  Their image becomes bigger if they become involved in something for the betterment of African Americans and the image and the employment and the distribution situation.

Speaker 1: So would I be correct, or would you agree with that one of the great detriments of us moving ahead in this industry is ourselves.
Speaker 2: Is us.
Speaker 1: Is us.
Speaker 2: We're our, we're our biggest enemies in this whole thing.  Because they're not going to, they're not going to level the playing field for us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They're not gonna do it.  And you know, you know I don't blame 'em.  They got theirs and it's all about the bottom line for them.  It's all about making the--as much money as they can make and for as long as they can make it.  And for everybody protecting their butts.  Everybody protects themselves.  So nobody wants to get involved in anything that's new and innovative.  But if you're an African American artist in this country, you know how difficult it is.  And if you are in a position to change it, why not?  Why not?  But they're afraid to change it.  So they will lose friends, you know.  I mean I'm sure that person that I'm talking about, he doesn't need me.  What does he need with me?
Speaker 1: He thinks he does not need you.
Speaker 2: Right, doesn't need me.  He doesn't need me, so he's gonna avoid me whenever he sees me and he's gonna avoid me because he can't quite confront me and I'll say well you know you told me you were gonna read the script.  And then I got, I got this white guy calls me and he passes.  He can't deal with that, so he's gonna avoid me, he's gonna avoid me.  So that's the biggest problem we have of changing the system is that we, our success stories won't commit to using their leverage, and that's what you gotta do.  You gotta use your leverage.  Now in, in, in fairness to a lot of them, some of them do.  Some of them do that, you know.  But most of them don't.  And I'm not using any names because they know who they are, so--

Speaker 1: You mentioned-- just an earlier part of the interview, you mentioned Lonne Elder [III], one of the icons of the industry that we've all looked up to as a playwright back in New York [New York] and out here.  You recently did a--were part of a tribute to, to Lonne.  And if you would just give us a little taste of your presentation.
Speaker 2: Well first of all, he, he--needless to say, Lonne and I go all the way back to my very first Broadway play, very first play, professional play in New York was 'A Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] and Lonne of course was in that play.  He was the original Bobo in that play, and that's when we met.  So we've been friends and colleagues for all those years until he passed away.  And as I mentioned, he had written projects for Kevin [Hooks], my son Kevin.  He had written--we had done projects together, he and I.  And in the tribute to Lonne Elder, who I still miss.  It's amazing, he was such a incredible man.  He was a pain at times, but you, you, you loved him so that you know, you know that, the way that goes.  But I wrote kind of a, a tribute.  In the tribute, I wrote kind of a tribute on 'Ode to Lonne.'  And I don't have it in front of me, but it was--it, it was--it goes, it went something like this:  Well Lon, you're gone now and you know I think back on the times when, when we sat at Birdland and listened to John Coltrane together (simulates instruments).  And I tell you I think about the time when we used to go almost every night to this three for one bar in Harlem [New York, New York] and sit down with Langston Hughes at the bar and talk about the time that he was so important un the time of the Harlem Renaissance (simulates instruments).  Remember?  Remember that?  I tell you, Lonne Elder was one of the great individuals that I have ever met in my life; he changed my life.  And I'll never forget him.  Take him out on a rift (simulates instruments).  Lonne's gone, but we remember him.  It went something like that.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: And it was just so wonderful, such a beautiful time.  And he was a great man.  He was a great man.  We, we, we, we spent--we lived together for a long time when we came back off the road from 'A Raisin in the Sun.'  And during the whole time when he was writing the great play 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men' [Lonne Elder III] and I lived with him when he was doing that.  We would read the parts, the different parts across the, you know, table at night.  While he was working, we'd read the parts together.  He was a dear friend.  His family's still wonderful friends of mine.  His kids are basically my kids.  His son, Christian [Elder] is a, is a filmmaker, a screenwriter, he's not a filmmaker.  But he writes screenplays.  As a matter of fact, I just read one that he wrote.  And it's, it's funny because his dialogue, it all is reminiscent of Lonne.
Speaker 1: You said something during that presentation you just gave us.  You said Lonne changed your life.  In what way?
Speaker 2: Well politically he changed my life.  He made me realize that my talent, my ambitions, were great, were wonderful.  But we live in a society where we have to really be aware of what's going on around us politically.  He was a political animal.  Little bit too conservative for me.  I tend to fall on the liberal side of, of things politically.  But I was not really aware politically until I met Lonne and Doug [HM Douglas Turner Ward], Douglas Turner Ward.  So Douglas Turner Ward, Lonne Elder were the two people that, I mean they were very close friends with Paul Robeson, and they would tell me the stories about how they would sit with Paul and talk politics.  So the two of them, especially Lonne, would, would talk politics.  And I learned a lot about politics through Lonne.  It changed my life just from the point of view of being a professional and not being so hung up on myself.  Not being so egotistical, which is a problem that a lot of artists have, black, white, whatever.  They, they, they're too hung up on themselves.  It's fine to be hung up on yourself, but you have to think past yourself to what's happening in the world.  And Lonne did that for me.  He changed my life because he made me a worldly, a more worldly person.

Speaker 1: If you in your entire career, of all of the productions, presentations that you have done, film presentations, if you had to select the most successful ones in your opinion.  Not financially successful.  I mean the ones in which you consider the most, either because of a certain scene or because of the entire production, how, how would you rate the top three?
Speaker 2: The top three, we're talking film now.
Speaker 1: Film.
Speaker 2: Not plays, okay.  Well the top three films I think if I had to choose the number one film as it relates to material, character, you know and the kind of things that actors really look for.  There was a movie, the first movie I did as a matter of fact.  Very first movie I did was called 'Sweet Love Bitter.'  It was a story about Charlie Parker, Miles Davis character in it, I played the Miles Davis character.  And [HM] Dick Gregory played the Charlie Parker character.  Beautifully written by a man named Herb Danska and directed by Herb as well.  And I loved that role that I played.  Didn't get many roles like that, that delved into where an actor can really use his, his emotions and deal with his chops as an actor.  That one.  The second film I think probably was the Otto Preminger film that I did.  I just had so much fun working on the character and working with Otto, although a lot of people didn't care that much for Otto Preminger.  I liked the man and he liked me, it was a wonderful relationship we had.  And then I worked--so that film was called 'Hurry Sundown.'  And I worked with five of the most incredible actors.  [HM] Diahann Carroll and I played lovers in the film.  Jane Fonda was in the film.  We had a wonderful relationship.  Michael Kane was in the film.  Faye Dunaway was in the film.  John Phillip Law who went to Europe and, and did his thing, was also in the film.  And, and, and, and I was so fortunate to meet and to work with and to live with for the seven weeks we were there, with the--one of the, one of my heroes, Rex, Rex Ingram.  Rex Ingram was in the film, played Diahann Carroll's father in the film.  And the stories and the, just the--I mean he was just such a wonderful, wonderful human being.  So the, the experience of 'Hurry Sundown,' second to 'Sweet Love Bitter.'  The third film if I had to choose three, the third film was working with my son [Kevin Hooks], although I didn't do that much in the film.  It was a nice role.  It was a movie called 'Passenger 57' and 'Fled,' so you have four now.  'Passenger 57' and 'Fled' were two movies that Kevin [Hooks], my son Kevin directed.  And to be able to work as an actor with your son directing you, was just one of the most incredible experiences for me.  And although the roles were not great roles, they were good roles, but they were not great roles because in 'Passenger 57' Wesley Snipes was the star.  And in 'Fled' Laurence Fishburne was the star.  So I was costarring in these films but, but working with my son, working with him, watching him the way he commanded the set.  The way people respected him.  You would walk on a set and you would look for the director because he didn't even look like, I mean you know Kevin's a, kind of a smallish in stature but big in spirit.  So people didn't--he looked like a teenager.  So looking for the director and all of a sudden he says action, and then you say wow, he's the director.  And he would say, "Well listen, when Dad goes over here and when Dad does this, I want you to do this.  And when Dad does this."  And I'm standing there going okay, son, do your thing.  Those two movies along with 'Sweet Love Bitter' and 'Hurry Sundown' were four of my favorites.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you know, plays is a whole other thing.
Speaker 1: Let's try plays, same thing.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, I've done a lot of plays.  The very first play I did was 'A Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] very first professional play I did was 'A Raisin in the Sun,' which was a wonderful role.  I replaced [HM Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] Lou Gossett in that play.  Then 'A Taste of Honey' [Shelagh Delaney] that I replaced Bill, Billy Dee Williams in that play.  Those roles were wonderful and the plays were equally as wonderful.  But if I had to choose one play as an actor, it would be 'The Blacks' [Jean Genet].  'The Blacks' was such an experience for me as an actor, and I grew so much doing that play.  I did that play on and off for about three years, on and off.  I'd leave the play, go do a movie, come back to the play, leave the play, go do a television series or whatever and I'd come back to the play.  But the role of Village, character's name was Village.  And I mean I'd act with, I acted with greats like Roscoe [HM] Lee Browne and [HM] Maya Angelou and Cicely Tyson, you know, Chuck Gordone and Lex Ingram.  I mean Lex Monson, forgive me.  I got the Lex's and the Rex's names--but the 'The Blacks' if I had to choose one play that satisfied me more than anything, it was 'The Blacks.'
Speaker 1: So you would rate 'The Blacks' over 'Raisin in the Sun?'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd rate 'The Blacks' over--performance-wise, just as an actor.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I would rate 'The Blacks.'
Speaker 1: Most satisfying to you.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So would 'Raisin in the Sun' be over 'Taste of Honey?'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they, they run--
Speaker 1: It would be 'The Blacks,' 'Raisin in the Sun'--
Speaker 2: 'The Blacks,' 'Raisin in the Sun,' not even 'A Taste of Honey.'  There, there, there were other plays that I did on and off Broadway.  'Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright' [Peter Feibleman] was a play I did with Ellen Holly and Cicely Tyson and Claudia McNeil again.  That was really quite a wonderful experience as an actor, and I was a young actor at the time.  Still in my twenties.  But yeah, those, those four or five plays.  I mean I, I've enjoyed most of the things that I've done.  I've turned down a lot of work that I just could not--and I do it still.  I mean I can't do the stuff that they offer me.  So they don't offer me anything anymore because I just can't do the silly stuff.  I, you know it's--you don't have to.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should not.
Speaker 2: And it's a shame when I see actors, friends of mine who really need to work, you see.  They need to work to pay bills, whatever.  And they end up doing the silly, stupid, dumb stuff.  And you see 'em and you say you know, it's a shame, it's a shame.  Because if your body of work is strong, and mine is strong, you don't wanna weaken it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But some actors can't help it.
Speaker 1: You don't want to be remembered by the last things you do.
Speaker 2: Right.  And some actors unfortunately have to do that stuff, and I understand, you know, you gotta make a living.
Story_ID: 154321
Speaker 1: If I asked you the question the highlight of your career, could you partic-- take a particular moment or, or event that would be the highest highlight?
Speaker 2: Well the highest highlight is difficult.  I'll name a--well one of the high--people don't know this about me.  One of the highlights was when I did a musical on Broadway and I was able to sing.  It was called 'Hallelujah Baby' [Arthur Laurents] that I did with Leslie Uggams and Allen Case.  Betty Comden, Adolph Greene, Jule Styne, all the great musical people were involved in putting this together.  And there I was singing one of the lead roles.  And a lot of people didn't know that I was a singer, right.  And so that, that was a highlight for me to--every night before the curtain went up, that orchestra started and you just felt, you know like--and when the curtain goes up and that orchestra is playing, and then the play begins.  But before that curtain goes up, you're standing on stage getting ready to do, to open the play.  But there's the overture.  And the overture was dynamite, right.  It just infuses you.  And so by the time the curtain goes up, you're ready to just kill 'em.
Speaker 1: You're ready.
Speaker 2: Right.  'Hallelujah Baby' was, was that.  That was one of the highlights because of the--I got an opportunity to sing.  And, and if people don't believe it, there's an album, so you can get it, right.  And, and then Leonard Bernstein, one of the great conductors of all time and one of the classic music icons, asked me to narrate the 'Airborne Symphony' for the New York Philharmonic.  And there I was on stage with 120 people in the orchestra, a chorus of another 120 people, and me and the other people that were doing the narration, and Bernstein up there with his--Lenny with his hair going crazy and this baton.  And the funniest thing happened when it--so there I was, I narrated the 'Airborne Symphony' and it was really great.  But, but it was new to me and I don't read music.  So I had to go on his cues, right.  Well if you've ever seen Leonard Bernstein direct an orchestra, or conduct an orchestra, you know he goes and he's going, he's doing the "St. Vitus Dance," right.  And at one point he's supposed to give me my cue to start.  And he was going, doing his thing and boom and the hair was flying and he--I thought he did that and I started the dialogue.  Fortunately, it didn't really come out, so you know, but he looked at me, he gave me the strangest look.  And then afterwards he says, after it was over and you know, and they loved it, it was great, it was a big success.  He said "What were you thinking?  What were you doing?"  I said you gave me a cue.  I thought you gave me the cue with the baton, you know.  But if you saw, if you've ever seen him, he goes crazy up there, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, I have.
Speaker 2: So anyway, but that--to narrate a symphony for the New York Philharmonic with, with all these incredible musicians and all in the hall of the Lincoln Center, that was the highlight for me.  There were a lot of highlights.  I've been doing this for a long time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And a lot of highlights, but those, those are some.  There, there also when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed.  Henry Fonda and I were doing a play, I was doing a play and Henry Fonda was doing a play on Broadway.  And one of the local stations wanted to do a, a tribute to Martin and just had people coming from different plays around, you know New York and the mayor came, whatever.  And Henry Fonda and I hosted that evening on television.  Sure would like to try to get that.  I don't know if--it must have been taped, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But yeah, I, I, I hosted this tribute to Martin Luther King the night he was shot, the night he was killed, for, for one of the local television stations in New York [New York].  And they just picked me because I was starring in a play, and Henry Fonda, and the two of us did it together and it was wonderful.  Yeah, and then I ended up doing a movie with his daughter so.
Speaker 1: Right, with Jane [Fonda].
Story_ID: 154322
Speaker 1: Now you've had a long career.  And, and I don't mean to say this is the end because you've got a million and one things on your plate that you're still going to do.
Speaker 2: A lot of things.
Speaker 1: But I would like to sort of find out for our audience how would you like to be remembered?  What was--what have you been involved in and done that you might like people to say well this was Robert Hooks?
Speaker 2: Well it's not my acting career.  My acting career was very big and, and broad and you know, filled with all kinds of wonderful characters and experiences.  And I tell you I would not, you know I, I've been the luckiest person in the world.  But what really and truly means more to me than anything that I've ever done as an actor or as a performer, was building cultural institutions for others so they--to give them the opportunity that I didn't have.  I didn't have a theater company to go to.  I didn't have a cultural institution where you can go and study all aspects of the industries.  I didn't have that, but I built that.  I did it in Washington, D.C., I did it in New York City [New York], the D.C. Black Repertory Company, the Group Theater Workshop, and the Negro Ensemble Company are three organizations that I started myself.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: With my colleagues.  I co-founded these.  The Group Theater Workshop which was the first, I co-founded with [HM] Barbara Ann Teer.  I know you know Barbara Ann Teer, Dr. Teer in Harlem.  She's just another, another colleague and an icon in Harlem.  Well she was the co-founder of the Group Theater Workshop with me.  The Negro Ensemble Company with [HM] Douglas Turner Ward and Gerry Krone and I, and the D.C. Black Repertory Company.  Now I initiated those three companies.  I was the--they were my brainchild, children.  They were my brain, brain, brain children.  Thank God for Barbara Ann Teer.  She had it all and we shared it together as partners.  And Douglas Turner Ward you can--what can you say about this guy?  He's a genius.  And Gerald Krone, another genius.  And then Vantile Whitfield in Washington [D.C.]  If I had to, if I--my legacy was written, it would be what I have done for others, not what I did on my own and my successful career.  But what I was able to do with little or nothing but ideas, I was able to create opportunities for some of the top actors in this industry, some of the top writers and directors and choreographers in this industry.  I created opportunities for them to do their thing.  Some of them remember that and return my calls.  Some of them don't.  But that's okay.  It was there for them.  That's how I wanna be remembered.
