Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well as you can tell by the confirmation of my body I, I am quite eclectic.  I'll eat a little bit of everything but I like, I really like Chinese food and I like the steaks every now and then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.  I like red for some reason, I don't know.  And my wife hates red for some reason.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring and fall in Chicago [Illinois].  That's when the weather is most desirable I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: We try to go different places every year but then if you want to ask me my favorite, any part of southern California I think I like.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Off the top of my head I can't, I can't think of one.
Story_ID: 19386
Speaker 1: Can you give us the names of your parents and spell them for us and maybe their birth dates and where they were born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Leola, L-E-O-L-A, Moseley was her maiden name, M-O-S-E-L-E-Y.  My dad's name was Fred Rice, Sr.  I'm, I'm junior.  They were both born in Decatur, Alabama.  She was born 1898 in Decatur, Alabama and he was born 1892 in Decatur also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they give you, tell you any stories about their family backgrounds (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, more so from my mother's side than my father's side.  My mother's dad was part of the Union Army and we still have his discharge which is very unusual for a Southerner to fight in the Union Army, but I hear he went North to join the Union Army from Alabama and we still have his discharge papers at home.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Fred Rice, Sr.  Well Fred Rice at that time cause I hadn't, I was just a figment of his imagination.
Speaker 1: Now this is, but this is your mother's--?
Speaker 2: No this is my father.
Speaker 1: Your (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah this is my father.  My mother, no I get what you mean.  My mother, that's my mother's father's name.  He's the one--my, my father, I never did see any of his relatives, especially his mother and father.  They were, they had died by the time I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm talking about my mother's side.
Speaker 1: So he would be a Moseley?
Speaker 2: Yeah, his name would be Moseley.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: M-O-S-E-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you don't remember his first name?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  It's--oh hell I can't remember, can't recall now but I--oh what was, I, I can't recall his first name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he served in the Civil War [1861-1865]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Civil War.
Speaker 1: And you have the discharge of it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did he serve in the South or did he (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I have no idea where he served.  I imagine he did serve in the, in the South because the Union armies occupied most of the South at the time.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Okay, does your family talk about any of the--about slavery at all?  Any stories come out of that experience?
Speaker 2: No, I--.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The main thing was that they were farmers and they were cotton pickers.  And from what I hear both sides of the family seemed to have been sharecroppers at the time.  They got a part of whatever they produced and so as you see they come from very humble surroundings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your, what did your mother do for a living?  Did she like work in the fields and (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well I imagine she did.  In fact, I'm quite sure she did as a, as a child and teenager but at the age of sixteen years of age she left the, she and my, my dad left the South and came to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do they have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I have, the only thing, con--no, the only conclusion I can reach it's a small town and so I guess they knew all, all knew each other anyway so it wouldn't be too hard meeting anyone in that town.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they migrated to Pittsburgh--.
Speaker 2: Initially yeah, and he worked in the steel mills, yeah.  He was in that big World War I, post-World War I migration of blacks coming in up from North for jobs leaving the South.  That was the first migration and he--they stayed in Pittsburgh for a while then they moved to Cleveland [Ohio], still job, going from job to job.  They stayed in Cleveland for a while and then moved to Chicago [Illinois] and I think they moved to Chicago about 1919, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's about the time of the Chicago riot?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did they have any story of that?
Speaker 2: No, evidently they weren't privy to any of the problems of the Chicago riot.  I think possibly they could have made it up here after the Chicago riots because if I remember correctly the Chicago riots were the summer in 1919 and I think they came up subsequent to the riots.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so your father found work here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes, he found work at the Rock Island Railroad at 47th [Street] and Wentworth [Avenue].  He worked at what they call the train repair shop there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did he do that for most of his life?
Speaker 2: No, he did it until the Depression around 1935, '36 [1936], and they laid off a bunch of railroad workers at the time.  And he had a big family.  It was all, there were nine of us.  And he got on the WPA [Works Progress Administration], the WPA is one of [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt's methods of trying to resolve the Depression by hiring unemployed people to do public works.  So he worked in the WPA and I think his salary was about fifty five dollars a month.  And he was promoted to supervisor and that pushed his salary up to sixty dollars a month, so that was right in the middle of the Depression.  And he remained on the WPA until World War II [1939-1945] and then he got a job with the Chicago Board of Education as a janitor.  And he worked as a janitor until retirement age in, for the Chicago Board of Education, think he retired around age sixty five.
Story_ID: 19387
Speaker 1: Can you name your brothers and sisters and tell us where you fall within the--?
Speaker 2: Certainly, I'll try.  Alphonso was my oldest brother.  He died when he was two years old [1928].  And I had a brother by the name Alonzo [Rice], he was next to the oldest.  He, he died at the age of fifty-three [1974].  I forgot the year he died but he died at the age of fifty three with cancer of the throat.  Then my sister named Patricia [Rice], she died recently [1996].  She died at the age of sixty nine.  Then I come in there and I'm still living of course.  And then I had, have another sister by the name of Cora, Cora Gill.  She died about five years ago [1994].  Then another, another brother by the name of George [Rice], he died at the age, of age fifty three [1983] with lung cancer and I have a sister by the name of Beverly [Jones], she's still living.  And another sister by the name of Ruth [Davis] and she died at the age forty five [1980].  Then a brother who recently died by the name of Nathaniel [Rice], he died a few months [2002] ago with lung cancer.  So lung cancer seems--and I just got operated for lung cancer about six months ago so lung cancer seems to be quite prevalent in my family.  Of course it has to do with smoking.  We've all come, came, we all came up during the smoking era and just about all my sisters and brothers smoked.  I quit back in 1974 but it didn't seem to help me in keeping away cancer because I had lung cancer, I contracted lung cancer about eight months ago.  So that's the whole family in its entirety.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a large family during the Depression?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 19388
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up in Chicago [Illinois]?  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up here and where did you all live?
Speaker 2: We lived where the Robert Taylor Homes were [later] built at 41st [Street] and Dearborn [Avenue] and went to Fair--Hartigan [Elementary] School.  At the time it was at 40th and Dearborn and that was the neighborhood where we, we lived until I was around oh, was I around ten years old then we moved further south to 52nd [Street] and Dearborn [Avenue] where the Robert Taylor Homes stretch all the way out to 57th and Dearborn.  That was prior to them building the Robert Taylor Homes.  And so as a child we lived two places, 41st and Dearborn and 52nd and Dearborn and then as a teenager we moved into 5251 South Wells [Avenue] and stayed there for a few years.  And then we moved to 65th [Street] and Minerva [Avenue].  By that time I was grown and I was, went to the army at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was it like growing up over there?  I mean there were, a lot of people can't imagine what it looked like prior to the projects, if you could describe what it looked like.
Speaker 2: Well it, it was old frame houses over there at the time and it was considered the slum area right, especially 41st, especially around 41st and Dearborn .  For big families the apartments were large and most of them are owned by absentee landlords and not the individuals living there. And we were pretty poor but we didn't know it at the time.  I didn't, I didn't know because we all took jobs on the side.  I've been working since I was ten years old doing various and sundry things and most of my, most of my sisters and brothers worked, start, began working at an early age to, to help father [Fred Rice Sr.] supplement the income.  So we didn't lack the necessities of life.  We didn't have to have the luxuries but we certainly had, we ate well and we were clothed pretty well but as a result of the effort by all the kids to take, take on jobs, part time jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you all do to amuse yourselves?
Speaker 2: Well then we made our own toys.  This generation I notice these kids now they don't even play marbles.  We, marbles were quite popular when I was a, a kid and we, we made our own scooters and we made our ridings out of fish boxes and two-by-fours and wheels from old buggies.  We made scooters out of skates, nail one, one part of the skate up front and other part on the rear and put two two-by-fours together and made skates.  We also made our own kites by using newspaper and, and glue made with flour and taking an old tie to use as a, as a tail for the kite and it flew very well.  But these were all homemade things.  And so we didn't have the luxury of having toys given to us at Christmas time.  Big Christmas was when we had a lot of fruit and a lot of food to eat, that was our big Christmas.  We didn't get presents, we just--you know our parents couldn't afford it.  But we did our own toy-making more or less.
Story_ID: 19389
Speaker 1: What about school?  Did you like school and what school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I liked school.  I went to Hartigan [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois] the first four years in going to school and I still vividly remember the school teachers at Hartigan and how well they taught us.  I don't remember anybody having a problem with reading and, during that time.  That was stressed quite well, quite much to be able to read.  And I'm wondering you know why these kids, present day kids have so much trouble reading.  I don't remember anyone in our group having trouble reading.  We started off on Billy and Sally and wagon and puff books you know the regular elementary and came right on up, but I can't recall anyone not being able to read and read well.  So this is a new phenomenon to me that you know this, people and the kids aren't able to read.  But then we went to, the last four years of grammar school I went to [John] Farren [Elementary] School at 50--50th and, and it's still there, 50th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue], went there four years and then I went to DuSable High School for four years, graduated from DuSable High School.  Then I went out to William, Wilson Junior College [now Kennedy-King College] at 68th, it was at 68th [Street] and Stewart [Avenue] at that time and spent two years in junior college.  And back, back in the '60s [1960s] I went back to school and finished my bachelor's degree at Roosevelt University and stayed and got a master's degree there and that's the extent of my education.
Speaker 1: You're moving very fast here.
Speaker 2: You asked me about that education so I had to give you a complete story.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you remember everything.  Back in grade school were there any special activity that you were involved in, teachers that took an interest in you?
Speaker 2: I thought there were, at the time when I went to school teachers couldn't marry, had to be single.  And so their whole life was with their, with their kids and they stayed after school with people, kids that they felt that needed extra attention.  I hear that doesn't go on anymore.  They get out of that school they say as far as they could.  So we had committed teachers, what I think were very committed teachers in grammar school and some in high school.  But I was impressed with the, with the quality of teachers I had my first eight years of school.
Speaker 1: And do you remember the names of any in particular?
Speaker 2: Oh certainly.  Yeah I remember the name of my kindergarten teacher.  She was a beautiful, tall, slim thing and I, at that time I was only five or six years old but I would appreciate her feminine beauty.  Ms. McKay (ph.) was her name and she remains vivid in my memory.  And my first grade teachers, a Ms. Blue (ph.) was one of them, Ms. Elliott (ph.), Ms. O'Connell (ph.).  Ms. O'Connell was the one that would spank you.  Back then you could get spanked, your teachers could spank you and they, you couldn't sue them or you wouldn't sue them.  The parents were not inclined to suits then they were inclined to keep you straight.  So if you go home and tell, tell your parents that your teacher spanked you, you might get another spanking.  Now they file suit, so it was different, it was different values back then.  That's the era of corporal punishment, everybody would beat you.  I don't know if that's altogether bad.  The police officers never did arrest you and, and made a paper out on you.  They'd take their, their billy and tap you on the rear end a couple of times and so it was a different society altogether.
Story_ID: 19390
Speaker 1: What about law enforcement in the black community these days, were there very many black police officers on the force?
Speaker 2: No there was about a force of 7,000 and it stayed around 350, no more than 350 for quite a little while.  So in my neighborhood you always had black police officers because they would get an assignment with the, with the black areas at the time.  They weren't assigned outside of black areas so we were familiar with the police officers.  But we had no reason to call them because I don't remember my parents [Leola Moseley and Fred Rice Sr.] anybody on the block ever having to call the police for anything.  And so their services were not needed as much as they're needed now.  I remember the block I was living on, there was only about two or three families even owned automobiles.  So automobiles, traffic wasn't even a problem at the time.  So we see police in the squad car and we had the police in DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  We had one, one police officer at DuSable at the time I went there and was, had about oh I'd say about 3,500 kids and they had one police officer and he ruled the roost.  So it was a much more disciplined type society back then and you had no--the block I lived in, I can't, I can't remember but one family not having a father and mother at home.  Seems that back then the sanctity, the marriage was, it, people, it was more prevalent than what it is now, people getting married.  But I don't remember but one family that, that the woman controlled, which is all reversed now.  Most of, lot of families are single family, single parent families, it wasn't so then.  And so as far as I'm concerned we have regressed in that, from family relationships.
Story_ID: 19391
Speaker 1: Is there anything about grade school you want to tell us about, any memories?  Incidents that happened while you were younger made a lasting impression on you?
Speaker 2: No, not that I can think off the top of my head in grade school.  I, I was a good student in grade school.  I didn't have any problems, personally didn't have any problems at all with any of my subjects.  Back then they even taught geography.  I hear they don't even teach geography anymore.  These, these kids don't know India from Alaska.  But we, we had general science, I don't know if they teach that or not.  But general science was a very helpful course because it introduced you to electricity and the telephones and, and how batteries work and positive and negatives from lightening, things like that.  It was really, I thought it very beneficial.  I don't know if they still teach it.  I know my, my kids didn't get it when they were in school which was a generation later and I more or less had to tutor them in, in, especially in general science.
Speaker 1: Did they get various parts of it depending on what they focused on?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: But so what did you, what subjects did you like the best in school?
Speaker 2: I liked foreign languages.  I took French for four years and for some reason I like French, that's why I stuck with it.  And I went over to France a few days and had to pull out my high school French album and speak French over there (unclear).  Some reason I liked, I really liked it.  Math I didn't, never did like math.  Foreign languages I, I took Latin too.  I took Latin, two years of Latin which they don't even teach anymore.  And I thought Latin was very beneficial and very helpful to me in learning roots of English words.  I think it helped extend my vocabulary, English vocabulary taking Latin.
Story_ID: 19392
Speaker 1: In high school, you were very involved in high school activities and how did you do grade-wise?
Speaker 2: Grade-wise I fell down in high school, simple reason you know I was working part time as a porter in a drug store.  And I think that took away something from me because I worked four or five hours after school every evening.  And I attribute, that was the reason why I didn't get as good a grades in high school as I did in grammar school.  I was just occupied, more occupied with doing, with the, the job you know the part time job and I think that's the reason.  I wasn't on the honor roll.  I finished about the middle of my class.  They used to rank you back then.  I don't know if they rank you now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they still do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, about the middle of my class so I didn't, didn't do as well as, in high school.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in a lot of social activities in high school?
Speaker 2: No I wasn't and I wasn't for the simple reason that I just didn't have the time.  I was busy working.  I had belonged to the Latin club and another club, physics club I belonged to.  But that's the, it wasn't social that was educational you know.  But social activities I--it wasn't too many around DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] anyway except senior prom.  That's about the only social activity and joining different clubs that, that stress whatever, whatever discipline that the club, that the club embraced.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have any idea in high school what you wanted to do in the future?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  I didn't have no idea what I was going, going to do.  I took a general science course [educational track] and they rated you when you went to DuSable to determine where, whether or not you would even, even let you take a general science course.  And that's how I happened to take Latin because I ranked the, at the entrance exam I ranked pretty high and so they let me take a general science course which encompasses Latin too.  But I had no idea what I want--I certainly didn't want to porter in that drug store (unclear).  I had no idea, no idea what I, what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Did you have any teachers that suggested any counseling in high school about what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I didn't even seek their counsel at the time.  I, my career path was remote then.  I had no, you know, I just didn't, didn't even give it any thought at that time you know as to what career paths I would take.  Just didn't occur to me just what I would do later.
Story_ID: 19393
Speaker 1: What did you do after high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Wilson Junior College [now Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] for two years.  At that same time I was working at the post office part time.  They had a school set at the post office that permitted school children to work if they were sixteen years of age or over to work four hours a night part time.  And when I was out of Wilson Junior College I worked at the post office too so I was working all, just about all my life.  And that was very helpful because it kept me, I bought my own clothes, I did--bought the things that my parents [Leola Moseley and Fred Rice Sr.] would ordinarily buy themselves and so I was more or less self sufficient as a result of working part time at the post office.  But, so I, I played football a year out at Wilson Junior College.  And after, after about two years I didn't graduate I quit and, and worked, started working full time at the post office.  And then in nineteen--when I was twenty two years old, Uncle Sam called me and drafted me and I was in the active army for two years.  Thirteen months of that was in, in an infantry outfit in Korea.
Story_ID: 19394
Speaker 1: You're in Korea, this is nineteen--?
Speaker 2: --'51 [1951], '52 [1952], 1951, '52 [1952].  I was in the last all black infantry regiment, the 24th infantry regiment of the 25th division.  I was with them until they disbanded.  President [Harry S.] Truman signed an executive order integrating the Armed Forces in 1948 but people in the Far East command where I was didn't begin integrating until 1952.  They broke up all the black units and integrated them with the white units.  So I went from an all black 24th infantry regiment into a 159th field artillery which is an integrated field artillery.  So my point I'm trying to make, it took the Army, especially the Army in the Far East three years in order to implement Truman's executive order.
Speaker 1: Now the 24th and the 25th I think are historic black regiments (unclear)(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Regiments, right.
Speaker 1: Did they have special names or--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well the 24th, the one I was in was called "the blockhouse."  That was the blockhouse regiment.  But they gained fame during the civil, not Civil War, the Spanish-American war.  And they were stationed on, out west too when they were in the United States.  But they had been in Japan for quite a few years prior to the Korean War so when the Korean War began they, they transferred them from Japan over to Korea.  But I didn't get with them until February of '51 [1951].  They were in Korea when I got with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you there before or after the battle of the Inchon [North Korea]?
Speaker 2: I was there after.  You're talking, that, that was way up north and that was right after, I got there in February of '51 [1951], I think it was January or December of '50 [1950] or January of '51 when that battle that, that you're alluding to took place.
Speaker 1: Is there a tension in the army at that time on the verge of this integration move by Truman, was there a lot of tension there?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't notice any tension over in the Far East because they were prepared for so much.  They gave classes, the chaplains talked to groups of white and black soldiers and they more or less prepared us for integration as much as they possibly can by communicating with us.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the kinds of things that they would impart to the soldiers to--?
Speaker 2: Well the main thing was consideration to your fellow soldier regardless of race and to work together in harmony, and that was what they were emphasizing.  And that we have a polyglot society and we have all kinds and we must learn to live in, live with each other if not love each you know, things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you comfortable in the Army?
Speaker 2: No, I was getting shot at, getting artillery thrown at me.  I was very uncomfortable at times.  I was much more comfortable getting out there, going home on that, on that ship.
Speaker 1: Did the military life appeal to you at all?
Speaker 2: It appealed to me, not over there.  Military life appealed to me, I have a six, after I got out of the Army I had a six year reserve obligation and they stuck me into a reserve outfit and it was more, much more appealing because they were paying us.  And so I was using that money to pay my car insurance and things like that.  So I stayed in the army reserve for twenty years in order to get a pension and they didn't call us back to active duty thank goodness and so I got away with twenty years of taking Uncle Sam's money in reserves.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything that you can recall of note happening in your career to you that you want to tell us?
Speaker 2: No, just--we were being shot at by our own people more than by the enemy.  We were strafed by United States Air, Air Force planes two or three times in spite of the fact that we had our colors out, laid out you know for open game but they still--so we got more action against us from our own people than, than we did from the enemy especially the air action.
Speaker 1: And was this before the integration of the troops or after?
Speaker 2: No, this was after.  I mean this was after.  I was in the field artillery when this happened.  They made--I don't see any correlation between integration and that.  That's just mistaking--and mistakes happen you know in those type of situation, types of situation. So I don't think it was any, any relationship vis-à-vis integration and, and, and those actions.
Story_ID: 19395
Speaker 1: When you came back from the Army what did you do?
Speaker 2: I went back to post office and I started taking exams, every exam I could take.  I took the park district, police exam, fire department exam, the Chicago [Illinois] police exam and any other exam that popped up I took to get a better job.  The fire department, I passed the fire department's exam.  They called me first but at the time I was on, on the police exam and high enough to get called soon.  So I waived the fire department's exam and when the police department called me I took that job, with trepidation, great trepidation because I didn't know what to expect.  I was very apprehensive about becoming a police officer but I liked the, the, not so much the salary but the, the goodies that they gave you.  They gave you free hospitalization, one year sick leave and three weeks' vacation so they really had some good job benefits, that's what attracted me to the police department.
Speaker 1: Now you initially went for the park district police or--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Park District yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Park--you had, back then you had two separate police departments.  Park District and the City.  I initially started with the Park District.  Back in '59 [1959] Mayor [Richard J.] Daley merged the two police departments into one and then I became a city police officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how did you take to the training?  The training, well I know it wasn't enjoyable but, well it might have been.  I mean, what did you think about the training?
Speaker 2: I liked the training.  At the time I was young and in good shape.  I always tried to keep my body in good shape by playing basketball and running like that.  So I liked the training.  I didn't mind the running and all the other, all the other gyrations you had to do in order to keep in shape.  Of course we had a sadistic judo instructor.  He took pride in breaking at least one arm every class.  And he, he broke an arm of one of the boys that was in, in class with me so before he--he had his quota of broken arms before he got to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you saw that, heard that arm snap you knew that you were safe.
Speaker 2: But he took pride in breaking at least one arm every class.  He was really sadistic.
Speaker 1: That is.
Speaker 2: Otherwise, the classroom work kept you busy because you had to not only study different ordinances and statutes and also you had to study different phases of, of criminal, of the criminal code and you had to know your, when you could shoot and when you couldn't shoot and things like that that kept you in the books studying and, and being tested.  So it wasn't much of a challenge to me because I, it, it, I don't, I didn't think it was sufficiently difficult because some, some of the guys in the class did.  They'd just flunk out you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the training you received was fairly rigorous you think?
Speaker 2: Physically, but no I don't think mentally it was too rigorous, you know.
Speaker 1: And in retrospect do you, what do you think about that?
Speaker 2: I thought that they could, instead of training me on the mechanics of overcoming resistance and shooting weapons and all like that, I always felt that training should be also part of a sociological education too.  And as I progressed in the police department that was my, I tried to stress that not only training but education too and now it's part of the curriculum now you know sociology in most police departments not just Chicago.  It's, so that no matter overcome--take a gun away from somebody or overcome somebody the resistance is still part of the training but also you have a, an education part too.

Speaker 1: You came in I think shortly after O.W. [Orlando Winfield] Wilson, just as he became--?
Speaker 2: No, I came to city police in 1959 [from his previous position with the Chicago Park District Police, until 1959 a separate unit].  [Superintendent of Police] O.W. Wilson came in, in '60, [1960]--'60, a year, year separated, we were coming over from  [sic, to] City but I was at the [Chicago, Illinois] Park District at the time.  But we had our own chief over there, our own setup and all so coming over to City was altogether different setup.
Speaker 1: Okay.  O.W. Wilson is supposed to--he's come down in history to us now as someone who changed the Chicago Police Department tremendously and can you comment on that (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Oh, he changed the Chicago Police Department.  He brought Chicago Police Department out of the 19th century into the 20th century, in fact the 21st century.  He was very visionary.  He was the best thing that could have happened to Chicago because Chicago Police Department, I didn't recognize it when I came over from the Park District.  You had to buy your own paper to write reports.  The typewriters you had to have hand print reports that's going to court because the typewriters wouldn't work, the stations weren't kept up.  You had, you had, plus we had thirty-eight stations at the time and most of them the boundaries were in accordance with the different ward boundaries.  So you had a political-police tie-up physically that way.  And so he broke all that up.  He reduced the police department from thirty-eight stations to twenty-one stations and, and more or less, they more or less squared off as opposed to falling in any political boundaries.  He brought in new equipment, all new squad cars.  He brought in a new communications center.  He extended the education of, of people at the training school, he just did wonders, he, he, for the police department.  He, he renovated all the stations.  Also 11th Street--he renovated 11th Street.  He brought new reporting procedures in.  You didn't have--in order to report a crime you'd call a number and, and, and, and transmit the information on the telephone and a person downtown would type up the reports.  So he really, he really did, he was a boon and blessing to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now at the time did you really feel a part of something new and--?
Speaker 2: Oh certainly.  We saw it, we saw it all around us.  Of course you had an element in the police department that resisted any change whatsoever and especially O.W. Wilson coming in from the outside making changes, there was a normal, natural resistance, some.  Then he started expanding the, the ranks.  He started giving tests every two years for each rank and took the, took the cream off the tests and, and as a result he, he slowly and grudgingly wom over some of his detractors.  But he was a, he was a wonderful man for Chicago.
Story_ID: 19397
Speaker 1: At the time you joined the police department, what was your feeling about the historical relationship between black people and the police department in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Back then you didn't have the, the agitation against the police department as you have now.  If you remember back then they had more foot patrolmen.  The police were closer to the, the people back then.  You didn't have that, that open animosity toward the police as you have now.  That changed back in the middle '60s [1960s] on to the middle '70s [1970s] when, during the civil rights movement when the police had the task of regulating conduct on all these marches and all like that and sit-ins and all like that.  Police had the, were the bad guys because they're the ones that had to enforce the laws and, and so they became as a deterrent.  The civil rights people saw them as a deterrent to their objective.  And the police were really put in, in situations where they couldn't win.  In the South they really pushed the--community relations, really suffered as a result of activities by Southern police chiefs in, in, in trying to, trying to break up demonstrations.  And you saw in Birmingham [Alabama] with [Public Safety Commissioner Eugene] 'Bull' Connor and you saw it down in Selma [Alabama] and that information became, that, those incidents became nation, not only nationwide but worldwide.  And it certainly didn't show the police in a bad--in a good light.  Here we had that 1968 police convention where the police was beating up all, not all but some of those protesters downtown on Michigan [Avenue] and it certainly didn't, didn't put the Chicago police in a good light as a result of that activity.  So the police were called on to crowd control and then they--well especially Chicago police weren't equipped and never had been trained.  Police, police officers have been trained to handle individual assignments, problems, not mobs of people.  And for the most part they overreacted and it certainly gave the police department all over the nation a bad name.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Chicago Police Department I guess if we can work at it, could you say that they start, I mean towards--as you were coming in--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --they're making a transition from trying to get away from being the political extension of aldermen, to change the boundaries of the districts and change police practices, made to increase the communication capacity of police and try to be more objective in a sense?  Though at the same time they, they didn't seem to be able to relate to some other problems that were going on with, popping up, they couldn't really deal with that?
Speaker 2: Well it's very difficult to relate to someone that's deliberately sitting down blocking up traffic.  You have the onerous task of opening traffic up and so you don't look good trying to move women and children and old men and people like that out of the street and, and safely put them out on the curb somewhere.  And that's what we had to do in Chicago if you remember Lawrence Landry and [Albert A.] Al Raby.  They're the ones that, that went into civil disobedience, not just demonstrating but civil disobedience by blocking up intersections and things like that.  And the police had to take some action because they're tying, tying up the city.  Now in taking action you can't look good when you, you're forcibly moving women from the middle of the street, but you know there's no way in the world you can look good.  And so as a result police community relations suffered and it's not just in Chicago, just about all over the nation.  They're all over the nation because the civil rights movement was, was active all over the nation, not just here in Chicago, especially in the South.
Story_ID: 19398
Speaker 1: How did you feel as a police officer being in that kind of a situation where people are taking direct action and then you are seen as an extension of the city's will to try to stop it?  I mean did, did you ever feel conflicted about it at the time?
Speaker 2: No I, I was a police officer, I had to do police work and that was police work to be done there and you just had to do it.  Otherwise you just can't refuse to say, you can't refuse to try to bring law and order out of chaos.  That's your job.  And back then they were chaotic times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And placed the police officer right in the middle.  And if you notice, if you ever saw videotapes of the so-called police riot downtown [Chicago, Illinois] you saw black police officers and white police officers engaged in, in activity there that, that people call a police riot you know after the fact.  So it was a situation where you know you should, you hate to see it happen but you, you know, you certainly can't--if someone is blocking up the exit and entry to buildings or streets and all like that and impeding the ability of people to go from point A to point B, it's your job as a police officer to do something about it.  You know you can't politicize that event and say I, I can't, I won't do anything because they're my people or something like that.
Speaker 1: No, I'm just asking--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --because I wanted to know if you ever sympathized with the people that are--.
Speaker 2: Yeah I sympathized with what they were trying to expound but not their method.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you think it's probably a better way to change--?
Speaker 2: Well [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], he, he, he embraced [Mahatma] Gandhi's theories of nonviolence.  That's the reason why he's respected till this day.  His marches were nonviolent.  He, he didn't try to obstruct the normal flow of traffic or anything like that.  In other words his marches were legal insofar as the Constitution is concerned, not insofar as some of the areas where he demonstrated because they had other impediments, needed a permit or things like that.  But he, you had to admire him because he, you know his demonstrations he, he, he preached nonviolence.
Speaker 1: So they did block traffic then, they tried to do things that were illegal (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yeah but they were, yeah but they, they, they--in the South they did.  In the South they did for the simple reason that they wanted to go to jail and they, the Southern places accommodated them.  But you see how, you see the reaction to the Southern police vis-à-vis the Northern police, altogether different, dogs, water hoses and things like that, you didn't see that here in, in no Northern city.
Speaker 1: Well Chicago we did have that police riot in (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah the riot, yeah police beating on, beating on--.
Speaker 1: You had the Democratic [National] Convention [1968]--
Speaker 2: You had the Democratic Convention but we didn't use, never used dogs on, on people, never used fire hoses on people.  So in, in comparing the two efforts to contain marches I think most Northern cities were much more conscious of harming people than what they were in the South.
Story_ID: 19399
Speaker 1: What was it like bring a [Chicago, Illinois] Park District patrol officer?  Did, did you start at the lowest level and work your way up?
Speaker 2: I started as a patrolman with the park district and we had responsibility for the parks, the boulevards and the beaches.  That was our (unclear)--and so it was a much cleaner job than the city.  We didn't have to go up in these apartments separating fights and things like that you know.  So it was a, a much cleaner job than the city, city's job.  You know in retrospect I can compare it cause I got a little bit of both you know.  But the park, the park district advancement, you couldn't advance to much in park because in fact they hadn't had a sergeant's exam in twelve years and as soon as I came over to the city, O.W. [Orlando Winfield] Wilson started having exams every two years.  So I had occasion to take the sergeant's exam almost as soon as I came over to the city.  As a result I was promoted to sergeant.  So he opened, he opened the doors for advancement, especially black officers because it seemed to have had some sort of a, a quota amongst not only black patrol officers, black sergeants too.  When O.W. Wilson came here it was about five black sergeants on the Chicago Police Department and one lieutenant and one captain and that was all the supervisor officers they had.  So it changed radically after O.W. Wilson was here for a few years.
Story_ID: 19400
Speaker 1: During that time then I guess the popular, black population of the police department didn't really reflect the black population--?
Speaker 2: No it still don't.
Speaker 1: --of the city [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I think the black population of the city is about forty, forty five percent now.  Think the police department is up around twenty nine, thirty percent.  So it still doesn't reflect it despite of the fact that--now it's going to be harder because you have a education requirement.  You got to have at least two years of college in order to take the exam and so it's much more difficult to become a police officer now as a result of that.  Most people take two years of, had two years of college have gone probably to get a, a bachelors degree and they seek other horizons rather than being a police officer.
Speaker 1: But do you think that's good to raise the standard?
Speaker 2: Oh certainly for no other reason that the American public is much more educated.  Around thirty, thirty percent of the American public has bachelors degrees now and, and agencies like the police department has to keep up.  Otherwise they'll be looked down upon as just a layman, never, never professional you know just another part of our labor.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I think that for no other reason than that they--it's good to have a minimum educational quota.  Chicago policemen, police department going one step further.  They pay for your tuition according to the grades you get.  If you got a grade A in a subject they'll pay one hundred percent tuition, B, seventy five percent, C, fifty percent.  So they go above and beyond what is normally expected of an agency and encourage people to go back to school and get degrees because they, the trend now is that, is education in policing and whether or not an educated police officer would be a better, make a better police officer than the one that just graduated from high school, the jury is still out.  Certainly it's, it's, it's good to have an educated department I feel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In a city like Chicago don't you think it's probably attractive for people with a college degree to serve on a department that pays and has the benefits that the Chicago police department has?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was talking to a bunch of students over at Illinois [Institute of] Tech [Technology] and I told them if I had to do it over again with all of the benefits, all the goodies you got, I'd go back and really to be a police officer.  Any time you can stay off of a job for one year with some catastrophic sickness or injury and still get paid, that's hard to beat.  Fourteen days of just holiday time, different, different holidays.  You know after you work there you're going to get paid over time for it, fourteen holidays we--Chicago observed every ethnic group's holiday there are.  You got the Polish--what do you call it?
Speaker 1: Pulaski Day?
Speaker 2: You got Pulaski Day and you got the Irish--I--
Speaker 1: St. Patrick's Day.
Speaker 2: St. Patrick's Day, [Dr.] Martin Luther King's Day, Columbus Day and you name, you name the ethnic group and it's a holiday for them every--and they, and if you work you get time and a half so the goodies are there.  You get--most of, most of your medical paid for, you, not only you but your family too and so you got dental benefits, you get, you get a pair of eyeglasses a year, one pair of eyeglasses, not only for you but any member of your family, uniform allowance.  You get twelve--you'd never know it by some of these raggedy police officers but they get twelve hundred dollars a year for uniform allowance.
Story_ID: 19401
Speaker 1: The Irish traditionally controlled the local government in the large Northern cities because when they immigrated into the United States they could speak English and none of the other ethnic groups that immigrated could and so they, they more or less fell heir to run the city and running the city departments.  And you see it not only in Chicago [Illinois] but in other northern cities such as New York [New York], Boston [Massachusetts] where the Irish took over the politics and the running of the city government by default more than any other reason because they could read the, speak and write, read and write English.  And the English, people of English descent certainly didn't want to run these--they were, they considered themselves a step above municipal politics.  So as a result the Irish controlled disproportionately.  I use past tense but I should use present tense because in some places the Irish still control the police departments and the, and the mayor's office.  So that's the situation you have here.  You didn't have an Irish, a, a non-Irish mayor until you had Mayor [Anton Joseph] Cermak,  and he didn't last long.  He got killed.  Then the next non-Irish male you had was [Michael Anthony] Bilandic and then Harold Washington.  Otherwise it's been Irish mayors in the city of Chicago since, almost since time immemorial.  Also in the police department you had Irish police chiefs up until O.W. [Orlando Winfield] Wilson.  O.W. Wilson was of Norwegian descent and he broke the ice here and the only other, up till that time the only other non, non-Irish police superintendent was Richard Brzeczek who was Polish and then came the black superintendents, me, Leroy Martin and then you had a Hispanic in Matt Rodriguez and you got another black superintendent person, [Terry] Hilliard.  But there's traditionally been the police an Irish enclave in most of the big northern cities and Chicago isn't any different.  Now if you notice now there's still Irish still disproportionately control the judge, judges.  If you look at--the next time you go to vote you look at the list of people that's voting, list of people that's running you see predominant Irish names although Irish you got a very small Irish population in the city of Chicago but they run the county offices.  You don't have a big Irish community.  Biggest Irish community I think can think of in Chicago now is Beverly and that's all, that's been integrated fast by blacks and so you don't have any huge Irish population within the city.  So their strength is in the county now.
Story_ID: 19402
Speaker 1: You're a patrol officer, in the [Chicago, Illinois]  park district and you initially moved to the Chicago Police Department in '59 [1959] I think it was?
Speaker 2: '59 yeah.
Speaker 1: '59.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And you take the sergeant's exam I think you told us and you passed--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and became a sergeant?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Took the sergeant's exam.  I took the, this--I took the--I'm getting ahead of myself.  I took the detective's exam first.  That was the first exam that he [Orlando Winfield Wilson] gave in 1960 and I was on the top of that list and I was a detective, detective until '63 [1963] then I made sergeant in 1963 although I took the exam in about '61 [1961] I believe, the sergeant's exam.
Speaker 1: It was better to be a sergeant than a detective, I mean--?
Speaker 2: Certainly it's better.  You tell people, somebody else what to do and not do it yourself if you're a good supervisor.  You're a bad supervisor you do it yourself and let the person that's supposed to be doing it look at you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Your object as a sergeant is a supervisory officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you still in the detective division (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yes, I stayed within the detective division as a sergeant in the burglary section and I supervised investigations on the West Side.  I worked out of the Maxwell Street station, what you see on the television every now and then.
Speaker 1: Hill Street Blues?
Speaker 2: Hill Street Blues, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: An old station.  Incidentally the University of Illinois [Chicago, Illinois] police has remodeled that building and that's their headquarters.  That, all that area now is, belongs to University of Illinois.
Story_ID: 19403
Speaker 1: So what was it like?  Now you've got you know black people are a minority in the [Chicago, Illinois] police department.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And you're--you know it's a police department that's not known for its dynamism in terms of being able to change you know.  And you know [Police Superintendent] O.W. [Orlando Winfield] Wilson is just bending, you know reluctantly towards of a lot of changes and a lot of resentment (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Reluctantly is a good word to use.  So he, he, there was a lot of opposition thrown his way.  But he had the blessing of the mayor and so the opposition didn't, didn't create any problems other than sabotage.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the mayor we're talking about is Mayor--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mayor Richard J. [Daley].  He had the blessing--the mayor is the one that appointed him.
Speaker 1: A powerful mayor.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And so bucking him is just an exercise in futility.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what happened when these different organizations bucked him.  Police are traditionally resistant to change.  It's an organization, very conservative organization and they don't look at change too well.  And they, they're comfortable doing you know today what they did ten, fifteen, twenty years ago.  And I guess it's just a characteristic of the police profession.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And it's--wouldn't you say it has something to do with it being militarian in its--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I think the reason for it is that, that people gravitate to police, the police department certain types of people gravitate to the police department.  And I think those are the type, one of the characteristics is just resistance to change.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but you don't think the structure itself has--?
Speaker 2: That's similar to military structure?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Possibly but I can't see any correlation because--of course the military is also resistant to change too.  They, they fight change too.  Maybe you have a point, I don't know.  I have to give it more thought.
Speaker 1: So at any rate, all of these things kind of combine to make them pretty resistant (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: To change.  But weren't we all, we, we most of us--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 1: But this is true too, most people are resistant to change.
Speaker 2: Look at change with suspicion.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's why before you--in an organization before you make change you have to explain it and explain it and explain it and make people comfortable with the change or more comfortable than what they were.  You never make them fully comfortable.
Speaker 1: That's a good point.  Everybody is pretty much resistant to a lot of change.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And the police department probably attracts those who are more resistant and the structure doesn't help with change, pretty much, so--
Speaker 2: I get on my wife when I want the scissors, I want to get the scissors where they normally are in the drawer in the kitchen.  And if they're somewhere else it just throws me off you know.  I like to place things down in certain place where I can go back and get them and she's the reverse, you know.  And so I have to battle all the time, put it back where it belongs.  Well it's better here.  Well let me know you know battling each other about little changes, you know, because we're comfortable with what we did yesterday the way we did it yesterday.
Story_ID: 19404
Speaker 1: Now in those days I guess any black person on the police department was someone who was making a big change because there weren't that many blacks anyway.  So--.
Speaker 2: Now it wasn't that many blacks back in the '50s [1950s].  Blacks began coming on the job in increasing numbers after O.W. [Orlando Winfield] Wilson came in because he was have, he was having entrance exams every two, two years.  And so you saw an increase from about eight percent when O.W. Wilson got here and so I think when he left it was around twelve, fourteen percent black.  So it, it increased the amount of black--it certainly increased the amount of black supervisory officers considerably(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: It just about doubled.
Speaker 2: Yeah, considerably.  Yeah, 'cause it wasn't many to begin with.  I have a picture of, at the time when [James M.] Rochford was superintendent where, of all of the exempt personalities that were there when Rochford was superintendent back in the early '70s [1970s], only a handful of us.  So it wasn't a great jump in exempt, exempt personnel is what--I don't know if you understand what exempt person.  Exempt from civil service rules, they're appointed and they serve on the, the superintendent serve--the superintendent appoints and can remove them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What they call exempt personnel.  Anybody above the captain, above the rank of captain in the police department are exempt people.
Speaker 1: So in other words a superintendent could create a commander out of someone who is a captain--and they can (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Well if someone--.
Speaker 1: --bring them back down to captain if they wanted to (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, or could make a commander out of a sergeant or a patrolman because he's exempt from civil service rules.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And they have no job security.  Only job security you have is if you're under civil service rank then you have job security.  Otherwise you serve at the whim of the superintendent.
Speaker 1: Do you think that creates a very loyal group for a superintendent?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, yeah more so.  That's what O.W. Wilson had to face.  He brought in the exempt category.  He wanted some people that he chose to run the organization because they were stabbing him in the back.  So he felt that if he could appoint his own command staff independent of civil service or the exams that he could gain better control of the department.  He was correct too.
Story_ID: 19405
Speaker 1: What were some of the memorable events in the 1960s at the Chicago [Illinois] Police Department?
Speaker 2: Oh the '60s [1960s].  Oh, the '50s [1950s], I can't think of anything in the '50s [1950s] that were extraordinary but the '60s [1960s], I was in the middle of all those West Side riots.  I was lucky on the, when the [Democratic National] Convention [1968] came in, I was a lieutenant at the time.  I was stationed at The Amphitheater and not on Michigan [Avenue] so I missed that excitement.  But the Martin Luther King riot [1968], the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] riot [1969] downtown so I was in the middle of all of that.  So those things remain indelible in my memory.  Also I was the district commander at the Englewood District when they, when they [civil rights demonstrators including Martin Luther King, Jr.] marched on Marquette Park [1966].  They were marching on Marquette Park just about every night and that was kind of harrowing.  And then you had the Nazi party over there and they wanted to march into the black community and, and people with shotguns and rifles were waiting on them and so it was really turmoil and a lot of chaos.  When I went over to the Englewood district I had a head full of hair.  Left there didn't--baldheaded.  So it was quite a bit of police activity all during that area, that era.  But I'd say from 1965 to nineteen, oh it's quieted down about 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any vivid stories say from the Marquette Park march that you remember?  We've heard stories around here from some of the marches and they're still hearing some stories from police officers who were on the scene.  I know there was a great deal of rock throwing.
Speaker 2: Yes, and matter of fact the--.
Speaker 1: And some shooting too?
Speaker 2: I don't recall any shooting but there certainly was rock, lot of rock throwing.  I had, I thought I could get away without putting on a helmet but I put on a helmet when a few rocks came my way in one instance.  The big march, the last march we, that they made out there we had to pull in a lot of police officers cause the first time they marched over there we were outnumbered.  We just couldn't protect them.  So the next time we had, oh we had, oh we had almost a thousand police officers protect those marchers.  And so we managed to get them in there and, and they made their prayers right in the middle of Marquette Park and then they left.  But we had to have a lot of police officers guarding them because those people over there were very anti-black and they were resorting not to gun, I don't remember any gunfire but they resorted to throwing stones and glass bottles and things like that at the police.  And we had a few injuries but nothing serious because of the fact that there were no, no gun play, gun play out there.  You had some dents probably but I don't recall any, any gun play by the police or by the citizens either.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you think that those marches were handled successfully by the Chicago Police Department?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Any time we can get marchers in, into an antagonistic area and get them out safely you can, only thing you can say is you're successful because it's not just like marching downtown.  You're marching in a very hostile area and same with the Cicero [Chicago, Illinois] and [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] march in Cicero [1966].  It was a very hostile area and your main thrust is, is to make sure you have sufficient police officers to protect the marches, otherwise you're going to lose the battle.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Some of the marchers have reported that cars were tampered with where they were parked.  I think they parked in, at some place and then marched into Cicero.  When they came back they said that their gas tanks had been tampered with, sugar poured in the gas intake and that some cars set on fire and other things.  Did you ever hear of any--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Oh certainly yeah.  We had cars with women in them stopped and turned over and set on fire, women passing through the Marquette area.  So yes there were instances of, of that.  We had to set up police officers at major intersection to tell the black people to go around the area.  The officers were afraid to let them through there because the mob would stomp them and beat them up or turn their car over and burn it up.  So we had instances of that.
Story_ID: 19406
Speaker 1: As you continue as a sergeant into the latter part of the '60s [1960s], I mean when do you--do you get promoted from sergeant or something (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was promoted from sergeant to lieutenant in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at the time they sent me out to the Burnside Station, 91st [Street] and Cottage Grove [Chicago, Illinois] to put, put me in charge of robbery investigators.  I didn't stay there too long.  They brought me downtown and put me in charge of the gang intelligence unit.  Have to remember back in the middle and late '60s [1960s] the Blackstone Rangers on the South Side and Conservative Black, Conservative Vice Lords were the big gangs on the West Side and Disciples were over in Englewood and we had a real big gang problem.  It was, incidentally it was aided and abetted by certain people that felt that they, the gangs had some good in them and they could be reformed and they could be made to model citizens.  You had Reverend [John] Fry out there in Woodlawn and a few more ministers that embraced the gangs.  But the gang was really wreaking havoc all over the, the black community and the West Side and the South Side.  In fact the Blackstone Rangers literally tore up East Woodlawn, tore it up.  And so we assigned two hundred police officers, I was in charge of two hundred police officers trying to combat those gangs.  They did a good job.  We invited the hierarchy of the Blackstone Rangers and they went to jail and, but they were still being--growing everyday though so the gang problem still--but I don't think it's as acute now as it was back then because now they're more or less in narcotics and when they kill and shoot each other now they, as a result of competition in selling narcotics.  Back then they were just gang banging, then they became sophisticated and started, and got more from the federal government.  Federal government gave the Blackstone Rangers a million dollars for their efforts in cleaning up the gangs.  They gave--put the rabbit in the briar patch, you know.  The Vice Lords, Sears gave them, Sears Roebuck gave them a substantial amount of money just to keep that area around Sears Headquarters free of gang activity.  Those guys on the West Side went and bought Cadillacs with their money.  But that's the reason Jeff Fort--more of the money on the West Side was Sears but the money on the South Side was government money.  The government made a case against them saying that they didn't use that money for the purpose it was intended and that's, that's how we got Jeff Fort indicted by the federal government, not for gang banging but for misusing of government money.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  A lot of people don't know that and he's still in jail.
Speaker 1: Now you were superintendent when that, right, I think--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You weren't?
Speaker 2: No, I was superintendent in '83 [1983].  At that time I was commander of the gang intelligence unit.
Story_ID: 19407
Speaker 1: Now there was also a lot of tension in, around 1968 and '69 [1969] concerning groups of political dissidents and that were being mentioned in the same breath as gangs in the city or one being the Black Panther Party.  Do you remember, you have any reflections on the Fred Hampton case?
Speaker 2: Yeah he scared, he scared the hell out of the white structure in this town [Chicago, Illinois] because they saw him as a very dangerous threat because of their rhetoric.  "Off the pig" and, and the barrel, "Freedom comes from the barrel, from the barrel of a gun."  They'd walk around in a military uniform with tams on, with a rifle slung all over their shoulders and they scared the dickens out of the, the white establishment.  And that's why you had that FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] raid over there on West Monroe [Street] where Fred Hampton [along with fellow Panther Mark Clark] was killed.  That was their reaction to all of that dangerous rhetoric.  They never did--in Oakland they were, they were violent but around Chicago they, they just talked of battle.  They didn't do anything untoward to precipitate any combat with the police or the FBI.  But the FBI got some warrants on, on some people and they went over to Monroe Street to serve them in conjunction with Chicago police and you know, you know what happened, the shootout.  Fred Hampton was killed.  But they took the Black Panthers much more serious in the black community.  Black community didn't--felt that--some, some people in the black community felt it was a positive force because they had certain programs that were on the West Side dealing with young, breakfast, feeding breakfast and things like that, you know.  And so they got good PR [public relations] as a result of--but they never did, they weren't anywhere near as bad as the Blackstone Rangers or the [Conservative] Vice Lords.  They didn't kill anybody black or white.  They had, all they did was meet and throw out a lot of rhetoric that scared the hell out of everybody.
Speaker 1: Now did, did the FBI, or I think it was States Attorney [Edward V.] Hanrahan at the time I think, did they consult with you at all about their plans to raid the Panthers?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No I didn't know anything about it.  He didn't use my men [the Chicago Police Department's gang intelligence unit] at all.  I didn't know anything about it until after it occurred.  They used some Chicago police but none, none of my men.  I don't know where they came from.  And they used FBI agents and there was overreaction all the way but the Black Panthers had them so afraid you know with those, knowing that they had a lot of guns and that was what it was about recovering those illegal guns.  And, and all it takes is one shot and oh, the devil broke loose, you know.
Speaker 1: Well you know the subsequent investigation showed that it, it wasn't a shot fired from the apartment out.  All the bullet holes went in the door.
Speaker 2: In the door, yeah.  All it takes is one, one nervous trigger to start you know start it off.
Speaker 1: Right.  So how did you feel about that at the time?  Did you think--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: I thought it was an overreaction.  It wasn't necessary and they didn't give anybody an opportunity to surrender and I think it's, it was out of fear more so than any other reason.  But it was strictly an overreaction all the way.
Story_ID: 19408
Speaker 1: And now in 1968 as well there's another activity within the police department that's going on and that's the formation of the African American Patrolman's League.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the American Patrolman's League was started earlier than '68 [1968], around '60 [1960], I don't know about '65 [1965] something like that.  Started by three guys, Renault Robinson, Sadler [sic, Howard Saffold], and another light complexion guy.  I can't think of his name.
Speaker 1: [Edward] Buzz Palmer.
Speaker 2: Buzz Palmer, oh you, you remember, you got a good memory.  And they're the ones that started the Afro American Police Association and they're the ones that agitated for change.  They, they're the ones that brought suit against the Chicago [Illinois] Police Department alleging that, discrimination and they won that suit.  And as a result they put the Chicago Police Department on the quota system, X number of blacks to be hired and be promoted, women, females too were included there.  That's when we had to open, open the gates for female police officers as a result of that suit.  But the city, I say the city lost it but it was, it was a consent decree between the city and the courts.  I don't think it ever went to trial, think it was just a consensus decree between the city and the courts under Judge [Prentice] Marshall's, in Marshall's courtroom.  I could be wrong but I can't remember any trial.  Seemed like it was a, they settled it with a consent decree.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think you're right.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  And as a result you saw more and more blacks coming in and not only as supervisors but patrol officers too and then you saw females coming in.  I hear they're coming in, in great numbers now but back then you know it was one or two a class.  But you couldn't, that, that particular consent decree protected females too.  So the department, result of that suit the department opened up reluctantly but they opened up because of the courts.  And so one thing you can say about the Afro American Police Association they did, that was, that was the main thing that they did as an organization was be the plaintiffs in that suit.
Story_ID: 19409
Speaker 1: What were the major issues in the Chicago [Illinois] Police Department in the '70s [1970s] I mean from, I know after Fred Hampton I know that case went to trial and that was a constant tension around that case going on.
Speaker 2: As a result, yeah.
Speaker 1: --probably didn't affect daily life in the police department as well.
Speaker 2: As a result [States Attorney Edward V.] Hanrahan lost the election the next time he ran cause the black voters turned out against him if you remember correctly.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So the issues in the '70s [1970s] were as the issues are now, police, excessive use of force by police, police not ridding the neighborhoods of narcotics, that's a big area of discussion.  Think those are the two.  The excessive force seems to be, always be a problem in any police department for the simple reason the police has the onerous task of regulating conduct and order maintenance.  Sometimes it takes, sometimes people just don't willingly do what they're supposed to do.  You have to arrest them.  And then in arresting them you're going to have people that resist arrest.  You're always are going to have police officers that, that will utilize their office to brutalize people too.  So a good example is that Area Two [police station].  They're still investigating.  I hear they brought in a new panel to investigate using excessive force by that commander out there, I forget his name.
Speaker 1: [Jon] Burge.
Speaker 2: Burge, yeah.  Gee your memory is very good.  And you know of course the statute of limitations are gone.  I don't know what they're going to do with the investigation when they finish, except point fingers and say--
Speaker 1: I think a judge reopened it, actually.  I mean he's actually liable for prosecution because it, it wasn't handled properly in the first place.
Speaker 2: He's been prosecuted though once.
Speaker 1: Well--.
Speaker 2: Could be double, double jeopardy too I don't know.
Speaker 1: Actually I think a police action is taken by the department to relieve him of his duties--.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah he was fired.
Speaker 1: But he, but he, he got his retirement benefits and went to Florida. I don't think he was  ever criminally prosectued.
Speaker 2: Yeah maybe you're right. Yeah he was fired and he went down to Florida.
Story_ID: 19410
Speaker 1: We were just talking about [Chicago Police Department Area Two Commander] Jon Burge and the torture allegations up in Area Two [police station].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you know police brutality is always an issue in police departments, Chicago [Illinois] being no exception.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: How did you--did you have to, ever have to deal with those kind of cases (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the first time I dealt with them because I, because I, I saw it was a problem and also the mayor, Mayor Harold Washington if you remember he ran on a platform of get rid of the Office of Professional Standards, get rid of it.  So when I came in, I told him you have to have some means to investigate that excuse of excessive of force.  You just can't get rid of the unit without putting something in its place, otherwise who's going to do the investigating?  He said well they're not efficient.  Well we'll change the unit.  So what I did was I brought in a criminal justice scholar, scholar, teacher from UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] by the name of David Fogel, not a police officer, been in academia all his life and put him in charge of OPS [Office of Professional Standards] and gave him carte blanche to pick his people.  So he picked his own staff and his own, own supervisor and all and began investigating use of excessive force and next couple of years we were down twenty five percent in complaints of excessive force.  My administration was not a problem when it comes to the use of excessive force.  That incident you're talking about out in Area Two, Burge, that mostly occurred under [Richard] Brzeczek.  And in fact all of it occurred under Brzeczek.  So I, I was proud of that accomplishment that we managed to cut down the complaints around twenty five percent and so that's how we just, we just completely gutted the old Office of Professional Standards.  And most of the investigators were there were appointed by Jane, through Jane Byrne you know political appointees and not because of their proficiency in investigations at all.
Story_ID: 19411
Speaker 1: I wanted to go back to the '70s [1970s], late '70s [1970s], middle of the '70s [1970s] before we get into the Harold Washington campaign and all that.  But I know I think when [Richard] Brzeczek was--well the black community was clamoring at one time for a black superintendent and I think we had an interim superintendent--.
Speaker 2: Sam Nolan.
Speaker 1: Sam Nolan, right.  And you want to discuss what happened there and--?
Speaker 2: Well when Jane Byrne came in, she came in on the platform of getting rid of [James E.] O'Grady.  O'Grady was the superintendent prior to Jane Byrne being mayor.  And so he quit rather than her get rid of him, he quit and then we had succession of acting superintendents, [Michael] Spiotto, Mike Spiotto was one, [Joseph G.] Joe DiLeonardi was another and Sam Nolan was another.  But they were acting superintendents until such time as the police board could give her three names of the, the best qualified candidates.  That's how police superintendents were chosen.  And she chose Brzeczek as one of the three.  She wanted Reardon [ph.] but Reardon didn't want the job, First Deputy Superintendent Reardon.  He didn't want the job so Brzeczek got the job.  And, and so he was appointed.  She--that was--he was Jane Byrne's superintendent at the time.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name?  You might not be able to but just for the sake of the tape, you know.
Speaker 2: I don't--.
Speaker 1: Richard Brzeczek.
Speaker 2: B-R-C-Z-Z--C-C-Z-E-K is close as I can get.  He has every letter in the alphabet in his name.  But I followed Brzeczek after Harold Washington election and it was a hot election too because if you remember was on television in uniform telling people to vote for Jane Byrne or the city [Chicago, Illinois] won't be safe and things like that.  He really got involved in partisan politics.
Speaker 1: Even before that there was another police scandal involving Jane Byrne and Brzeczek and it was called "killing crime"--do you remember that (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Yeah, they had, they caught the Chicago Police Department classifying crime downward, felonies to misdemeanors and felonies to unfounded and misdemeanors to unfounded to make the city look good.  And there was one young lady on Channel 2, I forget her name, she's the one that exposed--she's a really good investigator.  When she goes on the air she has a--.
Speaker 1: Pam Zekman.
Speaker 2: Pam Zekman, yeah.  You got a good memory.  I wish I had your mind.  Yeah Pam Zekman exposed it and it was a great embarrassment, you know.  Crime tickets were doctored more or less to make the city looks good, look good and we had to change procedure.
Speaker 1: I think some even hit the wastebasket right, before they even got--?
Speaker 2: You can't say it was in the wastebasket because you got all of them have numbers.  All these numbers have to be accounted for so you usually have to get on a, get on the typewriter and unfounded for some reason or reclassified.  Throw in the wastebasket you'd have a, have a void of numbers just like a checkbook you know.  So each, each criminal incident has what they call an RD number.  Do that, that's a good way to get caught right away throwing, throwing in, in the, thing in the wastebasket.  Yeah that was brought out during his, during his regime and very embarrassing to the police department but they caught with their hands in the cookie jar, simple as that.
Speaker 1: So there was an issue for reformers to talk about you know--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --prior to the election of Harold Washington (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Oh yes always issues in any election, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) "killing crime."
Speaker 2: There was a lot of issues and politicians manufactured issues.  It was always, especially the police is so controversial, there's always an issue pertaining to police.  They're doing too much of this, they're not doing enough of that you know.  It's always one, one thing or the other.  So the issues was that and police brutality and OPS [Office of Professional Standards].  OPS was an issue at the time if you remember and what else?  Few other things, yeah a few other things was a issue you know.
Speaker 1: I do remember Harold Washington was very strident about the issue of police brutality--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and OPS, he was--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, but we could have done, we could have done quite a bit.  It wasn't a, it wasn't a problem when I was superintendent.  It wasn't a problem that the citizens, citizens hung on to you know because we did adjust ourselves to it you know and it, and effectively cut down the amount of, of complaints.
Story_ID: 19412
Speaker 1: The black community you know after electing Harold Washington mayor expected some you know one of the big issues was the police department.  And people expected some dramatic change in the police department.  And so can you tell me what, what were changes--?
Speaker 2: You remember correctly I reduced, got rid of, transferred about eighty five people for the simple reason that I felt that I was exposed to the saboteurs because you remember that election, police department was active in that election.  We had detectives going to project buildings checking voting rolls.  He had automobiles, police automobiles with stickers, Vote for Jane Byrne on, on--if you go into, you went to a police station you saw election paraphernalia and posters and all like that, very politicized the police department was.  And that was another one of Harold Washington's platform is to get the police out, politics out of the police department.  So he, he stressed that too.  So, but--trying to think of something else that came up during that campaign.  I can't, off the top of my head I can't think of anything else.
Speaker 1: Well one dramatic thing I mean I think primarily pivotal, that was the appointment of you.  That was--you probably forgot, appointing you in the first place, that was a big, dramatic change.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that was Harold Washington's--the system you know he just can't arbitrarily appoint a superintendent.  He has, the police board has to interview candidates and I think then we had about seventy five candidates, and give him the three best candidates and he can either choose one of the three or throw the list back to the police board and tell them to give me three more.  I'm unhappy with any of these three, three more, give me three more.  And so I happened to be one of the three and people just knew that Mayor Washington must have interceded, interceded with the police board to get me appointed.  But he--they forget that that police board was Jane Byrne's police board not Harold Washington's police board.  Jane Byrne put, put those people in there.  And they work in, and they, they work in staggered terms you know.  And so, but he--I knew Harold Washington.  I knew him because when I was Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] district commander that was his state senatorial district when he was down, down in Springfield [Illinois] before he became congress, congressman.  So he was, I was just about the only person outside of [Howard] Saffold and, and Renault Robinson he knew in the police department.  He was totally unfamiliar with the, with the police department and its personnel.
Story_ID: 19413
Speaker 1: Now you were, at the time when you were chosen by the police board as well as the candidates weren't you chief of patrol?
Speaker 2: Chief of patrol, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's probably--that's one of the most powerful positions in the police department if not you know, next to the superintendent (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yeah it's a power, it's a powerful position because you got most of your personnel under you, about 8,000, 8,000 people, personnel people but still you got bosses over you.  You got first deputy superintendent and you got the superintendent so you just can't act at your will.  You have to you know, you have to seek their permission for any move that you make.  But for the simple reason just like I, when I made all my moves with the exempt officers I didn't seek the mayor's [Harold Washington] approval but I had, gave him the courtesy to go down and let him know what was going on.  Because he didn't, I don't think he wanted any parts of the police department at that time number one because you know he had been gone, he's going to jail because of that little income tax rack--rap.  And that was played up by his detractors that he was a jail bird and all like that.  And so I guess he felt that he'd stay away from the police department otherwise they'll accuse him of manipulating the police department, this ex-convict.  You know he more or less stayed away from the police department and they'd tell you, they say I had the, the best tour of duty as a superintendent than anybody because I was free from politics from the mayor, not from all the aldermen and everybody else that has a phone.  They're always calling asking for this, that and the other, you know.  But long as all of them are asking for something legal and ethical these are aldermen you know you have to, have you see if you can accommodate him, you know.  And so people say well you're bringing politics into your job, you're not.  But they, they confuse politics with a little P with politics with a capital.  Politics with a little P is really clout, but politics capital is capital, people that's out there duly elected by people and represent the people.  And you have to serve them so long as it's ethical and legal.  You can't back off, aldermen or anybody else that's elected by the people and have a legitimate concern or problem that the police can address themselves too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when, when you are selected superintendent by Mayor Washington--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --lot of excitement in the black community.  You are really the first black superintendent--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --of the Chicago [Illinois] police department.
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, if you--Sam Nolan, Sam Nolan was the acting superintendent.
Speaker 1: Yeah but you're, you're the first--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yeah but confirmed by the, by the city council.  Sam Nolan never was put up to be permanent superintendent.  He just filled in.
Speaker 1: So how did you--did, had you resolved to do certain things before you, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well I didn't know I was going to be, be superintendent to tell you the truth because I applied when they made [James E.] O'Grady superintendent.  I didn't make it but I got a promotion.  I got a promotion to deputy chief.  Then I applied again when [Richard] Brzeczek made superintendent and I didn't make it then but I was promoted to chief of patrol.  I said gee if I apply again I might get another promotion and lo and behold the next time they, they appointed me.  And, and I knew that job was difficult.  It's a twenty four hour a day job cause I've seen other superintendents work.  And, and it's a long day.  You got your, all of your appointments during the day and then in the evening you're all, you invariably have some place to go, community organization meeting or something so you're working twenty four hours a day.  Soon as you get home and get to bed the phone rings, some police officer is shot or shot somebody and you're back up again.  So it's really rough on you psychologically and physically.  So I didn't, really didn't relish the job but you know after he chose me I took it anyway and, but I took it with great trepidation because I knew the type of life I'd have to live being superintendent.
Story_ID: 19414
Speaker 1: And you also had the added feature of controversy too around just the fact that you were black in charge of this police force that's been you know controlled by the white community for such a long time.  And then you also had the appointments that I guess were made in terms of Harold Washington's own staff of body guards and stuff, members of the--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't, I didn't, I wasn't involved in it except checking, of probing.  If you remember Saffold, Harold Washington put Howard Saffold in charge of his bodyguards that I had hired, chief of bodyguards, but I had laid down some restrictions to make sure those guys get a shave and a haircut, some of them and, and wear a suit and tie everyday.  They represent not themselves but the Mayor.  So if you remember seeing them they always had a suit and tie on and so that was some of, some of the restrictions I gave them.  You can't go out here you know with those, those open shirts and all like that guarding the mayor you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time though I mean you know the appointment of these, you being superintendent who will think you're responsible and you probably, I would guess unless I'm wrong, you know got a great deal of flack for the appointment of a man like Harold Saffold probably ?
Speaker 2: (Smultaneously) Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: Politically I would say the--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --white power structure as the main man for the mayor, you know he had command status I think at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah he had command.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So the whole group who was on the outside, you know the whole group on the outside, on the [Afro-American] Patrolman's League becomes an inner sanctum you know of the mayor (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: They came to be his bodyguards because he chose people that he was familiar with and so it was all right with me as long as they adhered to you know good dress and, and they're not a bunch of hoodlums themselves.  We checked all of them out you know for the records and outside of minor suspensions all of them passed, passed being checked out you know.  So--but you're right the, they resigned themselves, the detractors resigned themselves to the fact that a black mayor and he don't choose his own people.  Now a black superintendent he's going to choose his own people.  I did more, there were seventy eight, seventy eight changes I made within six months after I became superintendent and for obvious reasons.  I had saboteurs all around me, sensitive cases, sensitive reports were being delivered down to city hall.  If you remember you had that 2921 controversy, very sensitive reports were sneaked down you know in city hall so I had conspiracy all around me.  But after I got through getting rid of those people and getting my own people in I, it certainly cut down.  But that was a key to, to I think to my ability to properly supervise the department is to bring my own people in.  And in doing so I brought quite a few blacks in because I had been familiar with a lot of the black command officers you know and so I made, and I trusted them.  As a result I got sued and I won all the suits but I was going to court three or four years after I retired still hearing those suits.
Speaker 1: Yeah there were white police officers who sued you for racial discrimination.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.  Yeah um-hmm, so--but they lost everyone of those cases because it's, it's precedent for an individual like a mayor in a department to pick his own people.  And that's been the custom all, for quite a while.
Speaker 1: Maybe you can comment on this, I have heard, I've heard and heard police experts say that there's a five-ninety-five rule for police conduct and the rule goes like this.  They say, five percent of officers would never violate their job in order to do a good job and always do what they're supposed to do and be courteous and respectful and efficient and so forth.  Ninety percent of officers--no five percent will violate the rules when they can and brutalize people and do all other kinds of weird things that could get the department in trouble to keep the city in court and keep the community distrusting of the police and the other ninety percent will watch the other five percent and see which way, where they're gonna be on that given day depending on what they can get away with or what they don't want to do or, yeah.  And that's the basic rule.  Do you find that to be true?
Speaker 2: Well the police officers you see violating the rules and regulations, so darn many regulations that cover everything.  You jump out of your squad car without your hat you're violating a regulation.  And it's so many regulations that govern police conduct that I'd say about ninety percent of police officers break them one way or the other there's so many regulations.  You got a thick, book of regulations this thick and also state statutes that thick and so small, small, you're going to have small violations.  But our main concern as administrators is with the big violations most of them you know like disrespectful to people and bribery, corruption, and excessive force.  That's, that's, that's what will kill you, bribery, corruption and excessive force will ruin your tenure as, as a police superintendent.  So that's what you really couldn't, you know.  But you, you got to watch them things.  You--I used a system where I had inspectors.  I increased my inspectors to about twenty, twenty inspectors and certain things that I think that we're falling down on, I sent my inspectors out to write those people up and hold the supervisors responsible for permitting it, for permitting it.  And so that was the way I exercised control because you know you're up at the top and you have 13,000 police officers below you and 2,000 civilians and you have to develop some method and all, all sorts of ranks in between.  Communication is a problem.  Communication from up-down and from down-up.  So it's one thing to sit back there in headquarters and issue orders, next thing make sure the order has been adhered to.  And so you have to develop methods to make sure that your orders are being complied with.  Otherwise they're not, they'll forget about it.  Good example is this incident out here at 9-1, they call 9-1-1 and the police officers didn't show up until twenty minutes later.  Well they're supposed to, soon as they show up at the scene they're supposed to by computer let the communications center know about it.  That's in rules and regulations.  They didn't do it and they found out nobody else did it.  Other words it's, superintendent wasted his time by, by making it an order telling them to do that.  And that's what will happen if you don't make sure if your order is enforced.
Speaker 1: Yeah and it's an order that could have protected them had they--.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And supervisors, no one, none of the supervisors insisted that they do it.  In other words there's an order in the book that specifically state the procedure in arriving at scenes, totally disregarded, totally.  And that's, that will, that will happen in a large organization provided you don't set up some method to monitor compliance.
Story_ID: 19415
Speaker 1: Now during your tenure as superintendent under Harold Washington, did you--I mean how did it go?  How did it go?  Do you--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: I think it went smooth.  We set up, we created a lot of waves initially.  Remember every alderman and his brother had bodyguards. I got rid of all the bodyguards with the exception of [Edward M.] Burke and [Edward R.] Vrdolyak.  They took me to court and, and they're going right to circuit court and the judge that knows them, they drink with him probably every week.  He ruled against me and I had to give them their bodyguards back.  But I came in wrangling you know wrangling them because they were quite angry with me to begin with, not only the white aldermen, black aldermen too.  I want my bodyguards.  They're using police officers as go-fers and, and chauffeurs and no one has ever threatened you or anything.  You're not in any danger but they used them as servants and police officers are expensive.  And when you bring police officers down there and use them in such a way you take, you take police officers off the street to do it.  So I created and of course I, I, I dropped a lot of heavy, heavy police commanders, deputy chiefs, people that were familiar that the other administration placed in there.  One of them was [William] Hanhardt, you been reading about Hanhardt.  There's always been a rumor about him for years, that's the first thing--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: He was involved in a jewel heist--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the Loop [downtown Chicago, Illinois] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Hanhardt right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was one of the first I, I got rid of.  So I wouldn't--they didn't like me.  Matter of fact aldermen, aldermen tried to pass a rule in the city council that prior to any change in procedure I had to get, get city council's permit, permission.  I said hell we can't agree to, with each other.  I'm not going to wait for them to, to okay a procedure and they're fighting each other down there.  The procedure never would come into being.  But that's how, that's how they tried to emasculate me initially but I put my foot down and said now you're usurping the responsibilities not only of the police superintendent but the executive branch of government.  Executive branch of government controls the police not the legislative branch so they backed off.  But that was what they were trying to do, they were trying to strip me of power to, what power I had to run the department.

Speaker 1: Now this day and age you know I don't have too much anyway because of unionism. Everybody's unionized.  I'd hate to be superintendent now, everyone's unionized except the superintendent.
Speaker 2: So that is an issue that was new basically--(unclear)(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Yeah it's new.
Speaker 2: And then when you became superintendent the union in Chicago [Illinois] was created under Jane Byrne--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Fraternal Order of Police came in under the Jane Byrne administration--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Yeah that was her platform that everyone, everyone would be able to join a union and first thing the fire department did was strike against her, a nasty strike too because it involved police officers enforcing the law against firemen.  Very nasty because they got violent, drunk and violent against the police, and they had to be locked up.  So that was really a nasty strike and it still, repercussions are still being felt because she hired quite a few strike breakers if you remember and gave them a, gave them a job once the strike was over.  And I hear there's still bitterness in some fire stations against those guys that were hired as a result of being a strike breaker.  But she's the one that opened the door to unionism.  Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, Sr. didn't want any city worker unionized, police or anybody else but he was just like a benevolent despot.  He gave us a raise every year you know just to keep us happy to keep from wanting to unionize and he succeeded and when he died it was a non-union city with the exception of the crafts.  But no one else was unionized so that was something that has been relatively new in the city of Chicago, not New York [New York].  New York has had police unions, fire unions for a much longer time and so when they go to negotiate with the city they usually get some kind of goodies.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your, because there's something I haven't asked about your tenure as superintendent under Harold Washington.  Is there something else you want to tell us about it and how did it end?  We want to know what you (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well it ended real, real nice.  I always liked Harold.  I thought he was a very good man.  He was a very effective public speaker.  I used to go out in neighborhoods with him every week and I was just enthralled by the way he could, he handles the English language and, and get his points across.  I think he's one of the most articulate mayors we've had in the city [Chicago, Illinois].  Of course he hadn't had too much competition.  But, but I thought, thought he was really good when it comes to handling people.  He, he never, never called me and asked me for, to do these favors for anyone or anything like that, never did.  In fact every time I had contact with him is when I'd call him on something that I thought he should know.  It's newsworthy and hit the papers I'd call and let him, to keep him abreast of what's happening so he could be prepared.  You know he wouldn't get, he wouldn't get surprised and that's the only time that--but he, he never did ask me about putting certain people here and there and anything like that.  In fact, in fact he left me alone.  He had the--an assistant, Mike Holowinski that was always on the phone wanting this and that and the other but not Harold.  And you have your politicians, they're always calling the police superintendent about wanting something you know wanting extra patrol or something like that.  And most of the time it's a legitimate request you know.  It's every now and then they want you to do something unethical or something like that.  But to answer your question I got along with Harold very well.
Speaker 1: And how did your term end (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I, I was tired and I had maxed out.  I was sixty one years of age at the time and had thirty-two and a half years of service so I had maxed out on my pension.  I was working for nothing because I could make money, more money staying at home looking out the window than going to work.  And I was pretty tired in that four years of being bombarded with problems and not getting your rest, no family life, anything like that so that was the reason why I decided to, to retire.  And once I retired I stayed at home a whole year resting before I did anything.  And after that I took a job teaching over at UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago, Illinois] and I took a job for a firm that's out in the suburbs but just part time.  I never did work full time anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right now I'm not doing anything.  My health has failed me you know.  And so all I'm doing now is taking it easy and resting.

Speaker 1: There have been some changes in the Chicago Police Department since you retired.  Leroy Martin was selected by Harold Washington as superintendent and shortly thereafter Harold Washington died and you know we have a new mayor and community groups.  I want to ask you about community groups.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Community groups I know during your tenure as superintendent organized community groups you know were during your tenure called for more, I mean for a faster response to 9-1-1--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --was a big issue at that time.  And then later on it matured into a call for community policing in the '90s [1990s] after you had left.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And how do you feel about--do you think the community really knows what it wants or how did you feel about dealing with community complaints?
Speaker 2: The community, most people in the community want good policing.  They feel that they should have good policing and most community organizers, community presidents or whatever you want to call them usually work well with the, the police.  It's only very few police, community people that relish in an antagonistic relation with the police department.  The police need the community because we can't see everything, we don't know everything and certainly if we're making an arrest we need some community person to be in court as a complainant otherwise they'll throw the case out.  So it's, it's something, it's a necessity that the police work as closely as possible with the community.  And conversely the community should have a, should work as closely as possible with the police if they're going to succeed.  And from my experience most community organizations with the exception of one or two has a very cooperative relationship with the police.  Sometimes they get disillusioned and disappointed sometimes but, and on the whole we need the police, we need the citizens, the police and the citizens certainly need us.  And that's the whole, whole rationale behind community policing is get the community involved with the police and the police involved with the community.  Now from what I hear in certain neighborhoods it's working very well.  Other neighborhoods where there's a lot of transiency not too well.  I can, can't see it working too well in say a high rise project with people coming and going.  And but, usually in middle class bungalow type areas, community policing is very strong because you have that permanence of home, home ownership in those areas.

Speaker 1: Chicago has, seems to be having a big--it's funny the current police chief of Washington, D.C. who is a former community policeman--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --here in the city of Chicago [Illinois] and you--the city's done a lot of Chicago police--I mean the Chicago police presence seems to be widely spread than you know you think (unclear).  Do you think that Chicago is really ahead of other major cities in terms of its police department or about--?
Speaker 2: In what respect?
Speaker 1: In any respect, you know.  What do you think?  You think we're--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: Some we're, we're, yeah.  Some we're ahead and some we, we might be a little behind.  We certainly, we're ahead of New York [New York] police department and Los Angeles [California] police department is just rife with dissention so, so we're ahead of them.  Most big city--but I can't think of any big city police department that I could say that's ahead of Chicago.  Maybe medium sized police departments, yes.  But technologically and scientifically you can't beat the Chicago police department.  I was out, down there the other day in the--in where they keep their records and found out that everything is all automated now, fingerprints and everything, records and everything all automated.  And files all automated and, and it just--I was impressed with, with the technological advances that had taken place since I left.  They're getting into DNA now.  They're trying to set up some method of, of preserving the DNA impressions as opposed to--I'd say fingerprint identification in about ten, fifteen more years before DNA take its place.  It's more accurate and it certainly--you don't have to buy a building to keep your records or anything like that to keep records.  So I think DNA is a precursor of taking the place of, of fingerprints.
Speaker 1: Okay. So is there anything about your tenure as superintendent or as a police officer that you'd like to say that we haven't asked you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I imagine how much my pension is.  No, you've been very thorough.  I'm trying to think what you haven't asked me.  But, but I'll tell you something, I'll volunteer some information.  I was the one that computerized the fingerprints.  I was the one that went down to city hall and, and found out that they could, found that they can save money by computerizing fingerprints because they were getting sued for holding people too long prior to fingerprints comings, results of finger, fingerprints coming back.  So as a result they gave me six million dollars and I bought that computerized fingerprint system.  Also computers in the cars I started the beginning that, (unclear) that.  They're just finishing up here in recent years because it was expensive improvement.  But that certainly helped expedite the identification of cars and people and writing reports and all like that.  It was a boon and blessing.  I had that on my mind when I left that system then where you can determine where your squad car is at any given time and moment.  They got that satellite.  They still haven't gotten that.  I hear police departments and unions are resisting that because I don't know, that's too close of your supervision.  But you got to sell the fact that it's also a safety feature too because if a police officer is out there needing police help, they know exactly where he is and to send help.  So it's a safety feature too.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting issue.
Speaker 2: But some of the police department haven't bought that for the simple reason it's too much opposition.  They don't want that type of supervision.  They want to be able to stop at the grocery and do their grocery shopping or something on company's time or do other things on, on department's time you know.  That's too close supervision.  I also changed the excessive force guidelines.  Before we were adhering to the state guidelines.  All you had to do is be a forcible felon and you could use your weapon to apprehend an individual.  And my guideline was that there has to be fear of a life being taken, either your own or somebody else's before you use, or to stop a forcible felon like a rapists or some, or an armed robber or something like that.  So as a result the incidence of use of deadly force by Chicago police cut, was cut down, cut down erratically [dic, dramatically] and I hear we're still down, incidents are still down compared to the way it was before that order came into being.
Story_ID: 19420
Speaker 1: Do you think these things constitute your legacy as Chicago's [Illinois] first black superintendent(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Some, yeah some of, some of the things.  Yeah, some of the things are, but there were other things too that still in effect you know orders are still in effect that I, I put in.  So I don't worry about legacies, I worry about getting that check every, every month because in policing you're going to have your detractors and you're going to have your backers.  All depends on your perception of what occurred if you're around that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I don't know, remembered as a hard working stiff.  I don't have any ambition for worldly acclaim or anything like that, just another hard working person that's come and gone.
Speaker 1: Did your parents get a chance to see you become a successful police officer?
Speaker 2: My dad [Fred Rice Sr.] did.  My mother [Leola Moseley] died at the age of fifty-eight and my father stayed around to age eighty-one.  But he thought I was some sort of a nut to become a police officer to being with.
Speaker 1: How did he feel at the end?
Speaker 2: He didn't express any opinion.  He, he was at my promotions, sticking his check out--chest out rather.  But he, anybody become a police officer in Chicago must be crazy and sometimes I agreed with him during, during my career.  But my mother nor my father want, wanted me to take this job, especially my mother.  She, she was really worried about me taking a police job because of the inherent danger you know.
Speaker 1: Are you glad you did?
Speaker 2: Yes, because it's, it's something that I enjoyed in retrospect I, I, I enjoyed being a police officer because you're constantly involved with people.  If you don't like people it's, it's not a good job for you.  If you like people and you like the give and take of being with people, meeting new people, a police, a police job is for you because it's never a dull moment, you're always meeting different situations and meeting new people and it certainly lends itself to job satisfaction.  Sometimes you get frustrated but most of the time you'll feel fulfilled.
