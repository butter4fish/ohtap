Story_ID: 9940
Speaker 1: Please tell me a little bit about your mother, starting with her name and where she was born and her background and where she grew up.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Bennie, Leon Bennie Comer Latimer and then she remarried Lee.  And she in later years went as Bennie C. Lee.  She was born in Montgomery, Alabama.  She used to say she was born right at the foot of the capital, one block from the capital.  She grew up in Montgomery and then she went to Selma University and finished and then she got a job teaching down in the hometown where my grandmother [Delia Foster Comer], her mother was born in Midway, Alabama.  And that was a real triumph for my grandmother because she wanted her daughter to go back and teach in her hometown.  And she taught until she married.  She was late marrying.  And she had five children, the oldest child passed away, was a boy and passed away and ten she had four children after that.  And two girl--I mean three girls and a boy.  I was the youngest of the four.  I used to say that I was the youngest of seven, four children, two dogs and a cat.  So--but, and she married my father who was a Tuskegee [Institute] graduate and had taken what was called building trades in that time.  It was like pre-architect I guess.  And he wanted to build and that's what he did.  And he built a lot of homes and schools and churches.  And then he, he was late of course marrying both--in fact someone said that those two people marrying, my father [L. S. Latimer] was much older than my mother but--she was in her thirties and he was in his forties or maybe--never knew exactly how old he was.  But he came to Montgomery and that's the way my mother and father met.  And he lived with a cousin of his who was friendly with my grandmother and my mother and that's the way he met my mother.  And then he ended up building the house that--for my grandmother and my grandfather and he--mother said he used some of the finest materials.  And when we were children she used to say this is a certain kind of mahogany that was the mantelpiece and it had French doors between the dining room and the living--and he had put a lot of things in there 'cause, be, I guess because he was sort of smitten with my mother.  And he--his father was in Georgia, owned a, a lot of land.  His grandfather was a, a county judge in, in the county and his mother was a fourteen year old slave, my, my--his, his father's mother and father.  And his, his father was left a lot of land from his, his, his father and--because they had had a relationship, a lifelong relationship and he sold it to him.  He didn't will it to him so they could not take it away from him.  And so my father continued to farm all of this--my grandfather continued to farm all this land.  And my father being the oldest with eight sisters, my grandfather thought he would come back and eventually take over.  But after he'd gone to Tuskegee and he didn't want to go back and farm anymore.  But my grandfather left him as an executor of his estate and then the Depression came along and they had to sell some of the land in order to survive.  And--.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  Did your mother ever share any stories with you about growing up and where she grew up and just different stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were a lot of stories she used to share.  She told me one time about her grandmother dying and her mother decided, had--there was some insurance and her mother decided that the money would be used for her to go to school go, away to school.  And, but she told her that she could have like two dollars, and which was a lot of money you know, said she could do anything with it that she wanted to.  And there was a blind man that used to sell apples, candied apples and so she said she was going to take this money and she--and he was blind and they called him Blind Bob.  And she was going to buy out Blind Bob and give all of her friends a candied apple because she had all this money you know.  But my grandmother had put it in the bank so that she would have a, you know a nest egg for her to send her--and she went to Selma University as a result of that.
Speaker 1: Now tell me a little bit, how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: I would describe my mother as someone who was way ahead of her time.  She was very conscious of things that other people sometimes didn't think about.  Like she did not let them put our vaccinations on our arms.  We had them on our legs because she said girls keloid and, and especially blacks keloid and she was afraid that we'd have scars.  And you grow up to wear bathing suits so she didn't want us having any scars on our arms.  And she was a strict disciplinarian.  She was different from my grandmother.  My grandmother had rules as well but my grandmother's rules were all black and white, there was no gray.  And my mother's rules did include some gray and--areas.  And she taught when we were smaller and my, and we stayed with my grandmother and she would outline everything.  She had plans for everything.  And she would as to you know, and was a very good manager, very, very good manager.  She could manage with whatever she had and she parted a, a lot of things to us about not wanting anything that you couldn't pay for, not being overly sassy to your elders and going to school and she stressed education very, very much.  And not just in the formal training but education throughout, in the home, in the school, in the church wherever because she thought that life itself was a, was, was an education, your experiences that you had in life, part of being educated.  And an education wasn't just formal training.
Story_ID: 9941
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your father starting with his name, where he was born and where he grew up?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Lonnie Sawney (ph.) Latimer.  They called him L. S. Latimer.  He was named after his father.  He grew up in Lumpkin, Georgia which was near, down near, the southern part down near the area where, where President [Jimmy] Carter came from.  In fact his, his grandmother who was a fourteen, fourteen year old slave eventually was sold off to another farm.  She was sold off to a farm where the Carters were and she married a man by the name of Carter from that farm in that area.  And he--my grandfather had as I said, he farmed all of this land so he had a lot of modern methods of farming and had been invited to come down to Tuskegee [Institute] to teach some of his methods of, of crop rotation and things of that nature and that's the way he got his children--so my father and the, I think maybe the two older girls they all went to Tuskegee.  The rest of them went to other schools.  My grandfather believed in education so they all of--in those days girls didn't necessarily go to school.  But they all went to school.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: A very proud man, very--someone that could, was hard for him to reconcile and deal with the culture of the day in the sense that the unfairness and the unjust way that people were treated.
Story_ID: 9942
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about how far back you can trace your ancestors and who were they and do you have any stories that were handed down throughout the family?
Speaker 2: On my maternal side, on my mother's [Bennie C. Lee] side, she came, they were, they grew up, there were about three families and they did very well in farming and whatever they did in, down in I don't remember the county.  And my grandfather on my mother's side was part Indian and he, and his brother had escaped from a place and their, their names were Frentraw (ph.).  And they--.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: You know, I really don't, don't remember how they, how, how it was spelled.  I'll have to ask my sister.  And his older brother took him with him when he was escaping away from I guess from one of the slave plantations.  And they went to, got to a town called Comer and they adopted the name of that town, changed the name thinking that--and so that's the way my mother got to be a Comer, C-O-M-E-R, which was her maiden name.  And they had no--and on my paternal side, on my father's [L. S. Latimer] side as I said he was born, his father was the offspring of a fourteen year old slave girl and one of the owners who--there were three brothers.  One was a doctor and one was a newspaper editor and my grandfather, my great-grandfather was the county judge.  And they lived in this big, on a big plantation and the doctor, the one that was a doctor got married and when he, when his bride came into the house and found this fourteen year old girl and baby in the house she tried to get the, the, them put out which was my great-grandfather and my, and my great-grandmother.  And she didn't but she kept on until she got the, my grandfather married and he married and had a child, a little boy.  And the boy had rheumatic fever or something and his, his growth was stunted and he went somewhere and found somebody that said that they could you know, could stimulate his growth and it turned out to be a quack.  But in, in the, in the meantime he, the young boy died so my great grandfather turned back to my grandfather and they remained, had a relationship going for the rest of their life and that's the way my grandfather got the land that he, which was quite a lot of land that he--and much, some of it was sharecropped and so he continued to do that and was able to put his children through school and all of that.
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Delia Foster Comer], I didn't know my grandfather.  He had passed before I was born.  But I knew my grandmother very well.  She was a part of my formative years until I was about seven or eight and she died.  And when we first left Pennsylvania and I came, I was the only one that hadn't started to school yet.  So my grandmother and I were at home and so we became very good friends and she would call them the children and I called them the children.  So I thought my grandmother and I were grown and then they were the children.  And, and she would give me a teaspoonful of tea in my milk and I thought we were both drinking tea.  So I would tell people that Mama and I would have tea.  We called my grandmother Mama, and my mother, Mother.  And then we had a great aunt that we called Mother Dear but it came out to be just Ma Dear rather than Mother Dear.  And so these, and then we had an aunt, my mother's sister that lived in Montgomery and then one who lived in Pennsylvania and so it was Mother, Mama, Ma Dear and Auntie and Aunt Mary.  These were the women who were sort of influential in my formative years.  My grandmother was born as she said three weeks after surrender and I always thought that that was a certain date from the time that--then I, as I grew up and started studying something about history, I found out that surrender was different in different states.  And so, but she did not have the benefit of a formal ed, formal education yet she could write and read the Bible.  And she ran successful businesses and she never went to school formally until [President Franklin D.] Roosevelt started adult schools during the Depression and in the, in the '30s [1930s].  And Mama went, and Mama went to school.  But she had, and she could pick up the Bible and read and it used to puzzle us how Mama could read the Bible and we wondered whether some of it was memorization.  But she would turn to a certain--one of her favorites was John 3:16.  And she used to sew.  She made clothes for people and she would go downtown and as they would put the, the new, the different fashions out for spring, summer, winter and fall and they would put them out early.  And my grandmother would go down and look at these and keep the, the dress or whatever it was in her mind and then she'd come back and she's make a pattern out of, out of newspaper.  And she would use the, the--that to, so she was really, really talented in designing clothes.  And then she would--when she made something off of that particular pattern she would roll it up, whatever the cloth was she would roll up that pattern and she would take a piece of that cloth and tie it.  And then she'd put it, stick them down in a, in a, sort of a chest.  And then if she wanted to make that again she would just go and get, and pick out that particular pattern.  She made hats.  She was determined that my, my mother would be diverse so she sent my mother to Chicago to take beauty--a course in, from Ann Pope Trumbull Malone.  She was the other person at the same time as Madame C. J. Walker.  And so mother was able when we were children to do our own hairs because she had been trained to do it.  And she--my grandmother also had her to take a course in millinery so she could make hats.  And so my grand--my mother was able to do a lot of things because my grandmother insisted and that came on down with my mother because she insisted that we be able to do something and, as she would say you have to always have something that you could fall back on.

Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory was a traumatic thing when I burned my hand and you can see it's a little--and my grandmother had a stove that had what they, it was a wooden stove and she--and it had what they call a stove key that you could lift the, the eyes off of the stove.  And I put that stove key on my hand, didn't know it was hot and it burned it.  And at that time my whole hand was almost covered with that.  And there was a doctor that lived next door and a, and a nurse that lived across the street and I just remember my grandmother taking me and picking me up and running out and of course the doctor was not there.  And the, and the nurse Ms. Albertine was there so she took me over to Ms. Albertine's to the nurse to--that's one of the earliest things that I can remember.
Speaker 1: What kind of memories do you have of growing up?  How was, what was daily life like in your house and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: With my grandmother, daily life was rigid.  You got up at a certain time and you, you had chores to do.  And you had to get breakfast and get ready and so there was a very rigid routine of--and then when I started to school you'd go to school and you would come home and you had to take off your school clothes.  You didn't play in your school clothes and you could play until dark and you had to be in the house by what she called, my grandmother called first dark and that was when the street lights was, they'd start coming on but they'd start coming on very slowly.  And by the time those lights were fully on you had to be in the house.  So, sometimes we'd be up the street or somewhere else and we'd see those lights starting on and we would head for, for the, for the house.  We had to go to Sunday school and we had to stay to church.  Many kids didn't have to stay to church but my grandmother had us.  And she didn't care whether you went to sleep or not but you had to stay.  And she, and her pew sometimes my head would be in her lap and then maybe one of the others would also fall asleep but you had to.  So it was--and she had lots and lots of dinner.  We lived in a fairly large house so she always had, somebody was always there.  She lived near the college so she would, before we came back to, from Pennsylvania she had boys that went to school that would board with her, room and board and as many people did.  And they would--she only took boys because she had she--girls had to cook so she didn't want them in the kitchen and she would provide breakfast and dinner for the boys.  And many of them graduated and went on and they would have a big rival football game at thanksgiving time between Tuskegee [Institute] and Alabama State [University].  That was a big thing.  So all of the alumni would come back and all of these boys who some, many of them were principals of schools and things would come back and had, and stay with my grandmother.  And many of them would just come in, let her know she was there and put their bags down and then they'd be off.  But they would come back for Thanksgiving dinner.  And I can remember my grandmother having as many as twenty six one time for Thanksgiving dinner.  So--and you went to Sunday school, you went to church.  There were certain things you couldn't do on Sunday like you couldn't play ball on Sunday, couldn't go to the movies on Sunday.  You could go for walks and you went to BYPU [Baptist Young Peoples Union] and, or BTU [Baptist Training Union] and you didn't--it was prescribed living.  And you, you, you were, knew what the rules were and you knew what the consequences were if you broke the rules.  So you know you tried to abide by them.
Story_ID: 9944
Speaker 1: Could you please give the names of your siblings and their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: As I said my oldest brother passed before we were born.  And then my oldest sister Lonnie Latimer Jennings is still living and she's in a nursing home in Cleveland, Ohio.  She has cancer.  And she also has a daughter who has MS, multiple sclerosis so they're both in the same nursing facility.  My brother was next and he was--his name was Leon Sawney Latimer and my mother named him L. S. so that he could still have the same initials as my father had but she gave him her first name which was Leon.  And he has passed.  He had a tragic accident death in 1961.  My next was a sister and she--her name was Bobbie Latimer and she was named after my maternal grandfather who was Bob Comer.  Everybody called him Bob Comer so mother was naming my sister after him.  And then I was the last child and as growing up I, I enjoyed the position I held in the family because my grandmother sort of catered to me because I was the baby and because, because I had had pneumonia and she had sort of nursed me back.  And so I asked my mother one day I said, "How come you didn't have a whole lot of more children and then still leave me to be the last one?"  She said, "I had a hard enough time."  So my daily life was very prescribed.  My grandmother was quite a helping person in the community so she always had somebody, there was always people there for dinner and some of my friends would eat with us every day.  And I remembered running into a man, I didn't know who he was but someone told him who I was, that I was Dear Comer's granddaughter.  And he said "Oh, he said I owe your grandmother quite a lot," because when his mother died he said my grandmother took in the whole family and kept them until his father remarried and so she was very helpful in the community with a lot of things.
Story_ID: 9945
Speaker 1: Tell me about your block or your community.  Do you remember the name of the street that you lived on?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In Montgomery [Alabama] we lived 636 Thurmond Street and I don't remember--I was born at home in Coraopolis [Pennsylvania] and I don't remember the name of the street.  I can see the house but I don't remember the name of the street.
Speaker 1: What was your community or what was your block like?
Speaker 2: It was a block of people that, a variety.  There was college professors.  We lived very near the college, very near the, the next block down from the president of the college [Alabama State University], Mr. Trennan (ph.).  And most of the people in the block my mother [Bennie C. Lee] as I recall was the only person in the block that, only woman in the block that worked.  It was a fairly nice, what they at that time called nice neighborhood.  My grandmother had said one time that my mother [Bennie C. Lee] brought some girls home from school and they didn't have a, a separate guest room and so she told my mother, said don't, don't--we will, we will have a guest room so you can bring as many people home.  So when they built the new house out in what they place called Bel Air which was very near the college it was different from down in what they call North Montgomery and it was a, what was considered a nice neighborhood.  There was doctor--there was a doctor in the neighborhood.  There was two postmen, there was a, a nurse that lived cross the street.  And there weren't a whole lot of children in the neighborhood and there were, I don't remember any children younger than I was 'cause I didn't see any babies.  I was not around any babies and my first job and I saw all these babies and I was really suffering (laughs).
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Grass, cut grass and those days people had lawn mowers that they had to push.  And, and so when the grass was cut you could always know that it was fresh.  Coca-Cola, my grandmother gave us each a little teaspoonful of Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola in those days were considered almost like a drug and people you know would--in fact I think it did start out as a sort of a, a medication.  It was--and, and it just tastes so good you know at first.  And, and it--when I had a real Coke, I mean you know when I grew up and had a Coke, it never tasted the same.  It never tasted like that little bit that my grandmother gave us.  Sounds, streetcar, the streetcar ran right in front of our house on the street, the street car going back and forth.  Sights, the school, Alabama State and going downtown to capital, Dexter Avenue.
Story_ID: 9946
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your elementary school.  What school did you attend and were there any teachers there who influenced you?
Speaker 2: I started out at what they call Alabama State Laboratory High School [Montgomery] which was a, Alabama State [University] was more or less a teacher's college and they had what they call a laboratory school which would give the students an opportunity for, to train to be teachers.
Speaker 1: And this was in elementary?
Speaker 2: This was in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they--one of the teachers that I still remember was Ms. Wheat.  I think maybe she was probably my second grade teacher and she was very stern.  And I think I'd been to kindergarten and maybe was in my first grade, I don't remember.  But anyway when, when I transferred, went from kindergarten to first grade and the first day we stayed only part of the day but then the next day she told us we were going to have to stay all day.  And it just seemed so long and I think we--I went to kindergarten, it was sort of like a half day or something.  But anyway I don't recall exactly but I remember crying and telling my grandmother that it was just too long.  It was too long and to stay all day.  And--but the teachers were very, very--it was sort of a controlled classrooms.  They had so many girls and so many boys in each class.  And I don't remember, since I was the youngest child and my mother [Bennie C. Lee] taught and we had to do a lot of the dirty work of helping her with her lesson plans and grade papers and all like that, I think I learned to do a lot of things before I really, I don't remember when I learned to do them.  I knew how to, I knew all of my ABCs and counting and all that when I first went to school.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was probably a pretty good student but I was, I would want to get it over with so I was, I memorized a lot so that I didn't have to go and, and--and school wasn't a big deal for me and maybe it was because my mother taught and maybe it was because--so I did what I had to do but I don't know that, maybe I wasn't challenged enough.  And so I did pretty well in school and then, and I enjoyed some of the things we did in school but I don't remember, I don't remember too much about elementary school except I got skipped one time.
Speaker 1: And during this time what kind of child were you?
Speaker 2: I was sort of a, because I had older sisters and brothers and my sister that was right over me and my brother, they were a pair.  And my mother had sent my oldest sister off to boarding school at one time after, right after my grandmother died and so, and she had been my protector from the other two.  And so I was sort of at the mercy of my sister and my, and my brother and my sister was younger than he was and he could actually beat her you know.  But she, she could outwit him.  She was the Lucy and so if she wanted to get back at him she would get him in a position where he would do something and then he would get a whipping for it.
Speaker 1: And at this time in your life during the elementary school years did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I--it was expected that we would grow up and teach because my mother was a teacher and I didn't want to teach.  And I used to think about traveling and think about, we used to, a little friend of mine and I, we used to cut out coupons out of magazines and the paper and we would send away for all of the stuff we'd get and we would get all kinds of stuff.  And I used to play office with all of this stuff 'cause I had everything that I had to--and I, I didn't know what exactly what it was but I was you know doing some things.
Story_ID: 9947
Speaker 1: What about junior high school?  Where did you attend junior high school?
Speaker 2: By the time I got the junior high school, were we in Pennsylvania?  I guess I went to Booker T. Washington because by that time the fad was to go to public school and if you went to private school you were considered sort of, what kids would call that they're a nerd, you know.  So I wanted to go where all my friends were going and I asked Mother [Bennie C. Lee] if I could transfer to Booker T. Washington and she said no.  So I--she wasn't, she was teaching and she left before we did and she got home later so I just went and took myself and, and enrolled in Booker T. Washington 'cause I didn't--it didn't cost anything so I didn't have to worry about the tuition.  So then when the fad changed and I wanted to go back and I told her that I was going to go back to Lab High and she said well I didn't tell you to leave so you get yourself back the same way you got, you left.  So--.
Speaker 1: What was her reaction when she found out you had enrolled yourself in Booker T. Washington?
Speaker 2: She, it wasn't you know a real big deal.  She didn't, she didn't, she pretty much encouraged me to do you know a lot of things you know on my own.  She didn't have a whole lot of restrictions on what you were doing as long as it was something like I decided I wanted to take typing and shorthand because my oldest sister was going to take typing and shorthand.  So they, I went to the school where she was going to go and the ladies that owned the school said I couldn't take typing and shorthand 'cause I wasn't old enough.  And it, and they had Pitman and Gregg and I think she was still teaching Pitman.  And so she said I could take typing but not shorthand so I started taking typing.  And then I bought a used typewriter and so I used to use my typewriter and do all kinds of things and I would make booklets for my mother.  My mother was the president of clubs and things.  I'd make booklets for her and I made one for her one time with--and as, as president put all the names of all the members and their addresses and the themes for the, for the club year and all.  And so when she took it to club everybody liked it so and, and she told them that I had made it and they said well could she make us one?  So I made--she came back and told me that I had to make one for everybody in the club and I got, I don't know whether I got twenty five cents or fifty cents each but whatever it was enough for me to pay--I, I got the typewriter, I went and found it myself and bought it and it was, it was, I had to pay I think twenty three dollars for the typewriter.  And so I paid so much down and then I was supposed to pay so much a month or a week or something like--the man let me have it.  So I got enough money out of that to, to pay my, to pay for my typewriter.  So, I did--but--.
Speaker 1: And at this time in your life during junior high school who were some of your friends and who was influencing you?
Speaker 2: The friends were mostly neighbors.  There was a, a girl on one side.  We called ourselves the backyard girls because their backyard was on, they were on one street.  They were on Hall Street.  We were Thurman Street and then there was another girl that was in the back of us and so our backyards and we would--there was sort of a fence between our--but Dorothy could come through so the three of us were sort of--Nan and Dorothy and I were sort of close.  They influenced me to a certain extent.  Nan's mother had passed and Dorothy's mother was sort of ill and so my mother was, would sew a lot.  She was quite a sewer and she'd make dresses and things for us.  And to encourage me 'cause I was sort of shy and didn't want to participate and plus I was younger than some of the other kids. So she, to go to, they used to have what they called little backyard parties where people would spin records and they would dance and have some little refreshments and stuff like that.  And I would get invited to a lot of things but I never would go.  And so in order to encourage me she'd say, "Well I'll make you a new dress.  I'll make you something like that."  So my--these other two, they would say well you know the question would be well what are you gonna wear?  And I would say, "Well I don't know.  I guess I'll wear the same thing I wore last night," you know.  And then of course mother was always saying "Don't wear the same thing all the time."  And so I'd go to bed and I'd wake up the next morning, mother would have made me a new dress.  And so when I would go out and we'd got ready to go and I would have on something new and they would think I had betrayed them because I said you know I was going to wear something else.  So, but clothes weren't a big deal for me.  I sort of resented clothes because my grandmother had been you know sort of made clothes and designed clothes and made all--she used to make all three girls, she'd buy some material and make all three girls a dress and then make my brother a shirt out of the same material.  But--and my mother was strictly a clothes person and my oldest sister and all.  But clothes didn't, you know I sort of resented the fact 'cause you know you always had to have something new and you always had to--so I you know would wear the same thing twice.  I liked wearing uniforms.
Speaker 1: So during high school how did you get back to the Lab School?
Speaker 2: I went, my brother had worked at a store.  He worked at a drug store delivering for a drug store and he got a lot of tips and he couldn't stand to see me cry.  So when I was crying he, and they all called me baby and, and he said, "Baby what's wrong?"  And I said, "Mother said I can't go back to Lab High." And so he said, 'How much was it?"  And I said, "I don't know."  And it wasn't that much but he said well--and he kept all his money in a sock or something, all of this change everyday he would get people, he delivered things for the drug store.  And he said well he would go and look in his sock and see you know if he had enough money and so he said, don't worry, he would get, he would you know he would get the money for me if I wanted to go.  So--.
Speaker 1: And what were your high school years like?
Speaker 2: Since I was younger than the kids in my class they were, they were okay.  But I was not, I wasn't dating or anything like that and, and I enjoyed being with the kids.  And then we had a lot of outside activities.  My mother had us involved in everything.  I was you know was, I was in girl scout and I had to take music lessons and I had to go, we had things dealing with Sunday school and church and, and you were in plays and she you know was always taking you somewhere so she exposed us to a lot of things.  And so you had a lot of outside activities, plus you had your chores to do you know.  And mine was to take care of the kitchen on Saturday.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you in high school?
Speaker 2: I guess I was okay you know.  As I said school wasn't challenging to me.  It was just sort of routine and I didn't--.
Speaker 1: Were you thinking about going to college?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah that was, you know that, that was expected.  You didn't, I mean it was it, it was expected that you would do that.  Now how was another thing but it was expected that you would go to college.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: In the '40s [1940s].
Story_ID: 9948
Speaker 1: So you left high school and what did you do next?
Speaker 2: And my mother [Bennie C. Lee] remarried and--.
Speaker 1: When did your father [L. S. Latimer] pass?
Speaker 2: Oh I don't know.  He left Coraopolis and Aliquippa and went to Youngstown to do some work because he didn't want to work in the steel mill.  So I, I don't remember the year that he passed.  My mother remarried and moved to North Carolina.  She married an old friend that she had known when she was at Selma University and he had gone to Shaw [University] to go to medical school.  And he was supposed to return to Alabama and I guess they were supposed to be, going to get married.  But later in years she, through a high school classmate of mine's mother who was his niece, she ran into her one day and she said, "You know my uncle is always through here and he's always asking me about you."  And my mother said, "Well tell Press to, to, to get in touch with me you know next time he's in town."  But anyway, my mother remarried but she didn't move to North Carolina until I got out of high school and then she went to--and, and as soon as she got in North Carolina she got sick and was very ill and had to go to the hospital.  And we had moved and everybody was going to--my brother was in Detroit and my sister was in New York.  My oldest sister was in New York as was my second sister I guess.  So they all came to help mother you know move and all.  My mother was teaching and so she continued until school was out.  And so the first year that I, we went to North Carolina I went to a small Presbyterian women's school called Barber-Scotia [College] 'cause Mother--.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: B-A-R-B-E-R, dash, S-C-O-T-I-A, think it is.  And it was in Concord, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And what was life like there?
Speaker 2: Very strict.  My brother had frightened me because he told me that they open the gates in September to let you in and then they, they lock them and then they didn't open them again until May.  But Dr. Kozak (ph.) wasn't quite that bad.  But my sister and I were, were two of the few people that didn't stay in the dormitory and so I went that one year and then at Christmas time we went to New York.  And soon as school was out we headed, headed for New York.  And so after I got to New York I, my mother was saying something about coming back to school and I said if that's going to school I'm not going anymore.  And this same friend that I had grown up with, she was in New York and we both had jobs and so she decided that she was, we could stay in New York and go to school in New York.  Go to City College [of New York] and she said that we could go for seven years and come out with a master's at night and we could keep our jobs so that was going to be the answer.  I didn't have to go back to this.  And so I was under age and my mother said when we--oh we had applied to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] and the year before and we were going to, and so mother dusted off--I had been accepted so mother dusted off that acceptance and sent it in and all and she called up my oldest sister and told her to send me home, that I was still a minor and I was still under her.  And when I got home mother had my trunk packed and two one way tickets.
Speaker 1: And what was life like at Hampton?
Speaker 2: Oh it was a growing up for me.  It was different.  Now she knew that--and, and my mother didn't send me to school. She took me.  I was the only child on the train with a mother and because she knew I was just determined as she was and she was, she was afraid that if I went--so she stayed in Norfolk a couple of weeks or so to make sure that I stayed and she picked my roommate, she picked my room.  She went to the dean of women and all and she knew that once I got there and got you know involved in it that I, I'd be okay.  So as I said she was very, very, very ahead of her time.  And so I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the, the dormitory life.  I enjoyed the, the girls and my roommate and I--that my mother had picked.  Mother went through that train and interviewed everybody on the train.  And by the time that trained backed from Newport News into Hampton she had selected--and there was a girl from Miami that was popping her fingers and knew all the tunes and all like that and I just knew, I said oh I hope I, she can be my roommate.  And so when we got off the train mother said, introduced me to Alpha (ph.) and she said, "This is gonna be your roommate."  So about four or five years ago or something I took Alpha with--she lives in Minnesota, to, down to Dominican Republic to a fancy resort and so someone was asking me say, your college roommate said, she said I had four or five and I'm not speaking to any of them.  She said how did you all get, you know get to together?  How did you all pick each other?  And so Alpha said, "We didn't.  Allie's mother picked us, put us together."  So, but I, I enjoyed, I enjoyed the school.  I enjoyed it because of the surrounding the campus, it's a beautiful campus.  It's surrounded by water on three sides and it was a new experience for me.  It was outside the community, it was outside of the house, it was outside of the very controlled community that I had been in.  And so I, and, and plus I was sort of on my own, you know.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of activities were you involved in at Hampton?
Speaker 2: The dance group, creative dancing, interpretive dancing both creative and interpretive dancing.  I was involved in the drama and, and I played Ellen Creed in whatever the thing was with Jimmy House.  Girl called me today, Jimmy House is her brother in law.  I enjoyed you know doing all kinds of things, going to the, the, going--there were two of us.  My roommate, my mother told my roommate to make sure that--she was just a little bit older than I was.  She wasn't that much older to, to, to, to think that she had--but she thought she had a mandate so there was a girl that lived upstairs, two girls Willa and Margaret and Alpha didn't like them because she said they didn't study as, like they should.  And my mother had told her make sure I you know studied and did all the things I was supposed to do.  So I used to have, every month I would have difficulty, had cramps and so Willa and Margaret were very compassionate.  Alpha wasn't as compassionate as they were.  So they would come and get me and she would just you know, she just ignored them and--but I enjoyed, I enjoyed school.  I enjoyed you know being able to spread my wings a little bit and, and so I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from Hampton?
Speaker 2: In, in the late '40s [1940s].
Story_ID: 9949
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you were going to--?
Speaker 2: Do?
Speaker 1: --do with your life?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a social worker.  I had been--at Barber-Scotia [College], there was a social worker that spoke, came and spoke one time and he influenced me about some new things that he was doing, justice and fairness and all of that.  And so I said this is what I want to do.  But I also always wanted to go to law school and, but that was later in life.  My mother [Bennie C. Lee] had a friend who lived in New York, Arthur Madison and he came to Montgomery [Alabama] and, one time and was going to try to get blacks registered to vote and they had a trial and they arrested him because he, they said he was--but anyway he, I was so impressed with what he did and, and all and we went to the trial.  And so I said well I will probably like to go to law school some time in life but later in life.  I wasn't, that wasn't going to be the immediate.  I wanted to do social work.  But my mother wanted me to teach.  In fact she said for me to take education, some education and I took secondary education not because I intended to teach, but that was because--and she said, I said, "I'm not going to ever teach."  She said "You, you, you don't have to teach but you might always have something to fall back on.  You might need to teach at some point."  So one summer when I was at, I stayed to school and I got involved with one of the professors who was involved with one of the projects that the American Friends Service Committee was sponsoring on campus and I got involved in that.  And, and then the same professor suggested and I was explaining to him that I wasn't, didn't want to teach.  And they had a placement system at Hampton [University] that they would place you and get a job for you.  And the little lady that was in charge of it, little--they still had a lot of white teachers and everybody, in fact when I first went there they had a white president, the last white president and of course the kids got rid of him.  So they--so this lady that was in charge of placement, she kept sending for me and she had me to, for me to interview with all of these principals and so when I turned everything down she finally said, "Well what's wrong?  You want more money or you want to be near home?"  And I said, "Neither."  And she said "Well, what's the problem?"  I said, "Well I don't want to teach."  And she just you know, that was almost unheard of.  I mean she almost said something like well what are you gonna do, domestic work or something like that?  Those were the only two things available to blacks.  And I said, "You don't have to worry about getting me a job, you know.  I--you can just scratch my name off 'cause I'm not going to go into anymore."
Story_ID: 9950
Speaker 1: What did you do for the three years in between graduating from Hampton [University] and deciding to go to law school?
Speaker 2: I first did a project with the American Friends Service Committee, the Quakers.  It was called Institutional Service Units where they sent young people in to do some of the things the state couldn't afford to pay for but yet they needed done.  I was sent, a part of a unit that covered New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut but I was sent with eight, with--there were eight of us in the unit sent to Clinton Farms, New Jersey which was the state reformatory for women in New Jersey.  And there were eight of us in the unit and it was volunteer work and we didn't get paid.  And I didn't tell my mother [Bennie C. Lee] and, that I wasn't getting paid because I think she might have--a little upset.  And so, but the thing that attracted me to doing that was that the same mentor more or less, professor had said that I could get, since I wanted to go to school and get a master's in social work that I could get credit for this experience, up to six hours credit towards a master's in social work.  So that just sounded fine to me.  So I went and stayed for that one year.  Well until, it was like a school year right, from September to May.  And then the woman that I was in charge of the project, American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia had other projects, Dorothy had asked me to apply for a QIVS which was another Quaker Project called Quaker International Voluntary Service and they would send young people to Europe to try and build up peace in the minds of people.  This was after World War II.  And so she asked me to apply but it was a volunteer work and you had to pay your own fare and your own way and I didn't have--and I told Dorothy that you know I didn't have.  Plus you were supposed to have at least I think two languages fluently and I told her I didn't have the money and I don't remember exactly what you had to have but I think it was as much as sixteen hundred dollars.  It was a lot of money in that day and here I wasn't working.  I couldn't tell mother cause she didn't even know I wasn't getting paid you know.  So, so I told Dorothy that I couldn't apply because I didn't have the money and she said they had some scholar, some fellowships and so to apply anyway to see if I you know got--and there was another girl that was in the unit and she was going into Philadelphia so I told her to take my application and you know talk for both of us.  And so when she came back she said they didn't accept us.  So the next time I saw Dorothy the director of our project, she said, "Allie I thought you were going to apply for QIVS." And I said, "I did.  They didn't take us."  And she said, "What you mean they didn't take you?"  She said--I said, "Well Kitty went in you know and she was supposed to talk for both of us."  She said, "I was on the committee."  Said, "Kitty came in and she never mentioned your name."  She said "You still have some time so why don't you, why don't you apply you know get it in.  And then if you get accepted then you can separately apply for the fellowship, for the money."  So I did and I was accepted and so then I also got the fellowship.  And later on this person said you know I didn't have any money, didn't have the languages or anything.  And so the unit--the, the, everybody was excited that I had been accepted and so some of the girls in my unit, you--oh and they, they gave you a whole list of things you had to have like knapsacks and sleeping bags and all kinds of things.  You had to have your name in it and all.  So they, in, in having a going away party they got together and they gave me my, you know pitched in and got a lot of the things that I needed to have.
Speaker 1: And what was your experience in Europe like?
Speaker 2: Well it was Peace Corps type.  I--the first project I, I worked in was in Grenoble, France and Grenoble was a university town.  And we went over on, on a converted military ship and, called the Marine Jumper.  And, and it, in those days it took ten days to cross the Atlantic.  And, and the, the, the city had been hit pretty hard by fighting during World War II.  And, and a lot of the people in the town had been killed, a lot of the men had been killed so women were out working and they apparently were having a problem with children, teenagers and things you know unsupervised which was new.  And so the town had asked us to come in and create a, a, a park, a recreational park for the town's children and also to teach them you know games and, and skills and recreational type activities and we did.  And when we finished--we stayed in the stadium, the girls on one side and the boys on the other and we cooked out in the open and all.  And a lot of things were still rationed in France and people were still having a hard time.  So--and then I left that project and went to another project down below Grenoble where we worked with a school for young paralytics, for paralyzed people.  And they were, the state didn't do very much for them and so it was all mostly organizations that did some--but this school was not destitute but they you know they needed funds and things.  So we were sent there to just do work like clean, clean up the place.
Speaker 1: And what was that like for you as an African American or as a black woman to be Europe working on these projects in the '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: It was, it, it, it was a time of expanding my horizon and one, the first project there was one other, there were two other Americans, one of them being the, the friend of the girl that was my roommate at Clinton Farms.  And she had told me that she was the only other person that she knew that this, this friend of hers, Susan was the only other person that she knew in Europe.  And she said "Well you know, the two of you all might write--so I'm gonna write her a letter and, and, and introduce you through this letter in case you all run into each other."  And as it turns out I did run into Susan and there was also the son of a Presbyterian minister there.  He was the other.  And they--when I--she told me her name I recognized it was the name that, that my friend, my roommate in the project and--.
Speaker 1: Were you accepted by the people there?
Speaker 2: Accepted by the, the--.
Speaker 1: The French?
Speaker 2: Yeah the--well the group wasn't just French but yeah in the, in--but not by these--especially this, this, this American boy that, whose, whose father was a Presbyterian minister who was from South Carolina or some place.  I don't remember exactly where he was from.  But he was very prejudiced.  In fact he told one of the, one of the fellows that was in the camp with us, Jacques who was, an artist, he must have told him something because Jacques had invited me and some others to--he lived in Grenoble and he had invited us to go home for, with dinner and I guess since I was one of the ones included he must have--he must have said something to Jacques about you know me, I guess inviting me to go with him to, to his house for dinner because Jacques came back--he didn't speak English very well and he had his English-French dictionary and he asked if I would go somewhere with him and he wanted to know what was wrong with me, you know?  And, because this--he must have said something to the fellow that I couldn't be included or something.  And, and Jacques didn't understand what he was trying to say.  So he thought maybe I had tails or, or had something you know really that was really wrong.  And then when he kept asking me all these questions then I, I finally figured out what it was and I said "Oh, don't pay any attention to him."
Speaker 1: So after that you decided to go to law school.
Speaker 2: Well I went in another project in Switzerland and I got sick and I went to the hospital and, and, and, and then I decided to come back.  I was going to volunteer for three years but then I decided that I needed to come home.  And, and then when I got home I decided my, my--I didn't tell my mother I had been sick because she was, would have, she would have been over there with the doctors and everything.  So I finally came back.
Story_ID: 9951
Speaker 1: What years did you attend law school?
Speaker 2: I went to, I, I took a job first when I first came back, working.  I had also taken a, a federal service entrance exam.  This professor also told me to do that.  And I had passed it and because I had had this experience at Clinton Farms [New Jersey], the Justice Department, this was under the Bureau of Prisons under the Justice Department, had sent me a letter asking me if I was interested in joining, in coming and taking a job with the Bureau of Prisons.  So I took, I had another offer in Philadelphia and one in New York so I decided to take the one with the Justice Department because I figured I could save more money and I was going to save some money to go to law school.  So I worked in the Federal Reformatory for Women in Alderson, West Virginia for about a year and then I went to, left there and went to law school.  Only I asked for leave.  I asked for a sabbatical 'cause all I knew about leave was what my, you know a sabbatical.  And so they thought I was going to continue 'cause I was doing social work down there type stuff and they thought I was going to, to school to, master's in social work so they encouraged me 'cause they were trying to get younger people into the bureau anyway.  So they encouraged me to go and so I went.  And so the first year in law school I was on leave and then I--.
Speaker 1: And what year was this?
Speaker 2: This was in the '50s [1950s].  And then I went to, then I went to law school and it was a, it was a very smart thing because it gave me employment for the summer.  And then I went back for the summer and then I resigned and went to, and then went to, went to law school.  And then I finished law school and of course there is a hiatus between finishing law school and going and, and, and taking the bar.  And my mother decided I should take the bar in North Carolina.  In Charlotte there were, she said there were no women, especially no black woman practicing then she thought.  So Mother, this was gonna be a project of hers like everything else.  So Mother applied for everything and she got every, got the application and had me to fill it out you know.  And then I ran into, the Supreme Court decision had passed and they had a, a separate law school in Durham and they were trying to justify keeping that law school so they apparently had a rule that if you plan to take the bar in North Carolina you had to register with the state board of examiners at least ninety days after you enter the law school.  Well of course when--I didn't even know I was going to stay because when you first got to law school they said look to your left and look to your right because one of you won't be here you know by the end of the year.  So that's the reason I didn't give up my job too.  But the--so they didn't, they said I, I was not eligible to take the bar.  So it went from being Mother's project to being my project and so then I appealed the decision and they also said I wasn't a citizen of North Carolina.  So I appealed the--I asked them did they have any--(unclear). And so I was working in New York at the time and they--I had a hearing in Raleigh and I think that was the--I had been subjected to things before but they weren't overt racism as I felt at this hearing.  I felt that it was the first black woman that took the bar in North Carolina had to sue the state in order to be able to take the bar.  And so they didn't ask me anything about citizenship or any of the things that I thought they would ask me about.  I came down from New York for this hearing and they asked me things about why I wasn't married and did I plan to get married and did I plan to have children?  And if I had children how would practice law if I were successful in passing the bar?  And just all kinds of--and I had, they, you had to pay the state seventy five dollars to investigate you, their SBI, and so they each had a file on me.  And one of them said that, "I notice you worked in a federal prison and I never heard of anybody that young working in a federal prison.  Are you sure you weren't an inmate?"  Now I had paid them seventy five dollars to investigate me so they--he knew the answer.  But they were intimidating kind--and I was facing a confederate--there was this huge, long table in the justice building in Raleigh, North Carolina and I just felt like there was more to it than--it was the, the, it was the gender thing as well as the race thing.  That was the first time I had connected the two things together.  I mean, I had been more conscious of the, the race thing before but this, this was sort of a combination of the two.  And so I just felt like I was you know that it was really overt some of the questions they were asking were.  So--.
Speaker 1: And what happened with your appeal?
Speaker 2: I think they, they, let's see.  I think they--oh they turned it down.  They turned it down.  So I got a master's in law because I then, by that time I had come back to Washington from New York and I enrolled in, or maybe I hadn't gone in New York yet.  I enrolled in Catholic University so that I could register in that first, you know within that first ninety days.
Speaker 1: And what year was this?
Speaker 2: This was 1954 or '55 [1955], '54 [1954] or '55 [1955] somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: And--?
Speaker 2: And they, but, and the dean of Catholic U called me up one day and he said I had the strangest letter from a board of examiners.  They were asking all these questions about you.  'Cause then I got the thing to fill out to say that I wanted to--'cause they only gave the bar once a year.  And so I enrolled and he apparently answered all the questions so that I could satisfy that ninety day requirement to, to--so anyway and then of course I continued and I ended up getting a master's, an LLM as a result of that experience there with, you know.  So I was getting out into the world and feeling all of this, what someone once said that you know it's not easy out there so you're going to have to make your way for yourself, so--
Story_ID: 9952
Speaker 1: You began a career in the federal government.  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I had already, after I finally did take the bar the man held up my license for six months.
Speaker 1: And what year did you take the bar?
Speaker 2: I took it in '55 [1955] I guess.  And, but he didn't give me, he didn't send the license until '56 [1956].  By, by that time I was in New York and--.
Speaker 1: So what did you do after you passed the bar?
Speaker 2: I eventually started looking for a job.  I practiced for a short time but I knew that, that practice, private practice alone was not for me because I didn't think--I didn't want to charge people and I did not think that people should have to pay if they, if they didn't have money to pay you know.  This was way before the legal services program.  This was just my own.  And then I went looking for a job in, in a legal department for--and at that time they had, they had almost very few women and almost no blacks in most legal departments in the government.  And I just got determined that I was going to get a job in an office of general counsel.  So I made a real project out of it.  I would go, divided the cities up and I came--I was still working on my master's of doing the dissertation.  So I would go to the Library of Congress or go somewhere and work in the, in the afternoon and then in the morning I would go around to different agencies.  And I found out if I stopped in the lobby and, and got the name of the general counsel and asked for him by name it was always a him, then I would get beyond the secretary because they figured that you know.  And I said I, I would like to get an appointment with Mr. Macomber (ph.) or whoever it was.  And so I just divided the city up and found, and looked in the phone book and found all the different government agencies and I, every day I would go to so many and, and I took my little package and I had samples of my, of writings and everything and just got determined I was going to get, and I wasn't going to give up.  And another girl that graduated in my class, she and I decided we were going to be FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agents, special agents so we went down to apply.  You had to either have a law degree or the accounting degree.  So we went down to apply and when we went in the girl asked us what we were there for and we said we want to get the application to fill out to be special agents.  Well at that time they didn't have black special agency--agents but we weren't too aware of it you know as such.  And so we asked--she called herself doing us a favor and she said, "Oh you all gonna have to wait because they don't take blacks and they don't take women as special agents."  And I found out later on if they needed a black or they needed a special agent a woman, they would contract out with a private security thing for them to hire someone to do the--so, and it was much later that they started getting women, women and, and blacks as special agents.
Story_ID: 9953
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s] you helped form a group to assist women who were working in the federal government.  Tell me the name of the group and the work that you all did.
Speaker 2: We--it was called Federally Employed Women and it came about because when the Civil Rights Act of '64 [1964] was passed it had sex as one of the prohibitive forms of discrimination but that only applied to the private sector.  It did not apply to the federal government itself.  And the only way sex got in there because some of the congressmen thought that it was a joke.  That if they put sex in as one of the--that the bill wouldn't pass.  So there were some women who used to get the Federal Women's Award and they would be invited to the White House.  It was called Federal Women's Award and it was prestigious just to be nominated.  And the group that got it in 1967, they went to the White House, they went prepared with a draft executive order for the president to amend the existing executive order to add sex as one of the prohibitive forms of discrimination against--in the federal sector that is in the federal government as, as, as well as with federal contractors.  So the--he did.  President [Lyndon B.] Johnson was the president at the time and he, and told the Civil Service Commission to implement it and so the Civil Service Commission wrote to each agency and asked them to set up a federal women's program and that they should either have a, a person or persons.  So in our agency by this time I was working at GSA [General Services Administration].  I did get a job and I, at the entry level for--and as a GS-7 [pay rate].  And then, and I stayed there long enough so that I went up through the ranks and got to the point where I was a [GS] 15 and they, that was sort of tops in that agency for women.  And so when a Civil Service Commission the--wrote and said a person, a person, they made the implementing Federal Women's Program by a committee and they, they, administrator just asked for the names of the women who were in the top grades.  So he put all of the women in [GS] 14s on this committee and then since I was 15 made me chairperson.
Speaker 1: And how do you think that organization is benefiting women today?
Speaker 2: Well it's benefited women in a variety of ways, especially in the early days.  Women were denied certain jobs like in the fire departments and police department 'cause they had height and weight restrictions.  And so we, we were able to--and the organization was started because I went to, by being chairperson of this committee which was a, a collateral sort of duty type that I had, I was not even aware of the executive order not long, not only the implementing program.  So I sought to find out who was doing what so we could sort of pattern ours after that.  And I found out many of the agencies didn't even know, and so whenever I saw a training course or anything I'd go to that course to try to find out what was going on.  And the, if it had anything to do with the implementation of the Federal Women's Program.  And so this program was not--one course I went I saw something about sex and I thought it was dealing with the Federal Women's Program and I got there and it was sort of like a high sensitivity program.  But anyway I finally asked the teacher, Helen Dudley who was a training officer for the Army if you know--I was there to find out about this Federal Women's Program.  It was sort of another thing for her.  So she asked everybody and I asked them, about the third day I asked if I could--if she'd make an announcement to see how many of these people that were there would like to get together and see who was doing something about, in all these agencies 'cause I found this big void.  And she said, "Well it's your idea you, you make the announcement," so I did.  And she gave, end, ended up being our biggest supporter and she gave us the names of other classes that had attended and we ended up deciding that the unions weren't doing anything, now had just started, they weren't doing anything and some others.  So we decided to form an organization to make sure that agencies were implementing the Federal Women's Program.  That's the way FEW came about.

Speaker 1: In 1977 you broke through the glass ceiling and became the first African American woman to become general counsel for a major federal government agency. Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well I stayed at GSA [General Services Administration] for nineteen years and then the administration changed and NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] had asked me to come over there because, because I was active in the women's movement people were always calling me and offering me jobs and asking me.  And I got a lot of my--a lot of people jobs that way 'cause I said no I'm not interested but I have somebody you know.  And so when I--NASA had called me and they had a new director of EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity] there, Dr. Harriett Jenkins from, from California and she was looking around the agency itself and they had no blacks in the general counsel's office over there.  So somebody had served my name up to her and so they came after me to go to NASA.  And so I left GSA and went to NASA.  I was, by this time I had gotten up to a [GS] 16 [pay rate]--I was a 16 at GSA and then I left.  And, and I told them I wasn't interested you know, 'cause I wasn't and they said no they would, they would you know give me a 17 to come over there, to be an assistant general counsel in charge of women.  And, and they had, they had special authority to give, they were called super grades in those days and they had special authority so they gave me a 17 to come over there and so I went.  Somebody said yeah I would go on you know.  It might be an omen.  So then I did and then after the, after, and when the administration came in, I think when [President Jimmy] Carter came in then they asked me to come back to GSA to be general counsel.
Speaker 1: And how did you feel becoming the first African American women in this position?
Speaker 2: I didn't--it was like going back home you know so it wasn't--I had been there all that time and I knew all the people and they all knew me you know.  So it wasn't a hard thing.  It wasn't like going out on a new job.  And so I went, went back and, except sometimes I would forget that I was in, you know the general counsel I was in charge and I'd say oh they got me coming up here again for something.  And then I'd say oh I, it's me.
Speaker 1: Did you feel like you had finally reached your goal?
Speaker 2: No, I, I never necessarily had a goal to, to--that wasn't, that wasn't very important.  I, my emphasis has always been on service, what I can do to help somebody else so it wasn't with reference to reaching a goal or anything.  I don't know that I've ever had a goal of just trying to get, get a, a job or a position or something like that because success is measured different for me.  It's, it's not so much externally, it's internal.

Speaker 1: You went on to stay at GSA [General Services Administration] for the next twenty years.  Tell me about some of your accomplishments during that time until you retired in 1997?
Speaker 2: No, I stayed about another eight 'cause I, I stopped--I went out of being out of the general counsel's office in 1980, '87 [1987] I think it was and I stayed to '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about some of your accomplishments during that time.
Speaker 2: I got a lot of women and blacks into the agency as well as into the office of general counsel.  I tried to help women, especially women who had no experience in Washington [D.C.], some of the women who would come in, in jobs.  I helped some of the young women who were just out of law school and out of school to help them with their application in writing up the things they had to write up and all of that.  We accomplished a lot.  We got women in jobs they never had before, worked with, through the [American] Bar Association and through the church and through a lot of things you know, mainly trying to--I feel that if you, if you're in a position where you can do something for somebody else then you have an obligation to do that.
Speaker 1: Do you think that many of the women who work in the federal government right now and who have very high ranking positions do you think that they realize the sacrifice beforehand so that they could have the jobs that they have now?  Do you think some women take that for granted?
Speaker 2: Some of them do.  They, they just can't imagine the way, just like some blacks, they can't imagine the time when blacks made different money than whites in the same job.  They can't imagine going on the train and having to go in the diner and sit behind a curtain.  To them these things must have existed thousands of years ago, not just thirty or forty or fifty years ago.  So some of the women are sensitive to that and that's one of the things that FEW [Federally Employed Women] did was, and now they have other organizations, Executive Women in Government and some other, a lot of--SES.
Speaker 1: Do you think more work still needs to be done or--?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Oh yes.  It's not over, you know.  It, it's not as overt as it used to be but there's still a lot of roads that we need to go down.  And when times get hard you'll see that there could be a backlash against women and a backlash against other minorities.
Speaker 1: And what do you think was the hardest for you in terms of being able to move up through the ranks as you should have, being a woman or being an African American?
Speaker 2: I would say mostly being a black more so than being a woman.  That was part of it too but depending on the situation.  Everybody had a mother or a sister or some, a woman in their family so they are more familiar.  Like I had a, a boss one time asked me why I hadn't made more progress when he got to be my boss.  He was an assistant general counsel.  And I, and I was stunned that he would ask me that.  And I said, "You know the answer."  And he thought I was talking about being a woman.  I was talking about race, because he said, "Oh I thought so because my"--his wife was a lawyer and he said, "Because my wife was run into the same things," and I thought that was it, the reason you know.  But we were talking about two different things.
Speaker 1: And what was it like for you being an--a black woman working in this predominantly white, male field?  What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Sometimes you were invisible.  I remember sitting in meetings and would say something and then later one somebody else would say the same thing.  And then they would--and I said, but I just said that you know.  And, but so you realize that they had, they, they weren't even listening to you.  So it was--and then the, the hidden racism, you could deal with the stuff that's on top of the table but the stuff that's under the table would sometimes be a little bit harder to deal with.  But I didn't, it didn't bother me because as I said I knew a lot of the people that I worked with and, and people liked me as a person you know.  So it wasn't--so I didn't you know I would just ignore a lot of things and let that be their problem.  I wasn't gonna let anybody define who I was and how I was going to do the job.  And so it, it didn't even bother me.  That was their problem, let them deal with it.  Don't put that on me.

Speaker 1: In 1998, you received--you were the recipient of a very prestigious award.  Would you please tell us the name of that award and what it meant to you?
Speaker 2: It was the Ollie [May] Cooper Award given by the, by the Washington [D.C.] Bar Association and it meant that--I knew Ollie Cooper.  She was the dean, she was the secretary to the dean and also the real dean as everybody would call her and she was very helpful to, especially the women in the [Howard University] Law School.  So I felt a kinship you know of receiving that.  And I thought it was something and I'd done a lot of--my mother [Bennie C. Lee] was very active in clubs and things, always doing for something.  So that was a way of life for me so you know being involved.  And, and mainly the, the main three things that I guess I worked through was the bar associations and I was general, I was a secretary for a long time.  In fact for a long time that's the only position in the bar association that women held was the secretary.  And the bar association, both the, the National Bar and the Washington Bar and the Federal Bar I was active in that.  When I first got out of the law school the American Bar would not take blacks and so the--and then I also worked in the Presbyterian Church.  I've been very active in the Presbyterian Church.  And then I also worked in other organizations like the Links [Inc.] and the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta] and so forth and things like that, mainly the Links 'cause I was very active, cause I believed in some of the things they were doing.
Speaker 1: What were some of your experiences with the Links like?
Speaker 2: In the early days it was very, very--I felt like we were doing something so I enjoyed it.  And they had a lot of people, especially Helen Edmonds who was national president when I--and some of the other women who were there.  And one being a friend of my mother's who just insisted that I come and, and work with her.  So I early on got involved in both the areas and the national organization so I was general counsel of the Links for about ten years and I was national vice president, I was membership chair, I was program chair of one of the programs and so I've you know did a lot of things in it.
Speaker 1: How did you see the organization change over the years?
Speaker 2: It, it still has service as its main orientation but I think there are a lot of women who want to use the organization rather than give to the organization they were looking at it to, as to what they can receive from it.

Speaker 1: What advice do you have for women, young women who are interested in pursing a career in the federal government?
Speaker 2: Be prepared, don't be shy about what it is you know you can do.  Apply, make sure you have all the skills and all the, and that you are prepared but to go for it.  I think the federal government offers a lot for young women today.
Speaker 1: And tell me how do you feel about the way you've lived your life and what's most important to you?
Speaker 2: I think the way I've lived my life has been one of, of trying to help other people.  And the thing that's been more, most important to me is seeing what I can do to help.
Speaker 1: And what would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I just would like for my legacy to be that she helped wherever she could.
Speaker 1: And why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: History is very important because we learn from history and it helps us to keep from making the same mistakes over and over again and especially in the black community.  We need to know our, our own history.  We need to know from whence we come.  And we, and it helps us to understand what being black in America means.
Speaker 1: Why do you like the term black opposed to African American?
Speaker 2: Because I see African American as not necessarily being limited to black people.  An African American could be a white African American from South Africa who've been there for generations and then they could come to--so I just think it's, it's a misnomer in the sense of how you talk about people.  And to me a lot of the things are not so much--and I also feel that we come from an African background basically, but I also feel that we are a conglomerate, we are the only things like the phoenix bird that grew up out of this experiment called America.  We're the only race of people and we're sort of unique in that sense.  When I first went to Africa, I've been to Africa about eight, eight or more times.  When I first went to Africa I was, you know, thought I was going to be you know, at last kindred with my people and I found that we had less in common, you know, because they were not feeling the same way sometimes about things as, as we did.  So I think that we represent every known conglomerate.  We're the only--we were completely cut off so we're the only true Americans in the sense that we were, we came up out of the ashes of this so-called experiment called America, the bad experiences as well.  The slavery you know was the thing that did it.
Story_ID: 9958
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African--for the black community?
Speaker 2: That there would come a time when people didn't have to worry about the color of their skin and I hope that we would get back to understanding the importance of some kind of formal training and education.  And that the emphasis would be put on unifying.  We've sort of lost our glue.  The church used to be the thing that kept us united in a sense, but we're losing that, so that we could get to some unity and that we would understand the complexities of a country like America and how that impacts not just blacks but on people period.  And so I'm hoping that blacks would understand that their destiny is, is in their own hands and that they have to get up and do something about it.  They can't wait for somebody to do something for them.
Speaker 1: And when you look back at your life what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: My family.  My--I was very blessed and I didn't realize that as much as I did until later life, but I was blessed to be raised in the family that I was raised in with sisters and brothers.  And, and the expectations and, and the chance of being able to get out and think on your own and, and do some of the things.  And the determination that they expected you know and the, determination and expectations.  You were expected to do something.  You were expected to give something back.
